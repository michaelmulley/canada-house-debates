<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>BANK ACT

<A NAME="LINK3">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.)</B> moved that 
Bill C-67, an act to amend the Bank Act, the Winding-up and 
Restructuring Act and other acts relating to financial 
institutions and to make consequential amendments to other acts, 
be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to rise in the House today to speak to Bill C-67 at 
second reading stage, I hope with the support of this House that 
this bill will go to committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are moving forward on second reading today to allow foreign 
banks to establish certain types of commercially focused branches 
in Canada.  Establishing this branching regime will undoubtedly 
enhance competition for banking services within the Canadian 
market.  This will help to provide a wider and better range of 
financial services for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The essence of Bill C-67 is that it will remove unnecessary 
regulatory barriers by allowing foreign branches to offer 
specified services in Canada through branches rather than 
requiring them, as at present, to set up a separate subsidiary in 
Canada with all of the regulatory implications and capital 
implications that that involves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The major benefit that we will be giving to the foreign banks 
coming to Canada is that they will be able to draw on the capital 
base of their parent.  They will be able to draw on their global 
capital in order to back up their Canadian lending operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They will be spared as well the expense of having here in Canada 
a separate board of directors and the different committees that 
are required by our regulators to ensure that they are compliant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will give to foreign banks greater flexibility in how they 
structure their Canadian operations.  We believe this to be a 
useful step to help stem what has been over the years a 
withdrawal of foreign banks from Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, there has been a reduction in the number of foreign banks 
in Canada since we allowed them to come in here in a subsidiary 
form in 1980. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cost-effectiveness of foreign banks operating in Canada is 
noticeably lower than that of the Canadian banks.  The reason 
given most often for this difference is the cost structure 
relating to the activities of foreign subsidiaries. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1010"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT2"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT2"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1010

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But it must also be acknowledged that our Canadian banks are 
truly competitive worldwide, and this may well be the real 
reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A considerable number of foreign banks have cut back on Canadian 
activities, or pulled out of Canada altogether.  Between 1990 
and 1998, the number of foreign banks with subsidiaries in 
Canada dropped from 57 to 45. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe that this is something we should ignore.  Any 
unwarranted damper on the ability of foreign banks to maintain a 
presence in Canada runs counter to our efforts as a government to 
encourage competition in the market for financial services.  We 
want and need this competition in order to ensure maximum choice 
and value for consumers of financial services in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that maintaining the status quo would likely rule out 
the prospect of more new foreign banks establishing operations in 
Canada.  Simply put, they have plenty of opportunities throughout 
the world to expand their efforts and their operations.  Their 
investment choices and decisions will be made on the basis of 
where they can get the best return on their capital. Removing 
some of these impediments will enhance the capacity of these 
foreign banks to develop higher returns because of the lighter 
regulatory burdens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also point out that not only throughout the G-7 but 
throughout the entire banking world, there are only two countries 
today, and unfortunately Canada is one of them, that do not 
permit this type of foreign bank branching in the host country. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to remedy this, in February 1997 the government 
announced its intention to allow foreign banks to open branches 
in Canada.  The following September, it published a consultation 
paper on the foreign bank access policy, followed by extensive 
consultations with all interested parties, as well as an 
examination of the regimes other countries had put in place in 
connection with foreign banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The regime set out in Bill C-67 is the outcome of these 
consultations.  The key parameters of the proposed framework are 
similar to those of our main trading partners.  The proposed 
regime will enable foreign banks to set up subsidiaries in 
Canada which would focus mainly on commercial banking activities 
and lending operations of a more general nature. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The regime would offer two options to foreign banks wishing to 
establish branches in Canada.  They could establish either a full 
service branch or a lending branch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me begin by explaining that neither type of branch would be 
permitted to take retail deposits.  That would mean they would be 
limited to deposits of $150,000 or more.  There is very good 
reason for this.  If foreign bank branches were allowed to take 
retail deposits, then we could not offer them as attractive a 
regulatory regime.  We would have to impose the full measure of 
regulations in order to protect those depositors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event, foreign banks already have the option in Canada to 
take retail deposits by setting up a fully regulated subsidiary. 
This option remains open to them.  Let us recognize right from 
the start that most foreign banks will not set up retail 
operations.  They have indicated that their interest is in 
expansion in the commercial wholesale banking market.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, these foreign banks would not be permitted to take 
retail deposits and since there would be no Canadian retail 
depositors' funds at risk they would naturally face this lighter 
regime of regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at the two types of branches that we are allowing, 
lending branches and full service branches, it is only the full 
service branches that will be permitted to take deposits of 
greater than $150,000.  The lending branches will not be 
permitted to take deposits, large or small. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, the lending branches would be restricted to borrowing 
only from other financial institutions.  As the name implies, the 
lending branches, the most lightly regulated of these branches, 
would be in the business of providing loans to Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The availability of two options for branches will make the 
regulatory framework more flexible.  Regulatory requirements may 
be adapted to the nature of the activities of foreign banks in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since lending branches will not be able to accept any deposits, 
they will be subject to fewer regulatory requirements than the 
full service branches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Foreign banks choosing to operate lending branches will not be 
able to operate either a deposit branch or a full service 
branch.  However, they will be able to operate other types of 
financial institutions that do not take deposits, such as 
insurance companies or other financial services.  Foreign banks 
choosing to operate full service branches will also be able to 
operate deposit taking branches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These options should be attractive to foreign banks already 
operating in Canada and those perhaps contemplating setting up 
here.  I have had indications from a number of foreign banks 
that, with the new Canadian system, they will consider setting 
up business here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The manoeuvring room associated with these options and the more 
flexible regulatory requirements adapted to each category of 
activity should reduce the costs to foreign banks of operating 
in Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does this mean for Canadian consumers of financial 
services?  Since the foreign bank branches would be prohibited 
from taking retail deposits they would not be competing with 
fully regulated foreign bank branches or domestic banks in the 
retail deposit market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we believe that they can make a positive contribution 
to the Canadian market in terms of lending to small and medium 
size businesses, corporations and some areas of consumer lending 
such as, for example, credit cards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe in addition that the domestic banks stand to gain 
from liberalization.  More often access to the Canadian market 
helps to promote fair and open treatment of our Canadian banks 
abroad and from 1980 when we allowed foreign banks to come into 
Canada this of course was always the main— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have to rise on a point 
of order to ask my hon. friend a question.  He just said that 
this new legislation will provide many opportunities in the 
retail banking sector, particularly for small business.  How can 
he say that with a straight face? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am afraid the hon. member for 
Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys knows that is not a point 
of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we have seen how foreign 
competition such as the Wells Fargo operations directed at small 
business have actually sparked some lending in Canada to small 
businesses which is not based on balance sheets. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1020"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen how foreign operations through electronic banking 
here in Canada have encouraged Canadian banks to get into all of 
these areas.  We have received indications from a number of these 
foreign banks that the areas they will concentrate on are 
certainly commercial; big companies of course, but also hopefully 
the smaller businesses that may not have options under existing 
regimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk about the conditions for entry.  I emphasize that 
the government will maintain control over which banks will be 
allowed to enter our market.  Let me highlight some of the 
standards they will be required to meet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A foreign bank must obtain the approval of both the Minister of 
Finance and the Superintendent of Financial Institutions.  As a 
condition of establishing a branch in Canada, the foreign bank 
must be regulated in its home country in a manner satisfactory to 
the superintendent.  Furthermore, we will be looking to see 
whether it has sufficient size, experience and financial health 
to support its branch operations in Canada because, above all 
else, we do not want to see banks in Canada going under, even if 
they are not taking retail deposits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More specifically, a foreign bank wishing to branch into Canada 
must generally have a proven track record in international 
banking, must have demonstrated a favourable financial 
performance over the last five years and must be widely held. 
These are the guidelines which are in place.  In addition, 
foreign banks wishing to set up a full service branch must have a 
minimum of $5 billion in worldwide assets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Safety and soundness in the financial sector is our top 
priority.  Let me explain how these banks would be regulated. 
First, they would be required to maintain a minimum deposit with 
an approved financial institution in Canada.  For full service 
branches the deposit would be the greater of 5% of the bank's 
liabilities or $10 million.  Since lending branches would have no 
depositors but would only be permitted to borrow from other 
financial institutions, they would be required to maintain a 
lower minimum deposit of only $100,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only way to establish a foreign bank in Canada is by 
establishing a subsidiary, not a branch, and presently the 
minimum deposit is $10 million.  The bank's parent is naturally 
incorporated in another jurisdiction and its primary supervisor 
would be the authorities in its home jurisdiction.  However, its 
business in Canada would be supervised by the superintendent. 
OSFI would be given adequate regulatory powers to carry out this 
role, including the ability to order that a branch maintain 
specific additional access with an approved Canadian financial 
institution if this were deemed necessary to protect depositors 
and creditors of the branch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of insolvency, OSFI could take control of the assets 
of the foreign bank which are in Canada.  If the proceeds from 
any liquidation that might occur were not sufficient, the 
depositors and creditors could seek recourse from the liquidator 
of the foreign bank in its home jurisdiction.  While foreign bank 
branches would be exempted from many regulations, I emphasize 
that they would be subject to all of the rules that we have in 
place for the protection of consumers, such as regulations on 
disclosing the cost of borrowing, interest and other charges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will touch briefly on four technical changes contained in the 
bill.  First, if the foreign bank is a member of the World Trade 
Organization, then it would no longer have to seek our approval 
to establish individual branches in various different locations 
in Canada.  In other words, we would remove one regulatory 
impediment to their further expansion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, there are proposals to eliminate the reciprocity 
provisions in the financial institutions statutes to reflect the 
most favoured nation principle of the WTO.  Under this principle, 
parties to the agreement must not discriminate among financial 
institutions from different countries and must grant most 
favoured nation treatment.  This means that Canadian firms can 
expect to receive the same treatment in other jurisdictions as 
those host countries offer to any other foreign institution 
coming to them.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A third amendment will be that OSFI can accept delegated 
legislation or regulatory responsibility from the provinces in 
Canada.  We are trying to harmonize a lot of the regulatory laws 
and rules governing financial institutions in Canada and this is 
a major thrust in that direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are federal rules and there are provincial rules.  This 
causes unnecessary red tape.  We will continue to try to 
eliminate this overlap and duplication, this totally unnecessary 
burden, by offering to take over the regulatory functions of 
provincial regulators so that we have one regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are working to encourage the provinces, where they do not 
want to give up regulatory control by delegating it to the 
federal government, to at least harmonize provincial laws among 
the 10 provinces and territories and with the federal government 
so that at least people can understand that there is only one 
regime they need comply with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last, an amendment to the law would provide authority to OSFI to 
make regulations restricting the disclosure of supervisory 
information by financial institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are attempting to enhance the competition in our financial 
services sector.  This is in accord with what the MacKay task 
force recommended, with what the Senate committee recommended, 
with what the House committee recommended and with what the 
committee chaired by the hon. member for Trinity—Spadina 
recommended.  We are proceeding with this and we look forward to 
this law being passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me conclude by saying something about the entire banking 
structure in Canada.  Our domestic banks are in favour of this 
legislation.  It will subject them in certain areas of business 
to even greater competition from abroad.  That is a sign of the 
confidence which they have in their own future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to put on record very clearly that I could not be prouder 
than to be the secretary of state dealing with Canada's financial 
institutions.  By all objective criteria, Canada's financial 
institutions are among the finest in the world in terms of the 
service they offer their customers and in terms of what they have 
contributed as an industry to our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our banks, for example, employ directly over 200,000 Canadians. 
That does not include the thousands upon thousands of other jobs 
which they generate, such as those found in marketing, accounting 
and in other areas.  They are the most highly taxed industry in 
Canada.  Forty per cent of the their income comes from abroad. 
They have penetrated foreign markets throughout this world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of the fact that 40% of their income comes from abroad, 
fully 85% of the global taxes they pay are paid right here in 
their home jurisdiction, Canada.  Ninety per cent of their global 
jobs are in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would defy members of this House, if they wanted to set up a 
new industrial strategy for Canada, to find an industry which is 
contributing more in terms of exports, taxes and jobs than our 
banking sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe it is in fashion to criticize our institutions.  I am not 
saying that they are perfect any more than I am perfect. 
However, this does not mean that we will renounce our obligation 
to continue to work with all groups in Canada to make sure that 
our banks provide not only world class service, but that they are 
world class players. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look objectively at what the banks have achieved in 
Canada and around the world.  Let us give them the credit that is 
their due.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to be speaking to Bill 
C-67 which amends the Bank Act to permit eligible foreign banks 
to establish branches in Canada.  The bill also amends the 
Winding-up and Restructuring Act and a number of acts relating to 
financial institutions, and makes consequential amendments to 
other acts.  In plain English, Bill C-67 would allow foreign 
banks to open branches in Canada but under strict regulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill was required as part of the commitment Canada made to 
the World Trade Organization.  We are happy to support the 
efforts of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be splitting my time with the member for Esquimalt—Juan 
de Fuca.  You will find unanimous consent for me to do so, Mr. 
Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Does the House give its unanimous 
consent so that the hon. member may split her time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we will not be seeing 
foreign banks on every street corner as we do our Canadian banks. 
The new full service foreign banks are restricted to taking 
deposits of $150,000 and up, so that will eliminate the everyday 
person who does not have that kind of deposit to make.  Basically 
that is out of reach for the vast majority of Canadians.  They 
would cater to those individuals who receive the largesse of the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New lending banks will not be permitted to accept deposits or 
borrow except from other financial institutions.  It is hoped 
that these foreign banks will serve as sources of funds for both 
small business and credit card users. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both the full service and lending branches will be allowed 
access to Canada's clearing and settlement system with the 
approval of the Bank of Canada.  An analysis of the bill would 
show that there will be more choice, but for the most part choice 
is limited to businesses and wealthy Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that few foreign banks have any interest in 
coming to Canada to set up expensive brick and mortar branches on 
the main streets of our communities.  In today's world of 
e-commerce banks want to compete electronically.  However the 
average retailing banking customer will benefit from the trickle 
down effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More banks will be fighting for business customers which means 
that more money will be available for customers.  If the banks 
lose some of their small and medium size customers they will be 
more competitive going after the average private consumer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most other countries in the world allow direct foreign banking. 
The Liberal government has been promising the same for Canada 
since February 1997.  It has taken two years to introduce the 
legislation.  We are pleased to see it is finally here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As mentioned the World Trade Organization has been the impetus 
for these measures as there is a June 1999 deadline to comply 
with the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the most ardent protectionists believe that we must 
protect Canadian banks.  They believe that Canadian businesses 
cannot compete without protection.  This attitude has been one of 
the factors in the drop in Canada's productivity over the last 20 
years.  In today's global economy it is crucial for all sectors 
of the Canadian economy to compete internationally.  That 
includes facing foreign competition at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was less than 20 years ago that foreign banks were allowed to 
have any access at all to the Canadian market.  However these 
banks have had to set up separate Canadian subsidiaries that were 
not connected to their parent banks in terms of capital, 
governance and accounting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has not been a steady growth in foreign banking activity 
in Canada. 
In 1987 there were 59 foreign banks operating in Canada.  Last 
year there were only 45.  In 1990 foreign banks had a 12% share 
of total banking sector assets.  Last year that was down to 10%. 
This means that Canadians and Canadian businesses have been 
deprived of a large pool of capital.  How will foreign banks 
react to the legislation?  Only time will tell.

</I></B></P><P align=left>While the protectionists rail against the entry of foreign 
banks, we in British Columbia have been living with the largest 
subsidiary of foreign banks for over a dozen years.  The Hongkong 
Bank of Canada was incorporated in Canada on July 1, 1981.  It 
rose to prominence in western Canada in 1986 when it acquired the 
Bank of British Columbia.  With this acquisition the Hongkong 
Bank of Canada went from being the 20th largest bank in Canada to 
the 9th largest bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1988 the Hongkong Bank of Canada bought Midland Bank Canada 
and in 1990 it acquired the Lloyds Bank Canada.  These last two 
acquisitions provided the Hongkong Bank with retail branches 
across most of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the name, the Hongkong Bank of Canada is a subsidiary of 
HSBC Holdings of London, England, the fifth largest bank in the 
world.  The Hongkong Bank of Canada is the largest bank in Canada 
and is headquartered in British Columbia.  Both the chief 
operating officer and the senior executive vice-president were 
educated at the University of British Columbia.  Thus many 
British Columbians have more attachment to this bank than they do 
to the Canadian banks headquartered in Toronto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Hongkong Bank of Canada is a good corporate citizen.  In 
British Columbia some of the events it sponsors include the 
Whistler Winterstart Festival, the Okanagan Wine Festival and the 
Yuletide Lights of Hope fundraiser for the B.C. Children's 
Hospital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More important, it has generally provided good banking services 
to its customers, both individuals and businesses, but what is 
most intriguing about the Hongkong Bank of Canada is that it has 
gone international with offices in Seattle, Washington and 
Portland, Oregon.  This is the future of banking, banks that 
transcend borders in a global economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, the official opposition supports the legislation 
even though it took the government more than two years to get it 
before the House of Commons.  We support it because in the long 
term the presence of foreign banks in Canada will benefit all 
Canadians.  Canadians should never fear foreign competition.  We 
should have enough confidence to realize that we can compete in 
today's global economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we could just get the Liberal government to dump its high 
taxation policies, Canadian business could be at the forefront of 
the global economy instead of trailing along behind.   Bill C-67 
is a good step in the right direction, but the government has a 
long way to go. 
<P><A NAME="LINK7"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure today to speak to Bill C-67.  I thank 
my colleague for allowing me to share her time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-67 was necessary to bring competition into the banking 
sector in our country.  We have had for quite a few years banking 
centralized in the hands of a very few number of large banks 
which were subject to decreasing confidence in the eyes of the 
public.  There is an increasing amount of scepticism as to what 
they are doing and whether they are servicing the Canadian public 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By introducing these smaller banks or banks from other countries 
we are introducing an element of competitiveness that will 
actually decrease the monopolies we have had in the country for a 
long time.  By doing that we will be able to hopefully decrease 
the cost to the Canadian public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day this is about trying to improve service 
and decrease costs to the Canadian public and to enable our 
economy to move in a much more aggressive and competitive 
fashion. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1040"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the new banks will be forced to receive deposits 
of more than $150,000.  This is unfortunate because the banks 
will not be accessible to the average member of the public.  That 
should have been changed in the legislation.  Any new bank that 
comes into the country should be able to compete on a level 
playing field with other banks.  All Canadians should have access 
to those new banks, not just small and medium size businesses and 
large corporations which will be able to derive benefits from 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last 20 years the number of banks in the country has 
diminished.  In the last 10 years the number has gone down by 
10%.  We do not think that is correct.  Bill C-67 will increase 
competitiveness and thereby give companies a greater choice.  As 
I mentioned the government could have and should have made a 
level playing field for the new banks so that the average 
Canadian would have access to this increased competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We applaud the regulations that there has to be the approval of 
the Minister of Finance, that there has to be an established 
customer compliance procedure, that all services have to be 
disclosed and so forth.  However, I wonder whether or not the 
checks and balances the government is putting in place are good 
enough to ensure the solvency of those banks in their home 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen banks in other parts of the world, particularly in 
Southeast Asia, collapsing because of gross mismanagement.  We do 
not want those types of banks to be allowed into this country.  I 
have not seen whether or not the appropriate checks and balances 
are there to ensure the banks coming into our country are not 
some fly by night institutions or institutions that are on shaky 
economic and fiscal ground.  This is information the government 
will have to bring to the House to ensure a clean passage of the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. parliamentary secretary has made some very cogent 
points about the banks in Canada.  There are a lot of myths 
surrounding banks, both positive and negative.  The negative myth 
is that the banks are not paying taxes, that they are somehow 
taking money from the public and that they are not employing many 
people.  The fact of the matter is that the banks provide a lot 
of taxes for governments.  Some 80% of the taxes they pay are 
paid in Canada and 90% of the people they hire on a global basis 
are here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However all Canadians have seen service charges go up.  They 
have seen the banks introduce things such a tied selling.  This 
is bullying and is an unfair practice.  If the banks want the 
confidence and the support of the Canadian public, they better do 
a far greater job than what they have been doing in terms of 
letting the Canadian public know that it is giving good service 
for its money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the downsizing which is taking place many individuals who 
frequent banks have found services to be decreased.  They are not 
happy with that.  If the banks want the increased confidence of 
the Canadian public, as the international community has in them, 
they better been seen to be acting in the best interest of the 
public.  Anything less will prevent them from having the things 
they want in the future such as bank mergers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The banks aggressively lobbied the House and the Minister of 
Finance for the government to introduce and approve legislation 
which would allow them to merge.  They did not do a good job of 
explaining to us and the public how the public would benefit from 
bank mergers.  We want them to be internationally competitive, as 
the secretary of state mentioned.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the banks must explain to the Canadian public how the 
average person is to benefit from their expansion into mega 
banks.  We want them to compete internationally but not at the 
expense of the Canadian public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-67 is rooted in globalization and free trade.  Again 
there are a lot of myths around free trade.  The last 
Conservative Party leadership race showed clearly that putting 
forth the argument that free trade is bad for Canada resonates 
well among a significant part of our population, but is it the 
truth?  We have actually benefited from free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, Canadians could have benefited more if the government 
had be able to give our Canadian companies a level playing field 
with other companies from around the world.  The high taxes we 
have, the overregulation and the culture of dependence that 
governments instituted and supported within our country are 
having a deleterious effect on Canadian companies to compete on a 
level playing field with other companies from around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Canadian companies had that level playing, the benefits to 
Canada in terms of employment and a healthier economy would have 
far exceeded what we are seeing today.  Unfortunately the 
government only did half the solution.  It opened up 
international and domestic markets to free trade but did not do 
the other side of the coin which would have enabled companies to 
be competitive in that environment. >It opened up these companies 
to competition but at the same time tied one hand behind their 
back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have often heard in the House about the need to lower taxes, 
to decrease rules and regulations, to provide financing for 
education and to do innovative things to ensure our students will 
have the skills to be competitive in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I would like to talk about the international financial 
institutions.  The government, along with representatives from 
the IMF, should look at ways to deal with short term capital 
flows which were so destabilizing to the international economy 
last year.  This will happen again.  We need some kind of check 
and balance to make sure short term capital flows across the 
world will not have the destabilizing and destructive effect to 
not only economies but to people around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some innovative things being done now.  I challenge 
the Minister of Finance and the secretary of state to bring these 
ideas to the House now so we can have and support internationally 
a comprehensive plan to limit short term capital flows.  Forty 
per cent of short term capital flows are moved in and out of 
countries within two days or less.  In 48 hours large term 
capital can flow in and out of a country that can have a massive 
negative effect not only on the economy but on the people of that 
country.  These can be long lasting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue concerns international financial institutions 
providing money to countries that are unstable and engaging in 
actions that profoundly affect international security.  There are 
over 45 countries right now that are engaged in bloody, brutal 
conflicts where individual civilians are caught in the middle and 
pay the price 80% of the time.  What fuels those conflicts and 
the purchase of those arms? It is cold, hard cash.  Most of these 
countries rely heavily on international aid and moneys from 
international financial institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By providing money through these organizations to countries that 
are purchasing arms to commit atrocities on certain groups within 
and outside their borders, we are actually providing the fuel 
that fires the wars and conflicts.

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are able to deal with these conflicts, if we can prevent 
the situation in central Africa, the situation in Sierra Leone 
where people are having their eyes gouged out and their arms 
chopped off, the situation in Angola where the diamond producers 
and purchasers are fueling a conflict that is costing hundreds of 
lives every day, if we are to continue to support the regimes in 
the Sudan that are supporting a war that has cost the lives of 
hundreds of thousands of people, then we are almost as guilty as 
the people who are pulling the trigger in those countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to deal with these situations in a pre-emptive way, if 
we are to prevent the bloody conflicts that are occurring around 
the world, we have to ask our representatives at the 
international financial institutions to prevent those moneys from 
going into the hands of those people who would purchase arms to 
fuel a fire to create international instability and conflict, 
death and destruction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last point I want to make is with respect to the United 
States.  The United States I believe will not be paying up its 
dues to the United Nations as of May 1999.  The money it owes is 
essential for the United Nations to function.  If the U.S. does 
not pay up in May 1999, the U.S. will lose its vote.  If the U.S. 
loses its vote, one can argue that it is a very unfortunate thing 
because it is a powerful country.  More important, the billions 
of dollars that the U.S. owes to the UN will probably not be 
paid.  What we will see is a potential significant collapse in 
the ability of the United Nations to engage in peacekeeping, 
peacemaking and international humanitarian operations in which it 
is engaging now that save millions of lives around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strongly advise the Minister of Foreign Affairs to work with 
the Minister of Finance and the Secretary of State for 
International Financial Institutions to bring up these issues on 
the international stage.  If we do not do that, all of us will 
pay a price not only internationally in increased demands for a 
defence budget and an international aid budget but also at home. 
When conflicts brew and take place half a world away, they come 
home to roost right here at home, because there is an egress of 
refugees, some of whom will ultimately come to our shore, and 
there will be an increased demand on our own social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not to say that we are somehow against individuals coming 
to our shores, but certainly people would like to live in their 
own homes, in their own countries and in their own culture rather 
than come to a world that is alien to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The failure to deal with this now will cost all of us millions 
if not billions of dollars and potentially the loss of human 
lives and probably Canadian lives too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I implore members and ministers on the other side to deal with 
these issues internationally and do it now. We cannot continue to 
fail as we have in the past. It is resulting in increasing 
international instability and increasing destruction to economies 
around the world, which also affects our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, we will support Bill C-67.  I will ask again 
that the minister look at the international implications of this 
bill to make sure that the small banks, the banks that are coming 
here, will have checks and balances to make sure that 
those banks are solvent back home.  They should make sure that 
without a shadow of a doubt, banks that are on unstable grounds 
do not come into this country and somehow create great 
instability within our own economic system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last, they should ensure that the banks ultimately will be able 
to provide better, cheaper service to the Canadian public, 
because at the end of the day the thing that counts the most is 
to make sure Canadians will benefit from this bill.

the European Network of Ombudsmen for Children urges governments 
to establish independent institutions to promote and protect the 
rights of children.  This network welcomes the trend toward 
creating special offices to monitor and support the full 
implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Children need a special office like a national children's 
commissioner to protect their human rights.  Children lack a 
political voice as they do not have the right to vote.  Children 
are particularly vulnerable.  They are more affected than adults 
by the conditions under which they live and by the action or 
inaction of government.  Canada's children need a national 
children's commissioner.

some weeks ago in this House we passed a motion unanimously

a call for 10 provincial moratoriums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday in Montreal we saw the inadequacy of that approach. 
Apparently the Quebec government has indicated its intention to 
consider proceeding with the bulk export of water.  If that 
happened, it would prejudice the ability of Canada as a nation to 
bring in a ban on bulk water exports because it would set a 
precedent under NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would urge the federal government to bring in the moratorium 
immediately to respect the motion.  I would urge the Quebec

doing something precipitous.

yesterday at 2.15 in the afternoon the Prime Minister told us 
that Canada's productivity is still on the rise.  But yesterday 
at 3 p.m. the industry department released a study called “The 
Productivity Gap between Canada and U.S. Firms—as of February 5, 
1999”.  That is the name of the study. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It showed that as recently as last month Canada's standard of 
living was still plunging.  According to the report, the gap 
between Canada and the U.S. “has been widening”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the government continue to deny that Canada's standard 
of living is lower than in the United States by $7,000 per person 
per year? 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, apart from the fact that the hon. member is mixing 
apples and oranges, let me simply say that what the productivity 
gap which the Department of Industry demonstrated is that in fact 
over the last 15 years there has been a decline in productivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The study began in 1985.  What we are dealing with are numbers 
throughout that period and a tale from that period.  At the same 
time, let me be very clear that as a result of the actions of 
this government and of Canadians across the country, more 
recently the numbers have begun to turn around.  That is what the 
Prime Minister has said, that is what I have said and it is what 
the Minister of Industry has said. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
that may be what the finance minister says, but it is not what 
our manufacturers and exporters are saying.  Yesterday they 
released a statement in response to the finance minister saying 
“The finance minister is simply off base when he says Canadians 
should not worry about falling living standards”.  That is from 
the Alliance of Manufacturers and Exporters.  It said that the 
current situation is not adequate to ensure continued growth in 
Canada's place in the international marketplace.  It said that 
last year Canada had gone from fifth place in the G-7 in terms of 
productivity to last place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the finance minister telling us that the Alliance of 
Manufacturers and Exporters is wrong when it says that Canada—

<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first of all, I have met with the alliance on numerous 
occasions.  In fact the productivity numbers differ substantially 
from industry to industry.  One of the problems that we have, as 
an example, is that obviously there are more productivity 
improvements in the higher value added area, the newer economy, 
than there are in a number of our older industries, those which 
produce basic commodities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why it is so important to emulate, for instance, what 
has been done in the oil and gas industry where a lot of the 
newer technologies are involved and are in fact improving 
substantially our productivity. 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
let me get this straight.  Last month the industry minister gave 
a speech in which he said “Canada's productivity is falling.  We 
are $7,000 per person behind the United States”.  Yesterday the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the finance minister likes to talk about quotes, so let me read 
for him what the industry minister said.  He said “The debt is 
simply too large”.  He also said that “taxes are 20% higher 
than they should be”.  One of the ministers is wrong and I want 
to know which one it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are embarrassed by the dropping standard of living 
which has been found by these reports.  Now we know.  It is out

<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member continues to make perceptive glances 
into the obvious.  Of course our debt is too high.  That is why 
we have been reducing it.  We have taken the debt to GDP ratio 
from 71% to where in two years it will be 62%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, we want to reduce taxes.  They were too high and that is 
why we reduced them in the last budget.  That is why we reduced 
them in this budget and that is why we will reduce them in the 
next budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, we have to improve our productivity.  There has been a long 
term declining trend.  We have now arrested it and we have to do 
everything we possibly can to make sure we have an upward trend 
in the future. 
<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the finance minister likes to brag about tax cuts, but 
the chief economic adviser for CIBC says that there are no tax 
cuts after the bracket creep and after taking a look at the real 
effects of what this government has done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The industry minister said that the debt is simply too high and 
that taxes are 20% too high as well.  Is that something which 
this finance minister is going to address to help improve the 
standard of living for Canadians which has dropped so 
dramatically under his guidance and leadership? 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I do not know where the hon. member has been for the 
last four or five years.  We have addressed it in every single 
budget.  We are one of the very few industrial countries that is 
actually paying down debt.  The income tax cuts which we brought 
in, $16.5 billion over the course of the next three years, will 
more than compensate for bracket creep, and every economist in 
the countries knows that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-66 will retroactively legalize its mortgage insurance

on applications for high ratio mortgages, will the minister tell 
the House what practices are in place to measure the conditions

demanding more up to date and better appraisals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the minister explain why this difference takes place?  Why 
are property appraisals being swept aside?  Does the minister

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>BANK ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK171">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-67, an 
act to amend the Bank Act, the Winding-up and Restructuring Act 
and other acts relating to financial institutions and to make 
consequential amendments to other acts, be read the second time 
and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK172"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Serge Cardin (Sherbrooke, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is of course 
with great pride that I accepted to participate today in this 
important debate on Bill C-67, which deals with the establishment 
of foreign bank branches in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I would like to comment briefly on the speech of the 
Secretary of State for International Financial Institutions, 
which is most indicative of the quality of Bill C-67. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said “This bill will allow us, we hope—”. We hope. If I 
introduced a bill, it would aim at achieving specific goals 
through practical means. I would not merely make a wish, hoping 
it will fulfil itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before explaining the position of the Bloc Quebecois on this 
bill, I must say that the attitude of the finance minister shows 
he is true to himself. This minister is unable to look at the 
big picture with respect to national finances. He has lost all 
credibility as our national treasurer, because of both his 
budgetary forecasts and his financial achievements. 
The Minister of Finance always tries to deal with a complex and 
general situation with a careless approach and in a piecemeal 
fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will recall how he dealt with the MacKay Report on the future 
of financial services. The minister decided to ignore the true 
issues raised in this massive report and dealt with only one 
aspect of the document, bank mergers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Acting unilaterally, and without waiting for the publication of 
the complete report of the Standing Committee on Finance, the 
minister took position on the bank merger issue and, based on 
incomplete preliminary data, decided to oppose the merger, “for 
the time being” as he said, adding that he would see later what 
could be done. This minister, who improvises on a daily basis, 
is an amateur financier who has no strict timeline for his 
political agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister continues in the same vein with Bill C-67, 
an act to amend the Bank Act, which will allow the establishment 
of foreign banks. To allow foreign banks to open branches in 
Canada without affording any protection to financial 
institutions in Quebec and Canada is to open our market without 
protecting ourselves. How re-assuring it is to be represented by 
such a government on the eve of negotiations with the World 
Trade Organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like his colleague the Minister of Agriculture, who weakened 
Canada with his recent positions, the Minister of Finance is 
about to act incoherently by opening our market against the 
interest of our institutions.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the finance minister take the time to read the MacKay 
report? Is he really aware of the impact of this review? I doubt 
it. The finance minister, like his Liberal colleagues, hastens 
to say he consulted various socio-economic stakeholders involved 
in this issue. I submit that is pure bunk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know if the finance minister consulted the 
Deputy Premier of Quebec before introducing Bill C-67. Was the 
president of the Mouvement Desjardins, Claude Béland, consulted? 
If so, how? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The analysis of Bill C-67 leads us to the conclusion that this 
piece of legislation introduced by the Minister of Finance is an 
attack on the know-how and expertise of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw your attention to clause 128, which amends the Office of 
the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Act. Let us have a 
closer look at clause 7.1, which says, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>7.1 (1) The Minister may, with the approval of the Governor in 
Council, enter into agreements with the appropriate authority of 
a province 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) with respect to the administration, application and 
enforcement of provincial legislation in respect of trust, loan 
or insurance companies incorporated or regulated by or under an 
Act of the legislature of the province; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) in order to authorize the Superintendent to exercise or 
perform the powers, duties and functions on behalf of the 
appropriate authority of the province, that the Minister may 
determine, in respect of trust, loan or insurance companies 
incorporated or regulated by or under an Act of the legislature 
of the province; and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) in order to 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(i) make applicable the Trust and Loan Companies 
Act, the Insurance Companies Act or this Act, or any provisions 
of these Acts, and the regulations made under any of these Acts, 
with the modifications that the Minister considers necessary, in 
respect of trust, loan or insurance companies that are 
incorporated or regulated by or under an Act of the legislature 
of the province, and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(ii) limit the application of provincial 
legislation in respect of trust, loan or insurance companies that 
are incorporated or regulated by an Act of the legislature of the 
province. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see once again an undisguised attempt by the Minister of 
Finance, through this legislation, to get involved in areas that 
come under Quebec's jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every day, the Bloc Quebecois condemns the numerous federal 
intrusions in areas of provincial jurisdiction, including those 
of Quebec. This is why we are opposed to the principle of the 
bill and will vote against it, unless satisfactory amendments 
are made to section 7.1, which allows the federal government to 
squarely intrude into Quebec's areas of jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This one-way provision would allow the government to appropriate 
and control Quebec's know-how. This is why the Bloc Quebecois is 
asking for the following amendments, which are essential in the 
current context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, any agreement mentioned in section 7.1 should be the 
result of government-to-government negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, section 7.1 should be amended to provide for 
reciprocity. Under such reciprocity, the appropriate authority 
of a province, and a provincial government, would enjoy the same 
privileges as those enjoyed by the superintendent and the 
federal government under section 7.1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the Inspector General of Financial Institutions 
and the Government of Quebec could subject federally chartered 
financial institutions to Quebec laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at the main amendments found in Bill C-67. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments set the general requirements that must be met by 
a foreign bank to establish a branch in Canada, the type of 
business that such a branch can conduct, and the standing 
regulatory requirements that will have to be met. The bill also 
includes a number of changes concerning the access by foreign 
banks to the financial services sector.

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the proposed system, on top of being allowed to establish 
a Canadian subsidiary, foreign banks will be able to set up 
either a full service branch or a loan branch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We bemoan the lack of overall vision on the part of the 
government regarding the future of the Canadian banking system 
and financial markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993, the finance minister, who does not know where he is 
going in this issue, has been improvising. He is putting at risk 
one of the pillars of our economy, the financial services 
sector. He should listen to what the Bloc Quebecois has been 
telling him for years now, namely first strengthen our national 
industry, then open the market, and finally liberalize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has always been of the opinion that the 
merger debate should be seen as part of a broader debate on the 
future of financial institutions. The same is true of the bill 
before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is acting irresponsibly and, by refusing to 
proceed cautiously according to the logical order suggested by 
the Bloc Quebecois, is leaving Quebec and Canada open to 
inconsistencies and discrepancies in the quality of services 
between poor and rich regions, a glaring and on-going lack of 
fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that, under the federal Insurance Companies 
Act, a federally chartered insurance company or a foreign 
company cannot sell policies in Canada to an insurance company 
set up under provincial legislation. Only a federally chartered 
insurance company, with the approval of the Minister of Finance, 
can buy these blocks of business. This situation is unfair to 
Quebec insurers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This situation shows clearly that while our financial markets 
are about to become more and more open to financial 
institutions, there are still barriers between our own 
institutions and we do not have full competitiveness within our 
own borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that the Bloc Quebecois had proposed a 
three-step approach which provides for a methodical opening up of 
financial markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a first step, the Bloc asks the federal government to change 
the ownership rules for banks and some of the accounting rules 
in order to allow and foster the grouping of medium and small 
size financial institutions into financial holdings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, a bank could join with a life insurance company, 
an investment funds company and a brokerage. 
This first step would allow the establishment in Quebec and in 
Canada of giant financial institutions which would be able to 
truly compete with megabanks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should allow a period of two to three years for 
the establishment of these holdings, which would be subject to 
the 10% rule and whose operations would remain 
compartmentalized,  as is already the case for banks. We should 
begin by taking the necessary means to encourage competition 
with new major players on a global scale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the federal government could then allow bank mergers. 
For instance, we would have on the Canadian market eight to ten 
players of similar size and strength and we would therefore have 
sound competition in our domestic financial sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sound competition is vital if we want consumers and small and 
medium size businesses throughout the country to have easy 
access to services at competitive prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the interest of fairness, the bank mergers should occur at 
the same time that the multisector holdings become operational. 
All players should be able to start at the same time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, the Bloc Quebecois would call for a greater 
democratization of banks and financial holdings along the 
proposals of the Quebec association for the protection of savers 
and investors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would also ask for a mechanism to encourage and measure the 
investments of banks and financial holdings in communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In view of the human aspect and of the socio-economic efforts of 
this reform, the Bloc Quebecois will support measures aimed at 
protecting access to financial services for the whole population 
throughout the territory.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will also be calling for a mechanism for parliamentary 
follow-up in order to measure the impact of the changes made on 
competition, service charges, employment, access to credit, 
transparency, and services to outlying and disadvantaged 
communities, so as to be able to make the appropriate 
corrections and adjustments as we go along, if need be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the federal government could open up the Canadian 
financial services market completely to international 
competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having made it possible for the small players in Quebec and 
Canada to join forces, there are less grounds for concern that 
they will disappear or pass into the hands of foreign companies 
as soon as the market is opened up to international competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind hon. members that our concern has always been, and will 
always be, to increase the competitivity of all sectors of 
financial services in Quebec and in Canada, and to increase the 
competition in all of Quebec and Canada.  More competition means 
better and better-priced services for consumers and small and 
medium-sized businesses throughout the country.  Enhancing 
competition is one of the concerns of the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also concerned with making these changes equitably.  All 
those involved in the financial sector must have an equal 
opportunity to make changes so as to enhance their domestic and 
international position, for example, by allowing financial 
holdings which bring together institutions from various sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members will agree with me that today's debate is liable to 
have a great impact on our society. 
We must always remember that public interest comes first and 
that there are people behind the figures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this sense, the Bloc Quebecois has always advocated the 
establishment of a parliamentary committee to oversee banks and 
financial institutions, which would periodically check whether 
consumers and SMBs are well served at competitive prices 
throughout Quebec and Canada, regardless of their personal 
wealth.  We have advocated the entry of new players into the 
market to increase competition and thus improve service to 
consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should mention that Quebec is at the forefront in protecting 
consumer interests.  In October 1998, Quebec announced the 
establishment of the Bureau des services financiers to protect 
the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It receives public complaints, ensures the law respecting the 
distribution of financial products and services is applied, sets 
up an insurance information and reference centre to give 
consumers access to clear and complete information, establishes 
a fund to provide compensation in the event of fraud, keeps a 
record of offices, independent companies and independent 
representatives and issues certificates to representatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To avoid overlap, the federal government should give Quebec the 
role of protecting consumers in the area of financial services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois also advocated greater democratization of the 
banks.  We share the concerns of Yves Michaud in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, I want to remind you that the Bloc Quebecois is the 
only party to have tabled a bill on community reinvestment.  We 
want the banks and other financial institutions to fulfil their 
social role and to be transparent about the means and objectives 
involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, I repeat that without appropriate amendments to 
permit government to government negotiations, we will vote 
against Bill C-67.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-67, an act to amend the Bank Act, the Winding-up and 
Restructuring Act and other acts relating to financial 
institutions and to make consequential amendments to other acts, 
is opening the door to foreign banks coming into Canada.  Let us 
make that clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard about some of the concerns raised by others, some 
of the benefits and so on.  I will venture out and do something 
that I think is unusual for a politician and attempt to predict 
the future.  I have no corner on wizardry or looking into a 
crystal ball, but it does not take much crystal ball gazing to 
figure out what is going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other day I said that sometimes when I stand in the House to 
make a speech I feel a bit like a eunuch.  I do not mean that in 
any kind of personal sense.  I mean it in a helpless sense, in 
kind of a worthless sense.  What is the point?  It is sort of the 
opposite of the Viagra issue.  Why are we doing this?  Sometimes 
I feel like I am a great big thick rubber stamp with ink all over 
one side of me, and every now and then I am asked to rubber stamp 
something that is going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a choice.  I am either a eunuch or a rubber stamp.  I 
will probably go with the rubber stamp classification.  Why do I 
feel this way?  Those in the gallery, those watching television, 
those listening in and those who will read <I>Hansard</I> or 
perhaps watch the CPAC version later today will be under the 
impression that we are debating whether or not to proceed with 
allowing foreign banks into the country.  There will be some good 
ideas, some bad ideas, concerns and so on, but there will be an 
impression that we are actually debating this issue and that the 
debate has some consequence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not.  It has no consequence at all.  Just as sure as the 
sun came up this morning, the legislation will pass 
expeditiously.  It is not because most parties will support it. 
It will pass expeditiously because the government has committed 
to the World Trade Organization to pass the legislation by end of 
June. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does all this mean?  Let us look at the details.  First we 
got a clue, not from the Canadian government, not from any 
government press release, but from the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>. 
Those of us who read the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> on November 
10, 1997, would have noticed the article “Financial services 
talks heat up”.  That article stated that Canada would submit a 
revised offer committing itself to open branch banking to other 
WTO members.  In other words, Canada made a commitment on 
November 10, 1997 to open up its doors to foreign banks.  We did 
not learn about that in Canada.  We had to read it in the <I>Wall 
Street Journal</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 12 a government press release came out stating that 
Canada welcomed WTO financial services agreement.  Services such 
as banks and insurance companies of a foreign nature would have 
access to Canada.  That was the formal announcement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just a few days later guess what other announcement was made? It 
was the announcement that the Royal Bank and the Bank of Montreal 
were to merge.  They had read the newspapers as well. They were 
aware that the Canadian government had negotiated a deal with the 
World Trade Organization to allow foreign banks to come into 
Canada.  The Royal Bank and the Bank of Montreal said they had to 
do something about it.  They had to get a little tougher and 
bigger and merge in order to confront the foreign banks being 
allowed into Canada and made that announcement.  This apparently 
shocked the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Knowing the discussions that take place around these issues, I 
suspect the banks were aware of the discussions in the World 
Trade Organization regarding financial institutions.  I am sure 
the Department of Finance would have been in touch with the major 
banks of Canada to alert them to this fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the Minister of Finance expect, that the Canadian banks 
would just sit there and say that any foreign bank could come 
into the country and be able to operate?  They had to take some 
steps to protect themselves, and merging was one of the options. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will make a prediction today.  Soon, because of the foreign 
banks that will be coming into Canada, in particular at the 
commercial level, and because of the increased competition from 
these great big foreign banks we will have to revisit the idea of 
bank mergers. 
In order to compete the Canadian banking industry will have to 
take on the international banking giants.  They are too small to 
do it on their own so they will have to merge in some form.  Will 
the Minister of Finance be open to some aspect of merging?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now understand the changing world conditions and the changing 
conditions of international banking.  We have huge American, 
European and Japanese banks now operating in Canada at the 
commercial level.  We have to protect our Canadian banks and 
allow them to grow.  Then the debate will be over and mergers 
will be announced in due course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is my prediction.  I hope I am wrong in my prediction but 
that is the way I suggest things are likely to evolve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the legislation do?  I listened to my friend, the 
secretary of state for financial services.  He is a man of great 
integrity.  He is a man whose words I listen to carefully and 
whom I often support.  I am encouraged by his openness.   We will 
notice in today's issue of <I>Hansard</I> that on the issue of 
whether foreign banks coming into Canada will help the small 
business community he said hopefully.  That was his word.  He was 
hopeful the foreign banks would be providing services to Canadian 
small business that are in search of capital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I give the minister credit because he certainly did not say that 
this would be good news for small business.  He said that he was 
hopeful.  I give him credit for being hopeful at least.  Surely 
we ought to do something more than simply being hopeful that 
small business will have better access to capital.  I will set 
that aside for now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anybody who believes for a moment that Bill C-67 will result in 
foreign banks coming in and providing much needed competition for 
the citizens of Canada is dreaming in Technicolor.  That will not 
happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear.  They are here.  They are interested in commercial 
banking.  Their primary interest is not in retail banking.  They 
tried that.  We had all kinds of foreign banks coming to Canada 
in an effort to provide retail competition.  Most of them have 
left or have identified a small niche market which they are in at 
the moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By and large, expansion in the retail banking sector by a 
foreign bank will simply not happen.  The big Canadian banks have 
that market pretty well sewed up.  There will be a creaming off 
of the system.  We will have increased numbers of foreign banks 
competing with our national banks to get the best business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing about big business is that it does not now rely on 
Canada's banks.  Big business has access to capital on a global 
scale.  It can access capital in Europe.  It can access capital 
in the United States.  It can access capital in Asia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not necessarily a problem.  Basically we will have some 
big banking giants competing with our banking giants for the very 
lucrative top end commercial market.  That is fair enough.  That 
is what will happen.  That is what the banks say they are 
interested in.  They are not interested in providing more 
competition at the retail level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, they are not interested in providing competition 
that will benefit the people of Canada in any meaningful way. 
They will not open branches in small communities.  They will not 
open branches in rural communities.  They will not provide better 
services in small towns of Canada or in the suburbs of our 
cities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They will be on the main street.  They will be on the Bay 
Streets of Canada competing for the international global capital 
market.  That is where they will be.  Let us understand the 
average Canadian citizen will not benefit by the existence of 
foreign banks in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those people who are operating small businesses in Canada, 
for those people who are probably operating medium size 
businesses, for those people who are self-employed, running home 
based businesses or small operations, foreign banks will be of 
little if any help at all.  That is not the market foreign banks 
are looking for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the problems of accessing capital, the problems of 
establishing good operating lines of credit, and the problems of 
accessing money for small entrepreneurs, for small business 
operators and for self-employed individuals will not be assisted 
in any meaningful way by allowing large foreign banks to open 
operations in Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation says that to open an account the minimum deposit 
is $150,000.  How many people have $150,000 to deposit into a 
bank just like that?  We are talking about a certain amount of 
people, not average individuals interested in the banking 
services of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I listen to some of my friends saying this will create 
competition for Canadian banks in terms of getting them to lower 
their service charges and so on, it is just by and large dreaming 
in Technicolor.  That will not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  They will probably go up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  As my friend from Winnipeg says, they 
will probably even go up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  They will be losing money to the other 
guys. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  They will be losing money to the other 
guys and have to go elsewhere for their profits.  Service charges 
are a lucrative aspect and something they could easily introduce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us acknowledge very clearly the debate we are having today. 
The legislation will go to committee, come back here for debate 
and off to the Senate.  That is essentially meaningless because 
it is a done deal.  The government commitment at the World Trade 
Organization back in December 1997 was that it would do this. 
Therefore parliament is irrelevant.  Parliamentarians are 
irrelevant.  The finance committee is irrelevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider what we are doing today.  We are talking about a 
major change to Canada's banking.  We have just gone through a 
long process of looking into the future of Canada's financial 
services sector.  A huge report was recently tabled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government says it will come out with a white paper to talk 
about the future of the financial service sector in Canada over 
maybe the next decade or two or three.  Why are we taking this 
decision today on introducing foreign banking?  This seems to be 
the cart before the horse.  The horse is not out of the barn and 
the cart is already running down the road.  There is something 
wrong with this process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  You know what the cart is full of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>   My friend says that we know what the 
cart is full of.  Yes, we probably do know what it is full of. 
That is why I say I feel like a rubber stamp today.  I know that 
by and large the debate is absolutely meaningless in terms of 
having any influence on the future outcome of the legislation. It 
is incredibly frustrating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another aspect to the legislation.  I listened 
carefully to the explanation of the secretary of state on how 
this would be helpful to the average citizen.  I made some notes 
as well.  I probably used my own wording.  I do not think he said 
it was some version of the trickle down approach, but that was my 
interpretation of what he was talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we could provide large foreign banks with an opportunity to 
come into Canada and compete with our banks at the upper end 
level of huge corporate business, he said that the benefits would 
eventually trickle down to the normal folks of the country.  In 
other words, give a break to the large international banking 
community, the large international banks, be patient and 
eventually the benefits will trickle down to the average citizen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  There are no breaks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  I hear what my friend says.  We are just 
changing Canadian legislation to allow greater access for large 
foreign banks to come into the country.  That is a pretty major 
change in how banking is conducted here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The secretary of state for financial services said that he had 
faith in the trickle down approach.  He said if we waited long 
enough eventually the good things would trickle down on us. If 
average Canadians were asked if they wanted to be trickled on, 
they would say no.  Being trickled on is not something they find 
attractive.  They probably feel they have been trickled on for a 
long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  They are probably trickled off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  They are probably trickled off at this 
point.  Getting trickled on, which is what the legislation is all 
about, is not the kind of thing we want to see in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would maybe welcome a change in legislation if in fact it 
meant that there would actually be real competition so the 
average citizen would benefit by lower service charges, by a 
greater range of services and by easier access to financial 
services.  The legislation will do the opposite.  It will put 
pressure on the existing banking system to cut back to enable it 
to compete at the high end level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does cutback mean?  It means a whole bunch of people will 
lose their jobs.  A whole bunch of people will lose access to 
branches in their various communities. Branches will be closed. 
The banks have already acknowledged this.  The Royal Bank the 
other day suggested that it would have to cut back at last $400 
million in the next little while. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cutting back $400 million means a whole lot of people who have 
jobs today will not have them.  A whole lot of people will be 
inconvenienced so that the Royal Bank of Canada can compete at 
the upper end of the commercial lending market.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What is our job here?  Is it not our job as elected representatives 
to protect the interests of ordinary people?  We do not have to 
protect the interests of banks.  Goodness, they have small armies 
of lawyers, financial experts and lobbyists and unlimited amounts 
of money. They do not need our protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The average Canadian expects us to represent their interests. 
That is why the folly of this debate today and this discussion is 
to give the illusion to people sitting in the gallery that 
somehow this is an important debate when the deal was cut two 
years ago when the Minister of Finance said “I promise that we 
will pass legislation permitting foreign banks in Canada before 
June 1999”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are we doing here?  We all are like a bunch of rubber 
stamps.  Stamp, stamp, stamp, that is all we end up doing now. As 
long as we understand we are just rubber stamps, then that is 
fair enough, but let us not pretend to anybody listening to this 
debate that this is meaningful in any way.  The Minister of 
Finance has decided on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us understand what this reveals.  Who runs this country? Who 
runs this government?  Is it the members of parliament elected by 
their constituents who make decisions?  The answer is clearly no. 
Is it the cabinet that sits there in secret and makes decisions? 
The answer is absolutely no.  One person sitting over there makes 
all the decisions, the Minister of Finance.  He made the decision 
on whether we should have foreign banking.  Was it discussed 
among the Liberal caucus members?  No, it was not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Read our report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  The report came after this was signed. 
My Liberal friend reveals the problem. The Liberals did not start 
the report until after this was signed, sealed and delivered. He 
reveals the fact that he actually thinks he is not a eunuch.  He 
actually thinks he has some energy, that he has some role to 
play.  He does not.  He is just a nice piece of backdrop that 
every now and again is asked to bleat, what we call voting, and 
that is his job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us understand that when we debate legislation like Bill C-67 
we are acknowledging one more time in a long list of 
acknowledgements that one person runs this country and runs this 
government, the Minister of Finance.  He decides now on education 
policy.  He decides on health care policy.  He decides on 
environmental policy.  He decides everything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, should we have foreign banks?  My friend says there 
was a committee roaming the country looking into this. I am on 
the finance committee.  We actually study this. It was all after 
the fact, after the Minister of Finance had committed to the 
world that this is what the Government of Canada would do on a 
particular day, and that is what we are doing. That is why this 
is really a frustrating place sometimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I like the Minister of Finance.  He is a smart guy.  He is not 
an expert on health care, education and so on.  Maybe foreign 
banking is getting close.  That is not the way we are supposed to 
work in this place.  Members of parliament are supposed to have 
some role in deciding on the appropriateness of certain 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I lament the fact, I regret the fact that we are living in a 
dictatorship.  It is a kind of elected dictatorship, because we 
do elect the dictator every four or five years, but basically 
once that is done, that is it.  We are all a bunch of rubber 
stamps.  We sit here and stamp ourselves and that is it, and the 
Minister of Finance decides what will go on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an elected dictatorship in the hands of the Minister of 
Finance who now decides all types of economic and social policy 
and all types of foreign policy.  Look at our defence budget. Who 
decides on the nature of Canada's armed forces?  Is it the 
minister of defence?  No, it is the Minister of Finance because 
he decides on the financial ability of our armed forces to 
develop the infrastructure they require. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is frustrating.  I am frustrated.  I know other members of 
parliament are frustrated.  They are shaking their heads.  Even 
some Liberals are shaking their heads one way or the other. I 
know the people of Canada are frustrated because they know that 
the government ignores them.  They say they feel alienated. They 
feel left out of the circle.  Of course they should feel 
alienated because they are left out.  They are not considered. 
Their views are not considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not support the trickle down theory of economics.  We do 
not like the idea of foreign banks coming into the country and 
not providing any useful services to the average Canadian.  We 
lament the fact that this debate is irrelevant.  What I am saying 
is that we will not be voting in favour of the legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to ask the hon. member a question.  I could 
have asked him off the record but then the people of Canada would 
not have benefited from his answer.  The member was speaking 
about the way this legislation has its origin in the WTO and in 
the international financial services agreement which was signed 
by this government a day before the Royal Bank and the Bank of 
Montreal announced their intention to merge or issue their 
wedding bands or however one wants to describe this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was no coincidence.  What struck me at the time was the 
false outrage of the Minister of Finance who claimed to be 
totally shocked and surprised that the banks might be considering 
this when in fact the day before the government had signed an 
agreement which in some ways precipitated the banks' considering 
the advisability of merging, something we are against but which 
nevertheless we recognize was effected by the signing of this 
financial services agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member care to comment more on that sequence which is 
something I do not think the Canadian public was fully aware of 
then or is fully aware if now?  There is the way the government 
prejudiced the outcome of the entire organization of our banking 
industry by signing this agreement with no debate in the House of 
Commons beforehand, and still no debate until today.  Now it 
expects us to pass something as significant as this after about 
two hours of debate.  Clearly this is not something we are 
prepared to co-operate in.  We feel this kind of thing should 
receive more debate and I am sure the member would want to help 
that happen by commenting on what I have just said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, once again the member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona has asked the kind of intelligent, thoughtful 
and probing questions we do not hear enough of in the House. My 
friend asked me to give a short history lesson. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who read the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> would have noticed 
on November 10, 1997 a small article stating that Canada would be 
submitting a revised offer on that day committing itself to open 
branched banking to other WTO members. We were perplexed by this 
because we had not heard about the government negotiating WTO's 
openness for foreign banking.  There had been discussions of 
foreign banking but we thought it would wait until the finance 
committee report was submitted to the House and until other 
reports underway had been completed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were perplexed so we made some inquiries in the House. We 
found out that the government had been negotiating changes to the 
financial services act for some time, that it had been 
negotiating the best way to open up Canada to foreign banks. This 
made everybody's ears perk up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 12 we got an elaborate news release stating that 
Canada was now welcoming the WTO financial services agreement 
which would open up Canada to foreign banks and foreign insurance 
companies. There was no debate here, not even a ministerial 
statement.  Unless we had the inside track through the office of 
the Minister of Finance, there would be no way the ordinary 
citizen even knew this was taking place until it was announced. 
Was it announced in the House of Commons?  No.  That would be the 
last place.  It was announced in the national press theatre. That 
is where the announcements are.  Why would you make an 
announcement in such an irrelevant place? It feeds into this 
cynicism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my friend said, then the banks came out with their notice. 
They said if the Government of Canada has just allowed the 
floodgates to be open for foreign banks, they have to do 
something and they have been thinking about a merger so they will 
announce their intention to look at merging.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We see the sequence.  I add one more element to what I said 
earlier.  Now that the foreign banks are coming in, and the 
biggest foreign banks now have access to Canada, we will soon 
hear a case to lower the 10% ownership level for our banking 
system.  Then we will see more bank mergers announced because we 
will have no choice under the WTO.

to hear him elaborate at greater length about the elected

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is a little off the 
topic but I guess not really when we are trying to make the point 
that the Minister of Finance essentially runs the show now and he 
is run by the WTO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are saying is that we are becoming irrelevant now in 
terms of what is important.  Earlier today in question period my 
friend asked a question about catholic newspapers.  The 
parliamentary secretary indicated that one of the reasons they 
took this action was because of the World Trade Organization. Now 
catholics from coast to coast to coast who are looking forward to 
their publication on a regular basis may not see it anymore 
because of the World Trade Organization's ruling.  What does the 
World Trade Organization have to do with whether catholics get a 
decent news letter? That is what it has come to.

strongly against the bank mergers.  Lo and behold the government 
did not allow the bank mergers to go through.  Maybe the member 
over there feels eunuch like, but not the members on this side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member a question with respect to his comments.  He 
talked about the trickle down theory and about all the breaks 
that were being given to these foreign banks.  I wonder if he 
could cite any of those breaks.  What this bill is about, if the 
member had read the bill, is breaking down the barriers to entry 
and creating more affordable and accessible financial services 
for all Canadians.  Can he identify the breaks to the foreign 
banks mentioned in this bill? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thought my friend 
actually answered his own question when he said what changes are 
being made to benefit foreign banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the whole act is about.  There are 141 pages of 
ways and means to permit, encourage and enable foreign banks to 
access the Canadian capital market.  That is what this is all 
about.  In other words, it removes the barriers that presently 
exist against foreign banks. If that is not helping foreign banks 
I do not know what is.  We are saying we are now open for 
business for foreign banks to come in and cream off the top of 
the market.  That is what this is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend reminded me of something that I forgot to say in my 
speech, the Liberal task force on bank mergers.  I will ask this 
rhetorical question.  Did the Minister of Finance have the 
courtesy to ask the members of the House of Commons who represent 
all the people of Canada, not just those who support Liberals but 
people who support the Reform Party, the Bloc Quebecois, the 
Progressive Conservative and the New Democratic Party, to seek 
the views of Canadians as to whether the banks should merge?  No. 
He asked some of his backbenchers to keep him out of trouble. 
It must get awfully boring sitting there bleating all the time. 
Rather than bleat for the next few weeks they can go out, travel 
around and then he will tell them what to say in the end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I use that again as an example of the Minister of Finance and 
the government abusing this place.  They do not ask MPs to do 
something. They ask a bunch of Liberal flacks in the back row to 
do something.  That is not the way it is supposed to work.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand (Richmond—Arthabaska, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
followed this debate with a great deal of interest, including 
the comments of the hon. member for Kamloops, Thompson and 
Highland Valleys, who displayed an unprecedented degree of 
frustration with government members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys has 
been here for quite some time. He can usually live with his 
frustration. If he ever has problems, he can always go to a 
therapist, including one from the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague and friend, the hon. member for Sherbrooke, also 
expressed a great deal of concern about clause 7.1. 
I hope the decision not to support the bill will not be based on 
clause 7.1. After all, that clause includes the key word “may”. 
As members know, there are many problems concerning financial 
institutions in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens is that the financial system is changing because of 
the WTO, among other factors. But the problem is more global 
than that. It is not the first time that we go through this kind 
of major change. We experienced a similar situation 25 or 30 
years ago, when federal and provincial legislation was adjusted. 
Quebec had made legislative changes to prepare the ground for 
the major shakeup that had taken place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These changes had a very negative impact on certain lending 
institutions in Quebec but, in the end, consumers were the 
winners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is clear is that today's bill is the result of WTO 
negotiations. 
This bill should have been debated in the House shortly after 
the WTO hearings. Officially we were told we had to wait for the 
report on bank mergers, but in truth, the finance minister 
wanted to wait for the decision on bank mergers to avoid giving 
the banks any legal argument regarding the fact that foreign 
banks are beating a path to our door. They are now in. It is 
made official by this bill, they are moving in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is Canada ready for this? Is Quebec ready for this? Probably 
not. The government made political hay on the issue of bank 
mergers. I can guarantee that this same government. which 
prevented bank mergers from happening in 1998, will allow them 
to go ahead in 2000 or 2001. Mark my words. It said no then, it 
will say yes later. Why? It will argue that the international 
environment has changed. 
The proof will be in the fact that Bill C-67 will have been 
passed by this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The move towards bank mergers in Canada is not over. What we and 
others fear however is that bank mergers will lead to a massive 
concentration of financial markets, insurance and car loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was also feared that bank mergers would bring about a major 
reduction in services to savers in Quebec and Canada, 
particularly in rural areas. Guess what is happening today? Bank 
mergers are not allowed to go ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of banks announced massive layoffs. Many banks, big and 
medium one, will announce branch closures. 
In Quebec, the flagship caisses populaires have announced—and 
will be discussing on the weekend—a major reorganization of local 
caisse populaire federations.  Over 300 small caisses populaires 
in remote areas are going to close.  Massive layoffs are taking 
place throughout Canada's financial sector.  And there have been 
no bank mergers yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has been made into a strictly political issue and the 
broader picture largely ignored.  Yes, foreign banks are 
entering the country and yes, foreign banks will increasingly 
take hold.  Yes, it is true that, with computer technology, an 
American credit card can be used to pay bills in the United 
States, that a car can be bought through the Internet, and an 
American loan taken out as well.  All that is true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-67 legalizes only a small part of what is now going on 
internationally.  Whether we like it or not, even though the 
major banks have not been allowed to merge, major changes are 
still taking place.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And yet, the number of branches is still dropping.  And yet, the 
job losses expected to follow bank mergers are occurring; it is 
just less obvious.  The Minister of Finance has arranged not to 
be held responsible for branch closings and job losses by saying 
no to the bank merger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These branch closings and layoffs are therefore being blamed on 
the nasty Canadian banks and Quebec's mean caisses populaires. 
It is their fault, and the ministers of finance in Ottawa and 
Quebec City are off the hook. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A wonderful opportunity has been lost to set up a financial 
safety net for the savings of Canadians. 
We missed an opportunity. At present, there are no bank mergers 
but there is no financial safety net either. In remote areas in 
Quebec and Canada, branches are closing, services are being 
reduced and fees are rising. This is what is going on. And yet, 
there have been no bank mergers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-67 will legalize something we already know is coming. 
There will be a complete reorganization. At the end of this year 
or at the beginning of the year 2000, there will be other 
applications for mergers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can be wiser, because Canadian banks know that the American 
and foreign institutions are coming. There could be a 
legislative change which would not bring official mergers of 
Canadian financial institutions. However, the legislation says 
nothing about services agreements, at present. 
We should not be surprised if the Royal Bank, the Bank of 
Montreal, the Toronto Dominion Bank, the CIBC and Scotia Bank 
sign service agreements without going as far as merging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a town with a population of 6,000, for instance Asbestos in 
Quebec, where there are several bank branches, we can be sure 
that one of these branches will close while the other remains 
open. There will be service agreements. Each branch will keep 
its sign outside, but the number of branches of each bank will 
be reduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there are no legislative changes, the government will have to 
deal with the situation and allow one or several bank mergers, 
or pass a bill at the last minute to set terms for bank mergers 
or service agreements between financial institutions, otherwise 
the market in Canada and Quebec will be taken over by foreigners 
and we will not be prepared for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, we are open to competition.  Yes, we are not afraid to have 
our institutions and businesses compete in the United States. 
Yes, we are prepared to let the Americans into our country with 
their financial services.  But can we be prepared with a 
financial safety net, which will guarantee that the people of 
Quebec and of the rest of the county will be protected? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reduced service charges, more customer services, continued 
services to rural areas, these are some of the demands that were 
made when the whole issue of bank mergers was being discussed. 
Unfortunately, the issue got rather clouded and today Bill C-67 
reflects only part of the discussions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-67, which was to be voted on in the House, was held up in 
order not to give the financial institutions that wanted to 
merge the legislative argument that “Yes, it is true, the 
foreign banks are on the way here”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If one goes out and asks people in the street, they will say “We 
are fine now.  Those big bad banks did not merge, so we will be 
protected. I'll still have my local branch.  I'll still have my 
teller; service charges won't go up too much; I won't have to 
deal with that darned banking machine too often”.  That is what 
they think, but that is not what is going to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is an agreement, what we need in this country is not 
subsidiaries, but actual branches.  There is a $150,000 
investment, and some people see this as positive, as an element 
of protection.  The only ones that will benefit from competitive 
service will be the people who are better off. 
That is a pity, because it was one of the arguments used by the 
Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also said that the $150,000 figure was negative, since it 
deprived all Canadians financial consumers, all Canadians 
wishing to save money, of any entitlement to more competition.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, we do not have the overall picture. The MacKay 
report was good, because it did provide the overall picture. But 
who has read the report among those who use their bank cards 
daily or go to the bank every Thursday to deposit their pay 
cheques? No one. The only thing that is remembered from the 
MacKay report is that it was against bank mergers. But it did 
not end there. It was much more than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a wake-up call about what we can expect from the banking 
industry at the international level, but the issue was not 
addressed in the House. We will miss the boat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned the MacKay report. 
Bill C-67 only provides that foreign banks have to open 
branches, instead of subsidiaries. There is no one on the face 
of this earth who can make any sense out of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What it means is that, first of all, the financial environment 
will make it easier for foreign banks to set up shop in this 
country. Second, branches will close, jobs will be lost, 
services charges will go up and services will be reduced in 
rural areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new legislation will come into force and people will say “We 
have a problem. One option is to reduce the minimum $150,000 
loans.” Foreign banks will be brought down to the level of other 
banks, to the level of branches, not subsidiaries, just 
branches. Watch out for what will happen during the next two 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that point the foreign banks will do their lobbying. 
Financial institutions, including the caisses populaires in 
Quebec—do not be surprised of they make agreements; they have 
already done so, but the Mouvement Desjardins will be reaching 
agreements with others in order to meet the competition—will be 
amalgamating and entering into service agreements more and more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there will be a problem in the regions and with the SMBs. 
BDC reports will prove there are financing problems for SMBs. 
The government will be running around trying to put out as many 
fires as possible.  They will not be prepared for the 
inevitable, that is, international competition within a country. 
That is today's reality—international competition within a 
country.  That is today's financial reality, and we have to live 
with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Credit is even harder for people to obtain, and yet banks will 
not be amalgamating. 
There is nothing.  People earning a lower or middle income have 
a lot harder time borrowing today than five or ten years ago. 
And yet the interest rates are low. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at consumer protection groups.  Look at what is happening 
in Quebec with the difficulty in borrowing.  The guarantees they 
want are incredible.  In the past, they wanted your shirt; now 
they want your pants, your underwear, your socks and those of 
your parents and your uncles.  That is what they want when you 
borrow these days.  Why?  Because the banks and the caisses 
populaires in Quebec cleaned out their financial portfolios. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Financial institutions have financial ratings for borrowers like 
you and me.  Mr. Speaker, I know yours is excellent.  A bank 
may, for example, have a rating between 1 and 9. 
One is the best rating and it is yours, Mr. Speaker. A Reformer 
would probably get a rating of nine. Why? Because that party is 
almost at the end of its political life. We do not know what 
rating the Conservatives would get. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> And what about the Bloc? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand:</B> The Bloc? That would be 5.5. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened is that financial institutions did a cleanup. One 
of them, which I will not name, decided that it would get rid of 
all its customers' accounts with a rating of 6, 7, 8, 9 and even 
5. This means that if you are a customer and have a hard time 
making ends meet, when the time comes to renew your personal 
loan or whatever, the bank informs you that it will not renew 
your loan. It cleans up its financial portfolio.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of sudden, the customer is faced with the bank's refusal to 
renew the financing. Think about the person who goes looking for 
alternative financing. In the old days, Household Finance, not 
to mention it, was there just in case. Even that institution has 
tightened up its lending conditions, now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation regarding our country's financial institutions was 
not planned properly. Many changes occur and people are very 
concerned. If we look at what is going on in Quebec, or in the 
rest of the country, we can see that people are worried about 
what will happen to services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see my Bloc Quebecois colleague nodding.  People in Quebec are 
very concerned about what is going on.  My colleague, the member 
for Sherbrooke, explained it very well.  Right before an 
election, the Government of Quebec introduced a legislative 
amendment allowing people to be more closely involved, by filing 
complaints about financial institutions in Quebec, including the 
caisses populaires. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What power does this body have?  To receive complaints, the way 
the ombudsman does?  It has no legislative authority, just 
political. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-67 represents an obligation, with international agreements 
that must be observed.  I cannot examine the bill from a fiscal 
point of view today.  I am sure members would be able to follow 
me, but I do not really know myself what I would say.  It is a 
very complex issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My criticism is that this bill should have been discussed 
rapidly after the agreement between all the WTO countries with a 
view to standardizing the international financial system.  That 
is when it should have been done.  This was a political issue. 
I use the word political, rather than economic or financial, 
advisedly.  The political issue was bank mergers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apples and oranges were compared, oil was thrown on the fire, 
and things were confused generally with respect to the banking 
issues.  It is most unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In future, I hope that the necessary time will be taken to 
ensure that there is a financial safety net for Quebeckers and 
all Canadians.  They will need one. 
<P><A NAME="LINK178"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, some 
aspects of our colleague's speech were most interesting, even 
though he got carried away at times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding his assessment of the Reform Party's political future, 
I think we would have a consensus. Regarding the Bloc Quebecois, 
I think the mark would be close to 9. And regarding the 
Conservative Party, I understand everything is possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I want to ask my colleague a question. I 
believe there is one concern he shares with many members of the 
House, namely access to financial services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I represent the riding of Hochelaga—Maisonneuve. In 20 years, the 
number of bank branches in my riding went from 20 to four. 
Access to financial services has become a problem for the most 
disadvantaged among us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger:</B> Then why did you support bank mergers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> I do not know whether the member for 
Ottawa—Vanier is speaking up to encourage me to go on, but the 
fact is— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger:</B> Why did you support bank mergers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member for Ottawa—Vanier is a 
little confused, but I will straighten things out for him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois was almost unanimous in saying that it would 
accept bank mergers as long as there would be guarantees with 
regard to access to capital, the Community Reinvestment Act and, 
most importantly, the ability of people to be served at any 
branch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, the question I want to put to my colleague from 
Richmond—Arthabaska, an interesting speaker in this Parliament, 
is the following.  Would he agree that, if we did what the 
United States has done and passed a law on community 
reinvestment, it  would be the best thing to happen to the 
economically weak? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, who agrees with me, knows what a law on community 
reinvestment can do, which is to evaluate the involvement of 
each bank in its community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger:</B> You would do better to get your act 
together.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> That is what we need, and the member for 
Ottawa—Vanier agrees with me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member for Richmond—Arthabaska if he agrees with my 
assessment. I am not asking him to comment Quebec's potential 
independence, except to say that it is inevitable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, what is inevitable is that, 
even within the Bloc Quebecois, there is no consensus on this. 
Perhaps the addition of a few Conservatives to the membership 
has confused things a bit, who knows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing we do know is that the presence of former 
Conservatives within the Bloc Quebecois sometimes gives rise to 
worthwhile logic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> That's the United alternative, an appeal to the 
United alternative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand:</B> The hon. member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve 
said that branches are being closed in his riding and, as I said 
in my speech, this is happening even though the banks were not 
allowed to merge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Branches of banks and of caisses populaires are merging, and 
people are afraid that this will happen primarily in less 
advantaged communities and neighbourhoods.  Unfortunately, rural 
areas are always less advantaged, and the major urban 
communities always have disadvantaged areas more likely to be 
without any suitable financial services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we speak of a financial safety net for investors in Quebec 
and in Canada, what we mean is that people need protection.  If 
there can be some kind of tax or refund to the taxpayer, why 
not?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I was interested in the remarks by the hon. member a few 
minutes ago about the ideological confusion that exists within 
the Bloc.  He gave credit for that confusion to the presence of 
some Conservatives within the Bloc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would certainly remind him that the Bloc was founded by 
Conservatives.  The influence of Conservatives in the Bloc has 
been persistent throughout, particularly when it comes to 
questions having to do with globalization, the WTO and the whole 
question of free trade and the liberalization of trade and 
investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see now at least one new member of the Bloc who is questioning 
the whole globalization phenomenon.  Hopefully, he will have some 
influence on his colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I did not rise to question the Bloc because the Bloc 
was not speaking so I will try not to get diverted.  I will ask a 
question of the member who was actually speaking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of things have happened over the last little while. One 
in particular is our debate on this agreement which is much after 
the fact.  This is legislation to implement an agreement that the 
Government of Canada signed over a year ago without parliamentary 
debate or consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member's party has been an uncritical advocate of the World 
Trade Organization and the global phenomena it represents whereby 
more and more decisions that used to be taken by national 
governments are now taken in the course of bureaucratic 
negotiation at the WTO.  Does this not give the member some pause 
for reflection, some second thought about the wisdom of the past? 
His party set our country on this path with the beginning of the 
FTA and NAFTA, a direction albeit followed and accelerated by the 
Liberals in spite of the fact that they had said they would do 
otherwise when they were running in 1993. However, I do not want 
to get diverted again and talk about the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want the member to say whether or not he has any concerns in 
this regard. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will not talk about the 
Conservative Party either, except to tell the NDP member that 
there is a Conservative government in Alberta, in Manitoba, in 
Ontario, in Prince Edward Island and in Quebec. As members know, 
there are two former Conservatives in Quebec: one is the 
province's premier, while the other one is the leader of the 
opposition. Therefore, there is a Conservative government in 
Quebec. This is just a joke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger:</B> It is a good one! 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand:</B> As for the numerous international agreements 
that were signed, it is true that, at some point, we begin to 
wonder about what is going on. I remind the NDP member that one 
the candidates for the Conservative Party leadership, Mr. 
Orchard, raised that issue and often said “To regain our 
sovereignty”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying we should revisit the agreements that we signed 
in the past. We made the right decisions. 
However, opening markets through international agreements such 
as those does carry consequences. It impacts on those who live 
in our country. Some people benefited from these treaties, but 
let us not forget that others were adversely affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are aware of that, then we can continue to be a key player 
on the international scene, while being even more sensitive to 
the impact of any agreement or contract that is ratified.

remarks by the member for Richmond—Arthabaska, I am pleased to 
hear that he is largely in agreement with what the Bloc 
Quebecois said about the MacKay report.

to financial institutions, easier credit, and, of course, the 
obligation to reinvest in the community raised by the member for

bill, as well as the reference to your credit rating being 
number one, Mr. Speaker, am I to understand that the member for 
Richmond—Arthabaska intends to boost his credit rating by joining 
the Bloc Quebecois? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, on the topic of credit ratings, 
various polls showed the Progressive Conservative Party last in 
the polls.  I think we were even right off the scale and 
certainly out of credit at one point.  We are doing better now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No, I will not be joining another party.  It is true, however, 
that the Progressive Conservative Party often has similar 
concerns as well as ideas on the Quebec issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we hope, however, is that the hon. members of the Bloc 
Quebecois would also share certain ideas, certain interests and 
a certain plan for Canada with the Progressive Conservative 
Party in the future.

him but it is very interesting that the Conservative member 
mentioned Mr. Orchard.  He was a candidate for the leadership of 
the Conservative Party who ran against the free trade agreement. 
I thought it funny to run for leadership of a party that brought 
in the free trade agreement when one is a virulent, anti-free 
trade guy.  I now understand why he always had so many unkind 
words to say about the NDP.  He was a Tory at heart who just 
could not find a Tory party that fit his particular version of—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think that all parties in the 
House could learn from the experience of the Progressive 
Conservative Party's openness, in its leadership race. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Orchard's contribution was to look at all the repercussions 
and to always be mindful of all the treaties signed.  His 
candidacy kept us open to the world so that the world would be 
open to Canada.  At the same time, it should not be forgotten 
that Canada is more than a name. 
It is inhabited by people and we must not lose sight of this.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>YOUNG OFFENDERS ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK183">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from March 15 consideration of the motion that 
Bill C-260, an act to amend the Young Offenders Act, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK184"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to start by congratulating 
my colleague and friend from Surrey North for putting this 
private member's bill before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think back to the days when I sat on the justice committee and 
the hon. member for Surrey North and his wife appeared before 
that committee when it was dealing with Bill C-37, a bill to 
amend to the Young Offenders Act.  I remember comments that were 
made after the hon. member and a number of other individuals 
brought to the attention of members of the justice committee the 
end results of the behaviour of young offenders.  It caused me a 
bit of concern when a Liberal member of that committee said to me 
after the hearing that these people brought nothing to the debate 
other than sentiment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is very important that all Canadians, including 
Liberal members, understand that the feelings of Canadians are 
very important when we talk about legislation.  Canadians must 
feel that they can support the legislation that is put before 
them by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The private member's bill which the hon. member for Surrey North 
has introduced is really quite simple, straightforward and easy 
to understand.  He is merely asking that section 7.2 of the Young 
Offenders Act be made a hybrid offence.  That means that there 
can be a fine imposed or incarceration as part of the sanctions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 7.2 of the Young Offenders Act deals with the 
responsibility that someone assumes in order for a young offender 
not to be locked up; in other words, posting bail or whatever we 
want to call it.  It is interesting that the Minister of Justice 
has obviously seen the merits of this argument.  I understand it 
is part of the new youth criminal justice bill.  Therefore, I 
have to assume, because the government has put it into its own 
legislation, that it will be supporting this amendment to the 
Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason it needs to be supported now and not put on the table 
until the youth criminal justice bill is passed is very simply 
this.  It is extremely important, knowing the timeframe that some 
of this legislation takes to get through the House, to have this 
amendment in place sooner rather than later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest to government members who may be looking for an 
excuse not to support this bill because it is in the government's 
legislation to deal with the issue.  It is obviously supported 
and it is obviously an important amendment to be made.  I am 
hoping that when the time comes to vote on this bill governments 
members will be there to support the hon. member for Surrey 
North. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned, the amendment deals with the issue of 
accountability. 
People sign undertakings or bonds.  There is an acknowledgement 
or a responsibility for them to live up to what it is they have 
signed. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1335"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just criminal matters where this happens.  We run into 
this situation in immigration.  People agree to sign a document 
indicating that they will sponsor an individual and that they 
will assume financial responsibility for a person coming from 
another country, and then they walk away from that 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue is more of a justice issue in that it is a person 
signing a document which says they will be responsible for the 
actions of a young offender and that they will make sure the 
young offender meets the conditions that have been imposed as a 
condition of their release. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this private member's bill is doing is showing that if a 
person has wilfully failed to comply with the conditions they 
agreed to, then something should happen.  There should be some 
responsibility laid upon them for having failed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a parent or guardian is unable to enforce the conditions that 
are spelled out in section 7, then basically the young offender 
should not be allowed to remain at large.  That is the contract 
which they have signed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a parent or guardian knows that they are not able to 
control or make sure that the young person is where they are 
supposed to be, or staying away from friends whom they are not 
supposed to be mixing with, then the onus should be on the parent 
or guardian to notify the authorities, who would then take the 
young person into custody or control them in some other manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an obligation for parents or guardians to do that.  The 
obligation which they undertook was that if they could not handle 
the individual they would turn the young person over to the 
control and authority of the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It really is a question of differentiating.  I would suggest 
that this bill is not trying to nail all parents because they are 
unable to know where their kids are 24 hours a day.  It is aimed 
at the people who have entered an agreement, a legal 
understanding, in order that the young person not be incarcerated 
or held until the court case is heard.  It is really earmarked or 
geared to that specific situation.  I do not think that anyone 
should misunderstand that it is a broader brush, that it tries to 
deal with all parents in all circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian taxpayers, the parents and guardians of young people, 
should realize that we are encouraging and supporting what the 
youth criminal justice bill or the Young Offenders Act offers, 
that young people can be released into the custody of parents or 
guardians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In most cases that is perfectly all right.  It works out fine. 
However, in those cases where somebody takes on that 
responsibility and then does nothing to make sure their 
undertakings are being fulfilled, there is something that can be 
done about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason the hon. member is asking for it to be treated as a 
hybrid offence is to give the courts the ability to put some meat 
behind their decisions, to put some emphasis on the 
responsibility that they are handing over to the parent or 
guardian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it is now, because it is a summary conviction and there is 
not any real penalty or sanction, it is too easy to walk away 
from that responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend my colleague for bringing this weakness in the 
legislation to the attention of the House.  It is obviously a 
weakness that the government has accepted needs to be addressed, 
as it has done exactly that with the youth criminal justice bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I want to ensure that my colleagues understand that if it 
is good enough to put in a new act, then it is good enough to 
support now so that it can at least be in existing legislation 
rather than waiting for future legislation.  We have no idea how 
long it will take for the new legislation to pass through the 
House and then the Senate after we have dealt with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those of us who are close to the member for Surrey North it 
is obvious why this is important.  The failure to pass this and 
put it into legislation can cause situations such as that which 
happened to the hon. member for Surrey North.  His son was 
murdered by a young offender who was in the custody of his 
parent.  The conditions of his release were not fulfilled.  We 
are all very sympathetic with the reasons this bill was 
introduced and we certainly support its intention.  I urge all 
government members to support this private member's bill when it 
is voted upon. 
<P><A NAME="LINK185"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
commend the hon. member for Surrey North for his contribution to 
youth justice through private member's Bill C-260.  We should all 
be applauding his efforts and acknowledging the work he has done 
on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It bears repeating that this amendment to the Young Offenders 
Act would not create a general liability for parents based on the 
crimes of their children.  The proposed amendment would make the 
existing offence of wilfully failing to comply with an 
undertaking given to a court, made in connection with a young 
offender's release from pretrial detention, a hybrid rather than 
a summary conviction offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed amendment to the Young Offenders Act contained in 
Bill C-260 applies where a youth has been found to be ineligible 
for judicial interim release under the Criminal Code test.  The 
current provisions of the Young Offenders Act allow such a youth 
to be placed in the care of a responsible adult instead of being 
detained in custody.  The responsible adult must undertake in 
writing to take care of the young person and to comply with 
conditions set by the court.  Currently, if the responsible adult 
wilfully fails to comply with the undertaking, he or she could be 
found guilty of a summary conviction offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Surrey North is proposing that the potential 
criminal liability for wilfully failing to comply is not serious 
enough.  On March 11 the government introduced Bill C-68, the new 
youth criminal justice legislation, which would repeal and 
replace the Young Offenders Act.  It should be noted that the new 
legislation makes the offence of wilfully failing to comply with 
an undertaking given to a court to act as a responsible adult a 
hybrid rather than a summary conviction offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An undertaking to act as a responsible adult is a serious 
responsibility and we have acknowledged that in the changes we 
have made.  It applies only to youth who would otherwise be 
detained in custody pending their trials.  We acknowledge that 
some may well be dangerous and difficult to control.  The wilful 
failure of a responsible adult to comply with undertakings could 
have tragic consequences for members of the public, as the hon. 
member who introduced this legislation can attest to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equipping those in the system with the tools to make decisions 
based on the facts of the case in front of them is a key 
direction of the new legislation.  Flexibility in the options 
available and empowering those in the system with a full range of 
tools that can be applied depending on the seriousness and 
circumstances of individual cases are hallmarks of the youth 
justice legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While some favour automatic provisions and set tariffs, we 
believe that the discretion and judgment of those in the judicial 
system counts and leads to fairer and more constructive outcomes. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill stipulates that, in each and every case, teenagers 
should face sanctions that promote responsibility toward victims 
and the community, teach them good values and help them measure 
the consequences of their action. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the debate on Bill C-260 some members have commented on 
elements of Bill C-68 and those comments must be addressed.  The 
hon. member for Crowfoot claimed that the government had 
abandoned 10 and 11 year olds who, by their criminal acts, have 
signalled to society that they are in need of help and 
assistance. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1345"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT45"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT45"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1345

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government does not believe that criminalizing the 
behaviour of 10 year olds is helpful. Child welfare and mental 
health systems are more appropriate ways of providing safe and 
effective help to disturbed children. These systems have access 
to a wider array of services and are more age appropriate, family 
oriented and therapeutic than those available to the criminal 
justice system.  I believe there is much consensus on that in the 
public and here in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not abandoning these children but are working with key 
partners to ensure they do not fall through the cracks but get 
the supervision and treatment they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Crowfoot also criticized restrictions placed 
on the publication of names.  The proposed legislation, Bill 
C-68, strikes an appropriate balance we believe between two 
legitimate and competing values, the need to encourage 
rehabilitation by avoiding the negative effect of publicity on 
the youth versus the need for greater openness and transparency 
in the justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allowing for the publication of the names of youth who commit 
the most serious crimes while protecting the privacy of those who 
commit less serious crimes is an appropriate balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We look forward to further debate next week on Bill C-68 and the 
opportunity to refute suggestion made by members to criminalize 
10 year olds and scrap important privacy protections for youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us today, however, proposes a change in the 
penalty structure for those who wilfully fail to respect 
undertakings made to the court.  I agree there is considerable 
merit in this being a hybrid offence so that the decision to 
proceed by summary conviction or by indictment could be made 
based on the seriousness of the crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to impress on youth that the justice system should be 
respected, should foster values such as accountability and 
responsibility and that criminal behaviour will lead to 
meaningful consequences, then we must apply those values to 
responsible adults in the youth justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. member for Surrey North for bringing this 
important proposal forward and I assure him that it is included 
in Bill C-68. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like a good number of Canadians, the hon. member for Surrey 
North has put forward proposals to reinforce the Canadian youth 
justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that new comprehensive and balanced youth criminal justice 
legislation has been introduced by the government and that a new 
youth justice system will soon be implemented, we are looking 
forward to work hand in hand with all Canadians who, like us, 
want to solve the complex issue of youth crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to prevent youth crime by establishing sanctions for the 
broad range of criminal acts committed by young people and by 
helping to rehabilitate young Canadians and turn them into 
law-abiding adults. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again I want to insist on the fact that, as the member 
before me said, this provision existed in the Young Offenders 
Act.  We are increasing the sentence provision in the new 
criminal justice act, Bill C-68.  I again thank the member who 
brought this forward and I commend his efforts to see it become 
part of our new youth criminal justice system.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I join 
in today's debate with a great deal of caution and earnestness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to assure my colleague, the mover of the bill, that we 
will keep in mind at all times the unfortunate events he lived 
through, and which led him to enter political life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, after consulting with members from my party, I do not 
think we will be able to support the provisions of the bill, as 
mentioned already by the member for Berthier—Montcalm during the 
first hour of debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, the bill is an important one because it highlights a 
fundamental issue, that of parental responsibility in the 
process, admittedly often a trying one, that leads to criminal 
behaviour and juvenile delinquency, and as members know, to deep 
trauma in the communities concerned.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been interested for years in the whole issue of crime, 
especially as a member of Parliament. In my riding of 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, some segments of our community are 
experiencing a serious crime problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quickly learned that, when discussing these issues and holding 
a debate on juvenile delinquency and crime, one has to deal in 
nuance because of the different levels involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Crime can be a symptom: often emerging in the teenage years, it 
is commonly linked to gangs or personal distress. 
Often there is a connection between crime, the family 
environment, the social surrounding, and finally failures in an 
individual's life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not the same kind of crime we are dealing with when we are 
talking about bikers gangs, money laundering or immigrant 
smugglers for example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This being said, the question raised by our colleague is: What 
part of the responsibility should be assumed by a parent? The 
persons in charge could be the parents or anyone who has custody 
of the child, who is still a minor. If the guardians are 
negligent, that is if they have failed to exercise proper 
supervision, as mentioned in the bill in question, if these 
people have not been as vigilant as required under their 
contractual obligation, it is asked that they be liable to a 
longer prison term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We come to our jobs as lawmakers with the sum total of our past 
experiences.  I have the utmost understanding, respect and 
sympathy for the motivations behind the bill introduced by the 
hon. member for Surrey North, and find them highly respectable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, the question arises: what impact will holding 
parents who have failed to meet their obligation of supervision 
and guidance more responsible have on outcome?  I believe that 
the underlying question we have as a party is not a denial of 
the existence of juvenile delinquency.  It is not a refusal to 
recognize that there are certain conditions conducive to the 
development of youth crime. 
It seems to me that there are two premises in the contributions 
made by the hon. member for Berthier—Montcalm, himself a lawyer 
moreover, and those made by our colleagues within caucus 
discussions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My understanding of the matter is that, first of all, it is 
extremely difficulty to look at crime without examining a whole 
set of factors.  Is there not a wider responsibility, a more 
general one, and is it not rather risky to focus essentially on 
the family unit?  This is the first aspect we question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, does the bill not reflect—despite reasons which, I 
repeat, for very personal considerations, are utterly 
responsible and respectable—a desire to say basically, at 14, 
15 or 16 years of age that you are an adult to some extent and 
should be considered equal to someone of 30, 40 or 50 years of 
age, whereas we know that the circumstances surrounding 
behaviour at age 14, 15 or 16, however dramatic they may be, 
must not prevent us from making distinctions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not?  First, because at age 14, 15, 16 or 17 we are at our 
most vulnerable, our values are not entirely established and we 
are still learning.

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, our opposition focuses on the fact that, as a society, 
when things happen in the family that verge on the criminal, 
should we not make resources available to this family?  More 
basically—and I want our position to be very clearly 
understood—it must not prevent us from establishing whatever it 
takes to provide a dissuasive effect and ensure the level of 
juvenile delinquency in our society decreases.  I think that is 
what all the parties in this House want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope to have a chance, later on, to make the connections 
between youth crime, poverty and other factors which reinforce 
this reality, but must we not also ask ourselves what this will 
do to the rehabilitation process? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say the big difference between the Reform Party and the 
Bloc Quebecois on this issue is our concern with rehabilitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As soon as signs of juvenile delinquency start appearing within 
a family—and I also mean within a community—should we not ask 
ourselves what it will do to the rehabilitation process if the 
parent or guardian or the person responsible, the person who 
signed the undertaking mentioned in section 7.2 of the act as 
proposed in the bill is thrown in jail for two years? 
In this type of situation, do we not have a duty to bring the 
parent and the child closer together? Do we not have a duty to 
make available to this family, that is going through a difficult 
time, mechanisms that are based on mediation and dialogue where 
we have to try to understand what went wrong? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a 14, 15, or 16-year old kills one of his peers, commits 
vandalism or commits any other offence under the Criminal Code, 
that means that, at some point, the youth rebelled against 
society. Of course there are different degrees of rebellion. I 
can understand that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The one criticism we can address to the Reform Party is that it 
looks only at solutions centred on sentencing. 
There may be something there worth looking into, but I notice 
they have given no thought or consideration to understanding the 
causes of such behaviour and the rehabilitation process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we are not very enthusiastic about the bill. This 
being said, we are ready to consider it, as the member for 
Berthier—Montcalm said on several occasions,. But how can we make 
the rehabilitation process even more effective? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Reform Party could give us the assurance now that sending 
parents to jail would ensure that the young offender will be a 
better citizen in 5, 10 or 15 years from now, we would have no 
difficulty supporting the bill, but we believe there is 
something missing here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not convinced that sending parents to jail for a longer 
time, with a stiffer sentence, which would prevent the child 
from maintaining contact with them, at least within the family 
unit, will enhance the rehabilitation process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to young offenders, there is already a model in 
Quebec. We have the expertise, we have the legislation. On the 
basis of verifiable data, which deserve to be discussed, we 
believe that the results were worth it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by saying that we understand and respect our 
colleague's motivation, but we are not convinced that this is 
the right way to go in order to reach the goals identified in 
his bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to have this opportunity to speak to the private 
member's bill that was introduced by the member for Surrey North. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the member for bringing this issue forward. It is not 
always easy to bring forward a private member's bill for debate. 
A lot of work is involved. Next week we will begin debate on the 
new youth criminal justice act which is very important.  I would 
like to congratulate the member for having done the work on this 
issue and for being part of a democratic process which ensures 
that these issues are aired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member's personal circumstances surrounding this issue are 
tragic.  This is all the more reason that we need to debate these 
issues, to ensure that our youth justice system works properly 
and protection is provided not just for young people but for 
society as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this bill is to make an offence as set out in 
section 7.2 of the Young Offenders Act a hybrid offence. As we 
have heard today in debate the bill does not change the section 
other than to make the penalty more serious. In serious cases 
under section 7.2, parents or guardians could face a jail 
sentence of up to two years if they fail to supervise their 
children who have been released from custody. This would be an 
increase from the current maximum penalty of six months in jail 
and/or a $2,000 fine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Normally when a child is charged with a crime under the current 
Young Offenders Act, a parent or guardian signs an agreement with 
the court to supervise the child and enforce certain conditions 
until the charges are heard.  This bill would increase the 
penalty if the conditions are not met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be a much fuller and comprehensive debate in this 
House as a result of the newly introduced youth criminal justice 
act, Bill C-68.  While we welcome this private member's bill as a 
good opportunity to debate something that needs to be aired, it 
is important that it also be in the context of youth justice as a 
whole. From that point of view it is important that the new youth 
criminal justice act be debated on the next day of business of 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the New Democratic Party very strongly support measures to 
protect the public from serious violent repeat offenders.  We 
believe that youth who fall into this category and have been 
determined to be a risk to public safety should be held in 
custody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One purpose of our youth justice system is to recognize when 
violent crimes have taken place, if custody is determined to be 
in the interests of the public, then those young offenders should 
be held in custody. We will get into this more when we debate the 
new act that has been introduced.  We have some concerns about 
the impact that provisions such as the one before us today may 
have on families and their ability to meet conditions.  What kind 
of difficulty will imposing a stiffer penalty have for a single 
parent, low income families or even families where both parents 
are working full time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to put on the record that although there are 
very good intentions around this bill, we have to have a balanced 
approach.  We have to look at whether or not this kind of penalty 
will place a significant and unfair burden on some families and 
parents who lack the resources to strictly enforce the 
supervision orders. A bill such as this one may be something that 
becomes discriminatory.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last few weeks a lot of the debate in the House of 
Commons has been about what is happening to Canadian families and 
how they are under enormous stress.  We have had debates from the 
Reform Party about the tax system.  There has been a lot of 
useful exchanges in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In today's day and age there is enormous stress on families. 
Parents sometimes have one, two or three jobs. Wages are being 
driven down.  People are working longer and longer hours for less 
money.  All of those things create stress on families, 
particularly on single parent families and low income families. 
These are very difficult times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do want to be clear about our concerns on the impact this 
bill, if it were approved, would have on some families in terms 
of their ability to provide the resources and supervision 
required under this bill and generally under section 7.2 of the 
act.  We have to make sure that the families that can least 
afford the resources are not families that would be singled out 
and unduly punished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to deal with the issue of youth crime or youth 
justice, the NDP believes very strongly that we have to look at 
the underlying causes of youth crime.  We must have adequate long 
term programs, not just a little bit here, a band-aid there, a 
new announcement today, or a few more dollars here and there. 
Governments at all levels have to make a serious commitment to 
address things like chronic youth unemployment and the lack of 
educational opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my own community, I am sure every parent is aware that 
education has a real impact on young people.  Young people who 
are seriously involved and doing very well in school and whose 
needs are being met through the educational system are very 
unlikely to get into trouble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Education is a lifelong process.  Young people must be supplied 
with the educational, employment and training opportunities they 
need. I and many other members in my caucus believe they are 
fundamental and critical things we can address as a society to 
ensure that we are actually preventing crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When kids are productive and involved in their communities and 
in their schools, they are not getting into trouble.  They are 
not falling off the edge.  They do not feel isolated, that nobody 
cares about them, that they have no future and that they have no 
hope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the converse is true.  When we see the lack of 
educational opportunities, the lack of training and jobs and the 
lack of community support then we see kids who are very high 
risk.  They become vulnerable to the sex trade, to illegal drug 
use and to youth gangs.  All of those things become pressures on 
young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From our point of view, those are the issues that need to be 
addressed if we are serious about addressing the causes of youth 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next week for the first time, the B.C. government is declaring a 
week to stop the sexual exploitation of children.  Youth 
awareness week is being very much supported by the RCMP as one 
way to draw attention to some of the issues facing our young 
people and how they get drawn into a criminal and marginalized 
lifestyle.  This is something we need to deal with and ensure 
that there is an adequate response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We appreciate this bill being brought forward.  As we begin to 
debate the youth criminal justice bill next, we want to deal with 
these issues in a more comprehensive way.  While we do support 
the intent of what is being brought forward here, we do have some 
concerns about the impact this provision would have on some 
families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We look forward to the debate that is coming forward in the next 
few days around the youth criminal justice system. 
<P><A NAME="LINK188"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on 
normal occasions we are very pleased to speak about issues that 
affect our constituents but to speak about dealing with young 
offenders, especially young offenders with some very serious 
offences, is not something we prefer to do. 
However we do not live in a perfect world and as such, we have to 
deal with the issues we are faced with as parliamentarians.

<A HREF="#LINKT49"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the member for Vancouver East who says that we 
should do all these proactive things to solve the problems before 
they happen.  But it seems in our society the old days are gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Newfoundland in the old days people would say if you had 
three square meals a day and a roof over your head, the world was 
a pretty good place to live.  That world of food, clothing and 
shelter being the only requirements for a person in society is 
not something which now exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our society has become unbelievably complex.  We need a lot of 
help from parliamentarians and from governments to make sure that 
our society is safe, that we have the basics in life which now 
include the requirement for a very significant social net. When 
one is young, when one is aged, and certainly when one is sick or 
disabled a lot of things are required to be put in place by 
governments to make sure that one has more than just food, 
clothing and shelter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Education, as the member mentioned, is one of the things which 
is needed in a more significant and increasingly aggressive and 
progressive way to get at the problems before they become issues 
which we have to deal with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Besides having food, clothing and shelter, citizens require 
safety and that governments address the fundamental things, for 
example, the issues of crime and youth and adult offenders which 
make us feel so insecure in our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is almost like insurance in reverse. We buy fire insurance to 
protect our homes.  Most of us will never see a fire.  Most of 
us, if we are lucky, will never see a violent offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is criminal activity.  We have seen some especially in St. 
John's West.  There have been terrible incidents all across 
Canada.  Violent young people whom we are speaking about today 
commit the most terrible crimes.  It frightens us all. It makes 
us want to buy safety insurance because we have been touched by 
this violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Newfoundland recently we have had half a dozen terrible 
examples of violence by young offenders against our senior 
citizens, some of the most defenceless people in our communities. 
Many times these young offenders are repeat offenders. They have 
been in trouble with the law in many places. When it happens to 
an aged person it frightens us all and makes us wonder where we 
are going to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like all the members who have spoken on Bill C-260, I want to 
congratulate the member for Surrey North for bringing it to the 
attention of the House and to the Canadian public.  Obviously we 
all deeply regret why the member has had to do this.  I say 
again, when one is touched by violence there has to be a reaction 
to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am disappointed that it took 18 months to bring the issue to 
the floor of the House of Commons so we could discuss an issue 
which plagues many Canadian communities and many Canadian 
families.  I wonder why that has had to happen.  Everyone knows 
the problem of young offenders, violent offenders and repeat 
offenders.  Why could we not deal with it when the issue was 
first brought forward? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember a saying, I think it was by a president, that it 
would be amazing how much we could accomplish together if we did 
not care who got the credit.  Sometimes in this place we are so 
involved with policy, with procedure and with positioning that we 
forget about the good idea.  Last night we had an emergency 
debate.  We have done that a couple of other times. If there is 
something that needs to be done and the Canadian public wants it, 
demands it and expects it, does it make any difference whether it 
comes from a backbencher from the Reform Party, a member of the 
Conservative Party or a member of the government, either 
backbencher or government minister? The idea is that the Canadian 
public wants certain things done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to concur with the comments made by our justice critic, 
the member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough who spoke when 
this legislation was last before the House.  He said that some of 
the progressive advances we are talking about are not going to be 
seen in the government's bill, Bill C-68.  Some of the better 
ideas are here now in Bill C-260 that we could implement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the ideas that the provinces wanted to bring in are not 
in Bill C-68.  In many ways we think Bill C-68, the government 
response which will become the law of this country, is going to 
be regressive.  It reverts to the not so good old days of the 
juvenile delinquency act. The idea is that repeat young offenders 
who are involved in offences which are less serious in nature 
will be tried in court as adults but then sentenced as children. 
Many people are left wondering why it is that it took the Liberal 
government 12 months of head scratching to come up with a very 
old idea.

<A HREF="#LINKT50"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has come up with a bill that fails to adequately 
protect Canadians from increasingly violent crimes committed by 
young people.  Public opinion on the subject is so strong that it 
should be obvious to everybody, even the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it seems it wants to project the image of a government 
that has toughened up the Young Offenders Act, the reality is 
that the patchwork legislation will do little to accomplish the 
objectives the minister claims to support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Age is part of it, lowering the age to 14 when 12 or 10 is 
recommended.  Parents, who are very proud of their young sons or 
daughters, are sometimes asked how old they are.  For some 
strange reason they might say four going on forty or six going on 
sixty. It seems that in our progressive society where change 
takes place so fast some of our young offenders are ten going on 
forty or fifty in the way they deal with the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In lowering the age to 14 at which young offenders could face 
adult sentences for the most serious of crimes like murder, 
attempted murder, manslaughter and aggravated sexual assault, the 
government has failed to go as far as it should.  Instead the 
ever present Liberal spin doctors are treating the important 
issue of youth justice as merely another public relations 
exercise, apparently indifferent to the substantive effects of 
the legislation the Minister of Justice has introduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me point out that even the minister's advisers in the 
Department of Justice recommended that the age of accountability 
should be lowered to 10 years.  The minister chose to ignore this 
advice and we as Canadians are left to wonder why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another problem with the minister's bill is the ambiguity in the 
language it employs.  This ambiguity will mean the implementation 
will depend on the interpretation of the legislation after the 
fact, instead of being clear and direct in the first instance. We 
are left with the same problem that the courts will make our laws 
for us.  Some of the legislation as drafted is hundreds of pages 
long.  We begin to wonder if lawyers who draft legislation do it 
so other lawyers will have reason to take it to court for appeals 
on top of appeals until eventually we get a new law many years 
hence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not alone in identifying the serious deficiencies in the 
proposed youth criminal justice act.  It has been criticized 
severely by the governments of Ontario and Alberta, both 
provinces in which youth justice is a particularly salient issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems clear that the governments of these provinces are much 
more in touch with the views and concerns of the residents than 
the federal government.  They know that window dressing is not 
adequate response to a very real problem.  They know that it is 
not enough to want to be seen to be doing something and that the 
kind of public posturing the federal government adopted with 
regard to youth justice is worthless without meaningful 
legislative measures to back it up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the spirit of the legislation introduced by the 
member for Surrey North.  It is an unfortunate fact of our system 
that it has taken so long to get it here.  It is also unfortunate 
for members of the House, and indeed for all Canadians who look 
to their governments for leadership on youth justice issues, that 
since the introduction of Bill C-260 the Liberals have chosen to 
bring forward such a weak response in Bill C-68. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the member for bringing it to the attention of 
all members of parliament and the public of Canada.  It is an 
issue that should be dealt with as quickly as possible. 
<P><A NAME="LINK189"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased today to speak in support of the bill 
of the hon. member for Surrey North.  The bill is quite clear in 
its intent to make section 7(2) of the Young Offenders Act a 
hybrid offence to present clear and genuine penalties to people 
who make a signed undertaking and then fail to live up to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who post bail for accused offenders forfeit it if the 
bail conditions are not met.  Why should any responsible adult 
who signs an undertaking to supervise a young offender not have 
to pay a significant penalty for failing to meet his or her 
commitment?  The concept is fairly clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Vancouver East suggested that the proposed 
legislation might discriminate against parents who for one reason 
or another lack the means to provide necessary supervision. 
Section 7(2) of the Young Offenders Act is specifically designed 
to protect the public.  It is not put there for the convenience 
of the parent.  It is to protect the public.

<A HREF="#LINKT51"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parents are not obliged to sign these undertakings.  There is no 
rule or coercion which says they must sign these undertakings. 
If a parent voluntarily undertakes to accept responsibility, I 
would submit the parent should be held responsible for his or her 
actions.  It is not something that can be done frivolously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The speech of the hon. member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve left me 
somewhat bemused.  I did not know what he was getting at a lot of 
the time.  If I could cut through all of it, it would seem that 
he rejects the concept of individual responsibility, not just for 
juveniles but for adults as well.  Bill C-260 is all about 
accepting responsibility for personal undertakings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary and others made reference to the 
fact that the bill would duplicate one of the provisions of the 
upcoming youth criminal justice act.  It would be covered in 
section 138 of the act, but I do not accept the premise that 
because the YCJA may be coming down the road some time in the 
future we should not be seriously considering this one small 
amendment to the YOA at this time.  One does not stop scrubbing 
floors at home just because there is a plan to make major 
renovations.  One continues normal everyday maintenance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-260 could be enacted now.  The new YCJA was only tabled 
last week.  Heaven knows when it will become law.  Hopefully it 
will not become law in exactly the same form in which it is now. 
It needs a lot of revision and renovation.  We could make this 
one quick fix to help the public, to benefit society in general 
at this time, simply by enacting a bill that incidentally has 
been coming down the pike for a year and a half.  It has taken 
that long to reach the point where we are now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I get a feeling—maybe it is a misplaced feeling—in listening 
to the hon. parliamentary secretary that there is a slight 
Machiavellian motive here, the ploy that we should not worry 
about Bill C-260 because the meat of it will be buried or hidden 
away in the new youth criminal justice act when it comes down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe the broader bill is being gussied up a bit with the clause 
to attempt to force MPs to support a pretty noxious piece of 
legislation for the sake of one very valuable clause.  It is like 
the old story about a chocolate covered smartie buried in a bowl 
of manure.  Anyone wanting to eat the smartie knows what has to 
be done.  I do not appreciate that approach to legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary diverged a little from the debate 
today.  I would like to respond to what she said about the child 
welfare and mental health systems being all that we need to look 
after 10 and 11 year olds caught up in the criminal justice 
system.  That is what we are relying on right now.  That is what 
we are doing. 
We are trying to deal with the 10 and 11 year olds strictly 
through child welfare and the mental health system and it is not 
working.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The new YCJA would do nothing to change an approach which has 
been a dismal failure. I have not had a chance to read the bill 
in any depth yet but on scanning the bill I cannot see very much 
serious improvement in the YCJA over the old YOA.  It is the old 
car with a new coat of paint.  Why are we taking this long and 
tedious approach to doing nothing?  The Muslims have a saying 
that the elephant laboured and brought forth a mouse.  That seems 
to be what is happening with the new act. 
<P><A NAME="LINK190"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am delighted to join the debate.  As a member from British 
Columbia I commend the hon. member for Surrey North who has 
worked hard to introduce Bill C-260, an act to amend the Young 
Offenders Act. In many ways this is a timely proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's strategy involves replacing the Young Offenders 
Act with new youth justice legislation which has proposed 
significant improvements to the youth justice system.  The 
strategy focuses on three key areas: preventing youth crime, 
ensuring meaningful consequences for offences committed by youth, 
and improving rehabilitation and reintegration for young 
offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's strategy for the renewal of youth justice 
launched on May 12, 1998 sets out a vision for responding to 
Canadians' concerns about youth crime.  Clearly, Canadians want a 
youth justice system that protects society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in the context of addressing problems with the current 
youth justice system through new youth justice legislation that 
Bill C-260 has been considered.  The bill, sponsored by the hon. 
member for Surrey North, proposes making the offences of wilfully 
failing to comply with an undertaking made in connection with a 
young person's release from pretrial detention a hybrid rather 
than a summary conviction offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the weaknesses of the existing system relates to pretrial 
detention and judicial interim release.  There is a failure to 
distinguish adequately between those who should be detained in 
custody prior to their trials and those who need not be.  This 
situation should be addressed through greater clarity on the 
criteria for pretrial detention and enhanced program support to 
ensure there are alternatives for those who do not need to be in 
jail prior to trial.  The hon. member for Surrey North's concern 
relates to those who are released and improperly supervised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provision of the Young Offenders Act that is the subject of 
Bill C-260 takes effect after the bail criteria have been applied 
and the youth has been found to be ineligible for judicial 
interim release.  In such cases the current provisions of the 
Young Offenders Act permit youth to be placed in the care of a 
responsible adult instead of being detained in custody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. member for Surrey North for bringing Bill C-260 
forward and I assure him that it has been given every 
consideration during the development of the new youth justice 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new legislation will soon be introduced.  It is an important 
component of our broad, comprehensive strategy to address youth 
crime.
