<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Elinor Caplan (for the Solicitor General of Canada, 
Lib.)</B> moved that Bill S-10, an act to amend the National 
Defence Act, the DNA Identification Act and the criminal code, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to address the House today on second reading of Bill 
S-10, an act to amend the National Defence Act, the DNA 
Identification Act and the criminal code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill follows up on an earlier piece of legislation, the DNA 
Identification Act, which received royal assent in December 1998. 
That act provides for the creation of a national DNA databank 
which will contain DNA profiles of convicted offenders and 
unsolved crime scenes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of the House will recall, parliament endorsed a 
post-conviction scheme for the databank because it will ensure 
that all charter requirements are met.  Bill S-10 does not change 
this important feature or the other key elements of the DNA 
Identification Act.  It does fine-tune the legislation to create 
a more comprehensive and effective national DNA databank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-10 also proposes some practical changes to ensure the 
smooth and effective implementation of the databank.  The data 
bank is scheduled to be up and running by the end of June this 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We therefore urge hon. members of the House to give Bill S-10 
prompt consideration so that we can move quickly to introducing 
this powerful investigative tool to improve public safety for all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to share with members how Bill S-10 was developed, how it 
will work, its benefits and how the bill was improved as a result 
of its passage through the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill addresses a number of proposals that were recommended 
by the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs 
when it reviewed the original databank legislation.  At that time 
the Senate committee proposed ways to better protect privacy 
interests and promote the databank's operations in an open and 
accountable manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-10 amends the National Defence Act, the DNA 
Identification Act to include the national DNA bank profiles from 
offenders who are subject to the military's code of service 
discipline and who are convicted of serious and violent offences. 
This amendment will ensure that we have a more complete databank 
that is not limited to civilian offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the purposes of the National Defence Act, a designated 
offence includes all the current criminal code designated 
offences as well as those service offences that are similar in 
nature to the criminal code offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Military judges will be authorized to impose databank orders on 
persons subject to the code of service discipline after they are 
convicted of a designated offence.  The DNA profiles obtained 
from these offenders will then be entered into the databank's 
convicted offenders index. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The National Defence Act is also being amended to authorize 
military judges to issue DNA warrants for military police 
investigations of designated offences committed within or outside 
Canada by someone who is subject to the code of service 
discipline.  This will assist military police in conducting more 
efficient and effective police investigations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to emphasize that the proposed amendments to the National 
Defence Act mirror the current provisions in the criminal code. 
They include the same constitutional and privacy safeguards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To enable parliament to monitor the ongoing operation of the 
databank, Bill S-10 includes new accountability measures.  The 
RCMP commissioner will have to submit an annual report on the 
operations of the national DNA databank to the solicitor general. 
The solicitor general will then report to both Houses of 
parliament.  Through this report, parliament will regularly 
receive valuable information about the databank's operations and 
will be able to assess whether it is meeting its intended 
objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary review provision in the DNA Identification Act 
has also been amended to give a Senate committee the same 
authority as a House of Commons committee to independently review 
the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The statement of principles in the DNA Identification Act is 
also being expanded to clarify that bodily samples and the 
resulting DNA profiles can only be used for law enforcement 
purposes.  Bill S-10 makes it clear that such misuse is 
prohibited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To ensure the smooth and effective implementation of the data 
bank, Bill S-10 also makes some practical changes to the criminal 
code.  These changes were identified during recent consultations 
with the provinces and territories in planning for implementation 
of the databank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal and provincial heads of prosecution noted that the 
current law is unclear as to when a court does not have to make a 
databank order.  Therefore, the criminal code is being clarified. 
Bill S-10 will require that the only time the court is not 
required to make a databank order is if the prosecutor advises 
that the person's DNA profile is already in the data bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To deal with offenders who may be transferred out of a province 
before a databank order can be executed, provincial court judges 
will be able to endorse an order that was granted in another 
province.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two criminal code provisions that have not yet been proclaimed 
are also being repealed.  These provisions would require a peace 
officer to inform a person specified in a DNA warrant or data 
bank order that he or she may express a preference on what type 
of DNA sample to give, and for the peace officer to take that 
preference into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These provisions could cause uncertainty when a person's 
preference conflicts with a judge's discretion in the the DNA 
warrant or order.  Uncertainty cannot be allowed to enter into 
this important process.  Giving a person a choice on what type of 
sample to provide is also unnecessary in law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The criminal code provision allowing a person to consent to the 
use of his or her existing DNA results for the databank is also 
being repealed.  This is because Canadian forensic labs do not 
support sending to the databank bodily substances or DNA profiles 
obtained from the criminal investigations.  Re-using an old DNA 
profile is not feasible because there is no way of verifying 
whether it actually belongs to the person specified in the 
databank order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-10 contains another important change to the criminal code 
and the National Defence Act to promote the accuracy and 
integrity of the national DNA databank.  Peace officers, or 
persons acting under their direction, will be required to take 
fingerprints at the same time that DNA samples are collected for 
the databank.  This will enable the police to verify the identity 
of the person specified in the DNA databank order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By comparing the person's fingerprints with those contained in 
the RCMP's automated fingerprint identification system, the 
police will know whether they are taking a sample from the right 
person. Fingerprints are also useful in verifying the identity of 
a person when a match occurs in the databank.  Not only will this 
measure enhance the reliability of the databank but it will also 
protect a person who has the same name as an offender specified 
in the databank order.  To ensure the complete privacy of 
fingerprints, the bill makes it clear that they may only be taken 
for databank purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of the improvements proposed in Bill S-10, Canada 
will have a more complete and effective databank that will better 
protect the public from repeat violent offenders.  The 
legislation includes practical changes to ensure that the data 
bank can be successfully implemented and that parliament can 
oversee its operations over time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All provinces and territories, the police, victims and the 
public are looking forward to the databank's timely 
implementation.  It will be an important milestone and a long 
awaited tool to improve public safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would therefore urge the hon. members of the House to support 
Bill S-10 so that we may proceed quickly in ensuring that its 
proposals are passed by the time the databank is implemented. 
<P><A NAME="LINK6"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will try to slow down.  I think I see some smoke 
coming out of the translator's booth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opportunity to speak to this Senate bill, Bill S-10, an act 
to amend the National Defence Act, the DNA Identification Act and 
the Criminal Code, puts me in a bit of a quandary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On one hand, I do not agree that we should be dealing with 
legislation that comes from the unelected and unaccountable other 
place.  On the other hand, I have to agree with much of the 
intent of the legislation.  It illustrates once again how the 
government has failed to do its job properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just a couple of years ago we dealt with DNA legislation.  In 
fact this is at least the third time we have dealt with DNA 
legislation in the past five years.  I suppose the government was 
embarrassed about its previous failures to adequately address all 
that was necessary.  That may explain why it brought Bill S-10 
through the back door, so to speak, through the Senate once again 
instead of through the House of Commons.  Surely the government 
will get it right one of these days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, while Canadians want legislation to address 
failings in our youth justice system, while Canadians are dying 
through failures in our health system through lack of funding and 
through the lack of a plan to address the failings of our 
national health program, and while victims of crime continue to 
wait for legislation from the solicitor general, we are forced to 
once again spend time in this place dealing with DNA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do not get me wrong.  I believe DNA technology is one of the 
greatest tools for law enforcement and our justice system.  All I 
am saying is that it is unfortunate that we have to take three or 
four kicks at the can just on DNA legislation when there are so 
many other issues of importance to our citizens. It is a travesty 
that the government wastes time and money trying again and again 
to get something right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember the last time we discussed DNA legislation.  When we 
were dealing with Bill C-3 just two years ago, the government 
played politics instead of sufficiently supporting our police 
officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When our police are asking for tools to help them solve hundreds 
of unsolved murders and rapes, the government goes only halfway. 
The government is more concerned with inconveniencing our 
criminals than it is with protecting our communities and ensuring 
that our more dangerous predators are removed from the streets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps after a number of our incarcerated criminals succeed in 
getting back onto the streets, only to recommit additional 
crimes, will we then be able to obtain their DNA samples to help 
the police with past unsolved serious crimes.  Maybe then we will 
once again be back in here dealing with yet another attempt to 
properly legislate on this issue of DNA and the DNA databank once 
and for all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-10 amends the National Defence Act to authorize military 
judges to issue DNA warrants to assist in investigations of 
National Defence personnel.  The bill also authorizes military 
judges to order military offenders convicted of a limited number 
of offences to provide samples of bodily substances for the 
purpose of the DNA databank. 
Essentially all this legislation is doing is including similar 
provisions for the national defence justice system that we 
provided under the criminal code through Bill C-104 in 1995 and 
Bill C-3 in 1998.  As a side note, hon. members will also be 
aware that Bill C-3 was a prime example of just how little the 
government really considers its law enforcement officers and its 
citizens.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 was passed in September 1998 to set up the DNA databank 
so that evidence left at crime scenes for very limited types of 
offences could be compared to the DNA samples taken from some of 
our more dangerous criminals.  I say some of our more dangerous 
criminals because the government decided to severely limit just 
who had to provide samples of saliva or blood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, individuals who have only been convicted of one 
murder do not have to provide a DNA sample.  Furthermore, 
Canadian citizens will be surprised to know that such a valuable 
and highly effective justice tool is not even in force yet.  As I 
say, it was passed in September 1998.  It will not be in effect 
until next month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RCMP have been quoted as saying: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—it's the single most important tool added to crime-fighting 
since discovery of fingerprint identification. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has taken over a year and a half to come into being. 
Typically there are indications that it may take our correctional 
service another couple of years to fulfil its responsibilities 
under the legislation and to provide samples of those offenders 
presently incarcerated or serving sentences within the community. 
Should Bill S-10 pass this place I can only wonder how far down 
the road it will take before it too is actually in effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have previously stated in debate, it is most unfortunate 
that our DNA databank legislation is not much broader to include 
most, if not all, indictable offences.  We all know that the vast 
majority of our more dangerous criminals start their life of 
crime with the lesser offences and move up to the more heinous 
criminal activity.  Once a criminal commits an indictable offence 
that criminal should be included within the databank so that he 
will show up should he ever leave DNA evidence at the scene of a 
subsequent crime.  The government seems to think that it should 
be a game between the criminal and our law enforcement personnel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I keep hearing about the government's concern for balanced 
legislation.  Seeing its legislation and seeing its political 
endeavours, I often wonder whether part of its aim toward balance 
is ensuring that our criminals have a fair chance against getting 
caught and receiving punishment for their crimes.  It is often 
more concerned for the interest of the criminals than it is for 
the safety of our citizens and the efforts of our police 
officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the listener gets the impression that this DNA databank 
and DNA warrant process will only bring our criminals to justice, 
I should point out that it is most important to also prove the 
innocence of some accused.  We are all familiar with how DNA 
evidence was used to exonerate Guy Paul Morin and David Milgaard. 
They provided bodily samples to prove that the evidence left at 
the scene of the crimes did not match their DNA, so this whole 
DNA revolution is probably more important or at least just as 
important to prove innocence as to prove guilt of an individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not said much about Bill S-10 specifically.  As I have 
said, it brings to the military what we have done for our primary 
criminal justice process.  It only makes sense that our military 
system operates on the same footing.  Yes, it is an inadequate 
footing overall but at least it is a start. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be supporting the legislation.  It is my hope that it 
will not take as long to come into force.  For some reason the 
government does not seem to realize the importance of each day it 
delays the implementation of legislation such as this.  It may 
result in another day that victims have to live with not knowing 
who was responsible for the crime.  It may result in another day 
that an individual is falsely accused of a crime.  It may result 
in a day that a criminal gets away with a crime, to say nothing 
of the added expense to the taxpayer of added investigation by 
our police and additional legal argument within our courts as 
both the innocent and the guilty make their appeals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To sum up, DNA is a valuable tool to separate the guilty from 
the innocent.  It will greatly assist the police.  It will 
provide greater certainty to our justice system.  It will protect 
our citizens.  Some of us may question the necessity to separate 
our justice system from our military in this time of peace, but 
it only makes sense that we provide a similar regime for that 
process for the same reasons we have provided it within the civil 
justice system.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, despite the 
terrible way I sound this morning, I would like to be able to 
give you my message to the end. I am counting on the co-operation 
and indulgence of yourself as well as my colleagues so that I 
may manage to do so properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-10, with which we are dealing today, addresses a most 
interesting and timely subject, DNA evidence.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>DNA is located in the nucleus of human cells and contains each 
human being's genetic code.  In fact, each of us has a personal 
genetic code, with the exception of identical twins.  A person's 
DNA yields his or her genetic fingerprint.  For law enforcement 
officers and lawyers, the advancement of science in the area of 
genetics is an indispensable tool for solving crimes, that is 
for finding the guilty parties and clearing innocent ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before addressing the main thrust of Bill S-10, an act to amend 
the National Defence Act, the DNA Identification Act and the 
criminal code, I would like to provide a brief overview of 
Canadian legislation as it applies to the sampling of bodily 
substances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before 1995, the criminal code included no provisions allowing 
bodily substances to be sampled for genetic analysis on 
individuals suspected of a crime.  Police officers did, 
nevertheless, collect bodily substances for genetic analysis 
purposes on accused individuals.  This practice was challenged 
before the courts under the provision of the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms, which provides protection against 
unreasonable search and seizure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decision in Borden by the Supreme Court of Canada in 1994 is 
an example of this.  In this decision, the Supreme Court of 
Canada clearly says that the taking of bodily substances 
constitutes a search and seizure. Unless permitted under the law 
or unless the accused validly agrees to it, it is to be 
considered abuse.  In this instance, hair and blood samples were 
taken from an accused in connection with an offence involving 
sexual assault.  Since no legislative provision authorized this 
seizure and the agreement of the accused had not been obtained 
validly, the supreme court declared the seizure illegal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This decision moved parliament to legislate in this area in 
order to respond to the constitutional requirements set by the 
Supreme Court of Canada.  At the time, Bill C-104 added a section 
entitled <I>Forensic DNA Analysis</I> to the criminal code. 
These provisions have established the conditions and procedure 
to be followed for obtaining a warrant to entitle a Canadian 
peace officer to collect bodily substances for forensic analysis 
purposes from individuals suspected of having committed certain 
serious offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 the government decided to go further in the area of 
collecting bodily substances by introducing Bill C-3.  The bill 
was passed by the House of Commons on September 19, 1998 and the 
new provisions contained in it are to come into effect in June 
2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the future, in addition to the taking of bodily substances 
when an individual is suspected of a crime,  samples of bodily 
substances may be obtained from people already found guilty of 
designated offences in order to include them in the DNA data 
bank. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1025"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, Bill C-3, the DNA Identification Act, created a national 
DNA data bank administered by the RCMP. That bank will include a 
crime index containing genetic information collected at the 
scene of a crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will also include an index containing the genetic 
identification profiles of adults and teenagers convicted of 
specific offences under the criminal code. This will help police 
compare DNA information found at a crime scene with the profiles 
of suspects and convicted offenders, the objective being to find 
the guilty party as quickly as possible, with the smallest 
possible margin for error. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Offences for which the taking of a sample may be authorized are 
called designated offences in the act. These offences are 
included in the criminal code and they are classified in the act 
as primary designated offences or secondary designated offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, for the purpose of the taking of a sample, murder, 
manslaughter and sexual assault are primary designated offences, 
while piracy, assault and dangerous driving are secondary 
designated offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this bill comes into effect, the justice system will have 
an effective tool to solve crimes. Only one group had been left 
out in the previous legislation, namely the military. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-10, which is before us today, complements the legislation 
on the taking and the storing of DNA data. 
There were no reasons to exclude military personnel from the 
system established for civilians, and this is why the Bloc 
Quebecois supports Bill S-10. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now comment on the main amendments to Bill S-10. Bill S-10 
essentially adds to the National Defence Act provisions that 
will authorize a military judge to issue a warrant authorizing 
the collection of bodily substances for DNA testing on military 
personnel who are suspected of having committed a designated 
offence, or who have been found guilty of such an offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the classification of offences for which a sample may be 
authorized is the same as in Bill C-3. 
It was quite rightly decided to include in this list certain 
offences specific to the military and covered under the National 
Defence Act, such as mutiny with violence, endangering a person 
on an aircraft, and negligence in the handling of dangerous 
substances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A military judge may now issue a warrant authorizing the taking 
of a sample in a case where a member of the military is 
suspected of having committed a designated offence.  The 
military judge will issue the warrant if there are reasonable 
grounds to believe that a designated offence has been committed 
and that a bodily substance has been found at the place where 
the offence was committed or on the body of the victim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The results of forensic DNA analysis can be destroyed if the 
sample of the bodily substance taken does not match that 
obtained at the place where the offence was committed, if the 
person is acquitted of the offence, or if the charge is 
withdrawn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, when a member of the military is found guilty of a 
designated offence, the court martial may make an order for the 
taking of a sample in order to include the accused's DNA profile 
in the DNA data bank. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1030"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The distinction between primary and secondary offences is 
relevant here because it determines whether the taking of a 
sample will be ordered.  When a member of the military is found 
guilty of a primary offence, the court martial must order the 
taking of a bodily substance sample. However, if he is found 
guilty of a secondary offence, the court martial is not required 
to make such an order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the latter case, a series of guidelines are given to assist 
the court martial in deciding whether or not to order a sample. 
The court martial must take into account the impact taking a 
sample would have on the privacy and security of the person. 
It can also take into consideration any previous convictions as 
well as the nature and circumstances under which the offence was 
committed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-10 also contains the provision that, when samples of 
bodily substances are ordered, they shall be taken as soon as 
possible, even if there is an appeal.  Results of the DNA 
analysis of bodily substances taken when a member of the Armed 
Forces is convicted of an office are transmitted to the 
Commissioner of the RCMP for entry in the convicted offenders 
index of the national DNA data bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any portions of samples of bodily substances that are not used 
in forensic DNA analysis are also transmitted to the 
Commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I believe it is worth pointing out that the bodily 
substances which can be sampled are hair, saliva and blood.  The 
foregoing were the main points of the new provisions to be added 
to the National Defence Act by Bill S-10 in order to allow the 
sampling of bodily substances for purposes of DNA analysis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-10 goes still further, by also amending the Genetic 
Identification Act and the Criminal Code.  I will therefore 
present the amendments to the act proposed by Bill S-10. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, there is provision for the DNA profiles, as well 
as samples of bodily substances from which the profiles are 
derived, to be used only for law enforcement purposes in 
accordance with this Act, and not for any unauthorized purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This addition provides additional protection to those who have 
had samples of bodily substances taken. 
In fact, these substances may in no case be used to develop a 
psychological profile or for medical research purposes.  The DNA 
Identification Act will help solve crimes, convict the guilty 
and avoid legal errors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must remember however that every person has the right to 
privacy and must be assured that DNA information gathered will 
not be used for experimentation.  The law provides penalties for 
those failing to meet these objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-10 adds to the DNA Identification Act the requirement that 
the Commissioner of the RCMP responsible for administering the 
data bank report to the Solicitor General annually on the 
national DNA data bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provision has already been made for a committee of the Senate or 
the House of Commons or a joint committee to examine the 
application of the law in the five years following its coming 
into effect.  This is why this amendment does not seem crucial 
to me. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1035"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT7"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT7"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1035
<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in the light of the financial problems the RCMP seems 
to be facing these days, this requirement may draw the attention 
of parliamentarians to the problems of implementing the law more 
quickly and, therefore, resolve them right away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However,  Bill S-10 also amends certain provisions of the 
Criminal Code concerning the collection of bodily substances. 
It involves permitting an order for sampling obtained following 
conviction to be executed in another province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take the example of an individual who is convicted and 
sentenced in Quebec of an offence for which the law permits a 
sample to be taken. 
The Quebec judge hands down a sentence and orders the taking of 
a blood sample, to include the DNA profile of the individual in 
the DNA data bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the new provision proposed in Bill S-10, if the individual 
is transferred to a penitentiary located in Ontario before the 
sample is collected, an Ontario judge can confirm the order 
issued in Quebec, thus making it possible to collect the sample 
in Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, it would not be necessary for an Ontario judge 
to receive a new application and to issue a new order. This will 
help avoid having multiple and useless proceedings, thus 
allowing those who work in criminal law to save money and time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second change concerns a criminal code provision allowing 
the crown prosecutor to obtain the authorization to collect 
samples for a designated offence under the act on young 
offenders who are already serving a sentence when the act comes 
into effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are ex parte applications, which means they are submitted 
without the offender being present. Under the current act, these 
applications must be accompanied by a certificate attesting that 
the offender is indeed serving a sentence for a designated 
offence, and a notice must be sent to the offender to inform him 
that the crown will submit the certificate. Since this is an ex 
parte application, the notice of filing is not necessary and 
Bill S-10 removes that obligation, which, in my opinion, is 
something quite acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A third amendment concerns a section in the criminal code 
dealing with the execution of the warrant. 
This section lists the formalities to be observed by a peace 
officer taking a sample of a bodily substance.  One paragraph in 
this section requires the peace officer taking the sample to 
inform the offender that he or she may express a preference as 
to the substance to be sampled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This requirement, if maintained, would place the peace officer 
taking the sample in a dilemma.  If the judge ordered a sample 
of hair and the offender preferred to give a blood sample, the 
peace officer would be unable to enforce the judge's order. 
Bill S-10 repeals this requirement.  I am sure this will avoid 
many impossible situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the fourth amendment, a peace officer taking a sample of a 
bodily substance in accordance with a court order may take 
fingerprints from the person at the same time. 
This is not stipulated in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose is to 
allow a comparison with fingerprints already taken at the time 
of arrest and to ensure solid identification of the offender.  I 
am not convinced of the usefulness of such a procedure.  It 
seems to me to hamper the process, when the fingerprints are 
already available, when the RCMP is overburdened and unable to 
keep up.  Would this be another sign of a lack of communication 
between the various departments?  Time will tell.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, according to the present criminal code, the court does 
not have to issue a sampling order when this is not required for 
application of the law.  This was unclear, and has been replaced 
in Bill S-10 by unequivocally stating that an order shall not be 
made if the national DNA data bank already contains a DNA 
profile of the person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These then are the main changes to the DNA Identification Act 
and the criminal code by Bill S-10.  I would like to close by 
reminding hon. members that the use of DNA has had spectacular 
effects on the lives of certain individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We might refer to the case of David Milgaard, who spend 23 years 
behind bars for a crime he did not commit.  In 1997, he was 
fully exonerated through DNA testing.  The tests made it 
possible to charge a certain Larry Fisher, a repeat sex 
offender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there was the high-profile case of Guy-Paul Morin, who was 
sentenced to life imprisonment in 1992 for a murder that he had 
not committed.  Once again, DNA evidence came to the rescue and 
provided proof that he was not the murderer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Undeniably, the use of DNA evidence can virtually work miracles. 
One cannot help but agree with the results.  The sampling of 
bodily substances for forensic purposes, however, also raises 
some concerns.  Some people fear that holding substances taken 
from individuals may result in the unjust marginalization and 
abuse of certain individuals. 
The profiles must absolutely not be used for such purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why it is imperative for vigilance to be maintained in 
connection with this technology, which is invasive to say the 
least, and has the potential to allow countless information on 
an individual to be obtained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overall the Bloc Quebecois supports Bill S-10, with some 
reservations.  It is pleased with the provision offering 
additional protection against the use of profiles obtained for 
purposes other than those allowed by the law. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK8"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to speak to a bill that is very 
important for the concept of justice in our nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been said by other members of the House, I am very 
disappointed that the bill emanates from the other place and that 
the government has not seen fit to bring forth this legislation 
and move it forward through the proper channels, which would be 
through the House of Commons, so that the bill on this very 
important topic would originate here.  At the same time, I 
commend the hon. senators of the other place who put their time 
and effort into working on this very important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This enactment, as has been indicated, would amend the National 
Defence Act to authorize military judges to issue DNA warrants in 
the investigation of designated offences committed by a person 
who is subject to the code of service discipline.  It also 
authorizes military judges to order military offenders convicted 
of a designated offence to provide samples of bodily substances 
for the purposes of the national DNA data bank.  These 
authorities are similar to those that may be exercised by a 
provincial court judge under the criminal code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This enactment would make related amendments to the DNA 
Identification Act and the criminal code.  The DNA Identification 
Act amendments would allow bodily substances and the DNA profiles 
derived from them, which are taken as a result of an order or 
authorization by a military judge, to be included in the national 
DNA data bank.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The criminal code amendments extend the prohibition against 
unauthorized use of bodily substances and the results of forensic 
DNA analysis to include those obtained under the National Defence 
Act.  In this bill there are other amendments to the criminal 
code which clarify and strengthen the existing regime concerning 
the taking of bodily substances for the purposes of forensic DNA 
analysis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The important thing is that the legislation brings about 
consistency between the justice system for those who are in the 
national defence regime and those who are not.  I have often 
spoken to members of our Canadian forces. I have been saddened to 
hear some of them tell me that quite often in the areas of health 
and justice they feel that they are second class citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One young man talked to me in confidence about the fact that if 
he had a medical problem he did not feel he got the same kind of 
treatment as he would if he were on civvy street so to speak. The 
same sentiment was echoed with respect to the justice system. 
Quite often they saw the justice system as a kangaroo court. 
Because of the rank and file structure of national defence, they 
felt that they were not getting fair justice and that they were 
in a lot of cases facing a kangaroo court. These sentiments were 
expressed to me by members of the Canadian forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any step that can be taken to make the justice system fair for 
all of our citizens is a very important step to take.  Certainly 
this legislation moves in that direction by making sure that 
provisions for DNA collection and sampling are similar across the 
justice system. This is a very important aspect of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill touches on many topics and I will not get into all of 
them.  It outlines the information that is required for taking 
the DNA warrant.  It talks about the various investigative 
procedures, the contents of the information and how this 
information must be filed with the courts, the marshal 
administrator, certain formalities that are involved respecting 
the taking of warrants, the issue of the detention of people, 
privacy, transmission of results to a commissioner and the 
transmission of bodily substances.  All these topics are dealt 
with in the bill, as is the role of the peace officer. These are 
all very important items. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill repeats a lot of things that were mentioned in previous 
legislation, Bill C-3.  This bill has widespread support with the 
law enforcement agencies and the public.  The concern of many 
people in the public is that our justice system bring about 
speedy and just results.  They see the collection of DNA and the 
taking of samples and so forth as being one means to ensure that 
kind of justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall speaking with some law enforcement officers not that 
long ago who were very concerned about this issue.  They wanted 
the support of the members to make sure that appropriate 
legislation was passed to facilitate them with their most 
difficult job of trying to handle the crimes that come before 
them. The bill is certainly a step in that direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP supports the idea of the bill, the collection of DNA via 
warrants.  It is important that due process be built in when this 
kind of system takes place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While there is a great deal of support by police officers and 
members of the public, a number of people also have concerns 
about the bill. Many civil liberties groups have some concerns 
about it.  We recognize that these are valid concerns.  They 
range from economic concerns, the money that could be spent on 
other issues, to ethical concerns of DNA testing itself and the 
probability that the forcible taking of DNA samples may be 
challenged under the charter of rights.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of issues need to be addressed when this legislation 
goes to committee.  Some of these are the indefinite period of 
keeping DNA on file; the inclusion of young offenders in the 
bill; and the issue of who has access to the DNA data bank and 
how the information may be used.  The latter is very important 
because when we are talking about DNA we know that it is very 
peculiar to an individual.  It is a part of the individual's 
identification, a part of that person. There has to be a certain 
amount of privacy and respect for privacy.  We have to be careful 
as to how this information is used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that DNA may be taken even while a case is under appeal 
is another issue which should be discussed in committee and dealt 
with.  The taking of DNA is mandatory upon conviction rather than 
at the discretion of the judiciary or upon request of the 
accused. That is an issue of concern to many people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, there is the fact that a person can be detained for 
what is defined as a reasonable amount of time for the taking of 
samples as opposed to setting a clearly defined period of time. 
What is reasonable in one person's eyes may not necessarily be 
reasonable in another person's eyes.  There should be some kind 
of consideration given to specifying the amount of time involved 
when we are implementing that part of the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also the costs, maintenance and security of the DNA 
bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we in the NDP support this legislation, we are supporting 
it cautiously with the caveat that the issues we have defined and 
talked about are extremely important and must be dealt with. They 
should be dealt with in a way that is going to make sure that we 
are improving the justice system and creating fairness and 
justice for all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>DNA is an extremely valuable and reliable tool for crime 
fighting.  We support this legislation and urge that when the 
bill goes before committee that the very important issues I have 
talked about be discussed and dealt with.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to speak to Bill S-10.  This is an important bill 
which amends the National Defence Act, the DNA Identification Act 
and the criminal code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the bill is to include in the DNA data bank 
created in December 1998 the genetic profiles of offenders 
convicted under the military justice system. At present the DNA 
Identification Act affects only offenders who are convicted by 
the civilian court system and not the military.  It also makes a 
number of minor changes to the existing act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For us it only makes sense that this happen.  It brings the 
military rules more in line with civilian rules and the 
circumstances with which civilians must deal.  It is somewhat in 
line with the recent court decision which determined that 
military officers have the right to refuse questionable 
medication in the same way that civilians do.  The military is 
going to have to treat the DNA process the same way as civilians 
do and we certainly support that.  We support the total merging 
of the two systems into one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years the courts have seen high profile convictions, 
such as that of Paul Bernardo, and eventual acquittals, such as 
that of Guy Paul Morin, due to the use of DNA evidence.  It is 
but the latest tool for law enforcement to use in the protection 
of Canadian society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-10 allows for a more broad, equal use of the DNA data 
bank while being careful not to trample on an individual's 
privacy rights.  It is a good piece of legislation brought about 
by the hard work of the hon. senators.  The PC Party would like 
to commend their efforts by stating that we will be supporting 
Bill S-10 when it comes to voting time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The DNA tool is a powerful tool in conducting criminal 
investigations.  It began as a result of the warrant for taking 
DNA samples, the 1995 criminal code amendment to allow for DNA 
samples to be taken under a warrant to facilitate the conduct of 
certain police investigations and identification of suspects. The 
second stage was Bill C-3, a 1997 bill on DNA identification 
which set the structure and administration for a national DNA 
data bank containing the DNA profiles of those convicted of 
serious criminal offences and of the DNA samples found at the 
scenes of unsolved crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The data bank should be operational by June 2000 and will be 
administered by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police which at 
present administers six forensic laboratories in the country. 
We can only hope that the federal government will come through 
with adequate funding for the DNA data bank.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general proudly stated recently that public safety 
would continue to be the Liberals' number one concern as he 
announced funding of $115 million for the data bank.  Sadly, many 
RCMP experts who will have to use this technology stated they 
needed $280 million for the data bank to combat crime in the 21st 
century.  Once again the Liberal actions were nowhere near the 
Liberal rhetoric and law enforcement has been given short shrift. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998 during the Senate meetings dealing with Bill C-25, an 
act to amend the National Defence Act which was to reform the 
military justice system, the then defence minister and his staff 
were enlightened to the fact that members of the military who 
were charged or convicted under the new National Defence Act 
enforced by the military police would not be subject to the 
provisions of Bill C-3 because it was enforced by the RCMP.  For 
cases of sex offences involving members of the military, the RCMP 
would not have the jurisdiction needed to do the job of taking 
and storing DNA samples.  By law it was supposed to do so but in 
cases of offences only involving the military, it could not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along with this apparent problem, a 1998 Senate report 
concerning the DNA data bank said that such access might affect 
the privacy of Canadians in an unprecedented and unintentional 
way.  In addition the committee believed that the nature of the 
information contained in the proposed data bank necessitated the 
strict monitoring of any process that would allow for the release 
of this information to governments or agencies outside Canada. 
The report recommended that the government strengthen the 
legislation concerning the administration of the DNA data bank 
and the security of the information in that bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To ensure the passage of Bill C-3 the solicitor general 
committed to draft a new bill which is the bill we are talking 
about today.  The bill would allow for, first, the jurisdiction 
of the DNA data bank to be extended to offenders convicted in the 
military justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the commissioner of the RCMP would be required to report 
on the operation of the DNA data bank as part of his annual 
report to the minister and then it would be tabled in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, a provision would be included in the new bill for 
parliamentary review every five years to address the concerns of 
members of the committee about the highly sensitive nature of the 
information contained within the data bank and the rapidity of 
technological change in this field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth and finally, the Senate and the House of Commons 
committees would have the same power to do a five year review as 
provided for in the new bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general then asked that the bill be introduced in 
the Senate before being tabled in the House of Commons so that 
the senators could ensure that all of the points of concern had 
been properly addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments proposed in Bill S-10 include under the National 
Defence Act that the DNA profiles of offenders subject to the 
code of service discipline who are convicted for serious and 
violent offences will be included in the DNA data bank for the 
first time. The code would apply to military personnel, the 
reserves and some civilians who accompany military personnel 
abroad.  As in the case of the existing provisions of the DNA 
Identification Act, Bill S-10 provides that both samples and the 
results of analyses must be transmitted to the commissioner of 
the RCMP and stored in the data bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new bill also provides that the provisions to be included in 
the National Defence Act concerning authorization for taking DNA 
samples, the handling and storage of samples, the results of the 
DNA analyses and the respective privacy will be identical to the 
provisions set out in Bill C-3.

since its establishment by Falconbridge Inc., the Raglan mining 
company has contributed to the economic development of two

Mr. Speaker, we now have scanners that can detect the smallest 
amount of drugs.  When I spotted a scanner at Joyceville 
Penitentiary I knew what it was.  They told me it cost about 
$60,000, but I figured this was a good investment as we could 
confiscate the drugs.  They told me “Oh, no, we do not 
confiscate the drugs.  When we find somebody who brings drugs 
inside the prison we send them back home and then they can try 
again 24 hours later”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is like someone getting caught while driving impaired and 
when they blow over the legal limit the RCMP tell them to turn 
their car around, go home and try again tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also told me there is another choice.  The visitor carrying 
the drugs can still go on with the visit, but must be accompanied 
by a guard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This week's lesson for the solicitor general is, we might reduce 
the drug problem in our prisons if the guards could at least 
confiscate the drugs.  Then they could let the prisoners have 
plenty of time to visit with their buddies while their buddies 
are doing five years for illegal drug smuggling.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As early as March the NDP tried to table a legal opinion that

that the enhanced service provisions of bill 11 violate the 
accessibility principle of medicare because patients can choose 
an enhanced level of service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By upgrading the service to include extras, the service then 
becomes uninsured.  Since speed and quality of service would vary 
according to ability to pay, this creates a two tier system and, 
as such, violates the accessibility principle in exactly the same 
way the Calgary eye clinics violate it, and yet for four years 
the Liberals have not enforced the act on the eye clinics because

the day; freedom brought at a very high price.

who died in a plane crash while on route to Dawson City, Yukon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My first recollections of the bishop and the brother were as a 
young mother with four children in Catholic school.  They were at 
all the assemblies and all the council meetings.  The bishop of 
the Yukon was always smiling, but I think it was his kindness 
that was so moving and always, always felt.

themselves, their diocese, and their country.  Bishop Tom and

Conili scandal is that the minister turned a blind eye to obvious 
wrongdoing.  His own employees alerted him to the fact that 
workers were simply transferred from company A to company B, but 
after a so-called investigation he rejected the only obvious 
conclusion that no jobs had been created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is covering up the investigation report.  Why 
would that be? 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member is wrong again.  The government is not 
covering up any report.  The government undertook a report in 
1977.  I seem to recall being told that it did not show anything 
to act upon at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as the parliamentary secretary said in the House, new 
information was received on Tuesday.  It was reviewed on 
Wednesday, and promptly the government itself referred the 
information to the RCMP.  That shows our intention and our 
commitment to having things done properly. 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Canadian

the report, why do members of the House not have it?  We have 
asked for it.  Why was it not tabled?  It is being covered up and 
the Deputy Prime Minister knows that full well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister must have hired Inspector Clouseau for that 
investigation because it only took a reporter two phone calls to 
have enough evidence to spark a police investigation.  The 
minister was obviously too negligent or incompetent to check out 
the same officials that a reporter did.  Or, did he have his own 
reasons for not investigating properly?  Did the need to show job 
creation and get a fat campaign donation override the—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

is obvious that Inspector Clouseau wrote that question and is the

better to prepare the questions, if not to ask them. 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Canadian

questions that the government is not answering about why clear 
evidence was ignored and $750,000 of Canadian taxpayer money were 
given for job creation when everyone could have told them that 
there were no jobs being created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been a week of shame for the Liberals.  They have once

particular case but the conclusion was not as obvious as the

the way for human resources to cut a cheque for three-quarters of 
a million dollars.  Either the government cannot be trusted to

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should be protecting consumers and our air 
quality and supporting the latest environmental technologies, but 
the responsible departments cannot even agree on their bottom 
line.  Meanwhile, consumers who are already being gouged now face 
shortages at the pump, independent retailers face bankruptcy, and 
gas prices are set to rise by yet another 10 cents a litre.  Why 
are the oil companies and the government holding consumers up for 
ransom?

Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has it all wrong.  We are not in any 
collusion with the oil companies.  In fact, I have to say the 
government generally agrees with the tone of the hon. member's 
concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that the health benefits of what the oil companies 
have been proposing are not good enough.  My colleague, the 
Minister of the Environment, has said quite consistently that the 
oil companies would have to propose something that protected the 
health of Canadians to the same degree or better than the current 
regulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also said that the regulation was about protecting the health 
of Canadians and that any proposal by the oil companies would

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B> Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government and the oil companies have had years to work on 
these problems.  Here were are down to the wire.  Both sides have 
dug in their heels and consumers are supposed to pay for the 
Liberals' incompetence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A litre of gas costs 78 cents in St. John's today.  They can 
little afford it.  Do the Liberals really want to be the ones on 
guard when gas hits $1 in Newfoundland, or will they finally 
agree that it is time to establish a federal energy price review 
commission?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

province of Saskatchewan where his own party has been in power 
for a number of years.  We know that pricing at the retail level 
is entirely within the jurisdiction of the province.  His own 
party refuses to take any such action in the province from which 
he comes.  Why does he not call his own government in the 
province of Saskatchewan and ask it if it wants to regulate 
prices in that province? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, I have to wonder about the tone of a question 
that seems to put emphasis on a clean environment yet still wants 
even cheaper gasoline when Canada, second to the United States, 
has the cheapest gasoline of any developed country.

in western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister extend that $175 million program to rural

Mr. Speaker, my hon. friend well knows that in the budget the 
Minister of Finance announced that there would be $2.65 billion 
over six years for infrastructure, including $600 million 
specifically for national highways.  The province of Nova Scotia 
will certainly have access to those kinds of funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He will also know that the $175 million of new money that I 
announced this week will help farmers in western Canada adjust to 
the new competitive world.  I assume the Conservative Party has 
some cares about western Canada, at least as much as the Liberal 
Party does. 
<P><A NAME="LINK74"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr.

the new economy.  The eastern provinces have to as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps he could explain to me the thought processes when he is 
deciding how to spend the $175 million.  There is a highway in 
Nova Scotia on which 50 people have died in the last six or seven 
years, mostly young people.  We could put the money in that or we 
could put the money in rural highways in western Canada to help 
grain transportation.  How does the minister make the decision to 
put grain transportation over saving lives?

Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is talking about two different

the infrastructure program to deal with the very tragic 
circumstances of Highway 104 in Nova Scotia.  I would ask him to 
talk to his provincial colleague in Nova Scotia to make that a 
priority at the provincial level.

<P><A NAME="LINK137"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in fact it has already said yes to the 
national missile defence system through legislation that has been 
passed and approved by the United States Congress and by the 
President.  It is a matter of the testing that continues to be 
done to perfect the technology, then a final decision on 
deployment will be made at that point in time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No final decision has been made with respect to that.  Canada 
has not been asked.  Certainly the matters that the hon. member 
raises and which have been raised by the foreign affairs minister 
are very legitimate concerns, and concerns that need to be 
addressed. There are other concerns.  The defence, the security 
and the relationship between Canada and the United States must 
also be taken into consideration.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the details of this program are still being worked

compensate western provinces under the WGTA reforms. We will be 
looking at that in the next little while.

is very important because the export of forestry products is 
important for Canada, as it is domestically in Canada, for 
economic and environmental reasons.  It is very important that 
we, as we can, demonstrate to the rest of the world that we

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill S-10, an 
act to amend the National Defence Act, the DNA Identification Act 
and the Criminal Code, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  When debate was interrupted for 
question period, the hon. member for Cumberland—Colchester had 
the floor.  He has 14 minutes remaining for his remarks. 
<P><A NAME="LINK182"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
when Government Orders was interrupted I was talking about the 
amendments that address the taking of DNA samples in the DNA 
Identification Act, which contains a list of designated offences 
which provide that DNA samples may be taken from any individual 
convicted of any one of those offences that I was talking about 
for forensic analysis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The list was divided into two types of offences, primary and 
secondary.  In the case of primary offences, it is mandatory for 
samples to be taken at the time of conviction, except in 
exceptional circumstances.  These offences consist mainly of the 
most serious and violent offences, as well as sex offences, which 
are the offences where DNA evidence may be of the most 
assistance.  The list includes offences such as incest, murder, 
manslaughter, assault with a weapon, causing bodily harm, sexual 
assault, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a secondary offence case it is not mandatory to take a 
sample, so the crown must satisfy the judge that it is in the 
interests of the public safety to take such a sample.  These are 
less serious offences in which DNA analysis cannot always be used 
to solve a crime or prevent other crimes.  They include such 
offences as using explosives, breaking and entering with intent, 
arson, assaulting a peace officer, robbery and hostage taking, 
among others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Bill S-10 this list, which limits the situations in which 
DNA samples may be taken, now applies to members of the military 
who have been convicted of these offences.  The amendments made 
by Bill S-10 do not change the key elements of the DNA 
Identification Act, but rather their objective is to strengthen 
certain principles of the act and to remedy some major failings 
identified by members of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal 
and Constitutional Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provisions of the new act include, first, that the DNA 
profiles of offenders convicted of a designated offence who are 
subject to the Code of Service Discipline will now be included in 
the national DNA data bank.  Second, within five years after the 
act comes into force, a review of the provisions and operation of 
the act will be undertaken by a committee of the Senate, of the 
House of Commons, or of both Houses of Parliament.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, a report on the operations of the data bank will then be 
submitted each year by the commissioner of the RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, there will be a clear statement that DNA profiles and 
samples of bodily substances taken in order to establish DNA 
profiles may be used only for the purposes of the administration 
of the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the implementation of Bill S-10, Bill C-3 will now become 
more effective, as the two pieces of legislation will work 
together harmoniously to improve management of the national DNA 
data bank and ensure a greater respect for Canadians' privacy. 
The DNA data bank is an extremely powerful tool with important 
repercussions for our justice system and our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provisions of Bill S-10 will ensure greater respect for the 
privacy of Canadians by setting very clear guidelines for police 
and the courts regarding the use of DNA profiles in criminal 
investigations.

<P><A NAME="LINK186"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

speak today at second reading of Bill S-3, the 1999 conventions 
implementations bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation puts into force seven new tax treaties that 
Canada has signed recently with Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Algeria, 
Bulgaria, Portugal, Uzbekistan and Jordan.  It also replaces the 
existing convention with Luxembourg and amends Canada's treaty 
with Japan. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These nine tax treaties have been designed with two objectives 
in mind—the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of 
fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before discussing the specifics of this bill, there are a couple 
of points I want to make for the benefit of my hon. colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I want to make it clear to hon. members that Bill S-3 is 
standard, routine legislation. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Proof of this is the fact that all of these treaties, like their 
predecessors, are patterned, to a large extent, on the OECD Model 
Tax Convention, which is accepted by most countries around the 
world.  The provisions in these particular treaties comply fully 
with the international norms that apply to such treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point I want to make at the outset is that, should any 
conflicting matters arise, tax treaty rules take precedence over 
the Income Tax Act.  This ensures that the objectives I just 
mentioned can be reached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me take a moment to put this legislation into context.  One 
of the goals of the 1971 review and overhaul of Canada's income 
tax system was the expansion of our network of tax treaties with 
other countries, a goal that the government has worked hard to 
achieve, and with great success I might add.  At present Canada 
has tax treaties in place with 68 countries, a number that will 
increase to 75 when the treaties in this bill come into force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note that Bill S-3 is the 24th tax treaty 
bill to be introduced in parliament since 1976.  In the past two 
years alone Canada has signed treaties or protocols with 14 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax treaties are particularly important to two ongoing 
government priorities:  tax fairness and the promotion of trade 
and investments.  I will deal first with tax fairness.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since coming to office in 1993, the government has been guided 
by the following principles of tax policy—principles that the 
finance minister recently reaffirmed in the 2000 budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, our approach to tax relief must be fair.  While tax 
reduction must ultimately benefit all Canadians, it must be 
directed first to those who need it the most—middle- and low-income 
earners and especially families with children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, broad-based tax relief should focus initially on personal 
income taxes where the burden is greatest and where Canadian 
taxes are most out of line with our history and with other 
countries. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the business tax system must be internationally 
competitive.  Fourth, broad based tax relief should not be 
financed with borrowed money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members know, the government's fiscal improvements have 
enabled it to begin providing general tax relief, an integral 
element of our strategy for sustained economic growth and an 
improved standard of living and quality of life for all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While tax reduction has begun, the government realizes that more 
needs to be done to lower the overall tax burden and to reform 
the structure of the tax system.  Tax treaties are a part of this 
overall structure and tax fairness demands that no Canadian 
should ever find himself or herself caught in the midst of double 
taxation.  As their full title implies, this is exactly what tax 
treaties work to eliminate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me explain what I mean by double taxation.  International 
double taxation arises as the result of the imposition of 
comparable taxes in two or more jurisdictions on the same taxable 
income in the hands of the same person and for the same period of 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This overlap between source based taxation and residency based 
taxation can result in adverse and unfair consequences for 
taxpayers.  These tax treaties like the ones included in the bill 
avoid double taxation by establishing rules for dividing taxing 
jurisdictions between the country of the taxpayer's residence and 
the country where the income arises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allocating taxing rights not only helps safeguard against double 
taxation but also reduces the burden of compliance to taxpayers 
resident in one country who have only limited contact in the 
other country.  An example of this is the reduction of 
withholding taxes. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Withholding taxes are the taxes countries generally impose on 
income paid to non-residents. This is a subject I will discuss in 
more detail a bit later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other government priority that tax treaties address is the 
promotion of trade and investment. Tax treaties are directly 
related to international trade in goods and services and 
therefore directly impact on Canada's domestic economic 
performance. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their impact is very significant.  Over 40% of Canada's annual 
gross domestic product is tied to exports.  Moreover Canada's 
economic wealth also depends on foreign direct investment as well 
as inflows of information, capital, technology, royalties, 
dividends and interest.  It is obvious then that the tax treaties 
contained in Bill S-3 will benefit Canadian businesses and 
individuals with operations and investments in these nine 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me outline the additional benefits in addition to the 
avoidance of double taxation that I have already mentioned. 
Taxpayers will know that a treaty rate of tax cannot be increased 
without significant advance notice.  The mere existence of these 
tax treaties will foster an atmosphere of certainty and stability 
for investors and traders that will only enhance Canada's 
economic relationship with each country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Annoyance and complexity in the operation of the tax system will 
be reduced as the need to pay tax on certain business profits 
where there is no substantial contact with the other country will 
be eliminated and a mechanism to settle problems encountered by 
taxpayers will be provided. 
Reducing the burden of compliance will encourage more 
international activity which will have a favourable effect on the 
Canadian economy.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I referred to withholding taxes as being one of the solutions to 
the problem of double taxation.  I also mentioned that countries 
usually impose such taxes on income paid to non-residents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's network of tax treaties provides for several reciprocal 
withholding tax rate reductions.  Without a tax treaty or other 
legislated exemption, Canada taxes income paid to non-residents 
at the rate of 25%. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reduced withholding taxes simplify the tax system and make it 
fairer.  The country where the income is generated can withhold 
tax usually at a rate of 5%, 10% or 15% on dividends and 10% in 
the case of interest and royalties.  In some instances royalties 
on copyrights, computer software, patents and know-how are exempt 
at source. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not go into the detailed changes in the tax treaties. 
They are fully outlined in the bill.  They talk about the 
withholding taxes that will apply to these treaties with respect 
to dividends and other types of income.  It is well laid out in 
the act.  In the interest of time I will move to other 
provisions. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The treaties covered in Bill S-3 address other tax treaty issues 
such as capital gains, non-discrimination based on a taxpayer's 
nationality and pensions and annuities paid to non-residents. 
Time does not permit me to discuss all of these provisions in 
detail. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there is one issue in particular I must bring to the 
attention of the House, and that is the proposed rules relating 
to the taxation of emigrants' pre-departure gains.  These rules 
were proposed by the finance minister and will be included in the 
1999 technical amendments bill when it comes before parliament. 
The proposed rules are recognized in the conventions with 
Luxembourg, Portugal, Lebanon and Jordan as they address the 
potential for double taxation in such situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, since the treaties with Uzbekistan, Bulgaria, Algeria 
and Kyrgyzstan were negotiated prior to these rules being 
announced, the proposed migration rules allow Canada to give a 
unilateral foreign tax credit to emigrants until the year 2007. 
This timeframe guarantees that there will be no double taxation 
of pre-departure gains before these treaties have been negotiated 
to take the new rules into account.  Japan has asked to review 
taxpayer migration in future negotiations. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before closing, I would be remiss if I failed to mention another 
benefit to double taxation treaties.  The second objective in 
designing these treaties is the prevention of fiscal evasion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Double taxation treaties encourage the exchange of information 
between revenue authorities to prevent tax evasion or avoidance. 
Sharing information helps revenue authorities identify cases of 
tax evasion or avoidance and act on them. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, I urge my hon. colleagues to support the 
legislation.  The benefits of Bill S-3 are clear. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The thrust of the treaties covered in Bill S-3 is to provide 
equitable solutions to the various taxation problems existing 
between Canada and these nine countries. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These treaties will help to secure Canada's position in the 
increasingly competitive world of international trade and 
investment while ensuring that Canadian tax policy remains 
consistent and Canadians are not subject to double taxation.  Let 
us pass the bill in haste and put it into effect. 
<P><A NAME="LINK187"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, Bill S-3, an act to implement an 
agreement, conventions and protocols between Canada and 
Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Algeria, Bulgaria, Portugal, Uzbekistan, 
Jordan, Japan and Luxembourg, is a good bill in many respects.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It leads to some of the things to which the parliamentary 
secretary made reference.  I have a bit of a problem with the 
bill.  Once again we have a bill before the House which 
originated in the Senate, that unelected, unaccountable body.  I 
find that quite problematic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance has always supported measures that might 
in some way lower the tax burden for Canadians.  Avoidance of 
double taxation would be a very significant result in lowering 
taxes.  The government needs to remove impediments that 
discourage trade and to foreigners coming to Canada for fear of 
double taxation.  The legislation also has the benefit of 
reducing tax avoidance concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One point is very clear.  Canada is very good at collecting 
taxes.  We have almost as many tax collectors, somewhere around 
45,000, as members of our armed forces.  Our armed forces are 
poorly equipped and overtasked.  Our tax collectors can be 
assured that this deterioration will not be allowed to occur in 
their bailiwick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The irony of the legislation is that we had a harmonization of 
taxes in Canada that was almost complete.  The GST and PST were 
rolled into a harmonized sales tax in some jurisdictions but not 
in others.  Other phenomena happened with respect to income tax. 
Quebec has had a separate collection of personal income tax for 
some time.  Other provinces are now moving in that direction.  A 
lot of this is occurring because we cannot lessen Liberal 
dependence on a high appetite for taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were not reassured when the Prime Minister said recently at a 
Liberal convention that the era of tax cuts was over.  Most of us 
had not realized that it had started.  Was he talking about 
Alberta or Ontario?  He surely was not talking about the federal 
arena. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is sad to say that total personal income tax revenues in 
Canada go toward paying the rough equivalent of interest payments 
on the debt.  We have no schedule to pay down that debt and we 
need that discipline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point I would like to make is that income tax treaties 
such as the one we are discussing today contain rules that are 
different from the Income Tax Act.  As such, these treaties need 
enabling legislation.  They need an act of parliament to give the 
treaty precedence over the legislation.  That is ironic when most 
of the treaties our federal government signs require no 
ratification in this place whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some treaties are much more binding and much more consequential 
to the nation as a whole.  The first example that comes to mind 
would be the commitments we made on greenhouse gas emissions at 
Kyoto.  That treaty requires ratification in our neighbour's 
congress and that brings a different discipline to the exercise. 
We do not have that in Canada but we need it.  That will bring a 
whole new discipline to our negotiators and their political 
masters.  We can be sure that when it comes to tax collection, 
however, the Liberals will smooth the path in whatever way is 
required to ensure it happens.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles-A. Perron (Rivière-des-Mille-Îles, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
allow me to say a few words before I start my remarks on Bill 
S-3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Sunday, we will be celebrating Mother's Day across Canada. I 
would like to take this opportunity to wish a happy Mother's Day 
to my mother, my wife, all the mothers in my riding, in Quebec 
and in Canada. Mr. Speaker, I am sure you will join me in 
wishing a happy Mother's Day to your mother. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us now revert to less serious matters, namely Bill S-3. The 
Bloc Quebecois is not opposed to income tax treaties between 
Canada and other countries. 
Therefore, we will support this bill, inasmuch as such treaties 
are aimed at ensuring the just and fair tax treatment of 
persons—I stress this word, which includes private persons and 
corporate persons such as companies, trusts and any aggregate of 
individuals—to encourage trade and investment in those countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although tax conventions avoid double taxation on corporate and 
personal income, in a number of cases they are a source of 
problems and tax evasion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, although the most recent treaties, which are based the 
OECD model, are relatively standard, Canada does have some older 
ones with countries considered tax havens because their 
individual and corporate tax rates are low, or non-existent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By signing tax treaties with these countries that are considered 
tax havens, Canada is turning a blind eye. It treats these 
profits as if they had been taxed at comparable rates abroad and 
does not tax them when they are brought back to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should point out that, since 1992, the auditor general has 
raised this issue on several occasions. I want to give an 
example of these tax havens and what they allow Canadians to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider the case of Canada Steamship Lines. We know 
that, before 1981, that company operated solely in Canada and, 
therefore, paid its fair share of taxes. In 1981, our dear 
Minister of Finance bought CSL and opened subsidiaries in 
Bermuda, Liberia and Barbados. We know that those three 
countries have signed agreements with Canada and are considered 
tax havens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, Liberia is described by people involved in 
international trade as the safest tax haven, the best there is. 
That is nothing to be proud of. Apparently, a Liberian company 
can do anything as it pleases, and in total secrecy. Liberia has 
no tax on profits from shipping. The government of that country 
only requires shipping companies to pay an annual flat amount of 
$350 U.S. That means that profits made in Liberia are subject to 
$350 flat tax and nothing more.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>CSL, Canada Steamship Lines, also has subsidiaries in Bermuda. 
Everyone knows that there is no income tax in Bermuda. A company 
can, through a contract, be exempted of any taxes until the year 
2016. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Barbados, companies are subject to a decreasing local tax, 
from 2.5% down to 1%. So, the higher the amount, the lower the 
tax rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me back to the fact that the government opposite 
should continue to sign tax treaties with countries that are not 
considered to be tax havens. 
It should spend money and be serious, so as to be in a position 
to readjust or change the contracts or agreements already signed 
with tax haven countries, since these involve millions and even 
hundreds of millions of dollars in tax losses for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know how much that government has cut in social transfers to 
the provinces. It could certainly recover these amounts and put 
them back in the transfers to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax treaties establish what is called reciprocal treatment 
between countries with respect to income tax, provided that tax 
rates for Canadian businesses and those in the countries with 
which tax treaties are signed are equivalent or more or less 
comparable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by saying that the Bloc Quebecois will support 
Bill S-3, which seeks to ensure a fair and equitable tax 
treatment for residents and non-residents, and to promote trade 
and investments between the countries that are parties to these 
conventions. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK189"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to speak on Bill S-3. This 
bill lets Canada ratify income tax treaties with Kyrgyzstan, 
Lebanon, Algeria, Bulgaria, Portugal, Uzbekistan and Jordan.  It 
also amends Canada's current treaty with Japan and replaces the 
longstanding treaty with Luxembourg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present Canada is involved in over 60 tax treaties.  These 
treaties set out a framework for taxes on investment income 
flowing between Canada and other countries.  They provide 
mechanisms to avoid double taxation and prevent tax evasion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A tax convention is an agreement between two governments under 
which each government agrees to limit or modify the application 
of its domestic laws in order to avoid double taxation.  Double 
taxation can occur when the same person or business pays 
comparable rates in two or more countries on the same taxable 
income for the same period of time.  For example, double taxation 
would occur if a resident of Japan was taxed in both Canada and 
Japan on dividend income received from a Canadian company. 
Preventing this helps to facilitate investment which is something 
that the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada feels that the 
government should further encourage.  Furthermore, limits on 
withholding taxes in the country where the income is earned are 
established.  Exemption is provided for certain income that would 
otherwise be taxed in the country where it is earned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax treaties also seek to minimize or prevent tax evasion.  They 
deal with tax evasion by providing for the exchange of 
information between tax authorities in the signatory countries. 
In some cases they provide for assistance in collecting taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most treaties are based on the model double taxation convention 
prepared by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and 
Development, otherwise known as OECD countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In regard to Bill C-3, Canada did not previously have treaties 
with Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Bulgaria, Portugal, Uzbekistan and 
Jordan.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment to the treaty with Japan addresses a specific 
issue pertaining to Japanese local enterprise taxes.  Japan in 
turn will exempt Canadian enterprises operating ships or aircraft 
in international traffic provided that Canadian provinces do not 
subject similar Japanese enterprises to similar taxes.  There is 
also a reduction in withholding taxes on inter-company dividends 
to 5%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Changes to the tax treaty with Luxembourg are intended to 
clarify and modernize the convention's wording.  Although the 
Progressive Conservative Party is supportive of new tax treaties 
which help to facilitate and encourage new investment, we do have 
some grave concerns with the human rights abuses committed by 
many of those countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of message are we sending by ratifying such treaties 
with those countries?  For example, Kyrgyzstan, a former Soviet 
republic that gained independence in 1991 when the U.S.S.R. 
collapsed, has been known for its rampant human rights abuses. 
It is located in central Asia and has a population of about 4.5 
million people.  The government has limited its citizens' ability 
to change the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were serious irregularities in the October 1998 
constitutional referendum.  These included widespread cases of 
police abuse and brutality, including arbitrary arrest and 
detention before and after the referendum.  Not a pretty sight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote from the Human Rights Watch.  It said that: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>...the government began with increasing vigour to obstruct the 
formation, registration, and activities of groups of citizens 
intending to organize support of opposition candidates or to 
participate in the upcoming votes as monitors.  Authorities 
charged five prominent opposition leaders with administrative 
offences—the equivalent of misdemeanours—for forming their 
group called the Movement for Honest Elections. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Executive domination of the judiciary limited citizens' rights 
to due process, although the judiciary is undergoing reform. 
Furthermore, the government regularly infringes on freedom of 
speech and of the press.  Authorities at times pressured 
journalists who criticized individual members of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lebanon is another example of a country with dismal human rights 
abuses.  For example, members of the security forces continually 
use excessive force and torture.  There have been hundreds of 
arbitrary arrests and detentions of people who opposed government 
policies.  Lengthy pretrial detention and long delays in trials 
are problems and the courts are subjected to an enormous amount 
of political pressure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government also has limited press freedom by continuing to 
restrict radio and television broadcasting in a discriminatory 
manner.  It has also banned the satellite broadcast of political 
programming.  Discrimination against women and Palestinians and 
violence against women are also problems in Lebanon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Algeria, the security forces are responsible for hundreds of 
disappearances, routinely tortured or otherwise abused detainees, 
and arbitrarily arrested and detained many individuals suspected 
of involvement with armed Islamic groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Human Rights Watch reported that on numerous occasions over the 
last several years, security forces have failed to intervene to 
prevent or halt massacres of civilians by armed groups and 
terrorists.  Armed Islamists continued their widespread campaign 
of insurgency, targeting government officials and families of 
security members, as well as persons whose lifestyles they 
considered to be in conflict with Islamic values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Human Rights Watch summed up the situation nicely by saying that 
the government is involved in, and I quote: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>...the gravest human rights abuses, including extrajudicial 
executions, torture, forced “disappearances”, arbitrary arrest 
and detention, failure to protect the right to life, and 
restrictions on the rights of freedom of expression, association, 
and assembly. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, bombs left in cars, cafes and markets have killed and 
maimed civilians indiscriminately. 
It is estimated that over 7,000 civilians, terrorists and 
security forces have died during the last year of domestic 
turmoil.  Close to 80,000 people have been killed during the last 
seven years alone.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from April 3 consideration of the motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK193"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North—St. Paul, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to address the House on Motion No. 298 put 
forward by the hon. member for Churchill River.  I thank him for 
bringing this matter before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed his concern for the environment and for the high cost of 
energy in some Canadian communities is truly commendable.  I 
would however like to point the hon. member in a new direction to 
achieve his worthy goals. 
Let me explain why I cannot support the motion. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1250"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT34"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT34"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1250
<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I share our government's belief that market forces, not 
government subsidies, should determine energy prices and supply 
without undue government involvement or bothersome regulations. 
This approach has served Canada well over the past decade 
contributing to economic growth, new jobs, increased resource 
royalties for provincial governments, and certainty and stability 
for the energy industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point of my disagreement relates to the question of 
federal-provincial jurisdiction.  Energy distribution systems, 
including natural gas lines, are the responsibility of 
provincially regulated utilities, not the Government of Canada. 
While it is true some provinces have seen fit to financially 
support the expansion of natural gas distribution systems, others 
have not, including notably the hon. member's home province of 
Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I cannot support the motion because it implies that 
natural gas is the only alternative to higher prices and more 
environmentally harmful fossil fuels.  This is simply not the 
case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the past decade communities across Canada have been 
exploring new ways to reduce their dependence on fossil fuels, 
either by using energy more efficiently or by displacing fossil 
fuels with local renewable resources. More and more they are 
looking to community energy systems, networks that link 
environmentally sound sources of energy to space heating loads to 
deliver on two imperatives:  the need for affordable energy and 
the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that are contributing 
to the global problem of climate change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Communities are being supported in this quest by Natural 
Resources Canada of the Government of Canada which for several 
years now has been working hand in hand with the Federation of 
Canadian Municipalities to increase awareness and use of 
community energy systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The results of this collaborative effort have been very 
positive. Interest in community energy systems is on the rise 
across Canada even in areas where natural gas is readily 
available.  In many cases it just makes more sense economically 
and environmentally to develop a community energy system rather 
than to expand our dependence on fossil fuels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Natural Resources Canada encourages efficiency and the use of 
renewable energy at all levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the individual can use current energy sources more 
efficiently by adopting the most efficient furnaces and keeping 
them well maintained and by making buildings more efficient by 
measures such as installing better insulation and more energy 
efficient windows. Individuals may also be able to use renewable 
energy technologies such as solar energy, wind energy or small 
hydro systems. The same principles can be applied at the 
community level where the opportunities are more diverse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By adopting community energy systems, waste fuel from local 
industry or power plants can all be harnessed.  By using these 
types of heat sources, not only are greenhouse gases reduced, but 
community pollution problems can also be reduced. Let me 
elaborate on some real examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some municipalities like Charlottetown, the site of Canada's 
first community energy system, are burning waste wood to produce 
energy.  This not only eliminates a waste disposal problem, it 
also takes advantage of a renewable energy resource. The first 
nations community of Grassy Narrows is using a similar approach, 
in this case burning wood chips harvested by band members.  Other 
communities in the Northwest Territories and Yukon are capturing 
waste heat from diesel generators to provide space heating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another option is to use cogeneration technology to get more out 
of existing fossil fuel systems by combining both heat and power 
production.

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cities of Windsor and Sudbury have community energy systems 
that use this approach.  Many more are jumping on the bandwagon 
because the systems offer benefits that are hard to ignore.  They 
generate jobs through capital investments and keep money in the 
local economy by reducing the need to purchase outside energy. 
Moreover, they can greatly reduce or even eliminate greenhouse 
gas emissions, which is critically important in light of Canada's 
international climate change commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many solutions to the climate change problem and all 
Canadians have a role to play.  It is absolutely essential for 
governments to show leadership, including municipal governments, 
if Canada is to meet its Kyoto target of reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions to 6% below 1990 levels by the period between 2008 and 
2012. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members will also be interested to know that community 
energy system projects are being supported through the technology 
early action measures initiative of the climate change action 
fund which was announced in the 1997 federal budget to move 
Canada forward in addressing climate change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I confirm again that the federal government is very serious 
about meeting this target.  This was made abundantly clear in the 
last federal budget which included more than $600 million to 
further our search for effective climate change solutions, 
including new funding of $125 million for two initiatives to help 
municipalities take action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The green municipal enabling fund is a five year $25 million 
initiative to support cost shared energy audits and feasibility 
studies of projects that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions, 
improve air and water quality, and encourage the sustainable use 
of renewable and non-renewable resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second initiative, the $100 million green municipal 
investment fund, will provide loans and loan guarantees for 
municipal energy efficiency measures, such as building retrofits 
that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Interest money that 
accumulates from the fund will be used to provide grants to 
eligible demonstration projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Together these funds will act as a catalyst for implementing new 
community energy system projects as well as other energy 
efficiency measures.  They are expected to leverage concrete 
investments from municipal, provincial and territorial 
governments as well as the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recent federal budget goes further by including measures to 
make it more attractive for the private sector to become involved 
in community energy systems.  We have the manufacturing and 
processing tax rate reduction, thus lowering the tax rate on 
private businesses on the sale of steam.  We have the capital 
cost allowance for district energy systems and we will be able to 
increase that from 4% to 8%, which means that private companies 
can write off their investment faster.  These new budget 
provisions will add momentum to the growing interest in community 
energy systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, many parts of the country do not have access to 
natural gas networks and the cost of bringing in distribution 
lines is prohibitive.  Community energy systems can ensure more 
efficient and environmentally acceptable use of energy in these 
communities, while helping to keep energy dollars in the local 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other areas, natural gas and electricity infrastructures are 
overloaded.  They simply cannot keep up with the demand. 
Community energy systems can alleviate some of the pressure on 
these networks by producing electricity locally, making 
constructive use of rejected heat that might otherwise be wasted, 
or using local mill wastes to displace space heating from 
electricity, oil or gas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I disagree with the motion but I commend the member for the 
goals and objectives of his motion.  I hope he will discuss the 
initiative of the federal government with the leadership of his 
community and thereby we can go in a common direction.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I appreciate this opportunity to speak and I appreciate your help 
in arranging this time for me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a pleasure to rise to speak to Motion No. 298, put forward 
by the hon. member for Churchill River.  The motion reads as 
follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should provide 
initiatives to deliver natural gas to unserviced regions and 
address environmental concerns and high energy costs. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is extremely important to an area such as my riding 
in northern Nova Scotia.  There are all kinds of small 
communities like Advocate Harbour, Parrsboro, Tatamagouche, 
Pugwash and Stewiacke which are not in the mainstream and will 
not get the benefits of natural gas as pipelines pass through our 
area.  If this initiative were successful, these small 
communities would have access to natural gas and would be treated 
equally, which is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC Party and I support this motion for a number of reasons. 
First, if natural gas is supplied to unserviced areas, then it 
will spur regional economic development, always a challenge in my 
region.  Second, natural gas is considered to be one of the 
cleanest energy sources widely available for public use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increased use of natural gas could help Canada meet its Kyoto 
targets.  In Nova Scotia, we have a very pristine environment. 
It is very clean.  We are very proud of it and we want to 
maintain that environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada signed a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 
6% from 1990 levels by 2010.  However, according to what I have 
been hearing, many of the industrialized nations of the world are 
uncertain about their abilities to meet these commitments, and 
Canada is one of those countries.  Those commitments may have 
been made in good faith, but, by all accounts, Canada is nowhere 
near its targets.  In fact, greenhouse gas emissions are now 
rising in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The dramatic rise in gasoline prices over the past few months 
has shown consumers that dependence on a single energy source 
places people in a very vulnerable position, forcing them to 
either pay the price or forgo the service.  Many people do not 
have any options, however, since they may be dependent on 
gasoline to travel to work or heat their homes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of energy sources available, ranging from 
fuel oil and diesel fuel to hydro-electricity, coal-fired 
electricity and various other sources of energy, all of which can 
be fairly expensive.  If another energy source can help reduce 
costs for industries or consumers, then I would support the 
initiative to help make that source widely available, which is 
exactly what we are talking about here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the east coast there are some exciting projects that are 
developing, supplying natural gas to the area and to the United 
States, and there may be potential for many further developments. 
Only a few months ago the Sable offshore energy project, through 
the Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline, began supplying natural gas 
to buyers in the New England states.  This pipeline goes through 
my riding, from one end to the other.  A natural gas distribution 
franchise has now been awarded to Sempra Atlantic Gas and the 
construction of a natural gas pipeline will allow gas to flow to 
households in the maritime provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By coincidence, I talked to officials from Sempra Gas this 
morning about routes for natural gas and the best way to get it 
to the smaller communities to see if there is some way to address 
those needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The pipeline is expected to service up to 300,000 households and 
25,000 industrial, commercial and institutional customers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also potential natural gas development in other parts 
of Canada, including the far north, Alberta and British Columbia. 
Recent newspaper articles have discussed the exciting prospect 
of natural gas development in the Northwest Territories after a 
10 year moratorium which shut down operations near the Beaufort 
Sea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The prospect of a 1,500 kilometre pipeline to link the Northwest 
Territories with markets in the United States is again under 
consideration.  Future revenue from the $4 billion project makes 
that project attractive to the Northwest Territories government, 
which is willing to provide $100 million of the initial 
investment.  Federal assistance is being sought to provide the 
additional $230 million needed over a four year period to see the 
project established. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like all natural gas projects, the potential for spinoffs to the 
local economy could be great.  Employment, infrastructure, 
training and other benefits would all be a part of the larger 
picture that would see the pipeline become a reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding last year we experienced those spinoffs and 
benefits.  The pipeline company and workers literally brought 
millions of dollars to our area and boosted our economy 
dramatically.

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an estimated six trillion cubic feet of natural gas 
reserves in the Mackenzie Delta region and the co-operation of 
the aboriginal groups in the area who have given their approval 
for development of these reserves means that oil companies are 
again exploring options in the area.  It will be very interesting 
to see how this project develops and the economic spinoffs it 
will provide to the northern region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that natural gas delivery to unserviced regions 
would assist regional economic development and improve the 
overall economic well-being of Canadian communities.  The 
Progressive Conservative Party supports this motion because of 
the need to help remote or rural areas develop economically and 
also assist Canada in working toward meeting its Kyoto targets 
for lower greenhouse gases. 
<P><A NAME="LINK195"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Motion No. 
298 today which states that the government should provide 
initiatives to deliver natural gas to unserviced regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that, although governments can participate in the 
delivery of natural gas or any other product, they cannot and 
should not try to avoid basic and natural market forces.  If a 
government tries to ignore the marketplace it is asking for 
trouble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my community of 30,000 people in Campbell River, one of the 
justifications for bringing in natural gas over a significant 
geographical hurdle was the considerable demand for the 
commodity.  This took much more than the normal business activity 
and the normal residential sector would ordinarily demand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There had been a proposal to build a natural gas/wood waste 
electrical cogeneration plant.  In addition to the usual 
residential and commercial demands, this would be a potential 
major consumer which would have a greater demand than the rest of 
the demand combined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our case the provincial government played a pivotal and 
essential role in ensuring that these two things happened in 
tandem.  Without its involvement and concurrence our community 
would still be without natural gas service.  Essentially it had 
to guarantee, in one form or another, that the cogeneration plant 
would receive approval and would be economic.  That was enough of 
an incentive to ensure that natural gas would come to the 
community.  That is what we could call a win-win situation for 
all parties, and there is always room for a win-win situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also room for governments to regulate rates so that 
averaging would make services and commodities more affordable and 
increase total demand by making them more attractive for more 
consumers.  The provinces and the territories have a very 
important regulatory role to play in these activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of these things are already happening where they are needed, 
where demand is sufficient and where they are not a burden on the 
taxpayer.  They are market sensitive, regionally sensitive and 
they properly allocate our energy resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is opportunity in the north and other remote areas for 
natural gas exploration incentives that would place the source 
close to unserviced communities.  This would create a whole new 
affordability index in terms of servicing remote communities.  In 
these situations there is opportunity for provincial or 
territorial governments to put incentives in place to try to 
expand the servicing area of natural gas distribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Northwest Territories, as an example, has done that very 
thing.  The Inuvik natural gas project came about because in 1998 
the Inuvialuit Petroleum Corporation, AltaGas Services Inc. and 
Enbridge Inc. formed a partnership to bring natural gas from the 
Ikhil field to supply the energy needs of the town of Inuvik. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The territorial Department of Resources, Wildlife and Economic 
Development funded a portion of the initial research for the 
project.  The department provided funding to assist residential 
customers to convert to natural gas heating, with Inuvik Gas Ltd. 
providing matching grants.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is all fairly recent.  Last September the hon. Stephen 
Kakfwi stated in the legislative assembly of the Northwest 
Territories: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This program will result in the reduction of residential energy 
costs in Inuvik.  It also allows the Northwest Territories to 
demonstrate its commitment to the reduction of greenhouse gas 
emissions. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some pretty good things to say on this subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this is an entirely different matter from what this 
private member's motion contemplates today.  This motion 
contemplates federal spending when the jurisdiction is almost 
exclusively provincial or territorial.  In other words, the 
motion contemplates a massive intrusion of federal government 
into provincial and territorial affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a major global natural gas producer and a major 
exporter to the United States.  Canadian companies are at the 
forefront in developing natural gas alternatives to traditional 
engine fuels.  There are many people aware of this, as there has 
been much attention paid to the stock market and publicly traded 
companies recently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Westport Innovations Inc. is a Vancouver based company which is 
traded on the TSE.  There is Calgary based Alternative Fuel 
Systems Inc., which is also publicly traded.  These are two 
companies with which I am somewhat familiar, but I am sure there 
are likely to be other Canadian based companies doing similar 
things.  These companies are working hard to use natural gas as a 
primary fuel, with good results, all of which has a positive 
impact on greenhouse gas emissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Westport Innovations utilized technology developed at the 
University of British Columbia.  It recently bought the rights. 
This is a good example of a public-private partnership doing 
research and development which has worked out very well for all 
parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Environment Canada has publicly recognized the efforts of 
Calgary based Alternative Fuel Systems.  It has developed 
products to convert diesel and gasoline engines to operate on 
cleaner burning natural gas as well.  AFS has received contracts 
to sell its products and technology to Mexico and India, enabling 
fleets of vehicles in those countries to be converted to run on 
natural gas.  This is all very good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The major environmental benefit, of course, is that this reduces 
vehicular pollutants.  The economic benefits come from the 
reduced fuel cost, as well as reduced maintenance costs and 
increased engine life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Natural gas is an excellent fuel source and Canada is blessed 
with large reserves.  It is very important that we do it right in 
terms of how we develop, distribute, market and creatively manage 
this legacy.  I cannot support this private member's motion, 
which is without vision and does not respect federal, provincial 
and territorial— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I listened to the member from the Canadian Alliance talk 
about unfettered market forces, that he does not support this 
motion and so on.  I would seek unanimous consent to ask the 
member a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  If we could let the 
hon. member finish, before we go to the next speaker, we could do 
it at that time, in what would be a pseudo-question and comment 
period.  Why do we not try that instead of interrupting him in 
the middle of debate.  That would not be something we would 
normally do.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  There is not much we 
cannot do through unanimous consent.  Is there unanimous consent 
for the member for Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre to put a question 
to the member for Vancouver Island North? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  No. 
<P><A NAME="LINK196"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the consideration from those members.  I am 
disappointed that the Liberal member from Ottawa, the upper 
valley, did not provide unanimous consent because I wanted to ask 
the member for Vancouver Island North a very important question 
about the Liberals, which I will get to momentarily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to stand in the House and support the motion 
by my colleague, the member for Churchill River, who is also an 
NDP member, which reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should provide 
initiatives to deliver natural gas to unserviced regions and 
address environmental concerns and high energy costs. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the Conservative members' views.  They support this 
motion because they too are concerned about the kind of high 
energy costs that Canadians are being subjected to without any 
kind of justification or regulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the point of having some kind of regulatory agency for 
energy, we have a regulatory agency for communications.  We have 
over 150 television stations.  We have hundreds of radio 
stations. We have all kinds of opportunities to choose whatever 
kind of communications that we like in terms of getting 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lo and behold, we have the CRTC which regulates communications 
in the country.  We also have a regulatory board for 
transportation.  There are many different ways to travel in this 
country and we have a regulatory board for transportation, the 
Canadian Transportation Agency.  I support those regulatory 
boards because we need some sense of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the underpinning of our economy is energy.  Everything 
we do, everything we consume and everything we move, whether we 
are going to work or it is the goods and services we buy, they 
all depend on the price of energy, be it natural gas, home 
heating fuel, diesel fuel or gasoline.  There is no backbone in 
the Canadian Alliance Party or the Liberal Party to support a 
regulatory agency for what is controlled basically by four or 
five companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have communications controls by the CRTC for hundreds of 
companies.  We have transportation controls for many companies, 
50 or 100 companies at least.  I do not know the number.  We have 
four or five companies that establish the price of energy and 
there is no regulation.  They set up the market forces to 
determine what the prices are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member for Vancouver Island North and the member for 
Winnipeg North—St. Paul, if we have regulatory agencies for all 
of these other things where there is pure competition, why not 
for the underpinning of our economy, which is the price of 
energy? Explain that one to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe the reason they do not support that is that they get 
substantial political contributions from the oil companies.  Lo 
and behold, surprise, surprise, surprise.  Bite my tongue.  I do 
not understand what the reason could be.  They receive hundreds 
of thousands of dollars a year from the energy companies to do 
what?  To let the market forces determine the price of energy. 
This is the underpinning of our economy.  This is not a chocolate 
bar.  If we do not like the price of a chocolate bar for dessert 
we can buy some other candy, a piece of cake, a piece of pie, or 
we can choose not to have dessert.  With energy, we cannot 
choose.  We have to buy energy to get to work, whether it is a 
bus pass, or driving a car or a taxi.  We need energy to pay for 
transporting of goods on rail, air or by ground.  Everything we 
do depends on that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The price of energy in this country has gone up so high, at 
record levels right now, because the government has no backbone 
to regulate the gas industry, be it natural gas, diesel fuel or 
home heating fuel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think Canadians see through these two parties.  The former 
leader of the Reform Party, who was a former oil company 
executive, would not let this band of MPs from western Canada, 
the Alliance members, talk about any kind of regulation for 
energy because he was a former energy executive.   Guess who 
primarily funds the Reform Party and the Canadian Alliance Party? 
Primarily it is the energy companies, followed by the banks and 
then Conrad Black.  Conrad Black gives these guys more money.  He 
is actually becoming a bigger backer of the Reform Party than the 
energy companies, which is really incredible because the energy 
companies have lots of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to return specifically to this motion because it is 
really important.  I have been dealing specifically with the 
motion in a very embracing way.  We have heard the Liberal member 
from Winnipeg North—St. Paul talk about market forces.  Given 
that kind of approach, members should know that government is 
obligated to provide a balance in the country.  Everyone knows 
that the big corporations and the wealthy families run our 
economy.  However, the government's obligation is to provide a 
balance to defend people and to provide a balance to the economic 
powers that run our country.   This is not the approach of 
Liberals or the Alliance members.  All they want to do is move 
the weights and the power more to the wealthy who run our economy 
now.  That is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we asked anybody whether or not the government should be the 
balance to the powers that run our economy, or to give them move 
power, I would venture to say that 90% would say that government 
should be the balance.   That is why we are asking in this 
particular motion that government provide some balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not all members live in the northern parts of Canada.  I have 
worked in northern Saskatchewan for many years.  The price to 
install a natural gas outlet in rural Saskatchewan, in the 
southern part of the province, can go as high as $30,000 for one 
installation. That is just the cost of the pipeline to the home 
of the rancher or the farmer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They think the market forces should determine this.  If they are 
so committed to Kyoto and the environmental concerns of millions 
of Canadians, they would say that natural gas would reduce the 
greenhouse effect and reduce greenhouse emissions, and that we 
should move to natural gas so that people living on farms in 
northern Canada could to use natural gas, which is our resource, 
to reduce emissions and provide a more cost efficient way to heat 
their homes, farms and businesses rather than burning home 
heating fuel which has higher emissions in terms of pollution. We 
could eliminate the use of wood or coal.  Many people in northern 
Canada use wood or coal.  These have a very high degree of 
pollutants compared to natural gas which is a very clean burning 
element. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to outline as well that we, as a country, have a very 
large reserve of natural gas and other forms of energy such oil, 
coal, and so on.   We are viewed as a net exporter of these 
resources; that is, we produce more oil and natural gas than we 
consume so we export the difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Minister of Industry stood in the House this morning in 
question period and said that we are the second lowest gas priced 
country in the industrialized world, I think he needs a little 
correction here, because he is dead wrong.  Of all of the 
exporting nations in the world, Canada has the highest priced 
gasoline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not talking about the U.S.A. which is a net importer.  It 
has to import more oil because it consumes more than it produces. 
Therefore, its prices are reasonably lower than ours when you 
compare them.  Its prices should be higher than ours because we 
export our surplus to the Unites States.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at countries like Mexico, Venezuela, Argentina, the 
Middle Eastern countries, all the countries that are exporters of 
oil and natural gas, we see that their gasoline prices are way 
below ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the Minister of Industry stands corrected.  If he was 
here I think he would feel quite ashamed that he said that Canada 
had the second lowest price of gasoline.  I wanted to correct the 
record on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a motion that is a very important motion.  My colleague, 
the member for Churchill River, has told his constituents and 
northern Canadians that they are important, that they are part of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All we are asking in this motion is for the Liberal government 
and the Alliance Party to recognize that we do have people living 
in northern Canada who are Canadians too.  We should provide a 
balance in terms of programs to these people who live there, 
settled in this country and defend our north in terms of 
environmental and other situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the Liberal member for commending my colleague from 
Churchill River on his natural gas motion.  I also think it is a 
very important motion.  However, the member stated that the 
federal government does not subsidize natural gas pipelines.  He 
may not be aware but the federal government does indeed 
participate in the industrial natural gas initiatives through the 
tax regime.  I wanted to correct the record on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask all members to reconsider our duty and obligation as 
members of parliament to defend and support people living in 
northern Canada.  I ask them to revisit this motion and consider 
supporting it so that we can bring northern Canadians into our 
country as equal citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I would like to obtain unanimous consent to ask the member who 
just spoke a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The member for 
Vancouver Island North has asked for the unanimous consent of the 
House to put a question to the member for Regina—Lumsden—Lake 
Centre.  Is there unanimous consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  One question and one 
response and the Speaker will determine the length. 
<P><A NAME="LINK197"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it will be short and sweet.  The 
motion that we have before us and the speech that the member for 
Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre gave relate to two different things. 
One is about incentives.  The member was talking a lot to do 
with price controls and other things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I read into that, is the member saying that price controls 
and incentives are the same thing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon:</B>  Mr. Speaker, first, the motion says 
that the government should provide initiatives, not 
incentives—so I think he is not clear on that—to deliver 
natural gas to unserviced regions and address environmental 
concerns and high energy costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I maintain that the speech I gave was more than relevant. It is 
really important to have a regulatory agency so that the most 
important element in our economy, the underpinning of our economy 
which is energy, should deserve some kind of regulation, as does 
communications through the CRTC and as does transportation 
through the Canadian Transportation Agency.  Why not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe my response should end with a question to the member.  Why 
does he believe that the CTA and the CRTC should exist but not an 
energy price review commission? 
<P><A NAME="LINK198"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am indeed delighted to participate in this very 
worthwhile debate today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the hon. member for Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, 
I am a little surprised.  Although he does speak very eloquently 
and very passionately for the cause in which he believes, I 
noticed that throughout his dissertation he kept using the word 
“think” many times:  I think, I think, I think. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It might have been a relative of his for all I know, but there 
was a famous king called Solomon who at one time said that people 
use thought or thinking only to conceal their actions and speech 
to conceal their thoughts.  I know it is a little twist in the 
words but I am just trying to figure out what he is trying to 
conceal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that perhaps he is trying to conceal the real agenda 
of his party, which is basically debt driven.  His party is of 
the belief that the government, the taxpayer of Canada, should, 
in all circumstances, financially support any institution that 
they believe in their own minds—and I disagree with him on 
that—the people need.  I personally believe that people need to 
take responsibility for their actions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take this opportunity to address the motion on 
natural gas put forth by the hon. member for Churchill River.  It 
is the government's current energy policy not to fund any 
megaprojects but to leave the competitive market to decide what 
goes forward and what does not.  It is our firm belief that we 
should not be an interventionist government with regard to 
megaprojects.  This is one reason, among a few others, that we 
have difficulty in supporting the hon. member's motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the hon. member's desire to ensure an 
environmentally friendly and secure energy source for his region, 
but that is what Canada's approach to the complex, evolving 
global challenge of climate change is all about.  We see it as a 
challenge that is both environmental and economic.  We on this 
side of the House look upon challenges as opportunities in work 
clothes to work for the benefit of each and every Canadian, to 
work for the benefit of each and every province; in other words, 
the opportunity to do the right thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Kyoto protocol in December 1997 reaffirmed the conviction 
among some 160 countries that six commonly identified greenhouse 
gases were accumulating in the world's atmosphere to the point 
that they must be altering the earth's climate.  The majority of 
global scientific opinion suggests that human conduct is 
certainly contributing to climate change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The protocol involved a commitment on the part of the 
industrialized world to bring down greenhouse gas emissions. This 
action is much like an insurance policy against those future 
risks.  Just like buying insurance, we cannot get the coverage we 
should have had after the fact.  We must do it before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For Canada our Kyoto target is minus six, to get our emissions 
down during the period between 2008 and 2012 to 6% below the 
level they were in 1990.  We are well on our way to that, but it 
will not be easy.  Nothing in the world is easy, unless we are 
constantly critics.  If we constantly criticize, that is easy, 
but when we have to make definitive decisions that will have a 
positive impact on the people of Canada things on occasion are 
not easy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member opposite spoke about Canada's northern climate. 
I come from northern Ontario so I know of what she speaks, but 
Canada's northern climate, vast distances, increasing population, 
increasing production, and its resource based and energy 
intensive economy make our commitment to that road much more 
difficult to meet.  If we can carry on from this point forward 
with no changes and business as usual, by the year 2010 Canada's 
greenhouse gas emissions will rise to about 26% above our Kyoto 
target. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We obviously have to slow down that trajectory, to flatten it 
out and then turn it downward to reach our target within this 
decade.  Where we will be when it ends will depend on how astute 
we are at managing our domestic change challenges in relation to 
the rest of the world.  We need to marry strong environmental 
performance with a strong economy.  The Canadian public wants to 
have both together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About 79% of human made GHG emissions are related to the way we 
produce, transport and consume energy.  The more energy efficient 
we become, the fewer emissions we generate.  The more we achieve 
in this regard through greater energy efficiency, the less we 
will have to rely on other means to satisfy our Kyoto protocol 
commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Across our entire national economy in every sector, in every 
individual behaviour, each and every one of us must achieve 
energy efficient excellence.  From a government policy 
perspective we have thus far used a variety of tools to achieve 
greater energy efficiency.  For one thing we have tried to 
improve our own operations within the Government of Canada.  We 
are on track to slash our emissions by more than 20% and to reach 
that goal by the year 2005. 
People can make informed decisions about energy use.  The 
EnerGuide label for equipment, houses and vehicles is a great 
illustration.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third tool is peer group challenges like the VCR, the 
voluntary challenge registry, where industries and business 
pledge to improve their performances and report their progress in 
a tangible and public way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are incentives like Natural Resources Canada commercial 
buildings program which puts up some cash to encourage developers 
and builders to incorporate best practices from the ground up. 
Hand in hand with these tools we must achieve a faster rate of 
new technology development and timely deployment of new 
technology.  This is the key underpinning for everyone's use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider an innovation like Solarwall, for example, 
developed by Conserval Engineering.  It is a new solar based 
energy saving technique for large building ventilation systems. 
It requires modestly increased one time construction costs, but 
it generates significant savings in ongoing operating costs year 
after year.  We get a more efficient ventilation system, fewer 
greenhouse gas emissions and a growing market across North 
American and around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must build our capacity for efficiency innovation in 
government labs, in academic institutions and in the private 
sector.  We must put that knowledge to work quickly in the 
marketplace.  Federally we are moving in that direction, 
specifically in each of the last four federal budgets.  Within 
Natural Resources Canada about $100 million each year are 
normally invested in research for climate change solutions. Other 
federal departments add another $50 million annually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line in all this is that there is no one simple 
answer.  Regretfully, although I have great respect and 
admiration for my colleague from Churchill, I cannot support the 
hon. member's motion because it advocates a megaproject policy 
for energy which has been replaced, as we speak, by a successful, 
competitive market based approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The focus of the Government of Canada's policy is on providing 
environmentally friendly and secure energy solutions for all 
Canadians.  This approach encourages energy solutions through 
initiatives that address the complex global challenge.  In my 
great riding of Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke I have two of 
Canada's greatest diversified energy producers: a hydro electric 
dam at des-Joachims and the Atomic Energy of Canada Laboratories 
in Chalk River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to be the very best.  We need to be the most 
intelligent, innovative and efficient at finding, developing, 
producing, delivering, consuming and exporting the world's most 
sophisticated and diversified energy products, skills, services 
and science.  The Liberal government will be very ambitious in 
this regard. The upper Ottawa valley is leading the way.  My 
great riding of Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke is at the cutting 
edge.  I believe that is a worthy Canadian ambition for one and 
all. 
<P><A NAME="LINK199"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, like 
the member for Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre I am pleased to rise 
today to support the member for Churchill River, Saskatchewan, 
and his Motion No. 298.  I will quote this very important motion 
which bears repeating: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should provide 
initiatives to deliver natural gas to unserviced regions and 
address environmental concerns and high energy costs. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We live in a very wonderful country.  Canada is truly fortunate 
to have an abundant energy resource that heats our homes and 
fuels our economy.  Natural gas is the cleanest burning and most 
acceptable carbon energy source. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian natural gas is distributed to more than four million 
customers in six provinces, providing 26% of Canada's energy 
needs.  This number is increasing each year.  Canada's natural 
gas exports are experiencing exponential growth.  Canada as a 
whole is experiencing this tremendous growth in the natural gas 
area. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1340"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same there are entire regions of our country that do not 
have access to natural gas.  This places many communities at an 
economic disadvantage.  We can look at many of the communities in 
the northern part of our country and many places in our rural 
settings that are at a disadvantage.  Natural gas presents an 
opportunity for economic development in unserviced regions where 
expensive fuel costs are a prohibitive factor in establishing and 
maintaining or expanding an enterprise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When my colleague from Churchill River was debating the motion 
earlier this year, he put forth the need for a national vision in 
relation to natural gas distribution.  He provided for the House 
examples of the social and economic benefits that natural gas 
distribution could bring to unserviced regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada, as I have said, is blessed with tremendous natural gas 
resources.  Canada is the world's third largest producer and this 
resource sector is growing tremendously.  Fuelling this growth 
and royalty revenue is United States demand which some day may 
place Canada's domestic needs at risk.  It is a bit disheartening 
to think that many natural resources in Canada are quite often 
placed at risk because of the needs and the demands of other 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember growing up as a young lad in Nova Scotia always 
wondering why I could buy an Annapolis Valley apple much cheaper 
in other parts of Canada than I could in Nova Scotia where those 
apples are grown.  This is something we have to give 
consideration to and it is something that becomes very relevant 
when we look at the whole issue of natural gas production. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Nova Scotia right now we are in the process of producing 
natural gas.  What is happening?  This gas is being shipped to 
the eastern states.  They are getting the gas even before many 
residents in Nova Scotia who live right around where the gas is 
being produced.  We have to think carefully when we talk about 
the issue of having a national vision for natural resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When my NDP colleague from Winnipeg Centre was speaking to the 
motion he described the fact that gas discoveries were once 
considered a curse while drilling for oil.  This is something 
that is interesting too.  If while they were drilling for oil 
they discovered a pocket of gas it was a nuisance factor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think with respect to the fishing industry how many years ago 
lobster, mussels and certain shellfish were considered to be junk 
food.  I hear many stories from some of the older people who talk 
about how they were embarrassed to go to school with a lobster 
sandwich.  They would much rather have had a peanut butter 
sandwich in the old days.  Nowadays we know that the priorities 
have shifted, the resources are looked at differently and lobster 
is considered a delicacy.  Mussels are considered a very fancy 
meal in restaurants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon:</B>  What does lobster cost? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle:</B>  I cannot say what it costs, but 
certainly lobster is now considered a priority over and above 
peanut butter sandwiches for many people.  This is how our 
resources change.  We have to keep abreast of this vision and 
look at how we can make sure that each part of the country 
benefits from the wealth that exists in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite often we look at the idea of oil and gas companies 
competing.  This is another factor.  The whole issue of 
competition becomes an issue that sometimes prevents us from 
getting the best use of our resources.  I can recall that when 
the Sable project was being discussed many oil companies came to 
me and lobbied me by trying to point that they were very 
concerned about the oil industry, that their prices remain 
competitive, remain as cheap as or perhaps even cheaper than 
natural gas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is almost like one company is afraid that if business goes 
from one place it will lose out.  It is unfortunate that we 
cannot learn to work together and to realize that because one 
thing is taking place which may enhance the lives of individuals 
does not necessarily rule out the other industry continuing to 
have a meaningful place in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Often we see it as one against the other and we always compete. 
This is the problem we see particularly in the province of Nova 
Scotia.  For far too long the island of Cape Breton has suffered 
because governments have felt that everything had to be focused 
in the Halifax area.  We did not spread things out across our 
province.  We quite often got the feeling that if something went 
to one area it took away from another area instead of seeing the 
idea that if we could facilitate another place growing as one 
place grows then everyone benefits from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what we need to talk about when we look at natural gas 
servicing Canada as a whole and providing opportunities for those 
unserviced regions. 
We need a real vision in this regard.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP proposes a national vision not a chequebook reference. 
The Liberals talk about megaprojects as if it is going to cost 
all kinds of money.  I submit that it costs more money not to 
have a vision, not to set initiatives and not to try to challenge 
these resources in the most useful way for everybody. That is 
what costs money.  When people start looking at it from a 
political perspective saying they will do only what is best for 
their region, that costs money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP proposes a national vision.  We are not proposing to 
sponsor every pipeline or every branch line so every home is 
linked to a cleaner energy source. We are asking the House to 
recognize that there are unserviced regions in the country. There 
are pockets of inefficiency and high energy costs.  We are asking 
the House to recognize these disparities and to correct them so 
the situation across Canada is not one of have and have not 
regions.  Let us increase the potential for all parts of the 
country to share in the resources and to take advantage of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have to think in terms of community input. Far too often 
we forget about getting input from the communities that are most 
affected.  Quite often we forget about the people who have been 
the natural stewards of these resources for years and years.  I 
am talking about our aboriginal communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many times resources have been developed in these communities 
but the benefits of the development bypass the very communities 
in which the resource is located.  This is quite often the case 
in the north and various remote areas.  We must have a vision 
that is going to take into account the realities of this great 
country and try to bring about equal opportunity for all to share 
in the benefits that we have in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak for a moment on the issue of emissions. 
The Progressive Conservative member for South Shore spoke in 
support of the motion.  The member cited Canada's faltering 
commitment to the Kyoto protocol to address climate change and 
greenhouse gases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The emissions continue to rise while the Liberal government 
hides from its responsibilities to provide leadership and 
direction and to ensure a cleaner environment and reduced energy 
costs for future generations. 
It is important that we think in terms of what we are doing for 
the future generation, for our young people.  We must ensure the 
kind of environment for them that will enhance their future 
rather than create more difficulties for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the NDP agree that not enough is being done by the Liberal 
government to meet our international obligations to reverse the 
damage to our atmosphere which all nations and people share.  The 
recent budget announcement will provide further studies and some 
immediate action but falls short of the current opportunities we 
could be implementing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP thinks this is a very important motion which is worthy 
of consideration and support by all members of the House. 
Ultimately by providing these kinds of opportunities right across 
Canada, we will be enhancing not only the future of our young 
people, but we will be providing economic growth and incentives
