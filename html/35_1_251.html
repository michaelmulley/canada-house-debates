	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
this first and new day for Canada I present a petition that has been 
circulating all across Canada. It has been signed by a number of 
Canadians from Uxbridge, Ontario.
<P>
	The petitioners draw to the attention of the House that managing 
the family home and caring for preschool children is an honourable 
profession which has not been recognized for its value to our 
society. They also state the Income Tax Act discriminates against 
families that make the choice to provide care in the home to 
preschool children, the disabled, the chronically ill and the aged.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to pursue 
initiatives to eliminate tax discrimination against families that 
decide to provide care in the home for preschool children, the 
disabled, the chronically ill and the aged.

	The petitioners call for a list of nine different things they would

	The House proceeded to the consideration of Bill C-102, an act 
to amend the Customs Act and the Customs Tariff and to make 
related and consequential amendments to other acts, as reported 
(with amendments) from the committee.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Christine Stewart (for the Minister of Finance)</B> moved

<P>
	(Motion agreed to.)
<P>

<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Stewart (for the Minister of Finance, Lib.)</B> moved that 
the bill be read the third time and passed.
<P>
<B>(1010 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have the privilege of beginning the 
debate on Bill C-102 at third reading.
<P>
	I also have the privilege of being the first member of the 
government to speak to the House of Commons after the rather 
monumental day we had yesterday. I welcome back all members 
who participated in the referendum. We will continue to debate the 
affairs of the country, as we have in the past, with the good spirit 
and dignity all members bring to the House.
<P>
	Although we have felt very passionately and very differently in 
the last while about things, I expect we will continue to work 
together both in committee and in the House in the spirit of 
improvement during the coming months.
<P>
	Before I get into the details of Bill C-102 I will discuss the 
efforts of the government, particularly the Minister of the Finance 
and the Department of Finance. I will discuss the improvements we 
are making in the framework to deal with questions of tariff and 
trade.
<P>
	In a general way governments have during the last 10 years 
endeavoured to change our relationship with our major trading 
partners. That resulted in the emergence of the free trade 
agreement, which was a bitterly contested piece of legislation, 
becoming law in 1988. In its original form it caused a great deal of 
dislocation in Canadian industry and trade. Since we have formed 
the government we have made some improvements to it and we 
now find it an effective framework for dealing in North American 
trade.
<P>
	At the same time the less controversial agreement, NAFTA, 
which was as influential as the free trade agreement, came into 
effect and set out our trading relationship with Mexico.
<P>
	More important, from a strategic point of view the underlying 
agreements around the world have changed in the last few years. I 
am referring to the World Trade Organization. Canada is now 
participating in a whole new regime which affects its trading 
relationships. It affects the way disputes are being adjudicated. It 
changes the specifics of tariff regimes on a whole number of 
commodities traded around the world. It is a giant step forward and 
Canada has played a leading role.
<P>
	As Canada fights for its interest on the world trade stage, it 
continues to have a number of disputes with its trading partners and 
it must aggressively pursue its interests. I do not have to tell the 
House how frequently the minister of agriculture has had to defend 
and promote the interests of western Canadian grain farmers 
against, in the trade sense, parochial interests from the United 
States.
<P>
	Similarly, the fur trade industry is threatened by new European 
regulations which will come into effect on January 1. The 
regulations will affect a large part of the fur export business. 
However, the Canadian government, under the leadership of the 
Minister for International Trade, has been very aggressive in 
pursuing changes to these regulations which will not only achieve 
the environmental and humane aspects of the fur trade business but 
also promote our access to markets.
<P>
	We have suggested a number of worthwhile compromises. 
Leaders from Europe have visited Canada. They have visited our 
research stations. They have visited the north to speak with the 
aboriginal people involved in the fur trade.
<P>
<B>(1015 )</B>
<P>
	In the end we are going to find ourselves with an agreement 
which is more acceptable to everyone. Failing that, we are willing 
to take the dispute to the World Trade Organization. Although not 
many cases have been made before it since its inception, this is a 
very strong case and we can promote it.
<P>
	Returning to the ground level of the World Trade Organization, 
we are constantly going through our regulations and trade structure 
to make sure that our own rules and regulations conform to the 
international situation. For example, our tariffs have to be reviewed 
constantly.
<P>
	There is a new trade structure in Canada for arbitrating among 
different industries. The CITT is an example of a trade tribunal 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15991"> 15991 </A></B>
<P>
which allows different industries to present their case as to what the 
levels of tariffs should be. This too is a new dispute mechanism 
which we think in the overall picture is a very important change. It 
gives the different sectors of the economy a  chance to make a plea 
in front of a regulatory body instead of simply making a plea to the 
political leaders, which at times because of the specific interest and 
regional needs can be a very difficult act for industries to get 
involved in. Everybody prefers the new tribunal to the old system. 
It is dealing with its first case and we will see how that proceeds.
<P>
	Bill C-102 fits into the good government theme we have been 
pursuing since forming the government two years ago this month. 
The red book, the speech from the throne and the budget each year 
have promoted this good government theme. We believe we are 
bringing to Canadians changes that are necessary, essential and 
desired to make for a more effective and productive economy.
<P>
	A number of the measures in Bill C-102 build on the 
government's review of Canada's tariff regime announced in the 
1994 budget. They are designed to ensure that Canada remains a 
favourable location for producing goods for investment, and also 
that Canadian businesses, including small businesses, are placed in 
a better position to profit from Canada's free trade agreements.
<P>
	Certain amendments we put into this piece of legislation, for 
example, the enhancements to duty deferral programs and tariff 
reductions on manufacturing inputs, are designed to lower input 
costs for businesses and to maintain and enhance the 
competitiveness of Canadian businesses in Canadian and world 
markets. In addition, Bill C-102 provides for a number of technical 
changes to simplify, clarify and modernize the customs tariff and 
its administration, and to make it easier and less costly for business 
to access tariff relief programs.
<P>
	The amendments to facilitate the processing of travellers at the 
border will allow Revenue Canada to focus on other important 
border issues such as smuggling and the processing of growing 
commercial imports. I want to speak to that for a moment. One of 
the aggravations which has developed in Canada and U.S. trade is 
not among big corporations or even in our professional 
relationships, but is as individuals travelling back and forth.
<P>
	It has been a long time since these regulations have been 
modernized. We are trying to achieve a threshold so that people 
returning from the United States, Europe, Asia, or from wherever 
they have travelled can bring back a reasonable amount of goods, 
taking into account what the prices really are around the world, 
without having to go through a lot of processing and trying to 
figure out how to cook the books and evade the law.
<P>
	More important, for those people who conform to the law or who 
are regular travellers, new systems have been designed for them to 
cross the border without having the complication of constantly 
being checked and having to fill out forms. Those people are in the 
vast majority of Canadians who, when they travel back and forth 
between  the United States and Canada, do so without complication 
and without any idea of trying to avoid the border crossings. 
Allowing them to go through quickly allows Revenue Canada 
without any increase in resources to concentrate on contraband and 
smuggling. The large movement of goods or services costs the 
Canadian economy money. They are illegal and we want to keep 
them out of the country.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	These are productive changes which reinforce the message that 
good government is responsive to Canadians. Good government 
means providing an easy way for people to carry out their activities 
in accordance with the law at the same time creating a more 
effective police force to deal with those who are not conforming 
with the law.
<P>
	These changes were first announced last June and have been well 
received at border crossings. Canadian businesses have not felt any 
undue hardship because of the increased limits for travellers. In the 
coming winter travel season Canadians will appreciate the ability 
to get across the border more quickly. We anticipate an increasing 
tourist industry for Canadians travelling abroad, but more 
important of people coming to Canada. It is incumbent upon us to 
make sure that people can come into this country easily.
<P>
	Vancouver is emerging as a very important port in the cruise 
industry. We have done things to facilitate the movement of people 
into Vancouver and on to those ships without tying them up for 
hours at border crossings or causing unnecessary procedural 
delays.
<P>
	I commend the Minister of National Revenue, who is from 
British Columbia, for many of these initiatives. He was very proud 
when the Prime Minister visited the Vancouver airport a couple of 
weeks ago. That visit by the Prime Minister showed that real 
progress has been made in the area of customs and customs 
administration.
<P>
	I look forward to input from members of the House who have 
border crossings in their ridings on whether they now find the 
service more effective. As the service is extended from coast to 
coast over the next few years, more and more Canadians will 
appreciate the changes being made by the Minister of National 
Revenue. He has the full support of the government. I again 
commend him on his initiatives and activities.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As hon. members may recall, this bill provides for important 
customs changes that will give Canadian businesses and 
individuals significant benefits in the long term.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15992"> 15992 </A></B>
<P>
	These changes include the improvement of Canada's duty 
referral programs and the reduction of tariffs on a broad range of 
inputs. They will allow us to improve the competitiveness of 
Canadian industry by lowering the cost of inputs.
<P>
	The proposed amendments will also update travellers' 
exemptions. Together with other measures proposed in this bill, 
this provision will facilitate the processing of travellers' 
applications and allow customs officers to focus on the real 
priorities such as processing the ever increasing number of trade 
imports and the fight against smuggling.
<P>
	The bill also contains technical amendments that will make the 
customs system more effective. The customs value of imported 
goods is one of the most important changes in this regard.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The finance committee had a very good hearing last week. 
Several witnesses met with us and talked about questions of 
evaluation and answered questions on how to proceed with the law. 
Tariff is an obscure part of what we do, yet for many businesses and 
many professionals who specialize in tariff regulations it is at the 
heart of the way they do business. Witnesses came forward and told 
us that we should be doing some things in a different way. The 
government was very interested and listened to them.
<P>
<B>(1025 )</B>
<P>
	The Canadian Manufacturers' Association had a dispute over 
how we were dealing with tariff relief on certain types of items. 
After a couple of years it was found that if the government decided 
that a particular item, for example a table in the manufacturing 
process, was not tariff free, a tariff could be retroactively applied. 
The committee broke at that point and national revenue officials 
went up to my office with officials from the Canadian 
Manufacturers' Association. Consequently, they came down with 
an amendment and changes were made.
<P>
	That is an example of being very productive in the way we 
approach legislation. It is very respectful of the finance committee.
<P>
	Under the leadership of the member for Willowdale, the finance 
committee has to deal with many different subjects. It is probably 
one of the busiest committees in the House of Commons. The areas 
under consideration can be very complex. For example, in the last 
two weeks we have had to deal with the tax treaty with the United 
States in Bill S-9. We have had to deal with tax treaties with other 
countries in Bill C-105. We have had to deal with measures from 
the budget in Bill C-90. We have had to deal with Bill C-103, which 
is the change in the Income Tax Act to deal with split runs, and we 
have had to deal with Bill C-102.
<P>
	All of this shows the wide range of interests members on the 
committee have and their ability to respond relatively quickly to 
the needs of a minister, whether it is  the finance minister, the 
national revenue minister, the minister of citizenship, or the 
heritage minister. We have had to respond very quickly and find out 
what the subject issues are.
<P>
	When witnesses come forward and say to be careful, that we may 
be making a mistake, it is not taken lightly. As I alluded to a 
moment ago in the case mentioned earlier, changes were made on 
the spot when we saw that the association had a very good point.
<P>
	One of the issues I wish to address is to make sure that the 
witnesses understood why we did what we did and why some 
changes were not made. The major amendment we introduced in 
committee was to reduce tariffs on manufacturing imports which 
would remove the competitive disadvantage that currently burdens 
Canadian manufacturers, since the U.S. tariff rates on average are 
lower than ours.
<P>
	Another amendment enhanced, streamlined and consolidated 
Canada's duty deferral programs resulting in lower import costs for 
Canadian exports, easier access to programs by small and medium 
size business and the greater ability of Canadian regions to 
compete with U.S. free trade zones.
<P>
	The most controversial area is the free trade zones. I will take a 
minute to explain what our strategy is because members opposite 
probably have local businesses, chambers of commerce, or 
whatever coming forward and saying they want a free trade zone. 
They want to have an area where economic activity can take place 
in a zone free from any taxes or taxes shared by others.
<P>
	Free trade zones have emerged around the world as a very 
important tool in reducing costs for businesses in dealing with their 
markets. The Europeans have one in Amsterdam around the 
airport. The Americans have several. There has been a 
longstanding demand for a free trade zone in Canada.
<P>
	Going back to the early 1960s, at least for the last 35 years we 
have made a number of efforts to target slow growth areas in this 
country and create some regional development programs. It goes 
back to the days of DRIE and DREE. There was also the tax credit 
which was eliminated last year. There have been a number of them.
<P>
	The premise behind this is the isolation of slow growth areas 
from faster growing ones, or in the vocabulary of economists, it is 
red pencilling certain areas. We can isolate by census track those 
areas in greatest need. We can take the lowest 5 per cent and say 
that arbitrarily we are going to help everybody who lives in the 
lowest 5 per cent of the census track as judged by unemployment 
rates, industrialization and population size. There are many factors 
you can take into account. What we have found over the years is 
that the schemes have not been particularly effective. Despite 35 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15993"> 15993 </A></B>
<P>
years of pretty extensive programming and tax measures, there has 
been limited  success in attracting industries that are of long term 
benefit to a region.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	Since we have formed the government the three regional 
development agencies we have, Western Economic Development, 
FORD-Q, and ACOA, have all changed their strategy as a result of 
the recognition of what I have just said, which is that many of our 
programs have been ineffective. This applies not only to the federal 
government but also to the provincial governments, who are 
hesitant to get involved aggressively in regional development 
schemes because frequently they do not work and they cost the 
taxpayer a lot of money.
<P>
	Having said that, we still have to find very effective ways to 
increase the capabilities of our industries for producing goods and 
transferring products from the Canadian market into our export 
markets, because that is our fastest growing area. Those who have 
been watching the economy very closely for the last 18 months 
know full well that the growth in our economy has come from 
exports and not from the domestic market. We still have a reluctant 
consumer. We have a very low demand on residential housing and 
commercial real estate is also slow. But we do have, to our credit, a 
very productive and fast growing export oriented industry, which 
crosses several different sectors: manufacturing, agriculture, 
professional services, and the automobile industry. We have been 
very effective in developing expertise that takes us around the 
world.
<P>
	A number of cities have come to us, Calgary being one, as well 
as some suburbs just outside of Vancouver, Halifax, and my own 
town of Winnipeg. They have told us that if we help them form a 
free trade zone they will create an atmosphere to increase exports, 
particularly into the American market. Winnipeg, through a new 
group called Winnport, has been very aggressively profiling 
Winnipeg as a transfer point from the European markets to 
Southeast Asia and into the United States. I wish the leaders in this 
campaign every success in achieving its new ambitions.
<P>
	They have come to us and asked why we do not help them form a 
free trade zone. They ask us why we do not take the area around the 
Calgary or Winnipeg airports and create a zone that eliminates 
tariff barriers and eliminates, in some cases in the United States, 
labour laws and eliminates a whole number of regulations to make 
it easier to export to the United States.
<P>
	We are very much interested in exports to the United States. 
However, at the federal government level we are preoccupied with 
enhancing the activities related to the export and not to the 
geographical region. That goes back to what I said at the beginning. 
The regional development strategies where we delineate zones for 
special treatment tend to be counterproductive. If we take an area 
around an airport, what do we do with the  exporter who is two 
blocks away? Do we want the exporter to take down his plant and 
move it, or do we want to move the zone over two blocks? If we 
move the zone two blocks, what about the architectural firm that 
happens to be three blocks away? Do we move the zone three 
blocks away?
<P>
	We have said to the municipal governments, the local 
development authorities, the chambers of commerce, and the 
provincial governments that have come forward with different 
schemes that they should be organizing and stacking up the 
provincial and municipal programs they want. If they want as a 
municipal government to zone certain lands and create an 
industrial park to encourage exporters to move there and show 
them the benefit of being close to an airport or a truck route or 
whatever mode of transportation is important, they should go 
ahead.
<P>
	What we are interested in is a tariff regime that makes it 
effective for exporters to get their goods out of Canada and into the 
United States. We will change the rules and regulations to make it 
as easy as possible for businesses to import the products, the goods 
and the services they are working with to make whatever it is they 
are exporting so they can get them to market with minimal 
intrusion by the federal government.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	We think Bill C-102 goes a long way to accomplishing that goal. 
We believe that once this becomes law exporters will find 
themselves within a regime that makes it a much easier decision to 
get into export markets, a much easier decision to import certain 
inputs and to add value into export to the United States, Europe or 
Southeast Asia.
<P>
	I must say we have deliberately decided not to get into free trade 
zones as traditionally defined at the local level but instead to tell 
people who come to us with proposals to do what they think has to 
be done in their local market and we will be there to support them 
through a national regime that will facilitate the activity, which will 
in turn create jobs and economic growth.
<P>
	This returns us to one of the premises of our government, which 
is that good government means the production of jobs and the 
expansion of the economy. The heart and soul of this government 
rests on the jobs and economic growth strategy. We feel that Bill 
C-102 contributes directly to this.
<P>
	The legislation also contains changes to improve the operation of 
the customs tariff and the Customs Act. One of the most important 
changes concerns the valuation provision of the Customs Act. This 
valuation provision was discussed by many witnesses before the 
finance committee last week.
<P>
	It is essential that the rules for determining value for duty not be 
vulnerable to manipulation or abuse. Otherwise, both government 
revenues and fair  competition would be put at risk. In this 
connection, Bill C-102 contains provisions that would clarify 
existing Canadian valuation policy. That policy is that the basis for 
duty and tax assessment on imported goods is the price payable by 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15994"> 15994 </A></B>
<P>
the Canadian purchaser. This is consistent with the thrust of the 
GATT-WTO valuation code and with NAFTA. Furthermore, the 
provision corrects problems that have also been identified and 
corrected by some of our major trading partners. These measures 
will ensure that Canadian producers receive the full protection they 
are entitled to under Canadian legislation.
<P>
	In going through the bill in more detail, I would like to begin 
with the enhancements to Canada's duty deferral program. Duty 
deferral programs defer or relieve custom duties on imported goods 
that are subsequently exported but are awaiting formal entry into 
Canada. Bill C-102 will enhance, streamline, and consolidate 
Canada's existing duty deferral programs: duty drawback, inward 
processing, and bonded warehousing. This is what I was speaking 
to a few minutes ago when I talked about our response to the free 
trade zone concept.
<P>
	The results will be lower costs for Canada's exports, programs 
that are more easily accessible by small and medium sized 
business, and greater ability of Canadian regions to compete with 
U.S. free trade zones. This will help attract and keep investment in 
our country.
<P>
	I would like to emphasize that the changes are a result of 
extensive consultation with business and they enjoy broad industry 
and regional support. I can attest that after consultations with us, 
people in Winnipeg see more clearly what we are trying to do and 
how their plan fits in with our own plans.
<P>
	Related to the enhancement of duty deferral is a change to the 
Access to Information Act. This change would protect the 
confidentiality of taxpayer information provided by the importing 
community under the Customs Act, customs tariff, and the Special 
Import Measures Act.
<P>
	This is very important for businesses dealing with us. Most 
export sectors are very competitive. If individual manufacturers 
feel that the information about their companies is being shared, 
they will not participate. At the same time, we desperately need 
their participation in order to have a better understanding of what is 
happening.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	Another major amendment proposed in the legislation is a 
reduction of tariffs on a wide range of manufacturing inputs. The 
amendment is also directed toward the relief of customs duties on 
manufacturing inputs so that our producers can compete more 
effectively. This amendment will enhance the competitiveness of 
Canadian producers both at home and internationally.
<P>
	In essence, we will be removing the competitive disadvantage 
that currently burdens Canadian manufacturers vis-à-vis their 
American counterparts by reducing tariffs on some 1,500 tariff 
items covering manufacturing inputs to more competitive levels, 
generally to the levels seen in the United States. Since the United 
States is our major trading partner, we feel it is very important that 
our levels be consistent with their levels to maximize the 
competitive advantage of our industries.
<P>
	The competitive problem is mitigated by the fact that exporters 
are entitled to receive full reimbursement of their input duties 
through duty drawback. However, as of January 1, 1996, existing 
duty drawback entitlements on exports to the U.S. will become 
more restricted under the NAFTA commitment. Therefore, to 
ensure that Canadian manufacturers enjoy the full benefit of 
Canada's free trade agreements we must bring our tariffs on 
imported inputs to more competitive levels. The 1,500 input tariff 
reductions I have referred to account for over $2.5 billion in 
dutiable trade.
<P>
	Another important amendment is the increase in duty 
exemptions for Canadians travelling abroad. This is a simple 
updating measure, which brings Canada's exemptions into line 
with those of its major trading partners. The bill will raise the 
levels of exemption as follows: to $50 from $20 after a 24-hour 
absence; to $200 from $100 after 48 hours; and to $500 from $300 
after seven days, with the once a year limit being dropped. I would 
remind hon. members that the new travellers exemptions are 
already operating without disruption.
<P>
	A further measure in the bill will also help to streamline Canada 
Customs clearance procedures for travellers under what is known 
as a basket tariff item basis. Under this measure the government is 
proposing to replace the thousands of existing categories of goods 
with as few as 12 categories. That will be of great benefit to 
Canadians travelling abroad.
<P>
	In addition to the amendments I have discussed, the bill contains 
a number of other changes of a largely technical or housekeeping 
nature. Most will serve to clarify the intent of existing customs and 
tariff provisions. Perhaps the most important of these deals with the 
value for duty of imported goods, also known as the valuation 
provisions of the Customs Act. It is essential that the rules for 
determining value for duty not be subject to any manipulation or 
abuse. Otherwise, revenue and fair competition will be put at risk.
<P>
	Bill C-102 contains provisions that clarify our existing practices 
in dealing with valuation. It is founded on the concept that the price 
paid or payable should form the basis for assessing duty and taxes 
on these imported goods. The valuation policies and practices that 
are used by Revenue Canada are in fact the same ones that have 
been in place since the introduction of the GATT  valuation code in 
the mid-1980s. The amendment to the valuation provisions of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15995"> 15995 </A></B>
<P>
Customs Act will provide protection to Canadian businesses as 
envisioned by the legislation.
<P>
	Members of the House will recall that Bill C-102 contains one 
tariff rate increase, which I would like to explain. The British 
preferential tariff is being withdrawn from certain rubber footwear, 
thereby restoring the 20 per cent most favoured nation tariff rate. 
Former British preferential trade imports will now compete on the 
same basis as other foreign suppliers. At the same time the bill 
allows for future improvements to preferential tariff treatment for 
the world's poorest developing countries.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	Finally, several motions were introduced in committee, as I 
mentioned before, and amendments were made. For the most part 
the changes introduced by the government were minor technical 
amendments, but I should like to make sure the House fully 
understands what these were.
<P>
	Of note, one amendment responds to requests from Canadian 
importers by allowing rubber footwear in transit to Canada on June 
13, 1995, when legislation was introduced eliminating the British 
preferential tariff free rate, to take advantage of the lower tariff free 
rate rather than being subjected to the 20 per cent most favoured 
nation tariff rate.
<P>
	The other notable amendment responds to the concerns 
expressed by the Canadian Chamber of Commerce about the 
proposal to shorten the filing time limit for remissions under the 
machine program. The government has responded to this concern 
by allowing importers up to four years to claim remissions on 
goods eligible for duty free treatment under the program.
<P>
	To sum up the specifics of the act, the legislation is about 
improved competitiveness, increased exports and enhanced 
employment prospects for Canadians. Bill C-102 will help to 
promote the continuing good health of Canada's large and vital 
export sector. It will help Canada maximize the benefits we enjoy 
under the free trade agreements and the changes proposed in the 
legislation will be welcomed by the great majority of Canadians 
affected by them.
<P>
	As I alluded to when I began my speech, this is a piece of 
legislation which may not have high visibility to average 
Canadians. However, to those who are working in manufacturing 
plants, to those travelling abroad regularly and to those seeking the 
most competitive position because their own jobs are at stake, this 
is one of the most important steps the government is taking in its 
workaday fashion, its desire to make the economy work and its 
desire to get government right. This is one of the steps we are 
taking that we think will in the end provide for greater job security 
and the enhancement of our export sector.
<P>
	It is with a great deal of pride I presented the bill to the House 
and have taken it through committee. It will make a major 
contribution to the Canadian economy. For that reason I call on 
members of the House to support the bill and to see to its speedy 
passage.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I find very telling the fact that the first bill to be 
considered following yesterday's referendum in Quebec would 
deal with free trade.
<P>
	I think that, in a way, this confirms the opinion held by the vast 
majority of Quebecers, who believed that a partnership with the 
rest of Canada would have been possible. We received some 
confirmation this morning that the federal government wishes to 
improve Canada's economic relations with the U.S. through a bill 
which basically makes trade between these countries easier. This is 
very telling indeed, in my opinion.
<P>
	Quebecers were the first to agree with and to support free trade 
between Canada and the United States and Mexico. I would just 
add this must go on, and efforts must be made to ensure that 
markets are available regardless of which political entities 
maintain them.
<P>
	This is true particularly for small business, which accounts for 
80 per cent of all job creation taking place in Quebec andwhich has 
taken on the challenge of dealing with the U.S. and Mexico.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	However, free trade must definitely be seen as more than merely 
an economic issue. The challenge for all Quebecers and Canadians 
is not to trash the social programs that may have been put in place 
in Canada. It seems to me that this is a major consideration.
<P>
	We will not win this free trade battle with the U.S. and Mexico 
by trying to make anything and everything match the American 
standard. I think that this will be particularly true in what lies ahead 
in terms of social program reform, including unemployment 
insurance and old age pensions. The government of Canada will 
come up with options which it will hopefully table soon and which 
will enable us to determine whether it has given in to the American 
competition and agreed to play their game or else decided to play 
the free trade game while preserving the values unique to our 
society.
<P>
	Accelerated harmonization will only result in making people 
increasingly dependent on the economy, and increasingly the poor 
will be going after a limited number of available jobs and, while 
their employability will increase, their incomes, wages, gains may 
not follow. In examining a free trade bill, therefore, it is important 
to look at the other side as well, that is to say the larger system 
within which free trade will take place.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15996"> 15996 </A></B>
<P>
	So, yes to free trade, because we want trade conditions to be 
eased. We even made a proposal in that sense in the  referendum, 
but it was not accepted by a majority of Quebecers. I think that 
Quebecers should be congratulated for respecting the democratic 
choice made. Results such as those of yesterday are not necessarily 
easy for anyone to take, considering that, for each group of 100 
Quebecers, a single person made the difference.
<P>
	This is true regardless of who that person is. I am not trying to 
make individual distinctions, but the fact is-and you people know 
what it is in terms of winning an election-that, for each group of 
100 persons, a single Quebecer made the scale tip in favour of one 
side instead of the other. And you know what it is to win elections. 
Given that result, people deserve a great deal of respect for 
accepting, as they did in Quebec, such a close decision. This is not 
to say that we are giving up on our ideals. Certainly not.
<P>
	I want to point out another aspect of the bill which, I feel, is 
important for both Quebec and Canada, namely the need to ensure 
that the protection granted to the cultural industry will not be 
jeopardized by a bill such as this one, which concerns goods, 
including a number of concrete physical products. But there is the 
whole cultural sector, where we will have to maintain such 
protection. Indeed, the debate that just took place in Quebec made 
Canada realize how fragile its position was in relation to its U.S. 
neighbour. We have to take a close look at some of this.
<P>
	In fact, Americans should perhaps go back to their history books. 
It seems as though they decided, in recent days, that no change was 
better than good change. Sometimes, such things lead to short term 
victories. However, from a medium term perspective, these issues 
must be looked at more closely, since Canada, as a member of 
NAFTA, will, in the future, be confronted with such situations, 
particularly when countries with economies comparable to that of 
Chile, likely the next nation to join NAFTA, will become partners 
under that agreement. We will have to show the same respect 
towards these countries, whether they are big or small, and treat 
them for what they are.
<P>
	When the free trade agreement was signed, we were told that it 
would take a few years before we started to notice a real difference. 
It is important to understand that this bill allows for an increase in 
the value of goods travellers can bring back, to bring these values 
in line with those set by our main trading partners.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	With this bill, therefore, there will be concrete action to increase 
exchanges, to facilitate exchanges. It must be looked at from that 
point of view, and it will be seen that there may be some 
advantages to Quebec consumers, Canadian consumers and 
American consumers once these regulations are in place. At the 
same time, we must ensure that our economy and our industrial 
structure are capable of following suit.
<P>
	There is one aspect which the representative of the government 
has not addressed, but which I would like to present. This type of
<P>
bill will impact upon the regions of Quebec and of Canada, because 
a change in customs operations can impact upon the number of 
customs offices there will be in a region, for instance, and on how 
businesses will be serviced.
<P>
	I refer in this connection to clause 12 of the new bill, which 
states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Goods, other than goods of a prescribed class, that have not been removed from a 
customs office, sufferance warehouse or duty free shop within such period of time as 
may be prescribed may be deposited by an officer in a place of safe-keeping 
designated by the Minister for that purpose.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That may seem gobbledygook to some, but basically the 
question that must be asked about this clause is the following: in 
regions where customs offices are closed, will that mean 
businesses are farther from their markets and therefore less able to 
service them?
<P>
	We must ensure that proper choices will be made. There have 
been some indications that have not been very reassuring. For 
example, the government has announced the closure of five 
customs offices in eastern Quebec. There will, in fact, be none 
further east than Quebec City. The offices that used to be located in 
Rivière-du-Loup and Rimouski, the customs officers right out to 
the Gaspe, all those will be done away with. Can these changes be 
made without negative impact, ensuring that acts such as this one 
will facilitate trade?
<P>
	These are matters that must be looked into. Care must be taken to 
ensure that the thing is done correctly. This is not really a change in 
legislation but rather a change in administrative application, and 
the government must ensure that its decisions do not penalize the 
regions.
<P>
	I have already stated, and return to the point here, that it is highly 
significant in my opinion that the intent of this bill is to concretize 
aspects of the partnership between Canada and the U.S. 
Throughout the entire referendum campaign we were told many 
times that the same thing is not possible between Quebec and 
Canada. It is very surprising, but at the same time very instructive, 
to come upon it again this morning, and this allows those who have 
taken part in the debate to see where the reality of that debate lay.
<P>
	How can we arrange things in this area to avoid the bureaucratic 
complications experienced in a number of other sectors? Bill C-102 
contains many technical elements, such as clause 5, according to 
which the operator of a sufferance warehouse or duty-free shop:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-shall keep in Canada such records-and shall, where an officer so requests, make 
them available to the officer.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In other words, customs brokers, the people who work in this 
sector, have a list of items-a, b, c, d, e, f, and up to i-which they 
are supposed to keep, so that in future they can produce them for 
the federal administration.  From this side, it looks much like an 
approach that was often used in the seventies, which I think is not 
necessarily a good idea for the future, because when I talk to 
owners of small and medium size businesses today and ask them 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15997"> 15997 </A></B>
<P>
what the government, any government, could do to improve the 
situation, I get two answers.
<P>
	The first one may seem rather surprising but is understandable. 
They suggest reducing subsidies but doing it across the board. The 
second one is about bureaucracy.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
	I am referring to the administrative paper burden for small and 
medium size businesses, which means they often have to spend as 
much time on paperwork as much larger companies in order to 
meet government regulations. In this bill we will have to ensure 
that what customs is asked to do-maintain certain records-can 
be done efficiently without getting into the same problems we had 
with the GST, for instance.
<P>
	Finally, Bill C-102 implements the effects of the free trade 
agreement. Generally speaking, we applaud the fact that these 
regulations will be put in place, since they will provide for a better 
trade relationship between the signatories to the free trade 
agreement, which is what everyone wants.
<P>
	Quebecers were among the instigators of the Canada-U.S. Free 
Trade Agreement, and they certainly hope this will continue. At the 
same time, we should remember that countries do not necessarily 
need very big borders to engage in mutually beneficial trade. In the 
nineteenth century, wars were fought to expand a country's 
territory and thus its domestic markets. As we approach the end of 
the twentieth century, we realize this can be done quite differently 
by simply letting everyone engage in trade, thus shifting the scene 
from the battlefield to the economy, where people who can produce 
goods and have a stable society are able to survive and contribute to 
economic development. That is where we are today. And we hope 
this trend will continue, but always with due respect for the society 
we represent.
<P>
	One sector that is more or less affected by this bill and that I 
would like to bring to your attention is the dairy industry. Farmers 
in Quebec and five other provinces in Canada signed an agreement 
in the summer of 1995 which covers milk supply management 
throughout their territory. This agreement is valid at least until 
1999, when it will be reassessed. It could last much longer. The 
producers reached this agreement in an effort to face the 
approaching challenge as the GATT agreements reduce tariffs in 
milk sales, which are of concern to them. We have set them a big 
challenge. Fortunately, however, they have already faced major 
challenges.
<P>
	This sector, which is more vulnerable than a number of others 
requiring appropriate measures, needs all the  support it can get to 
face the upcoming changes. One is the partnership between Quebec 
and five other provinces in Canada to deal with this market and also 
to obtain appropriate forms of assistance from government in 
increasing productivity to enable producers to provide a better 
quality product and to make products available in market niches 
that do not yet perhaps exist. One example of this is biological milk 
production.
<P>
	It is important to be able to forecast developments in industry, in 
agriculture and in other sectors and to see what is coming up. When 
we do not look to the future, we find ourselves in situations like the 
one in Quebec last week, when, suddenly, the federal government 
realized the situation in Quebec was special. After two years of 
saying that Quebec's situation in Canada would be resolved 
through good federal government, it had the lesson of its life, 
discovering that, in both Quebec and Canada, the problems were 
more than just economic. There are problems of distribution of 
wealth and of balance between the country's two founding peoples. 
The message from Quebecers was very clear: without specific 
change and without concrete proposals acknowledging Quebec's 
place in this country, in the very near future, a majority of 
Quebecers could well decide to change the situation.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	That was an example involving the agricultural sector. One thing 
Parliament could do, in my opinion, through the standing 
committee on agriculture, for example, would be to ensure the 
options chosen for the coming years, and I am referring not just to 
the term of the present agreement, which lasts until 1999, but 
afterwards, are relevant to the priorities of the sector.
<P>
	There is a sort of distress at the fact that there are fewer and 
fewer actual people farming, but their economic impact remains as 
strong. We must not fall into the trap of elected officials who say 
that, if fewer people are involved, less concern is warranted. We 
must instead establish the sensitivity of this sector and the type of 
action to be taken. This latest referendum campaign was a real 
revelation for me: it showed me the importance of these situations 
and of knowing how to plan ahead. I think we may be judged on 
this as well.
<P>
	Bill C-102 is therefore here to be passed. The Bloc Quebecois 
feels it should be passed. It will support it. It also feels that bills 
enabling us to make progress should always be passed. We should 
never be afraid of change for its own sake.
<P>
	When change is appropriate, we have to know how to integrate 
it. When it is not appropriate, we can reject it. However, when it is 
appropriate, we have to know how to integrate it. This is very 
important and, much later, this is how what we have done will be 
judged.
<P>
	I would therefore like to say in conclusion that Quebec put its 
faith in free trade and will continue to do so, so  that, in the end, 
each of the characteristics of the components of North America, 
and of the francophone people in particular, may be recognized, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15998"> 15998 </A></B>
<P>
validated and further developed, and Bill C-102 is one tool that will 
help in this regard.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Reform Party also supports the bill. I will be speaking 
generally in favour of the bill.
<P>
	Before I do I will take a couple of seconds and speak to the 
referendum last night. We cannot pretend that did not happen. We 
cannot just walk into this place and sleepwalk toward a further 
disaster.
<P>
	The hon. parliamentary secretary had a few words to preface his 
remarks and my blood ran cold when I listened. The essence of 
what he said was that he welcomed those people who were trying to 
break up our country over the last couple of years and last night. He 
welcomed them back and said let us go on as before, working in 
committee and working in the House.
<P>
	For the last two years going on before meant that every single 
word that came out of the mouth of the Bloc, and everyone in the 
Chamber knows it, has been to one direction, toward building a 
preface for the referendum last night for taking Quebec out of 
Confederation.
<P>
	We cannot go on as before. We have to turn the page on that. We 
have to go forward. We have had 30 years, all of my adult life, of 
trying to appease people who would break up the country. It is time 
to stop it. All it does is foster a festering tribalism evidenced last 
night for everyone to see on national television by the premier of 
Quebec.
<P>
	If we pretend this kind of thing is not going on in our country we 
are not doing our jobs as representatives of the people who sent us 
here. Tribalism is tribalism and that is what we have had here for 
the last two years. Let us not call it anything else.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	To the embarrassment of Canadians everywhere, because the 
vast majority of Liberals opposite are afraid to confront the Bloc, to 
confront this tribalism, to confront these people, at every 
opportunity they get they back away. They back away from it in 
committee. They back away from it in all opportunities in the 
House. We recognize the Bloc has 53 seats. It is the loyal 
opposition but that does not need to be the way the House operates.
<P>
	No one has ever retreated to victory. One does not build a 
country on appeasement. One builds a country on the values we 
share. We should be defining the values that make up Canadianism 
to be a Canadian. It does not matter what language one speaks, 
what race one is, these are the values that unite us as a country.
<P>
	I will get on to Bill C-102. The hon. Parliamentary Secretary to 
the Minister of Finance explained in good detail exactly what the 
bill is all about.
<P>
	We support it for essentially the reasons he said. It is a step in the 
right direction. It is a step to breaking down trade barriers. My hon. 
colleague from the Bloc is quite right when he asks why we would 
set up trade barriers between the rest of Canada and Quebec when 
we are trying to knock trade barriers down between us and the 
United States.
<P>
	We are in the process of breaking down trade barriers. One of the 
ways to do that in a free trade agreement is to, as GATT has forced 
us to do, start looking at the zillions of financial transactions that 
take place with us and the Americans on a daily basis and ask how 
we can make them easier. That is what the bill does.
<P>
	Many Canadians travel very often to the United States, as I have 
on occasion with my family, with our pooch Rex in the back seat. 
Coming across the border, as we are wont to do, we add up all of 
our purchases. Especially after becoming a member of Parliament I 
start sweating about an hour before I get to the border making sure I 
have everything because the last thing I want to do is find myself in 
<I>Frank</I> magazine for having smuggled something across the border.
<P>
	I start to sweat about an hour before we hit the border and I have 
a list. By the time we get a little closer my wife is upset. She says: 
``For goodness sake, why do you not forget it? Let's just go''. We 
have everything listed and we are prepared to stop and pay the 5 
cents or 50 cents or $5 duty or whatever it is.
<P>
	The last time we got to the border and we had these itemized lists 
the customs agent asked how long we had been gone. I said six 
days. We had our list ready and he said he had good news for us: 
``Keep on going, there is no duty applicable on this''.
<P>
	That makes great sense. We are absolutely thrilled the 
government is doing this. The government is also going one step 
further. It is trusting Canadians to make declarations on what they 
have.
<P>
	It is very prudent of the government to carry a big stick. If we as 
Canadians break our trust and smuggle things through, we do not 
pay the duty or we do not pay the sales tax applicable, the 
government should reserve the right to come down hard on us.
<P>
	The changes in the bill, forced by GATT, by the free trade 
agreement, are obviously steps in the right direction which we 
support wholeheartedly.
<P>
	However, it would seem to me that if somehow we could 
inculcate within the whole apparatus of government the notion of 
common sense, we could make life a lot simpler for a whole lot of 
Canadians doing business.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15999"> 15999 </A></B>
<P>
	I want to recount the story of Western Carpet Distributors Inc. 
in my constituency. A few years ago it was one of the primary 
distributors of carpet in western Canada. The carpet manufacturers 
had distributors who would in turn sell their carpets for them. 
Recently the carpet industry in Canada became vertically 
integrated. That means that the manufacturers started to sell 
directly to the retailers without the middleman, without the 
distributor. When one started doing it they all started doing it.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	This left my constituent, Western Carpet Distributors, in a kind 
of bind. He had built his business over the years and it was a 
prosperous, successful business. All of a sudden he found that his 
suppliers were selling direct and no longer selling to him. The 
carpet manufacturers bought up many suppliers, but for whatever 
reason they did not buy his business. He was left in a situation 
where he was competing with the very companies he had built in 
the first place by supplying product to retailers.
<P>
	When faced with this, as a businessman is wont to do, he found 
other suppliers. The other suppliers he found were in the United 
States. He then had to import material from the United States and 
sell in competition to the vertically integrated suppliers 
manufacturing and selling their own carpet in Canada. Because 
these manufacturers sold in Canada, he had a significant tariff put 
on his product.
<P>
	Now it starts to get fairly complicated. The cost of his product 
should include the retailing or the selling expense. He was not 
allowed to claim that and had to pay duty on it, yet his competitors 
did not. This was a fairly substantial blow to him. There is a thick 
file at Revenue Canada, as he has been trying to get this changed 
but to absolutely no avail.
<P>
	We have another situation in which he is caught up, adjusting to 
that, paying the premium. He is now in a situation where a 
company that manufactures in the United States, sells to its 
Canadian subsidiary, a wholly owned subsidiary who then retails, 
is able to get a cash discount before delivery of 5 per cent. This is 
within its own family. The manufacturer sells to its wholly owned 
Canadian distributor but can take a 5 per cent discount. The same 
Canadian distributor I am talking about does a deal with his 
competitor and he is not allowed to take that. That is considered a 
reduction in price, and he has to pay duty on it.
<P>
	We are treating two apples like apples and oranges. This should 
not be. If we are prepared to give individual citizens the freedom 
and the right to be held personally liable and give them the trust to 
come back and forth across the border, should we not also do 
exactly the same thing with Canadian businesses? Should we not 
give Canadian businesses the same trust and responsibility? If they 
misuse that responsibility, we should come down hard on them like 
a ton of bricks. But if in the normal  course of business they are 
doing what is not only reasonable but right and makes common 
sense, why do we not extend that to this sector as well?
<P>
	Perhaps it is because there would be an army-I do not know; I 
am sure no one has even thought of it. But if we were to take this to 
its natural conclusion, there are a lot of things in our Canadian life 
that we could do as citizens and do not need governments to do for 
us. We do not need a whole building full of people with sharp little 
pencils trying to figure out who is right and who is wrong, who is 
doing what and who is not doing what. If we are going to have free 
trade, let us have free trade.
<P>
	In conclusion, I want to put a few remarks forward on this bill 
just to ensure that they are on the record.
<P>
	Bill C-102 and bills like Bill C-102 restore faith in the business 
sector in imports and exports. They help to bring our country to a 
competitive level. This is good. However, because of our 
complicated tax system Canadian investors are still investing 
outside of Canada more than they are in Canada.
<P>
	We would support this bill. We would ask that the government 
continue to bring forward bills such as this and try to make life 
simpler for Canadians as individuals and businesses so that we can 
face the future in a much more competitive spirit.
<P>
<B>(1120 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> We will now move on to the 
next stage of debate, where members will be entitled to a maximum 
of 20 minutes for their speeches subject to a 10-minute question or 
comment period.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to join in this 
discussion today on Bill C-102, an act to amend the Customs Act 
and the customs tariff and to make related and consequential 
amendments to other acts.
<P>
	I know there are many in Etobicoke-Lakeshore, the business 
and industry community, the manufacturers, the exporters, the 
trading companies, and those who travel either as tourists or in 
business, who are very interested in these amendments.
<P>
	I thought I would have to debate some of the issues in the bill 
and call for support from the opposition. I was pleased to hear the 
support of my hon. colleague from the Bloc and also support from 
the Reform member who spoke just before me.
<P>
	It seems as though there is general agreement among all 
members that the amendments in Bill C-102 would do a number of 
things. They would increase the capability of transferring goods to 
export market, enable us to be competitive, and encourage and 
improve the capacity for people doing business in Canada and 
across our borders.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16000"> 16000 </A></B>
<P>
	I want to draw attention to some of the concepts of good 
government as we see them in Bill C-102. A number of measures 
provided for in this bill build on the government's review of 
Canada's tariff regime.
<P>
	I want to take the opportunity to compliment not only the 
Minister of Finance and the Minister of National Revenue, whose 
work and whose departments have brought forward these 
amendments, but also the committee on finance that worked on so 
many of the pieces of legislation, such as S-9, C-105, C-90, C-103, 
and these present amendments before us.
<P>
	This bill introduces tariff reductions on a broad range of goods 
used as inputs in Canadian manufacturing operations. The bill also 
introduces changes. I believe there was general agreement on these 
changes to enhance, streamline, and consolidate Canada's duty 
deferral programs and also to make them more accessible to all 
manufacturers. These changes exist not only to enhance but also to 
reduce input costs. These changes allow for regions to more 
effectively market the programs in competition with the U.S. free 
trade zones to attract and keep investment in Canada.
<P>
	There are several amendments to Bill C-102. In the context of 
good government, these amendments are designed to lower 
business input costs and maintain and enhance our competitiveness 
and therefore create more jobs and opportunities, as we promised 
in our red book.
<P>
	Bill C-102 provides for a number of technical changes to 
simplify, clarify, modernize and bring up to date the customs tariff 
and its administration, to make it easier and less costly for business 
to access tariff relief programs. We heard earlier some examples of 
individuals in the business community who work with rules that are 
bureaucratic, out of sync with the way of doing business in today's 
world.
<P>
<B>(1125 )</B>
<P>
	Several amendments to Bill C-102 resulted from broad 
consultations with the private sector and at the request of those 
sectors. We heard earlier from the parliamentary secretary about 
the changes that were made as a result of the input from 
consultations and presentations that were made to the committee in 
the drafting stage.
<P>
	The measures adopted in the bill will do a number of things. 
They will provide $60 million in import tariff relief to Canadian 
manufacturers to level the playing field with NAFTA trading 
partners. I can say that in Etobicoke-Lakeshore business people 
are very concerned about this area and I am sure will be quite 
pleased with the tariff relief section.
<P>
	These amendments will also position Canadian businesses with a 
duty deferral program to more easily attract investment and 
compete in expanding world markets with a minimum of customs 
overhead. Again, I think every member in the House who is in 
touch with  export business people knows the issue is an important 
one for them.
<P>
	The amendments will also assist and provide opportunities for 
provincial and municipal governments to enrich the duty deferral 
program with local incentives. It is always the way in which we on 
this side of the House work to ensure that the municipal, regional, 
and other levels of government work in accordance with policies 
and with what we are attempting to do in the House.
<P>
	The improvement of services to travellers through simplification 
of customs procedures will allow customs to focus on smuggling 
and commercial importation. Those who have been out of the 
country recently and have come back into the country with goods 
would already know the implication of this change.
<P>
	Enacting this bill will not only ensure competitiveness and make 
all of the housekeeping amendments, but it will also increase the 
value of goods travellers can bring back to Canada after absences 
abroad. As someone who has travelled in the last few months, I had 
to fill out forms and state what I was bringing back into the country. 
I also became aware of exemptions Canadian travellers are allowed 
versus the U.S. exemptions, as we cross from the U.S. into Canada. 
It is a positive step toward the accord we recently signed on our 
shared border.
<P>
	There are several other technical things within the bill. I want to 
stress a few that I am sure my constituents in 
Etobicoke-Lakeshore, who are watching very closely the passage 
of this and who are awaiting its full implementation, would like me 
to emphasize.
<P>
	I would like to draw attention to specifically the amendments to 
allow for possible future improvements to preferential tariff 
treatment for the world's poorest developing countries to improve 
their export opportunities. This is very important for a number of 
people within the communities attempting to do business in this 
area.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	The protection of all goods and jobs and the withdrawal of the 
British preferential tariff, or the BPT rate as it is called, on certain 
rubber footwear ensure that all manufacturers and producers are on 
an even playing field. I mentioned earlier travellers' exemptions 
and the basket tariff items to facilitate the processing of travellers.
<P>
	In the context of good government I stress that the amendments 
will facilitate smooth business across our borders. They will 
encourage competitiveness. They will respond to our 
manufacturers, small business people and exporters. They will 
provide opportunities to provincial and municipal governments to 
come up with local initiatives to deal with free trade arrangements. 
All the amendments in Bill C-102 will give Canada the climate to 
ensure that we have the facility to trade across our  borders on an 
equal footing. The Access to Information Act will protect the 
confidentiality of taxpayer information provided by importers 
pursuant to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16001"> 16001 </A></B>
<P>
the Customs Act and the customs tariff. Those changes would be 
greatly appreciated by business people.
<P>
	The housekeeping and technical amendments contained in Bill 
C-102 ensure that competitiveness will be increased. They will also 
ensure that the exemptions for Canadian travellers will be in line 
with those of our major trading partners. The amendments will 
ensure that related and consequential amendments will be made to 
all acts that impinge upon the Customs Act and the customs tariff.
<P>
	These amendments are needed and desirable. I join with my 
colleagues in saying that the amendments are excellent. Therefore I 
ask members to ensure that Bill C-102 receives swift passage.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the Parliamentary Secretary 
to the Prime Minister for getting involved in the debate as it affects 
all Canadians.
<P>
	I appreciate that growth is the heart of the Canadian economy. It 
is very important for all of us to remember that the growth of the 
wider Toronto area has been in large part based on the export 
industries. Major cities around Toronto house the auto industry, the 
direct manufacturers being the big three, and small firms that feed 
into it such as the parts suppliers. In Toronto a number of different 
industries export across Lake Ontario into the heartland of 
American industry.
<P>
<B>(1135 )</B>
<P>
	The message the government is trying to get across to Toronto 
area business people is that we are there to support them in the 
expansion of the economy and the expansion of their businesses. 
We are there to make sure they can get through customs at Buffalo 
or Windsor quickly.
<P>
	Individual travellers or those who own businesses and use border 
crossing points know that there are long lines and it can be very 
difficult. It is one thing for individual citizens to be tied up for a 
few hours on a Sunday. It is frustrating if they are with their 
children. However it is another thing for truck drivers to be 
constantly held up as they do business. It extends the working day 
too long. It makes the cost particularly for businesses with just in 
time delivery systems very expensive.
<P>
	We are trying to recognize the new realities in the legislation. We 
are trying to have members such as the parliamentary secretary 
take an interest because it helps us to give the message to the 
business community. The hon. member would probably want to go 
to the business community in Toronto to explain some of these 
points.
<P>
	By way of a question I ask the hon. member whether or not the 
business community on the export side, as far  as she knows, was 
beginning to understand the changes and the fact that we can 
accommodate tax free transitions as goods are brought into Canada 
and exported not only into the United States, which accounts for a 
large part of what we are doing, but also into Europe and South 
America. The Pearson airport is a centre for such transactions into 
new markets.
<P>
	The Toronto business community would be very interested. I ask 
her to discuss it with her colleagues from Toronto. Perhaps we on 
this side of the House, those from Ontario and others, could help to 
take the message into the business community and to promote 
Canadian exports through the new legislation.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Augustine:</B> Mr. Speaker, the comments made and the 
questions asked are very important and are at the basis of my 
decision to speak to Bill C-102.
<P>
	Perhaps I can speak to the fact that Etobicoke-Lakeshore is 
geographically centred in an area close to major highways, the 
Toronto airport and the borders through Niagara Falls and Windsor. 
There are thousands and thousands of small businesses, small 
industries and small manufacturers that are very interested in 
ensuring their businesses prosper, continue to grow and are a hub of 
activity in Etobicoke-Lakeshore.
<P>
	When I speak to business people one thing they say is that 
governments can do just so much. The business people need to 
keep government out of the way they operate. They need 
governments to facilitate. They need the bureaucracy, the 
paperwork and all such things to be facilitating. If the policies, 
guidelines, rules and tariffs are facilitated, we can do what we do 
best. We can produce. We can make sure our production lines are 
moving, make sure we provide opportunities for individuals and 
make sure we are part of the global world before us.
<P>
	We should look at tariff regimes and at what we are doing to 
ensure that the bureaucracy and the paperwork are minimized for 
businesses. We should ensure that businesses continue to grow and 
develop and that we produce employment for individuals.
<P>
	Not only would I take the message back, but I would make sure 
that businesses in my area have copies of the legislation and that 
they understand fully what the government is ensuring will happen 
for them.
<P>
<B>(1140 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to join in the debate on Bill C-102, an act to amend the Customs 
Act. I am especially pleased to do it today, the morning following a 
major decision in Quebec to keep Quebec in a strong Canada.
<P>
	I made mention of that because Bill C-102 is all about keeping 
our country strong. Keeping our country strong has been one of its 
elements and trade is very important to ensuring that our nation 
remains strong and continues  to grow and prosper for the benefit of 
ourselves, our neighbours, our children and our grandchildren. We 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16002"> 16002 </A></B>
<P>
can now look forward to getting on with other agenda items for the 
country. We can focus on some very important matters.
<P>
	While Bill C-102 contains numerous items that on the face of 
them appear to be relatively minor, people involved in importing 
and exporting know they are very important.
<P>
	I will talk about trade in the larger context. Most Canadians, my 
constituents included, will read in the newspapers from time to 
time Canada's trade balance compared with the rest of the world or 
that it has <I>x</I> billions of dollars in surplus with our trading 
neighbours, particularly our American neighbours to the south. 
This is an important number but it does not give the whole picture 
about what trade does for our nation, our citizens, our businesses 
and the world.
<P>
	Trade opens and keeps open lines of communication. When the 
Prime Minister led a delegation dubbed Team Canada to China not 
long ago, in some quarters he was criticized because there were 
deemed to be certain problems in China over the issue of human 
rights. The message was made very clear by the Prime Minister of 
Canada. We have concerns about what happens in terms of human 
rights in China, but the way to improve human rights there and 
elsewhere in the world is principally through trade. Through trade 
is communication. Through trade is learning. Through trade is job 
creation and growing and strengthening economies. Trade is the 
best way to improve our understanding of each other around the 
world. As is so often the case dollars talk. Free enterprise and 
capitalism when properly undertaken can in themselves drive the 
entire world toward higher standards of living and better relations 
among all people.
<P>
	The bill is part of the big picture. It is part of what Canada needs 
to do to ensure that all our small, medium and large businesses 
compete in the world and at the same time contribute to the world. 
It is very much a give and take situation.
<P>
	Canada, with its vast human resources, natural resources and 
technical know-how, has been able to maintain a relationship with 
the rest of the world that has been very much to our advantage. We 
have seen the maintenance of hundreds of thousands of jobs in 
many sectors of the economy. My riding of Algoma is a riding in 
northern Ontario which one might not think is dependent on trade. 
It includes part of Sault Ste. Marie, a border community. I will talk 
a bit later about what it means to be a border community. We also 
depend on tourism which is very much a trade item. We also 
depend on forestry and mining.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	I had the chance recently to meet a delegation representing the 
mining sector during their visit to  Parliament Hill on a lobby day. 
It is easier to appreciate that even mining involves trade, the trade 
of minerals, the trade of natural resources and also the trade of 
people.
<P>
	There is no question that without trade we cannot as a nation 
make the advances necessary to continually improve the lot of our 
citizens and the citizens of other countries.
<P>
	I would like to pick out a few of the items in this bill for special 
mention. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance 
and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister have 
capably outlined some of those provisions. I would like to relate 
some of those provisions to experiences I have had in years past in 
my own work life, for example measures to deal with duty deferral 
and the tremendous red tape that is involved in importing an item 
which will be further processed and perhaps become part of another 
item which will then be exported.
<P>
	In the seventies I was the manager of a small electronics 
manufacturing company in my riding. We were producing an 
electronic product. It was necessary to import a couple of 
components which simply were not available in Canada. The red 
tape we had to go through to import those items which would be 
included in a final product which would then be exported caused 
more headaches than I could possibly describe in the short time I 
have today. The lost manpower, the loss of time and resources were 
incredible.
<P>
	If there is one commitment this government will keep to 
business, particularly small and medium sized business, it is the 
reduction of red tape. Bill C-102 is going to combine the drawback 
provisions, the numerous provisions that are presently required of 
small business. Inward processing and bonded warehousing are 
other examples of red tape now facing importers who require 
products from outside the country for inclusion in a product which 
is made here and then exported.
<P>
	If there is anything we can do for small and medium sized 
businesses it is to reduce the red tape. From my experience I can 
say that this is certainly a most welcome addition to the 
streamlining this government is committed to making.
<P>
	Numerous small companies in my riding export. In Elliot Lake, 
ELMAR Co. manufactures products for the mining sector. More 
recently it has diversified to include consumer products such as 
special clothing for handicapped children and other products. It has 
faced numerous difficulties with the very issue I raised a moment 
ago, that being the importation of a good for inclusion in the final 
product which is to be exported.
<P>
	The fact that Bill C-102 will also streamline and reduce tariffs is 
a very welcome measure for this company and others involved in 
export. The books which contain the tariff codes are huge, about 
two feet thick. We should do whatever we can to simplify and 
reduce the requirement  that small businesses need to call their 
broker or a government office to find out about a particular product 
and its code standing. Whatever we can do to eliminate the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16003"> 16003 </A></B>
<P>
necessity of businesses to do that, we are adding that much more to 
the productivity of that business. Red tape never actually adds 
profits to the bottom line.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	I think business accepts that there needs to be a certain amount 
of involvement with provincial and federal governments when it 
comes to paperwork, but there is far too much of it. We made a 
commitment in the campaign to reduce the amount of unproductive 
work required by businesses in this regard.
<P>
	Mention has been made about streamlining border crossings for 
travellers, tourists and truckers. As I mentioned a moment ago, part 
of Sault Ste. Marie is in my riding. The border crossing at Sault, 
Michigan and Sault, Ontario is popular. Some years ago there was a 
tremendous problem with cross border shopping at a time when our 
exchange rate was not such as it is today.
<P>
	Happily, I can report that is not a major problem right now but 
line-ups are a problem. Line-ups are created because even though 
99.9 per cent of travellers are honest citizens and would tell 
customs or immigration agents the truth when asked, a tremendous 
bureaucracy has been created to catch the less than 1 per cent of 
people who are dishonest and might be trying to hide something.
<P>
	I see in Bill C-102 a recognition that most people are honest. Let 
us find ways to zip them through the border crossing and instead 
focus our energies on those who would try to avoid duties or would 
try to smuggle something into the country.
<P>
	We have the modern technology and we have seen some pilot 
projects in B.C. and elsewhere that will lead us to fulfilling the 
commitment made between President Clinton and our Prime 
Minister during the president's visit to this country some months 
ago. That commitment was that the border between our two 
friendly nations be made more open. We have seen it with open 
skies in the airline industry. We are also seeing a push toward 
opening the border, being respectful of the need to manage our 
different citizenship and our different cultures, but at the same time 
recognizing that this border, the longest, friendliest border in the 
world as I understand it, needs to be managed in a way which 
recognizes that most people crossing the border are honest citizens 
with nothing to hide.
<P>
	When I see the provisions of Bill C-102 that are moving us 
toward that goal, I am very pleased for my constituents of Algoma 
riding in northern Ontario who are not very far from the U.S. at 
Sault Ste. Marie.
<P>
	I do not think we know for certain how this will all work out, 
what regimes will be put in place to simplify the crossing for 
visitors and truckers, but if there is a will, there is a way.
<P>
	I mentioned truckers. What a waste of time for a trucker with a 
load to deliver to have to wait at the border for some official to go 
through endless paperwork and examination before allowing him 
to cross the border. Like our visitors, I am sure 99 per cent of our 
truckers are carrying legitimate loads to legitimate destinations. 
Whatever we can do to speed things up, we will be adding to that 
company's productivity. We will be able to help companies reduce 
their transportation billings to their customers. Down the line it 
will mean less expensive products at the consumer level. We are 
doing everyone a favour when we streamline our border crossings.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	Also in relation to borders, there have been attempts by the 
Manitoulin Economic Development Association to establish a 
ferry service between South Baymouth on Manitoulin Island and 
Alpena, Michigan. Sadly, that project has been put on hold for a 
while because of cutbacks by the Ontario government and because 
the Ontario Northland Transportation Commission has had to cut 
back.
<P>
	As part of the project, I had made a commitment to work with 
the Minister of National Revenue and his officials to find a way to 
establish an international ferry between Canada and the U.S. on 
Lake Huron. Tourists would benefit from a streamlining of the 
relationship between our two nations.
<P>
	Even though this project has been put on hold for the time being, 
it is very important that we push ahead with initiatives right along 
the border between Canada and the U.S., be they land or marine 
borders and that the ability for travellers to enter each country be 
made as easy as possible. This is in recognition of the fact that most 
people are honest and do not want to deliberately deprive the 
province or the federal government of their small share of taxes or 
duties.
<P>
	There is an issue which arose in committee and which the 
parliamentary secretary referred to dealing with the valuation for 
purposes of calculating duty. In simple terms, the confusion arose 
over the value placed on an imported good if it was shipped from 
the manufacturer, but the order was placed by a third party who 
charged a mark-up for the good. The debate was, should the value 
be the price from the manufacturer or the price the third party 
actually charged the final user in Canada? Very good arguments 
were made by a number of excellent witnesses, who said that the 
price should be from the manufacturer level.
<P>
	The committee was not convinced that the proposal in Bill C-102 
was different from similar practices in the U.S. or Europe, although 
good arguments were made that we were undertaking a practice 
that was different from either the U.S. or Europe.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16004"> 16004 </A></B>
<P>
	In moving ahead with Bill C-102 and with the valuation 
provision, we have made a commitment that, as for all trade related 
legislation, this legislation will be sent to an international panel for 
review to make sure it fits within the terms of our international 
trade agreements. A WTO panel will look at the trade provisions of 
Bill C-102 to ensure that it is consistent with our commitments to 
our trading partners around the world.
<P>
	I am sure that if a problem is found, being a responsible 
government we will look at any comments or suggestions which 
come back from the WTO panel. The majority of committee 
members were convinced that the provisions of Bill C-102 with 
respect to valuation were consistent with our European and 
American trading partners in particular.
<P>
	In my concluding moments, I would like to go back to the 
general theme of Canada as a trading nation. It is important that we 
maintain our integrity as a good and honest trading partner to the 
world.
<P>
<B>(1200 )</B>
<P>
	We are a trading partner that can be relied on to deliver product 
on time because our small, medium and large businesses are strong 
and able to produce and deliver on time. This requires that we not 
stand in the way of business to produce quality products, that we do 
not stand in its way to be profitable and that we ensure our 
education system, our manpower training system, is always there 
ready and able to provide qualified workers who know how to 
produce excellent products, who know how to do the research 
required to enable Canada to maintain its proper place as a leading 
trading nation.
<P>
	We look forward to seeing Bill C-102 implemented.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and 
Addington, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-102 represents the opinion 
and the majority belief of most of us that most Canadians are 
honest.
<P>
	I cross the border. I live within 30 miles of border at Thousand 
Islands. My riding of Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and 
Addington extends from the Thousand Islands to Algonquin Park. 
We have a steady flow of tourists back and forth. We have small 
businesses exporting and importing.
<P>
	Whether I was driving back from the United States or whether, 
as in a previous life, I was importing, I could see the honest person 
with the small company was being confronted with too much 
paperwork. There was a real lack of support for the small business 
person who was being put behind the eight ball.
<P>
	Certainly there is smuggling today. If a person wants to smuggle 
something he would target our area of the St.  Lawrence River. I do 
not want to see us penalize the honest person. I do hope Bill C-102 
will help eliminate some of this overburden of paperwork.
<P>
	The large corporations in our part of eastern Ontario are 
expanding at a great rate. Bombardier is shipping $595 million 
worth of cars to Malaysia and other places around the world. 
Celanese just got an expansion. It has invested $191 million so it 
can export most of that. It is a polymer based product. Basically the 
polymer to make a shirt is the same product used to make a 
two-litre plastic pop bottle.
<P>
	These companies have the resources, the income, the 
background and the experts to help with the trading nation 
philosophy we have. However, the small businesses do not always 
have all this information available. I certainly hope Bill C-102 will 
help in this respect.
<P>
	We need to send the message as the bill progresses that we will 
ally with small businesses so they can access this neighbouring 
market.
<P>
	Small businesses in my riding are getting the spinoff from these 
major orders. Almost $1 billion has been invested into our area this 
year. From that many small businesses can take the opportunity to 
reach into the United States, Mexico and to the fourth amigo down 
the road. Yet the atmosphere is not always there which says we care 
about small business. We all acknowledge small business is the 
engine of the economy. That is where our jobs will come from. 
How many people are not certain the government is really looking 
after small business?
<P>
	This is a great opportunity for Bill C-102 and for us. It is my 
responsibility following this to show how this will help our small 
businesses.
<P>
	I want to get the opinion of my colleague from Algoma that the 
mandate of Bill C-102 will help our small businesses and in what 
ways. I know he has studied this bill much more than I have.
<P>
	<B>Mr. St. Denis:</B> Mr. Speaker, my colleague has always expressed 
the concerns of his constituents and small businesses across the 
country very well.
<P>
<B>(1205 )</B>
<P>
	Whatever we can do to lift the burden from small business, be it 
at the border, in sales tax, at the level of corporate reporting, 
whatever kind of red tape we can lift from the backs of small 
business is something we can do to improve productivity, improve 
the bottom line and improve therefore the ability to create and 
maintain jobs.
<P>
	The fact that we can plan through Bill C-102 to move trucks 
through the border more quickly and efficiently means less time for 
that load between point A and point B and therefore less cost in 
terms of wasted fuel, manpower, et cetera. This fact alone may only 
mean pennies on a item in a load, but multiply that millions  and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16005"> 16005 </A></B>
<P>
millions of times; take two pennies on something worth a dollar 
and that is 2 per cent.
<P>
	If we do that over and over, day in and day out, the accumulation 
of benefits to the small businesses trucking goods to consumers, to 
workers, will accumulate indefinitely. The present value of those 
would virtually be immeasurable.
<P>
	When coupled with commitments the government has made to 
deal through regulatory reform with the issue of red tape in all 
areas, we are as partners to small business. I know some members 
of the third party say we should be out of business all together. I am 
not in favour of government's being overly involved in business 
but it has a role to play in assisting businesses to trade in the world, 
to take their proper place in the community, but not to be there as a 
burden. Government can work with businesses to ensure that even 
though they have to pay taxes those taxes are used wisely and are as 
low as possible.
<P>
	If there is one thing the government can do to assist our 
economic growth and renewal it is to reduce and eliminate where 
possible the red tape burden that now hangs over too many small 
businesses.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Algoma for 
his speech. More important, the work done by the finance 
committee was very important in the development of this 
legislation.
<P>
	Members of the finance committee over the last year and a half 
since I have been involved with it have had to deal with a number 
of different subjects. It requires a lot of work behind the scenes to 
make sure they understand each of these different bills.
<P>
	A member such as the member for Algoma who is close to the 
border, an area which also has a lot of tourism, really depends on 
the operation of Canadian borders not only for industry but for 
tourism. A member such as the one for Algoma has to spend a lot of 
time making sure he or she understands this legislation and is able 
to contribute to the debate.
<P>
	The witnesses who came in to talk about Bill C-102 were all very 
knowledgeable and very expert witnesses. They had very different 
opinions sometimes from what we wanted to do. It was up to the 
members of the committee to really strike a balance, to review 
these interventions and to come out with what I consider to be a 
first class piece of legislation.
<P>
	Could the member comment on some of the things he heard in 
committee and whether he thinks the bill accurately reflects the 
best way of proceeding on these various issues?
<P>
	<B>Mr. St. Denis:</B> Mr. Speaker, the parliamentary secretary in being 
succinct as usual has been accurate in his reflection of the facts as 
he was referring to me. I did  not want to be self-effusive. His 
comments about me were what I was talking about.
<P>
<B>(1210 )</B>
<P>
	There were a number of issues raised in committee. I spoke 
about valuation. I would like to spend another moment speaking on 
that because it was certainly the most contentious issue. In fairness, 
other matters were raised, of which the parliamentary secretary 
spoke, which were resolved during the meeting. As a member of 
the finance committee I was very impressed with the willingness of 
witnesses and officials to actually work out solutions to problems 
that needed to be addressed immediately.
<P>
	On the issue of valuation, witnesses might have gone away from 
the meeting not feeling totally satisfied that we were able to 
accommodate them. The issue really boiled down to whether the 
proposals in Bill C-102 were in line with the actions and policies of 
our U.S. trading partner and the European communities. We were 
not persuaded that there was that much difference.
<P>
	The WTO panel will look at Bill C-102, once enacted, and will 
let us know whether it is consistent with our obligations to our 
trading partners around the world.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to address Bill C-102, a government bill, 
and to have Her Majesty's loyal opposition stand before the House 
to support the bill and to have the Reform Party also stand before 
the House to support the bill. After four very difficult weeks it is a 
great day for Canada to bring in a piece of legislation which the 
major parties and the Government of Canada can support 
wholeheartedly.
<P>
	Bill C-102 will amend the Customs Act and the Customs Tariff. 
It is a bill of language and a bill of clarity; it clearly defines, 
enhances and streamlines the duty deferral program.
<P>
	The Canadian Chamber of Commerce made interventions in 
committee that perhaps if we did not bring the bill in on a time line 
acceptable to business more generally some companies would lose 
or forfeit the duty they may have paid to Revenue Canada because 
they could not reclaim on time. We have made adjustments so that 
this would not be a problem for business.
<P>
	These changes are designed to help improve the competitive 
position of Canadian industry and Canadian business. The 
amendments will allow regions of the country to be more effective 
in marketing their programs and their products in a competitive 
manner which allows Canada to attract investment and to keep 
business at home.
<P>
	The aim and the strength of the bill lie in its clarification of 
legislative provisions to make the tariff framework more clear and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16006"> 16006 </A></B>
<P>
to eliminate confusion and  ambiguity for Canadian companies, 
importing companies and travellers.
<P>
	The bill also prescribes the terms and conditions on which 
licences for the operation of sufferance warehouses or duty free 
shops may be issued to include the provision of security which may 
be required in the operation of these warehouses or shops. It 
includes the duration of licences and the fees or the manner of 
determining the fees, if any are to be paid, and for which licences. 
It is a very specific and clear bill.
<P>
	The bill also clearly defines the circumstances by which licences 
for the operation of sufferance warehouses or duty free shops may 
be issued, in which way they may be amended or suspended, 
renewed, cancelled or reinstated; the process of accountability.
<P>
	Bill C-102 also seeks to provide standards for the operation and 
maintenance of these facilities, sufferance warehouses or duty free 
shops, and in particular the manner in which the receipt of goods in 
these warehouses is acknowledged, the circumstances by which 
and the extent to which goods may be manipulated, altered, 
unpacked, changed or combined with other goods to make a new 
product while in the confinement of sufferance warehouses or duty 
free shops, in a clearly given constituency. The definition of these 
confinements is also clearly prescribed by these legislative 
enactments.
<P>
<B>(1215 )</B>
<P>
	This bill and these amendments clearly spell out what are 
considered designated goods. This clarifies the language and 
establishes standards for the operation and maintenance of the 
sufferance warehouses or duty free shops.
<P>
	Under this bill the framework is laid in which the importer 
operates his place of business and the respect and manner wherein 
he maintains his records of operation, his records of imported 
goods, so that he may be able to make them available to an 
inspection officer at any given time and answer truthfully to 
questions in respect of such importations.
<P>
	The sufferance warehouses and duty free shops are places where 
imported goods arrive. The manner in which the receipt of these 
goods is acknowledged, the circumstances and the extent to which 
these goods may be changed or altered, as I have indicated, is 
clearly prescribed and defined in this legislation.
<P>
	These changes should improve efficiency. These changes should 
reduce the costs of doing business in Canada. These changes allow 
business, in a very accountable way, to carry on in a very honest 
and accountable fashion and reduce the red tape for those people 
who are legitimate business and manufacturing companies here in 
Canada.
<P>
	There is one point that was of great contention in the finance 
committee. That was a point my colleague talked  about for a 
moment, an evaluation provision. Under proposed section 48 of 
clause 18, the value for duty is a transaction value of the goods if 
the goods are sold for export to Canada. The transaction value of 
goods shall be determined by ascertaining the price paid or payable 
for the goods when the goods are sold for export to Canada. We 
have changed that. The proposed amendment to subsections 45(1) 
and 48(1) are that we define the purchaser in Canada. The value for 
duty of goods is the transaction value of those goods if the goods 
are sold for export to Canada to a purchaser in Canada. Those are 
the key words, ``a purchaser in Canada'', and the price paid or 
payable for those goods can be determined. This is not a change in 
the process of doing business here. It is simply a clarification.
<P>
	I will give an example so that members understand more clearly 
what our Canada customs officials have been practising for the last 
decade. If, for example, a foreign manufacturer makes a product 
valued at $80, that is the price leaving the foreign country. That 
product may go through several middlemen and maybe there are 
transaction values added through this process. When the product 
finally arrives to the Canadian purchaser, its value may be $100. 
Therefore, which is the value for tariff, the $80 at the foreign 
country doorstep where it left the foreign country, or the $100 when 
it arrives at the Canadian doorstep? This amendment clarifies very 
clearly that the value provision in this amendment is the $100 
value, or the value to the purchaser in Canada.
<P>
	I took a moment to make that clarification because this is not a 
new change. This is simply a clarification to the existing 
regulations and the current practices that govern importation of 
goods in Canada today. It is the practice that has been going on for 
10 years. The clearly defined value for duty is the value that has 
been assigned. I repeat: this value has been used by Canada 
customs and tariff officials when assigning value for duty for the 
past decade. All we are doing today in this amendment within this 
bill is to allow every importer in Canada to know clearly the rules, 
to allow the value of goods as indicated on the invoice to the 
purchaser in Canada to be sure that he understands this value to 
which tariffs and duties will be assigned.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	There will be arguments as there were arguments in the debates 
in committee that the value for duty should be in fact the $80 value 
that was assigned at the foreign country at the time of export, 
before the transactions of the middlemen intervened. However, we 
felt as a committee that the value when it arrives on the Canadian 
doorstep is the value when all transactions have been incurred.
<P>
	Presentations were made to our committee by both the Canadian 
Importers Association and the Canadian Institute of Chartered 
Accountants in opposition to this bill, and more specifically to this 
very section,  ``purchaser in Canada''. They said this is a residency 
requirement, this is new. We argued that it was not new, that it was 
simply clarification, identifying the purchaser in Canada, and that 
it had been the practice of Customs and Tariffs Canada for the past 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16007"> 16007 </A></B>
<P>
decade; it was simply clarification and we were in compliance, not 
confrontation, with our world trading partners.
<P>
	I elaborate on that point because it was very important and a 
great point of clarification. It sends a message to our businesses in 
Canada, our manufacturing businesses, where we have value added 
jobs, that here at home we will do our utmost to protect those jobs 
through good legislation that is acceptable to our global trading 
partners.
<P>
	The bill introduces tariff reductions on a broad range of goods 
used as input into Canadian manufacturing operations, thereby 
bringing our input tariffs more in line with those of the United 
States. It does reduce tariffs on many finished goods that are 
required and requested by Canadian producers.
<P>
	Part of our red book commitment was to reduce government red 
tape and streamline government operations so that business in 
Canada could be more efficient and we could provide 
manufacturing jobs in a more competitive global economy. That is 
what Bill C-102 does.
<P>
	Bill C-102 allows Canadian travellers to bring back to Canada 
after their absences abroad goods of increased value. This will 
bring Canadian travellers' exemptions into line with those of our 
major trading partners and for administrative purposes ease border 
congestion. We know the majority of those travellers are honest, 
law-abiding citizens. This bill allows that to occur with more ease 
and allows us to spend greater time on those who are involved in 
criminal offences and criminal activities.
<P>
	This is a positive step forward for Canadian legislation. It is a 
positive step forward for our Canada-U.S. agreements and our 
shared border commitments to ensure that activities between these 
two peaceful countries occur with ease and with the greatest 
efficiency for both countries.
<P>
	Other amendments to the customs tariff or the Customs Act 
contained in this bill are aimed at clarifying the intent of certain 
legislation or involve changes to make the tariff framework clearer 
and more predictable for Canadian companies and the importing 
community. Those are very important words, ``more predictable'', 
when one is in business.
<P>
	I had the experience of being in a manufacturing biological 
business for some 25 years. I was a co-founder in Nova Scotia of a 
scientific company, a tremendous challenge of a high tech 
biological company in a part of the country that is known for its 
hewers of wood and drawers of water. It was a challenge indeed, 
but we  established that company and were able to provide 
scientific jobs for young Canadians in Atlantic Canada.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	I know the value of predictability and stability in regulations on 
importation of goods into a manufacturing process. It is all part of 
maintaining jobs, maintaining accountability to employees, and 
maintaining a stable marketplace and economy for all Canadians.
<P>
	These amendments will afford protection to our manufacturing 
jobs and enhance the capacity to which we can export, which is 
what Canada is so well known for. These amendments clean up the 
wording of the act so that importers in Canada, those who own 
businesses, and Canadians who are travellers will understand and 
appreciate the regulations more clearly. The clarification and 
wording are clearly conforming with our trading partners, not 
confronting them, as some might suggest.
<P>
	These are progressive amendments. In an accountable and 
trustworthy business trading partnership they enhance Canada's 
credibility in competitive global trade. I am very pleased to hear 
this morning that all parties of this House will support this 
legislation.
<P>
	I am eager. I am very pleased to be on the finance committee and 
to have heard the arguments on both sides to bring this into the 
House and let our business community in Canada know that we are 
progressive.
<P>
	We are listening. We are reducing the red tape. We are trying to 
streamline so that business can be competitive, so that we can 
ensure those Canadian jobs in all regions and make Canada the 
number one place economically that we are forecast to be in the 
next couple of years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I greatly 
enjoyed the member's speech. Based on her experience in the 
private sector, she is extremely qualified to talk about matters that 
affect small and medium sized business in this country. This also 
eminently qualifies her to be a member of the finance committee of 
the House of Commons.
<P>
	She made reference to the red book. I prefer to call it the 
well-read book, because so many Canadians have had a chance to 
be exposed to its contents, to be exposed to the commitments this 
government made during the 1993 campaign, which, when 
implemented, will do the kinds of things this country needs to take 
its proper place in the world as a trading nation that can, being 
strong economically, provide jobs for its citizens, especially our 
young people.
<P>
	She mentioned her experiences in business with the 
biotechnology firm in the maritimes. No doubt she has many 
personal experiences with the red tape that faced her and her 
colleagues in that business. I wonder if she could share with us 
from her personal 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16008"> 16008 </A></B>
<P>
experience the loss of productivity, the loss of human resources, 
the wasted time that attends the paperwork burden imposed on  
business in this country. She might say how it will be a liberating 
thing for business not to have this load weighing down on them.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brushett:</B> Mr. Speaker, it was in 1972 that I was a 
co-founder of a company called Dominion Biologicals in Truro, 
Nova Scotia. We vowed to put our money where our mouth was. It 
was not a lot of money, but it was almost everything we had at the 
time. We wanted to build a scientific company because so many of 
our young people had to leave Atlantic Canada in order to find jobs, 
particularly in science or research.
<P>
<B>(1230 )</B>
<P>
	We were noble in the cause, rather naive, and decided we would 
take everything we could after some experiences working for giant 
companies abroad to build this company in Atlantic Canada and to 
speed up the 25-year process. The company became very 
successful and went on to be publicly traded on the Toronto Stock 
Exchange.
<P>
	We did a lot of research and Canada Customs played a key role 
in our manufacturing business. We used biological products. We 
would immunize animals and humans for an immune response 
reaction and then we would plasmapheres and bleed those humans 
and animals and this would be our source of raw material.
<P>
	I do not want to go into every scientific detail of hybridoma 
production and monoclonal antibody production. This took a lot 
more research. Canada Customs was always a vital component of 
our business because we would purchase raw material, human 
plasma of high antibody content specificity, from countries abroad 
through the World Health Organization and the United States.
<P>
	That raw material had to be tested as safe and processed on very 
tight timelines. As well, in the manufacturing process there are 
large numbers of people involved and the processing is very time 
consuming, filtration, refrigeration, sterilization; protocols of 
world health standards and the National Institute of Health 
Standards of Bethesda, Maryland. Everything is on a very tight 
schedule because cultures must be produced and searched for 
contamination.
<P>
	A product must come through from Canada Customs in a time 
frame assigned by the manufacturer because we would have a time 
line by which to export the product to the Austrian or German Red 
Cross, to world health organizations or to sell the product to 
hospitals in Canada. Our products were all marketed to hospitals or 
Red Cross health centres for in vitro diagnostic testing.
<P>
	In my previous life I spent a lot of time dealing with Canada 
customs and tariffs, a lot of time processing paperwork and 
knowing the tariff item number so that a product could come in. At 
the same time a relationship of trust is built. They know the 
products being imported and to what company they are going. A 
one on one  relationship is established. This bill will do nothing but 
enhance those relationships. It will be a tremendous asset.
<P>
	They know you are a bona fide manufacturer. They know your 
integrity, reliability and honesty in the workplace. They know you 
have a place of business where people work and that you pay your 
fair share of taxes and your books and records can be inspected at 
any time.
<P>
	When they know their clientele and the transactions of goods and 
what they are and what they are being used for, the bill enhances 
that relationship. It speeds up the relationship and allows the 
manufacturer to get on with the process as quickly as possible so 
that the goods can go out the door for sale either domestically or in 
foreign countries.
<P>
	That is part of the credibility, the stability of being a 
manufacturer in Canada. It is part of selling goods. Manufacturers 
need to be accountable and reliable and able to be competitive in 
the global marketplace with a quality product that meets the time 
line because it is no good if there has been a disaster and it is two 
days late.
<P>
	It is critical to have these relationships with Canada Customs and 
with legitimate manufacturers in Canada. It is a vital component to 
have efficient regulations through which goods can move as 
quickly a possible, particularly the goods of which I speak because 
they are perishable. A small bottle of serum going to the Red Cross 
in Canada or to Europe might be worth $50,000. It is breakable and 
perishable if exposed to high temperatures or extreme cooling.
<P>
<B>(1235 )</B>
<P>
	The whole process of efficiency in high technology is key to 
doing business in Canada. I can speak firsthand of this from the 
Atlantic where we are a little more remote from some of the high 
tech centres. It can do nothing but enhance business here at home 
and maintain jobs particularly in the manufacturing sector. That is 
where the value added jobs are.
<P>
	It is very easy to call yourself an importer and have a fax 
machine in a small cubby hole in the wall somewhere. When you 
input something it goes through your fax machine and goes 
offshore somewhere or wherever, but it does not do much to add 
value to jobs here in Canada. That is an easy thing to do. We see 
more of this all the time as the global trading community becomes 
smaller. People are moving things but simply with a fax machine, a 
telephone and maybe a warehouse.
<P>
	There are manufacturers, with hundreds of people coming to 
work in the morning, that know the value of using Canada customs 
and tariffs. I can speak strongly of another manufacturer in my 
hometown of Truro, Stanfield's woolen mills. It employs 800 
people. It is a true manufacturer. It brings in sheep's wool. The 
wool is carded. It is then woven into yarn on spinning wheels. From 
the yarn it is then woven into fabric. The fabric is  then cut and 
designed according to whether it is a t-shirt, a piece of underwear, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16009"> 16009 </A></B>
<P>
whatever piece of garment it might be. It then goes in for stitching 
and sewing, into piecework.
<P>
	To watch the women work on the sewing machines at Stanfield's 
I believe they could compete with any women in the world in the 
garment sector. It does my heart good to watch our manufacturing 
people, to see the jobs created. These are value added jobs and the 
goods are sold in Canada and exported.
<P>
	Everyone in the House knows how our exports have risen during 
this past year. It is a sign we are doing the right thing. This 
legislation is part of that progressive activity. It is progressive 
legislation for this government. To see Her Majesty's loyal 
opposition this morning announce it would support it after four 
very difficult weeks in the country and to hear the third party say it 
would support this legislation can do nothing but enhance jobs at 
home. I am proud to be part of the legislation.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It sounds like Fruit of the 
Loom is doing well in the hon. member's riding.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there are close to 1 million small and medium sized 
businesses in Canada. Many of them are manufacturers; others are 
exporters or importers.
<P>
	To stimulate the economy and promote job creation, the 
government has considered the demands and needs of small 
business and introduced Bill C-102, an act to amend the Customs 
Act and the Customs Tariff and to make related and consequential 
amendments to other acts.
<P>
	I am pleased to support this bill. In summary, the bill before us 
would reduce tariffs on a broad range of goods used as inputs in 
Canadian manufacturing operations, which would bring our tariffs 
closer to those of the U.S. It would also reduce tariffs on certain 
finished goods, as requested by Canadian manufacturers. In 
addition, this bill would enact changes to streamline and 
consolidate Canada's duty deferral programs-duty drawback, 
bonded warehousing and inward processing-and to make them 
more accessible to all manufacturers. These changes are aimed at 
making Canadian industry more competitive by reducing input and 
administrative costs and easing the pressure on business cash flow.
<P>
	The changes to duty deferral programs will allow the regions to 
market more effectively the programs competing with U.S. free 
trade zones in order to bring investors to Canada and keep them 
here.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This enactment also increases the value of goods travellers can 
bring back to Canada with them after an absence abroad. This will 
bring Canadian travellers'  exemptions into line with those of our 
major trading partners and, for administrative purposes, ease 
border congestion so that customs is able to focus on smuggling 
and the growing number of commercial importations. It is also a 
positive step toward the recently signed Canada-U.S. accord on our 
shared border.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	Other amendments to the customs tariff and the Customs Act 
contained in the bill are aimed at clarifying the intent of certain 
legislation or involve changes to make the tariff framework clearer 
and more predictable for Canadian companies and the importing 
community. These changes should improve efficiency and reduce 
the cost of doing business in Canada. One change will result in 
higher tariffs and the withdrawal of the duty free British 
preferential tariff rate on rubber footwear to protect Canadian 
production and jobs.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The bill would also amend the Access to Information Act in 
order to protect the confidentiality of information on taxpayers 
provided by importers pursuant to the Customs Act, the Customs 
Tariff, and the Special Import Measures Act.
<P>
	Some of the provisions in Bill C-102 result from the 
government's review of Canada's tariff system, as announced in the 
1994 budget. Their purpose is to ensure that Canada remains a good 
place for producing goods and that Canadian investors and 
businesses, including small businesses, are in a better position to 
benefit from the free trade agreements between Canada and other 
countries.
<P>
	Some changes such as the improvement of duty deferral 
programs and the reduction of tariffs on manufacturing inputs are 
designed to lower the cost of inputs for business and to maintain 
and increase the competitiveness of Canadian business on domestic 
and international markets.
<P>
	Bill C-102 contains some technical changes to simplify, clarify 
and update the Customs Tariff and its administration and to make 
tariff reduction programs more accessible to and cheaper for 
business.
<P>
	The changes to facilitate the processing of travellers at border 
crossings will allow Revenue Canada, Customs to focus on other 
important border issues such as smuggling and the need to process 
an increasing volume of Canadian imports.
<P>
	Several of the amendments in Bill C-102 were made following 
consultations with business and meet their demand for help in 
facing the competition.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The measures adopted in the bill will provide $60 million in 
import tariff relief to Canadian manufacturers to level the playing 
field with NAFTA trading partners in tariff reductions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16010"> 16010 </A></B>
<P>
	They will position Canadian businesses with the duty deferral 
program to more easily attract investment and compete in 
expanding world markets with a minimum of custom overhead. 
They will provide opportunities for provincial and municipal 
governments to enrich the duty deferral program with local 
incentives.
<P>
	They will improve service to travellers through the 
simplification of customs procedures and allow customs to focus 
on smuggling and commercial importations.

	He said: Mr. Speaker, the reason I have moved these motions to 
amend the legislation is that I am concerned that our government is 
placing an impediment in the way of Canadian magazines. I am 
very concerned that by doing this it is jeopardizing the future of 
Canadian magazines.
<P>
	Specifically, for people who are not familiar with what exactly 
this bill is about, I will provide some background. Bill C-103 is 
legislation that would retroactively apply most specifically to 
<I>Sports Illustrated</I> magazine. It would prevent the use of split run 
technology to publish their magazine in Canada and also pursue 
Canadian advertisers. I will address that whole issue in a moment.
<P>
	This clause does not permit Canadian magazines which have 
circulations in the United States that are less than what they have in 
Canada to use split run technology to get back into their own 
market. By introducing this clause, the government is effectively 
blocking the way for the expansion of Canadian magazines which 
does not make any sense.
<P>
	This weekend I was at the Canadian Association of Broadcasters 
meeting in Ottawa. As a former broadcaster I thought I had a pretty 
good handle of what was going on with broadcasters. However I 
was quite surprised to find out that some Canadian broadcasters 
have extended far out into the rest of the world. In doing so they 
have not only strengthened their balance sheet and profit picture, 
they have also provided tremendous opportunities for Canadian 
actors, writers and producers. As an example, I found out that 
Power Corp. out of Quebec is the largest broadcaster in Europe. I 
was surprised by that.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	That tells us something about what we should be doing if we 
really want to give Canadian cultural industries a leg up on the 
competition. We should not be looking inward, becoming insular 
and engaging in navel gazing and putting up protectionist walls. 
We should be putting in place legislation that encourages free 
trade, that gives businesses the incentive to go out and compete in 
the world by getting into Europe, as Power Corp. has done.  It has 
provided all kinds of jobs for Canadian actors, writers and produc-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16011"> 16011 </A></B>
<P>
ers and all kinds of other people involved in the Canadian cultural 
community. That is the right approach.
<P>
	The same applies to CanWest Global which is involved in New 
Zealand and in Australia. The company I used to work for now has 
a MuchMusic type operation in Argentina which is doing very well.
<P>
	The point is that what applies to broadcasting applies to the 
magazine industry. At the end of the day the cream rises to the top. 
Ultimately consumers get the best products. They get the most 
choice at the cheapest possible price.
<P>
	I fail to understand why we are putting in legislation that 
impedes the ability of Canadian magazines to not only compete in 
the world market, but even in their domestic market against all the 
American and foreign magazines which are coming into Canada. It 
is ridiculous to have a situation where if you want to establish an 
operation in New York in addition to the one you have in Canada, 
you will not be allowed to use split run technology to get back into 
your own country. That is crazy. It makes absolutely no sense.
<P>
	Our amendment is designed to get rid of that clause. Canadian 
magazines would then have an incentive and the government would 
not be standing in their way penalizing them for trying to expand 
and provide jobs for Canadians and to ensure that Canadian culture 
and the Canadian cultural industries, particularly the magazine 
industry, are strengthened in this country. Why in the world are we 
doing this? It makes absolutely no sense.
<P>
	I am not going to belabour this. There are several motions before 
us and I will not talk for a long time on all of them. However, I 
really do feel that although the whole principle behind this 
legislation is flawed, this clause in particular needs to be addressed 
and this motion would be the ticket to do it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are here today to consider four 
amendments to Bill C-103. This bill contains major amendments to 
the Excise Tax and the Income Tax Act in areas that will benefit 
Canadian periodical publishers.
<P>
	It has been a longstanding policy in Canada to channel Canadian 
advertising revenues into Canadian periodicals. The Canadian 
magazine industry actually depends on these revenues, as they 
represent 65 per cent of total revenues. More than 30 years ago, in 
1961, the Royal Commission on Publications, commonly referred 
to as the O'Leary commission, looked into the situation of the 
Canadian magazine industry.
<P>
	After a comprehensive review, the commission recommended 
that steps be taken to increase the flow of advertising revenues 
toward the Canadian magazine industry to give this industry a 
sound financial footing.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	As a result, two legislative provisions were enacted in 1965: (i) 
section 19 of the Income Tax Act, limiting income tax deductions 
for advertisement directed at the Canadian market to advertisement 
bought in Canadian periodicals, and (ii) Code 9958 of the Customs 
Tariff, which prohibits the import into Canada of split-run editions 
or special editions of periodicals whose content is substantially the 
same as the content of the original edition, except for publicity 
specifically tailored to a Canadian market.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Over the past 30 years, section 19 of the Income Tax Act and 
tariff code 9958 have been successful in supporting the 
government's policy objective of encouraging Canadian 
advertising revenues to be directed to Canadian magazines. These 
two policy instruments have allowed the Canadian magazine 
industry to expand and to prosper.
<P>
	However, a potential threat to the Canadian magazine industry 
arose in January 1993 when Time Warner announced its intention 
to publish <I>Sports Illustrated</I> Canada, a Canadian split run edition of 
the U.S. magazine <I>Sports Illustrated</I>. It would be printed in Canada 
using editorial content electronically transmitted from the U.S. 
Since <I>Sports Illustrated</I> Canada would not involve the physical 
importation of split run magazines in Canada, tariff code 9958 
would not apply.
<P>
	Time Warner's initiative demonstrated that there was a loophole 
in tariff code 9958 and a need to update Canada's magazine policy. 
As a result, in March 1993 the Government of Canada established a 
task force on the Canadian magazine industry. The task force was 
asked to examine existing policy instruments and to propose new 
measures which would ensure the continued effectiveness of 
federal policy in support of the Canadian magazine industry.
<P>
	In its final report, the task force presented 11 recommendations 
to the government, two of which are addressed in Bill C-103: an 
excise tax on split run editions of periodicals distributed in Canada; 
and an anti-avoidance rule relating to the deductibility of 
advertising expenses in non-Canadian newspapers and periodicals.
<P>
	The proposed excise tax will be levied on split run editions on a 
per issue basis at a rate of 80 per cent of the amount charged for all 
advertising appearing in the issue. Without this measure, the task 
force noted that new split run editions would likely enter the 
Canadian market and the Canadian periodical industry would risk  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16012"> 16012 </A></B>
<P>
losing up to 40 per cent of its advertising revenues over a five-year 
period.
<P>
	The proposed amendments to the Income Tax Act will add an 
anti-avoidance rule to section 19 of the act. This will ensure that 
newspapers and periodicals which claim to be Canadian are in fact 
Canadian controlled for the purposes of the act.
<P>
	The proposed amendments to the Excise Tax Act and the Income 
Tax Act update our policy instruments in support of the Canadian 
magazine industry. They maintain the government's longstanding 
policy respecting Canadian magazines and underscore the federal 
commitment to support the continuing existence of a viable and 
original Canadian magazine industry. I wanted to put that before 
the House to give a context to the amendments which are being 
discussed.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to thank the hon. member 
for Medicine Hat for his participation in the finance committee 
deliberations. He is not normally a critic in the finance area, but 
rather in the heritage field. However, this bill went to the finance 
committee because it affects legislation which is under the 
jurisdiction of the Minister of Finance. His participation was 
greatly welcomed and contributed to the questioning of witnesses 
and our general deliberations.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	I will now deal with the first two amendments presented by the 
member that are grouped together. Motion No. 1 would delete the 
definition of excluded edition. An excluded edition is defined as an 
edition primarily distributed outside Canada. This is a key concept 
that appears in several provisions of the bill. If the motion were 
adopted, a periodical edition distributed in Canada could be a split 
run edition if its editorial content is more than 20 per cent the same 
as that of another edition primarily distributed in Canada.
<P>
	Thus the motion would result in regional editions of Canadian 
magazines being subject to the split run tax, even though at least 80 
per cent of their editorial content is original to the Canadian 
market. This would be contrary to the government's stated policy 
objective for the Canadian magazine industry. It would also be 
inconsistent with the vote of the House to adopt a ways and means 
motion and the approval in principle given to the bill by the House 
at second reading.
<P>
	The purpose of the bill is to encourage publishers to include at 
least 80 per cent original editorial content in magazines containing 
advertisements directed at Canadians. However, provided that a 
magazine satisfies this editorial content objective, there is no 
intention to discourage the publisher from publishing regional 
Canadian advertising editions of the magazine. For that reason the 
government will have to reject the motion.
<P>
	The second motion would eliminate exceptions that would 
exempt certain types of publications from being  subject to the tax 
on split run editions. The first exemption specifies the tax will not 
apply to an edition primarily distributed outside Canada even 
though it has some circulation in Canada. This exception would 
allow regional editions of foreign magazines to continue to be 
distributed in Canada, provided that the editions are primarily 
distributed outside Canada.
<P>
	The second exception would allow a publisher of a foreign 
magazine to distribute in Canada an edition that contains some but 
not all the adds that appear in one of the editions distributed in a 
magazine's home country, provided that the edition distributed in 
Canada does not contain any new ads.
<P>
	These two exceptions are intended to allow foreign magazine 
editions to continue to be distributed in Canada without being 
subject to the split run tax, provided that they do not contain ads 
primarily directed at Canadians. By deleting these exceptions the 
proposed motion would extend the scope of the split run tax to 
magazine editions not intended to be subject to the tax.
<P>
	Thus the motion is inconsistent with the vote of the House to 
adopt the ways and means motion and the approval in principle 
given the bill by the House at second reading. For this reason the 
government will reject the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hugh Hanrahan (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise today to discuss report 
stage of Bill C-103, an act to amend the Excise Act and Income Tax 
Act.
<P>
	I will spend the majority of my time today discussing Reform 
amendments that have been put forward to alleviate some of the 
serious problems or flaws that have worked their way into the bill.
<P>
	As I stated during second reading, Bill C-103 will impose an 
excise tax in respect to split run editions of periodicals. The tax will 
be implemented at the rate of 80 per cent of the value of all 
advertisements contained within the split run edition. The split run 
editions are essentially periodicals distributed in Canada. More 
than 20 per cent of their editorial material is the same or 
substantially the same as the editorial material that appears in one 
or more periodical edition distributed primarily outside Canada and 
they contain advertisements that differ from country to country. 
Reform's amendments lie at the heart of this issue.
<P>
<B>(1305 )</B>
<P>
	It is all too clear the issue of a split run edition of foreign 
magazines is one of predatory pricing or dumping its product on 
the Canadian market at unreasonably low prices as it means a 
siphoning off of Canadian advertising. If this is happening then 
punitive measures should be applied against the violators.
<P>
	The ultimate question is whether publications such as <I>Sports 
Illustrated</I> are in fact dumping and in so doing  bleeding the 
Canadian periodical advertising market dry. To effectively 
determine if split run periodicals dump their product on the 
Canadian market, we should examine the fees charged for 
advertising and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16013"> 16013 </A></B>
<P>
compare them to a competitor or another publication with similar 
numbers or readership.
<P>
	I will use readership as a quantitative measure in comparing 
<I>Sports Illustrated</I> with two other magazines simply because the 
same value was selected by the Canadian Magazine Publishers 
Association for comparing costs of advertising between 
publications. <I>Sports Illustrated</I> Canada has a readership of just 
over 650,000 compared with <I>Equinox</I> which has a readership of 
783,000 and <I>Outdoor Canada</I> which has a readership of 621,000. 
The readership numbers are relatively close for those who read the 
three magazines and are relatively the same cross section of the 
populace.
<P>
	Specifically Sports Illustrated charges $5,800 for a standard, full 
four-colour page advertisement, while <I>Outdoor Canada</I> and 
<I>Equinox</I> charge $4,300 and $5,500 respectively for the same 
standard, full four-page edition. Therefore it would seem logical, if 
<I>Sports Illustrated</I> is dumping the amount it charges, that 
advertisers should not only be lower but significantly lower. This, 
however, is not the case. It appears the opposite is true since <I>Sports 
Illustrated</I> charged more than the other two magazines for 
advertising space.
<P>
	Even if we look at the unit costs per 1,000 copies for the same 
three publications after taxes, <I>Sports Illustrated</I> has a higher unit 
cost per thousand than the other two. Again, if <I>Sports Illustrated</I> 
were dumping, these costs would be significantly lower and not 
higher. This evidence has been seemingly overlooked or ignored by 
the Liberal government.
<P>
	Further evidence is based on a 1983 study that the 10 most 
popular United States magazines in Canada commanded a 
collective circulation of approximately 2.8 million. Over the last 
10 years the names of the magazines have changed yet the most 
popular U.S. magazines in Canada today have 25 per cent less 
circulation than their counterparts a decade ago.
<P>
	Interesting enough at the same time the top 10 Canadian 
magazines have increased their collective circulation by almost 15 
per cent. It appears that Canadian magazines are winning the battle 
for readers. This is happening not because of government 
intervention but because of the quality of articles in the magazines.
<P>
	If we look at the amount of revenue generated for split run 
editions through advertisement, the lion's share is remaining in the 
hands of Canadian based magazines. Last year <I>Sports Illustrated</I> 
had six split runs that brought in ad revenues of slightly more than 
$1 million, which is minuscule compared to the $867 million in the 
Canadian magazine industry as a whole.
<P>
	A final note on this issue is that Canadian magazine publishers 
admitted to the Standing Committee on Finance that advertising 
revenues in the Canadian magazine industry have increased 4 per 
cent over the last year despite the alleged dumping and predatory 
pricing of <I>Sports Illustrated</I> Canada that were supposed to have 
taken place during this time.
<P>
<B>(1310 )</B>
<P>
	Moreover, the Canadian Magazine Publishers Association 
agreed there was no Canadian magazine in direct competition with 
<I>Sports Illustrated</I> Canada in its unique market niche for its readers. 
Even if there were, the Canadian competitor would survive not 
because of an end to split runs of a competitor but because 
Canadians wanted to read it and because it was quality material. In 
other words it would stand on its own merits. Advertisers would be 
attracted to certain publications for their readership and because 
they were Canadian or American.
<P>
	The complaints of Canadian publishers are based on a much 
simpler concept than predatory pricing called economies of scale. 
To say therefore that economies of scale inevitably doom Canadian 
culture is to say that domestic and foreign cultural products 
compete strictly on price, that is Canadians do not distinguish 
between them on any other basis.
<P>
	If there is one truth among nationalists it is that the two are not 
perfect substitutes. Canadian tastes are distinct and therefore 
indigenous production fills a need that foreign art cannot meet, in 
which case Canadians would be willing to pay a premium for the 
product. If we are not very different from the Americans, the 
advantage of economies of scale should be just as open to us as to 
them. A perfect example of this would be <I>Hockey News</I>, a Canadian 
publication running split run editions in the United States.
<P>
	Should clauses 1 and 2 not be amended as we have put forward, 
future Canadian publications will be prevented from expanding 
into the United States. Not only does the bill impede the flow of 
imports, it also takes away any incentive for Canadian publications 
to grow, to expand and to take full advantage of the U.S. market. 
That is shameful. For this reason Motions Nos. 1 and 2 should be 
passed.
<P>
	Bill C-103 implements a retroactive grandfathering clause as 
well. Clause 1 on page 6 dealing with section 39 clearly illustrates 
the meanspirited nature of the government in that it sets the 
exemption date for the legislation approximately one week before 
<I>Sports Illustrated</I> started running its northern edition. The bill 
therefore aims directly at disqualifying only them. This is grossly 
unfair and our amendment will remedy the situation by changing 
the enforcement date of the legislation to the day after the act is 
assented to.
<P>
	We on this side of the House oppose the bill for the following 
reasons. First, Reformers do not support the  notion that state 
sanctioned cultural protectionism is a good policy to implement. 
Second, Bill C-103 conjures up the view that Canadian magazines 
are not of sufficient quality or merit to compete with foreign 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16014"> 16014 </A></B>
<P>
counterparts. We on this side of the House know that this is 100 per 
cent false. Canadians are among the best in the world. We compete 
through our talent and our products, not through government 
sanctioned protectionism.
<P>
	It is clear therefore that the Reform Party cannot support the 
legislation without our amendments being passed. Bill C-103 
represents the worst of giving special interest groups an advantage 
at the expense of all taxpayers who will now pay a higher price for 
many magazines they choose to buy.
<P>
	On behalf of my constituents in Edmonton-Strathcona I thank 
the Liberal government for taking even more money out of their 
pockets.
<P>
<B>(1315 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to join in the report stage 
debate of Bill C-103 and to stand in support of those members on 
this side of the House who were speaking to this bill.
<P>
	I want to begin by giving a bit of my background as an educator 
and as someone who has enjoyed and is very concerned about the 
Canadian magazine industry. A task force on this industry was 
established in March 1993 with a mandate to recommend the 
update of existing policy instruments and to propose new measures 
in support of the Canadian magazine industry, which so many of us 
have enjoyed and are enjoying.
<P>
	Since 1965 there have been two legislative measures in place to 
support the Canadian magazine industry: the Income Tax Act 
section 19 and the customs tariff code. The objective of both of 
those measures was to ensure an adequate flow of advertising 
revenues to support a vibrant Canadian periodical industry. These 
instruments of public policy have in large part been successful. 
However, technological developments in an increasingly global 
trading environment have meant that those two measures in place 
for almost 30 years are no longer completely adequate to meet the 
policy objective for which they were designed.
<P>
	The first thing the task force had to do was learn about the 
industry. I would like to take this opportunity to give some 
background on the industry to put this bill in perspective to see 
whether the Reformers would appreciate some of the aspects of the 
bill that we are supporting on this side of the House.
<P>
	The task force commissioned two reports. One prepared by 
Informetrica Ltd. examined the economic environment within 
which the Canadian magazine industry operates. A second, 
prepared by Lee Anderson of Carleton University, analysed the 
Canadian advertising market with particular reference to the 
Canadian  magazine industry. The Informetrica study provided 
some basic information on the economics of periodical publishing, 
its products, markets, and cost structure.
<P>
	In 1991-92 the Canadian industry produced 1,440 magazines, 
with revenues totalling more than $846 million. The Canadian 
magazine industry is one of the most important media pipelines 
between the generators of Canadian information, ideas, and views 
and the Canadian public.
<P>
	In 1990 more families participated in buying magazines, both 
Canadian and foreign, than any other cultural activity except 
perhaps the buying of newspapers. Compared to 1978, the 
percentage of households buying magazines increased by 10 per 
cent, to an average of 69.8 per cent.
<P>
	The domestic market is measured by Statistics Canada. Statistics 
Canada estimates that there are more than three million 
subscriptions to U.S. periodicals not included in the trade data. In 
1991 Statistics Canada information presents one view of the size of 
the market and the Canadian magazine publishers' share of that 
market. Using these measures, Canadian publishers account for 
54.8 per cent of the total domestic market.
<P>
<B>(1320 )</B>
<P>
	One area of difficulty, of course, is that subscriptions ordered by 
Canadians directly from the U.S. and mailed from the U.S. to 
Canadians are not counted by any of the existing statistical 
systems. The value of magazines imported is the value at the 
border, with no real measure of the advertising contained therein. 
Therefore, with adjustments, an alternative measure based on 
circulation revenue suggests a Canadian publishers' share of about 
25.5 per cent of the domestic market.
<P>
	Although editorially rich and diverse, the Canadian industry is 
not on strong economic footing. We do not have to go very far from 
the House to recognize this. The 1991 statistics show that more 
than half of Canadian magazines had no operating profit. The 
average operating profit for the industry as a whole was only 2.4 
per cent. In any business that is really not good.
<P>
	Despite the strength of our mix of editorial content and diversity 
and the size and profitability of Canadian magazines, they are still 
very much limited in terms of their potential for revenue. The issue 
here is one of relative market size and economies of scale.
<P>
	Magazines have two clients, the reader and the advertiser. The 
building blocks of a magazine are circulation, editorial content, and 
advertising. The larger a periodical circulation, the more 
advertising it can attract. The greater a magazine's advertising 
revenue, the more it can afford to spend on editorial content, which 
in turn makes the magazine more attractive to consumers and 
increases its 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16015"> 16015 </A></B>
<P>
circulation. Circulation is crucial to advertisers and therefore 
crucial to a magazine's advertising revenue.
<P>
	The Informetrica study reported that circulation revenue 
accounted for $245 million or 29 per cent of the total revenue of 
Canadian magazines in 1991 and 1992. Magazines can be 
circulated on news-stands or through subscriptions. For Canadian 
magazines, approximately 10 per cent of English-language and 27 
per cent of French-language magazines are sold on news-stands. 
By contrast, 89.3 per cent of all imported consumer magazines are 
destined for news-stands. That is not to suggest that the 
government or the domestic magazine industry are interested in 
restricting the access of foreign magazines to our news-stands. 
These statistics are merely presented to demonstrate the 
competition Canadian magazines are up against on news-stands.
<P>
	Subscriptions are the main source of circulation revenue for 
most Canadian magazines. A large subscription base provides a 
publisher with stability, helps in scheduling production units, and is 
particularly important for cash flow, since most subscriptions are 
paid in advance or early in the subscription period. I am sure that 
most of us who have subscribed to magazines know that we hear 
from the magazine far in advance of the expiry date of the 
subscription.
<P>
	Advertising revenue is a lifeline of the Canadian magazine 
industry and crucial to the survival of Canadian magazines in an 
indigenous Canadian magazine industry. Sixty-five per cent of all 
revenue of Canadian magazines is derived from advertising. An 
adequate advertising revenue base is essential to the economic 
foundation of periodical publishing in Canada.
<P>
	Without a healthy Canadian magazine industry Canada's policy 
objective of ensuring that Canadians have access to Canadian ideas 
and information through Canadian periodicals cannot be met. 
Policy instruments that have been in place since 1965 are designed 
to achieve that purpose. Encouraging magazine advertisers to reach 
Canadian consumers through Canadian magazines and periodicals 
is as important today as it was 30 years ago.
<P>
	The advertising study commissioned by the task force showed 
that magazines have experienced more annual declines in 
advertising dollars than any other medium in Canada. Television's 
rise as an advertising medium over the 30-year period is perhaps 
the most significant trend behind the declining share of magazine 
advertising revenues.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	Magazines tend to be disproportionately affected in economic 
downturns through drops in circulation. Whereas people will 
continue to watch TV, they would cancel their magazine 
subscriptions to save money and have cash flow. That affects the 
entire industry.
<P>
	The bottom line is that the amount of money spent by advertisers 
to reach the Canadian consumer is not likely to grow. Therefore, 
within the Canadian advertising  market it is extremely unlikely 
that the share held by periodicals will increase.
<P>
	The two studies that were commissioned demonstrate very 
clearly the precarious situation the Canadian magazine industry 
finds itself in. This is a point I want to underscore, the precarious 
situation the Canadian magazine industry finds itself in. It must 
compete in a market that is dominated by imported magazines and 
it must compete for advertising revenues.
<P>
	The consequence for the Canadian magazine industry and thus 
for Canadian cultural development will be very serious if we do not 
take the necessary steps to maintain the structural support 
necessary to continue to meet the government's longstanding 
policy objective for Canadian magazines of ensuring that they have 
adequate access to advertising revenues.
<P>
	The measures in Bill C-103 are designed to support the Canadian 
magazine industry so that it can conduct business and be 
competitive. It is simply an extension of Canada's longstanding 
policy against split runs. The measures strive to plug a loophole in 
the tariff item so that the exploitation by Sports Illustrated Canada 
over the last two years can be dealt with. However, Sports 
Illustrated Canada got around the measures by electronically 
beaming the magazine to a Canadian printing plant.
<P>
	I know that the members across the way are speaking in support 
of Sports Illustrated. I want to make clear that these measures in the 
present bill are in no way designed to limit Canadian access to 
foreign publications. Canadians will still be free to read whatever 
they want, including an imported edition of Sports Illustrated. Our 
borders remain open to the millions of copies of American 
magazines that are bought here each year. The best way to support 
the Canadian magazine industry is to adopt measures that will 
encourage original content, regardless of the country of origin.
<P>
	We do not want a kind of recycled editorial material that is 
commonly dumped in split runs. We must continue to finds ways-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I hesitate to interrupt the 
hon. member. I have been as generous as I could. Short of the 
member asking for unanimous consent to conclude her remarks, I 
would have to resume debate.
<P>
	Perhaps the hon. member could mention to the House how much 
longer it would take to conclude her remarks.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Augustine:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was right at the very end.
<P>
	We must continue to find ways to maintain a place for the rich 
tapestry of ideas and information we now have in Canadian 
periodicals. To that end, I urge the House to promptly pass this 
legislation.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
happy to rise today to support the motions of amendment put 
forward by my colleague for Medicine Hat. Before I do that, I 
would like to take a moment to speak about Bill C-103, which 
is the basis for these amendments in the first place.
<P>
	What we have here is a form of cultural protectionism. It is 
protectionism for an industry that I do not think really wants it or 
needs it. This government seems to assume that this industry 
cannot stand on its own two feet, that it does not have a quality 
product that can be sold throughout the world on the basis of that 
quality. I really disagree.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	I wonder what has happened to the Liberal government. At the 
same time those members have been talking about trade 
liberalization, bringing in NAFTA, the GATT agreement, they 
seem to be moving in the opposite direction in the area of culture.
<P>
	In this area specifically we are talking about split runs for the 
magazine industry. What they do not realize is that Canadian 
magazines also use this technology very effectively. We have an 
industry in Canada out there competing in the international market 
and we can do it without government help. Those Canadian 
magazines will get sideswiped in this whole process.
<P>
	This goes against the whole grain of free trade, of trade 
liberalization, and Canada does not want to set this example. We 
want to set an example that we are free traders, that we can 
compete on the basis of quality.
<P>
	The question of whether this is actually a dumping issue was 
raised by my colleague earlier. If this is a dumping issue, that the 
Americans are dumping cultural property into Canada, it should be 
how it is addressed. We have a basis for discussing that with a 
NAFTA trade dispute panel. Why does it not go there instead of 
taking this round about way of hitting them with an excise tax?
<P>
	We have to simply move away from this whole idea that we 
cannot compete unless we have government subsidies. Our cultural 
industries are actually being adversely affected by our assuming 
that and we have to get on with the process of competing on the 
basis of quality.
<P>
	I want to talk to the first and second amendments proposed by 
my colleague. The first amendment deletes the term ``excluded 
edition'' from the bill. An excluded edition is an issue of a 
periodical that has less circulation in Canada than outside Canada. 
The second amendment deletes references to split end editions.
<P>
	The purpose of these two amendments is to ensure the Canadian 
magazines we talked about earlier, which circulate in the United 
States and do split end runs, do not end up paying excise taxes in 
Canada in their attempt to penetrate the American market.
<P>
	They are being penalized by an attempt to exercise cultural 
protectionism. The whole purpose of liberalizing trade between 
Canada and the United States is to allow goods and services which 
are superior and which are in demand to find a much larger market. 
We defeat that purpose of free trade by taxing Canadian periodicals 
which have a chance to stand, to make it at home and abroad.
<P>
	Canadian periodicals should be free to export our good ideas and 
our great culture to the United States. They stand a better chance if 
they can do so by using the split end run technology on their 
editions abroad and not be penalized here at home. Presently there 
are two Canadian magazines, <I>Harrowsmith</I> and <I>The Hockey News</I>, 
which will be caught in the net of the bill.
<P>
	Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 by my colleague ensure that these and 
other Canadian magazines are excluded from the bill's provisions. I 
would like to see our amendments passed this afternoon.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Godfrey (Don Valley West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
address some of the arguments put to us this afternoon by members 
of the Reform Party.
<P>
	I will limit my remarks essentially to four arguments. The first 
made by the member for Medicine Hat is an economic argument 
about market choice. It is an interesting theory about the ability of 
consumers to know their own needs best. It is a very alluring theory 
but there are flaws with that theory which I hope to point out.
<P>
	The second argument is that of the member for Edmonton 
Strathcona on the apparently arbitrary nature of Bill C-103 with 
regard to its targeting <I>Sports Illustrated</I> and its split run and the 
timing of the proposal.
<P>
	The third argument deals with the whole notion of state 
sanctioned cultural protection, alluded to by the members for 
Edmonton Strathcona and Peace River. The final argument deals 
with the whole notion of whether we can compete without this kind 
of government subsidy, an argument made by the member for 
Peace River. Let us review those arguments in order.
<P>
<B>(1335 )</B>
<P>
	How does the world actually work? The world actually works in 
economic theory and in economic practice in two different ways. 
We have what could be described by any economist as imperfect 
market conditions in many of our relationships with the United 
States.
<P>
	This is particularly true when, because of the market size and 
dominance in the cultural industries, there is a virtual monopoly 
condition which unless counterbalanced would essentially wipe out 
Canadian culture. It is true not only of magazine publishing but 
equally of broadcasting, movie distribution, popular music and 
many other cultural areas.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16017"> 16017 </A></B>
<P>
	Our experience in this country is a sad one, going back to the 
days of radio in the 1920s and 1930s when we discovered there 
was simply no place for a Canadian voice unless we created it, 
unless we legislated some protection, some place for Canadian 
voices to be heard, which led to the creation of the Canadian 
Broadcasting Corporation.
<P>
	We noted in a later era that in popular music Canadian voices 
could not be heard unless there was some place they would be 
protected initially so they could form a critical mass and then 
become competitive. We have noted in film distribution that there 
is still no place for Canadian voices because of the enormous 
market power of the American distribution systems. We have noted 
it in magazine distribution where we saw from 1961 a market share 
of 25 per cent of publications available in this country declining to 
21 per cent. With the introduction of various measures designed to 
prevent this kind of dumping Canadian magazines started to 
increase in their number and in their proportion of the marketplace.
<P>
	In other words, we are talking about public policy that actually 
has a track record of working; public policy that has worked in 
broadcasting with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, public 
policy that has created a vibrant successful popular music business 
which can now compete successfully in the United States, and 
public policy that has supported a vibrant Canadian magazine 
industry. Public policy works.
<P>
	The argument has been put on the second point that this is 
grossly unfair to <I>Sports Illustrated</I>, a magazine that deliberately 
tried to violate the spirit of the law against this kind of dumping by 
trying a technological device not available at the time of <I>Time</I> 
magazine or <I>Reader's Digest</I> when we had to deal with this 
problem previously. It was a deliberately provocative act which 
demanded a deliberate, measured and firm response, which is what 
this is about. The spirit of the law is quite clear and it has been 
violated by <I>Sports Illustrated</I>.
<P>
	The third argument has to do with the notion of state sponsored 
cultural protection. It is very interesting that we are not the only 
country to try to protect our cultural industries. It is also clear the 
United States does exactly the same thing. It is not possible for a 
foreigner to own a television station in the United States. The 
foreigner has to change nationality. We might argue that is a form 
of cultural protection. The Americans put it in a different way. 
They see that as a matter of national security so if ever they had to 
clear the air waves, a station would not be owned by some 
nefarious Canadian who would stop them. It is a form of cultural 
protection under the guise of national security.
<P>
	The Americans do all sorts of things in this area. They do not 
allow foreigners to own significant amounts of the merchant 
marine because it might be required for national security. Surely if 
we chose to do so in this country we could simply redefine what we 
are on about  here as our form of national security, our national 
cultural security. We also have something at stake here but we do 
not fight so much with arms as we do with our culture.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I think that, for all Canadians in whatever cultural or social 
group, our culture is nonetheless worth fighting for, since this 
culture, whether expressed in French or in English, represents us.
<P>
	I think that we will also benefit from the European model, which 
reflects similar concerns with respect to culture. Our French 
counterparts have done the exact same thing, taking action for 
instance against the distribution of American movies and television 
programs. The problem is the same, it has to do with who they are.
<P>
	That is what this is all about and why we are entering into a kind 
of alliance with the French and the Europeans on culture, in spite of 
American provocation if I may say so.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	The Americans look upon us as a kind of Trojan horse. And if 
they cannot prevent us from taking such action, they will not be 
able to do so, even with the Europeans.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I suppose the argument, particularly by the member for Peace 
River, is whether we can compete without a government subsidy. 
The answer to that is quite clear. We cannot compete in an unfair 
market in which superior economic power is evidenced by 
dumping. The product coming across the border in the form of the 
split run by <I>Sports Illustrated</I> has been légèrement canadianisé. It 
is not a true Canadian product. It violates all of the agreements we 
put in place when we dealt with <I>Reader's Digest</I> and <I>Time</I> 
magazine. It was designed to do that deliberately. We have to take 
deliberate action against it.
<P>
	As for being a subsidy, it is not a subsidy. It is simply a provision 
of the Income Tax Act which does not allow them to have favoured 
treatment because they have come up with a clever technological 
trick.
<P>
	For all these reasons I reject the arguments of the members of the 
Reform Party and urge the House to support this measure.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Graham (Rosedale, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to address Bill C-103. Before discussing the content of this 
proposed legislation, I want to say a few words about culture and 
the importance of the Canadian culture.
<P>
	Canadian culture includes a vast array of things. Ultimately, it is 
the essence and the reflection of who we are as individuals and as a 
nation. It reflects the way Canadians see each other, as well as the 
way they perceive the world. Our culture and our life as a people  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16018"> 16018 </A></B>
<P>
are inextricably intertwined. Cultural events, which are a reflection 
of ourselves, show the result of our creative voices and energies.
<P>
	Culture is a complex notion. It includes the knowledge, beliefs, 
arts, moral values, laws, customs, as well as all the other skills and 
customs developed by the members of a society. Culture does not 
only refer to art. It includes the periodicals and books that we read, 
the records and the programs that we listen to. Canadians are avid 
consumers of cultural products.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the majority of these products are of foreign 
origin. I say unfortunately because I wonder, as a member of this 
Parliament and of our Canadian society, how we are going to pass 
on our values and principles to our children and to our fellow 
citizens, if we have no control over publications, at least over a 
large number of publications, including cultural ones, in our 
community.
<P>
	In this era of mass communications, our industries, including the 
film, book, periodical, radio, television and recording industries, 
must face an enormous challenge. Not only must Canadian 
producers assume the very high costs and risks inherent to a small 
market, they must also compete with foreign products which are 
generally cheaper and which have free access to our markets. If our 
cultural industries are not relatively sound from a financial point of 
view, our cultural development will suffer and we will no longer be 
heard. This is precisely what this bill seeks to avoid.
<P>
	These reasons explain why Canada's cultural development 
deserves the full attention of public authorities, and particularly 
that of the members of this Parliament. As the hon. member for 
Don Valley West pointed out, every state takes similar measures. 
He mentioned Europe and France. Europeans have what they call 
``cultural exceptions'' to protect, through rules of European 
content, their cultural institutions.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	And remarkably, as my colleague for Don Valley West pointed 
out, the Americans are precisely the ones who generally treat 
questions of culture and cultural exports as purely commercial 
products. They also have the necessary means to protect American 
culture, American communications, American films and so on.
<P>
	It seems to me, therefore, that the member for Peace River has 
somewhat oversimplified the issue. Yes, we live in a world of free 
trade. That is true, but we must never forget that our American 
competitors are experts in transforming free trade principles into 
elements of protection when it suits them to.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I have a friend in the United States who uses a wonderful 
expression. He has often said that as far as his people are 
concerned, free trade ranks somewhere  between Christianity and 
jogging on a list of things much talked about but little practised.
<P>
	Another American colleague of mine recently said at a meeting I 
was at that, like some of us recognize, achieving free trade is like 
going to heaven; we all want to go to heaven but not just yet.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	That is the problem. These are principles easily expressed but, 
regardless of the country, there are always impediments to prevent 
culture from being protected. The reason for this is a very 
significant one: culture is the very essence of a society.
<P>
	We must be very pleased about what happened yesterday in the 
province of Quebec. We must all rejoice and I cannot miss this 
opportunity to state how thrilled I am with the wise decision the 
people of Quebec made in yesterday's referendum.
<P>
	I venture to think that the cultural aspect played a strong role in 
that decision, because Quebec's contribution to Canadian culture 
and the Canadian identity is enormous. Quebec makes it possible 
for the French language to flourish in Ontario and other provinces, 
and therefore contributes to the preservation and protection of 
French in North America, thus serving the interests of Quebec and 
of Quebecers themselves.
<P>
	Now we can work together in the interests of the French 
communities, the English speaking communities, the multicultural 
communities, to preserve this focal point of hope our country 
represents to the whole world, which is reflected in the culture this 
bill is attempting to protect for all Canadians within this somewhat 
limited context.
<P>
	The Government of Canada has fully assumed its responsibilities 
in this area. Over the past 35 years, it has put into place a wide 
range of organizations and programs in support of Canadian 
culture, to bolster what has been accomplished within the country. 
The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the National Film Board 
and our national museums and archival institutions, through the 
Canada Council, distribute grants to artists and cultural 
organizations across the country.
<P>
	The government promotes investment in cultural products by 
granting tax benefits to funding agencies such as Telefilm Canada. 
It helps Canadian periodicals attract the advertising revenue they 
need for their survival and facilitates their distribution to a very 
dispersed readership.
<P>
	Nevertheless, the problem of very high production and 
marketing costs still exists. In other industries, sales revenues are 
usually such that companies are able to break even. Although it has 
always been difficult for Canadians to finance production of 
cultural goods from national sales because of the small size of the 
market, it  becomes practically impossible as a result of the 
advantages enjoyed in Canada by foreign, especially American 
competitors. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16019"> 16019 </A></B>
<P>
This is certainly not to criticize foreign competitors, many of 
whom enrich our cultural life.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	The purpose of this legislation is only to highlight the structural 
and financial obstacles to the distribution of Canadian cultural 
products. Among our Canadian cultural industries, the one that 
concerns us particularly today in the context of this bill is the 
periodical industry.
<P>
	As was pointed out by the authors of the report of the Royal 
Commission on Publications in 1961, periodicals ``can give us the 
critical analysis, the informed discourse and dialogue which are 
indispensable in a sovereign society''.
<P>
	In the past thirty years, the Canadian periodical industry, both 
francophone and anglophone, has become more creative and, to 
some extent, more profitable. Unlike most of our cultural 
industries, the periodical sector is generally under Canadian 
control.
<P>
	In fact, our Canadian periodical industries include more than 
1,300 magazines, each with their own characteristics. These 
periodicals target various groups, use a variety of distribution 
methods and are regional or national in scope. Their content may 
be very specialized or very wide-ranging.
<P>
	The large number and diversity of periodicals published in this 
country-consumer magazines, business publications and 
specialized periodicals-reflect the concerns and tastes of 
Canadians.
<P>
	All regions as well most large urban centres have their own 
magazine. There are magazines for almost every field of 
endeavour: economics, professions and trades, arts and letters, 
science, religion, recreation, and so forth.
<P>
	The relative success of this industry is largely due to government 
measures aimed at giving Canadian periodicals access to 
advertising markets and the public. Although their editorial content 
is rich and varied, the state of Canadian periodicals is precarious. 
In 1991, more than half failed to make a profit.
<P>
	The Canadian market is more limited and is also shared by two 
main language groups. Canadian magazines will never have more 
than a fraction of the circulation of what are mainly American 
magazines. Circulation revenues of Canadian magazines will tend 
to remain below those of imported magazines. American 
magazines, for instance, collect more subscription revenues in 
Canada than do Canadian magazines.
<P>
	Advertising sales play a vital role in the magazine industry. 
Publishers of periodicals cannot break even unless they manage to 
attract advertising. This is true in all countries, but Canadian 
publishers are often faced  with strong competition from imported 
magazines, especially from the United States.
<P>
	That is why about 30 years ago, Canada took steps to make it 
attractive for advertisers targeting the Canadian market to use the 
Canadian media.
<P>
	The Canadian government was able to ensure that our 
periodicals would have more equitable access to their own markets. 
A complex set of measures involving postage, taxation and 
customs, together with subsidies, has contributed to the growth and 
stability of the industry.
<P>
	This particular measure and this legislation are an attempt to 
complete a system that protects not only our magazines but, more 
broadly, the culture, ideas and values these magazines 
communicate to Canadians and their children, by propagating and 
protecting Canadian culture. This government is to be commended 
for taking measures we feel are absolutely indispensable to 
preserve-

	<B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York-Simcoe, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
in Montreal on Friday, October 27 Canadians from coast to coast 
shared their love for Canada and Quebec. My riding of 
York-Simcoe sent six buses and turned away 200 more. In other 
ways, in rallies and vigils and in presentations of song and drama, 
they celebrated Canada.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, I am wondering 
if the member's intervention is relevant to Bill C-103 and the 
motions on it.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> During the last few hours I 
have been paying close attention to all interventions from both 
sides of the House. At the beginning of members' statements, 
whether on report stage of Bill C-103 or other matters we dealt with 
earlier, some members took a few moments to reflect on the 
historical event which took place yesterday.
<P>
	With the greatest of respect and fairness which the Chair owes to 
all its members, I am certain the member for York-Simcoe will be 
dealing with the matter at hand.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Kraft Sloan:</B> Mr. Speaker, my introduction has 
tremendous relevance for the importance of the magazine industry 
in Canada. It is really unfortunate the members of the Reform Party 
do not understand how valuable the Canadian magazine industry is 
to the country.
<P>
	Compared with the United States, Canada may be small in 
numbers, but Canadians everywhere have shown that they are big 
in heart and are capable of creating a mighty roar for Canada. The 
Canadian magazine industry is an important and vital contributor 
in defining us and explaining who we are. In comparison to the 
American industry it also is small in number in terms of its  
potential circulation but it is very important to Canadians. It 
represents a wide diversity of interest and must be supported.

	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Wellington-Waterloo, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about our great nation, Canada.
<P>
	While the results were close last night, we as a nation have so 
much to build our future on. Canadians from coast to coast share 
many of the same values and priorities. We all care about finding 
and keeping good paying jobs, that our streets are safe from crime, 
and that future generations will inherit a compassionate and 
prosperous country.
<P>
	The love for our country remains.
<P>
	Last week the citizens of my riding organized a rally to 
demonstrate their desire for Quebec to remain a part of our great 
nation, and thousands upon thousands of Canadians travelled to 
Montreal to declare their love for this country.
<P>
	These are the things that will hold us together. These are the 
things that we can build on in the weeks, months and years ahead.

	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when it came to the WGTA payout, the unique concerns of 
Peace River farmers were ignored by the government.
<P>
	To ensure this does not happen again with the impending sale of 
the federal fleet of 13,000 hopper cars, I would like assurances 
from the Minister of Transport that BC Rail will will be given an 
option to buy some of these cars.
<P>
	As a grain farmer I am well aware that BC Rail has had serious 
problems getting timely and reliable access to these government 
owned but CN controlled cars for years. In the more competitive 
market created with the elimination of the Crow rate, it does not 
make sense the government would limit the sale of its fleet to a 
couple of select players and force BC Rail to lease cars from its 
main competitors.
<P>
	On behalf of the farmers of the Peace, I believe BC Rail must get 
its fair share. Farmers need to know there will be sufficient cars to 
get their grain to market in the future.

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
while celebrating the fact that we Canadians remain together in a 
single country, we must ask ourselves some very important 
questions. What is a country, really? How did we weaken our 
political attachment to our country in the past 15 years? How can 
we renew the values we uphold and our vision of Canadian society?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In this respect, on behalf of the NDP we do not see uncritical 
decentralization and the offloading of federal responsibilities as a 
panacea, particularly if it is just a cover for the further dismantling 
of the very Canada that both Quebecers and non-Quebecers lament 
the continuing destruction of.

	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
outcome of the referendum gave us all a glimpse of the 
consequences that would result from the breakup of our great 
country.
<P>
	The tiny majority won by the no side gives us an opportunity to 
strengthen confederation from the inside. I think that Canada is a 
better country with Quebec, that Quebec's culture and economy 
make Canada stronger, and that Quebec is stronger within Canada.
<P>
	Being part of a large entity is beneficial to Quebec's economy 
and culture, as they are supported by both francophone and 
non-francophone citizens across the country. I thank all 
Peterborough residents who travelled to Montreal last Friday and 
all the people who expressed their attachment to and support for

	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
federal government has deliberately been cruising in neutral since 
the end of September while waiting for the Quebec referendum 
results. Major changes to unemployment insurance and old age 
pensions will soon  be introduced, and they will hit people harder 
than ever before since the inception of these programs.
<P>
	We are aware of the societal choice being made in Ottawa, 
thanks to secret documents leaked to the public. We know that this 
choice is totally inconsistent with Quebec's aspirations in terms of 
society. The wind of change coming from Ottawa is really a flurry 
of drastic cuts that has Quebec shivering.

take the blame for it.

	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
referendum result reflects two different visions of Quebec. One is 
that Quebec is an integral part of a united Canada. But it is more 
than that. Quebec is the founding province of Canada, the place 
where it was born, the cradle and champion of francophones across 
Canada.
<P>
<B>(1405)</B>
<P>
	The other is that Quebec is one of these world nations that, 
because of their history and destiny, must become independent, 
while of course recognizing its special ties with Canada.
<P>
	What these two visions have in common are democratic values, 
tolerance, and recognition of the fact that Quebecers form the only 
predominantly francophone society in North America.
<P>
	Quebec is now and forever a francophone society that is free and 
able to control its own destiny and development, as part of Canada 
and of the world at large.

<P>
	This referendum, the second in 15 years, clearly shows that 
Canada is still Quebecers' first choice. Obviously, given the 
numbers, there is no reason for anyone to go around bragging. 
Nevertheless, yesterday's vote is confirmation that Quebec does 
not want to separate from Canada.
<P>
	In the coming weeks and months, people from all over the 
country, and particularly from Quebec, will ask for a Canada that 
better reflects who we are.
<P>

take our country for granted. We took heed of that message and we 
are determined to do everything to ensure the best possible future

Quebec's constitutional future.
<P>
	Ninety-four per cent of Quebecers voted. That, in itself, is an 
unprecedented democratic success, given the importance of the

unequivocally that the principles of tolerance and freedom are

	On both sides of the issue, our fellow Quebecers in all regions 
behaved with dignity and honesty, respecting others' opinions, and 
maintaining complete calm.
<P>
	There is no doubt about it, the federal government and its crown 
corporations, the major Canadian carriers and the telephone 
companies in the anglophone provinces made major illegal 
contributions to the no side, illegally.
<P>
	But the profoundly democratic character of the Quebec

	We can only hope these results are enough to force our 
traditional leaders to leave behind their prehistoric ways and join

night the people of Quebec demanded change from the federal 
government, sweeping change which has already been advocated 
by the Reform Party. By resisting change the rigid centralists of the 
Liberal Party brought this country to the brink of destruction.
<P>
	Change must come and when it does, the government must deal 
with each province as an equal partner in Confederation. Whatever 
is offered to one province must be offered to all. The government 
may be tempted to grant special status to one province to retain a 
share of its traditional power, but the lesson we learned last night is 
this: If the federal government continues to clutch the power to its 
breast, it will lose the federation.
<P>
	Only the broad devolution of powers to all provinces on an equal 
basis will allow us to address the concerns of the different regions 
of the country. In order that Canada can continue to prosper, the 
socialist dream of this overwhelming and intrusive central 
government must be permanently laid to rest.
<P>
	Reformers will oppose special rights to any province because 
unity is based on equality.

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we know the government deliberately put off tabling its 
reform of social programs until after the referendum in order to 
keep the bad news awaiting the unemployed from them until then. 
There have been a number of leaks of late confirming that the 
reform has been ready for a number of weeks already. The CSN has 
even made public a bill setting out exactly how they would cut the 
unemployment insurance plan.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Now that Quebecers have 
voted no in the referendum, what is preventing him from unveiling 
his reform of social programs, under which he is once again to 
make cuts on the backs of the disadvantaged?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I find it quite surprising that the CSN has a bill I have not 
yet seen.
<P>
	The government is still looking at the problem, and we have not 
made a definitive decision. Furthermore, I am in contact with the 
provincial premiers, as I indicated two weeks ago in this House. 
The maritime premiers have made representation in this regard, 
and I have not finished consulting the other premiers. I hope to do 
so soon.
<P>
	When we are ready, the government will approve a draft bill, 
which will be submitted to this House. The members will be able to 
make suggestions and amendments and, after it has been duly 
studied, the bill will be passed.
<P>
	At this point, however, I have to say that cabinet has not yet 
approved any draft bill on the matter.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, up to now, the government cited the imminence of the 
referendum to explain why it was not governing. Now we wonder 
what pretext it will invent to justify its inaction.
<P>
	How can the government still claim that the reform of social 
programs is not yet ready, when, in the case of unemployment 
insurance, everyone can read the bill in the paper announcing more 
radical cuts on the backs of the unemployed?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have just answered the question. I repeat that no draft 
bill has yet been approved by the government. No draft bill has 
been submitted to cabinet. When it is submitted, the ministers will 
consider it, and there will be a resolution. I have to say we are well 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16024"> 16024 </A></B>
<P>
on the way, but I  want to talk to one or two premiers who have 
made representations, before approving the final bill. No draft bill 
has been approved by the government to date.
<P>
	So, we are waiting. When it is ready, we will table it in the 
House, and members can make suggestions or amendments, if they 
do not like it.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, given that the unemployment insurance fund will register 
a surplus this year of nearly $5 billion, does the Prime Minister 
plan to exempt the unemployed from further cuts and to reconsider 
his strategy of singling them out?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
</B><B>Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would suggest that the hon. 
leader of the opposition read the recommendations that were made 
by the House of Commons committee, which indicated that one of 
the serious problems in the past was that the government that 
preceded ours, of which he was a member, substantially cut 
unemployment insurance premiums. When a recession hit the 
country they had to suddenly and drastically raise those premiums, 
which only accelerated the recession. Therefore the House of 
Commons committee recommended that a reserve be established to 
ensure there could be a stable state of premiums established.
<P>
	As the hon. member knows, right now we are still paying off the 
deficit that was incurred by the previous government in the UI 
fund. We want to make sure we establish enough of a reserve that 
we will not run into the same problems the government of which he 
was a member encountered when it had to deal with the 
unemployment insurance system.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, despite the announcement in the last government budget, 
the Prime Minister has stated on a number of occasions that there 
was no question of cutting old age pensions. Despite the Prime 
Minister's prereferendum assurances, however, seniors are 
concerned.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. When will he make 
known the contents of his planned reform of old age pensions?
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was very clear in this House prior to the referendum and 
I am still clear after the referendum: we have no intention of 
cutting the federal pension benefits being received by those who 
are already retired-as I have said, and as I say again-either in 
November or in the next budget.
<P>
	I was very clear before the referendum, and I am as clear today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, could the Prime Minister reiterate today the commitment 
made on numerous occasions during the referendum campaign that 
his government will not cut the old age pensions of future 
recipients? I would like some clarification concerning ``future 
recipients''.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have never mentioned future recipients. We are speaking 
of those receiving pensions. That is always what we have said, that 
we had no intention of changing the plan for those in receipt of old 
age pensions.
<P>
	We have said that the federal government needs to ensure, over 
the long term, that the plan will be available for people who will 
reach retirement later, because everyone feels this is a plan 
requiring adjustments. There are more Canadians than in the past, 
proportionally to the pension, and we need to look to the long term. 
We have spoken of reform for the years 2005 and 2010, and not of 
the immediate future.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last night this country came within a hair's breadth of 
breaking apart. Fortunately the no side scraped through, but it was 
thanks to the last-minute efforts of the Canadian public, not to the 
strategy of the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The Prime Minister and the no side strategists woefully 
underestimated Quebec's deep desire for change, and up until 10 
days ago were still trying to sell the status quo with a little 
administrative tinkering. These gross miscalculations almost cost 
us the country.
<P>
	My question is to the Prime Minister. Three months ago the 
Prime Minister did not have an adequate plan to keep this country 
together. He did not have one last night. Does he have one today?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr., 
Speaker, we had a plan and the people of Canada responded well to 
it. We had a close referendum, which was the expression of the will 
of the people of Quebec. Their views were expressed. It was closer 
than we expected. We wanted more.
<P>
	I know the leader of the opposition wanted to win. There was no 
doubt in his mind that he wanted to win, which is normal in such a 
contest. But we won.
<P>
	I made a speech on Tuesday in which I said I was in favour of 
certain changes. I will bring about these changes very quickly. As 
far as the will of the people of Canada is concerned, yes, they have 
helped a lot. A lot of members on this side were in Montreal with 
the people  of Canada. However, I realize that during all that 
<P>

campaign the leader of the third party did not do much to help us to 
win.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I do not think the Prime Minister learned a thing from last 
night.
<P>
	Quebecers last night registered a massive demand for change. 
While Quebecers said no to separation by the narrowest of margins, 
both sides were giving a massive no to the status quo. Yet in his 
speech last night and in his remarks today, all the Prime Minister 
has to offer are the same old meaningless clichés about change that 
almost put this country over the edge.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister say today what changes he is going to 
make in the federal system to make it work for all Canadians? Will 
he be fresh, clear, and specific instead of tiresome, vague, and 
meaningless?
<P>
<B>(1425 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in a federation like Canada we have to talk with the 
premiers too, who during the campaign, contrary to the leader of 
the third party, did everything they could to help me and everybody 
on the no side to win.
<P>
	I had the chance to talk with the premiers yesterday afternoon. 
We discussed a certain possibility of change, not necessarily all 
constitutional. They are willing to work with us. That is the way to 
do that, which is not what the leader of the third party has done. 
Rather than unite with everybody to give a front of a united Canada 
for the referendum, the leader of the third party was always out 
trying to score some cheap political points.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Shameful. 
Mr. Speaker, if I wanted to score cheap political points, I would 
know where to go.
<P>
	A real agenda for change that would address the demands of 
Quebec and other provinces has to have two characteristics: it must 
be within the federal government's ability to implement without 
constitutional wrangling, and it must be capable of commanding 
support among all the provinces, including Quebec. Reform has a 
list of 20 such changes. We call them the new confederation 
proposals.
<P>
	My question will appeal to the ethics of the government. If we 
were to put these new confederation proposals into a brown 
envelope and leave them outside the office of the Deputy Prime 
Minister, would the government be willing to steal them so that 
Canadians could at least have some plan to address the demand for 
change in this country?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if the leader of the third party had been in  Quebec he 
would have realized that nobody in Quebec voted to dismantle 
medicare, free medical care for everybody in Quebec. Nobody 
voted for that. Nobody voted for the agenda of the Reform Party to 
destroy the social safety net that exists in Canada.
<P>
	What the leader of the third party is trying to do at this moment 
is sell its very right wing agenda, to the right of Gingrich. He is 
using this occasion to pass his own political agenda rather than 
arguing for the survival of the country.

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	Last week, the CSN made public the minister's bill on 
unemployment insurance reform. It indicates that, the more 
workers need unemployment insurance, the less help they will get 
from it. The rate of benefits paid to the unemployed will in fact be 
reduced according to the number of weeks they have drawn 
benefits in the past. The minister refused to comment before the 
referendum.
<P>
	Now that the referendum is over, will the minister acknowledge 
that the two-tiered unemployment insurance plan, which he 
claimed last spring to have rejected, is sneaking back into his bill 
and that seasonal workers will be hard hit by his reform?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, whether it was before the vote 
for Canada last night or after the vote for Canada, the reality stays 
the same.
<P>
	What the CSN put forward has no relation to the kinds of 
proposals the government is working on. Any documents they are 
dealing with they are conjuring.
<P>
	As the Prime Minister said, I have not yet presented my 
recommendations to the cabinet. When those recommendations are 
presented and approved after further discussions with some of the 
provinces, we will be very happy to present them in the House. The 
hon. member will be able to see for herself exactly what is in them. 
Until then, I would recommend that the hon. member not buy the 
kind of stuff the CSN was putting out last week.

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have heard a great deal 
about the need for change during the debates of the last several 
weeks.
<P>
	Perhaps the most important change we need to make is to get 
ourselves into having a job system for the 21st century that will 
reach out to the many people who have been unemployed for long 
periods of time and try to create the framework, the context and the 
resources to help them get good jobs to help economic 
development in the regions.
<P>
	One way we can make that change is to shift from an 
unemployment insurance program designed 50 years ago to an 
employment insurance program designed for now and the next 
century. The real interest of the high unemployment areas is to get 
a good job creation system in the country. That is what we intend to 
do.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it has 
been proven that Canadians from sea to sea want absolute equality.
<P>
	In the Confederation of tomorrow what guarantee could the 
Prime Minister give Canadians that every province and every 
individual will be treated equally?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in 1980 we put in the Constitution a charter of rights that 
gave equality to every Canadian.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> With that guarantee 
then, Mr. Speaker, why is the Prime Minister threatening to open 
up the Constitution again? There is no support for it across the 
country.
<P>
	He has said during this debate: ``We will make the changes that 
are needed''. Whatever that code means, whatever the changes 
include, could the Prime Minister guarantee to us that there will be 
no special status for anybody? Just say no.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there are in the Constitution provisions that are not the 
same for everybody. For example, there is a proposition coming 
from Newfoundland at this time, which has a system of education 
that is different from the ones in Ontario and Alberta.
<P>
	Some provisions in the Constitution guarantee forever that there 
will be four seats for the citizens of the province of P.E.I., even if 
the proportion of the voters is  much lower than some in Toronto. 
There is also a provision that one can argue does not guarantee 
absolute equality, but I think it is right for the province of P.E.I. to 
keep its four seats. It was among the first to join Confederation.

Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources 
Development. Through his UI reform bill leaked by the CSN last 
week, the minister, far from helping young people, is set to increase 
very substantially the requirements that first time applicants must 
meet in order to qualify for the support that the UI program should 
provide. The minister refused to confirm anything before the 
referendum.
<P>
	Now that the referendum is over, will the minister admit that his 
bill will increase from 20 to 26 weeks the minimum number of 
weeks of work required to qualify for benefits and exclude 
thousands of young people from unemployment insurance, and that 
the minister's new program will be one more obstacle to their 
access to the labour force?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I have said several times 
now, the proposed employment insurance legislation has not been 
finalized. It has not been presented to cabinet. The hon. member 
would be well advised not to pay attention to any documents 
various groups have of what they think we will be presenting.
<P>
	The hon. member should be looking at the fact that since taking 
office the government has introduced major new employment 
programs for young people. This year alone we will provide 
funding for partnerships with the private sector and with various 
school boards, including many in Quebec, to provide a brand new 
opportunity for over 25,000 young people to get the experience of 
moving from school to work, the vital bridge between formal 
education and work experience education.

First, I would point out to the hon. member that his facts are wrong. 
The reality is that the statistics we have from the Government of 
Quebec show the numbers of people on welfare have dropped over 
the last three months, not increased.
<P>
	Second, I would point out that one of the very strong

	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, for 
two very long years now we have watched the Prime Minister and 
the government overspend by $80 billion. We have watched them 
snooze while people fear for their safety on the streets. We have 
watched them sleepwalk to the edge of a cliff in Quebec. It is time 
for a wake up call over there.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Are we doomed to repeat 
the endless distinct society debate that 30 years of negotiations 
could not resolve? If so, how does he plan to convince nine other 
premiers that it is in their best interest to sign on to inequality?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was very pleased at the big rally in Montreal, where 
there were more than 100,000 people, to see the premiers of 
Ontario, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia 
there to show their solidarity. They showed the Quebec people that 
they wanted Quebec to remain in Canada. They also wanted to 
show their appreciation for the contribution of Quebecers since 
Confederation. I was very proud to see the premiers there. I noted 
there were not many Reform people there.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
holding rallies in the country is a far cry from good strategy.
<P>
	My question is again for the Prime Minister. Will the Prime 
Minister commit today to a process to ensure more authority for the 
provinces by giving them the tools to pursue their distinctiveness 
by decentralizing powers equally in the federation, in particular in 
areas like  tourism, culture, language and natural resources? Give 
an answer, for a change.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, all the powers the member mentioned are provincial 
powers. The only intervention by the federal government is to give 
money to the provinces in these areas. We use our spending power 
to give money in these areas. In the area of culture, for example, 
yes, the province of Quebec receives more than the proportion of 
population because it is where the milieu of the French culture is 
found. The reason a lot of the grants in relation to the French 
language are given to Quebec is that Quebec est le foyer de la 
langue française. We recognize that.
<P>
	However, we do not have the constitutional power in those areas. 
The powers are with the provinces. We sometimes distribute 
money to give an equality of chances to the people. The reality in 
Canada is that we have parts of Canada where people are rich and 
parts of Canada where people are poor. It is the value of the 
Canadian mentality that the parts of Canada that have money help 
the people who need money in other parts of Canada.

Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Cuts in transfer payments to the provinces announced in the last 
federal budget will mean a $650 million shortfall for Quebec next 
year. By 1997-98, the shortfall in Quebec caused by federal 
cutbacks will range anywhere from $1.2 to $1.9 billion, depending 
on the distribution method.
<P>
<B>(1440)</B>
<P>
	Now that the referendum is over, can the Minister of Finance tell 
us on what basis he plans to distribute the Canada social transfer 
among the provinces and if he still intends, as suggested in his 
budget speech, to use population as a criterion, which would mean 
that more than 40 per cent of all cuts made in Canada would be 
made in Quebec alone?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, every time the hon.

which is a very important system by which the federal government

<P>

the derivatives market is an important market in the country. The 
Superintendent of Financial Institutions has taken some major 
steps in the last little while to handle that.

<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Why is this happening 
and when is it going to stop?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will be the defender of British tradition in the House of 
Commons. Under this parliamentary system there is an official 
opposition. We do not choose it; we take it as it comes. The 
tradition is that in committees we allocate jobs according to the 
status of the official opposition. They are members of Parliament. 
They are members of Parliament elected to come to Ottawa.
<P>
	They wanted to break up Canada and they did not succeed 
yesterday, so they are still members of Parliament in Canada and 
they have the right to sit on committees. With respect, it is a

coming from rural Quebec I am happy to defend the British 
tradition.
<P>
<B>(1445 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the reason 
the separatists are in the House is the Liberal people who have sat 
in the House for some 30 years have not dealt with the problem 
before.
<P>
	We have been in the House for 45 days and there has been no 
agenda except for the agenda of the separatists. There has been no 
legislation before us. There has been no fiscal plan. The country is 
leaderless and the government sits and still does not give us any 
leadership.

	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister

made to replace the GST with a tax that would be fair and much 
more effective for consumers and small businesses in Canada.

discussions with the provinces, because this issue requires 
co-operation from both sides.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, that 
effectiveness is always slow to come. I have a supplementary for 
the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Does he still intend, as do his Liberal colleagues on the finance

sale price and to impose that tax on food items and on drugs? Is that 
the type of change proposed by the Minister of Finance to his

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources

with what I announced in my speeches last week. I intend to keep 
my word. How will we proceed? As I said earlier, the matter will 
have to be discussed with the provinces, because there are certain 
ways we can do it with the provinces, and there are other ways we 
can act only here in Parliament. So we are looking at various 
possibilities.
<P>
	As I have always said, I recognized Quebec as a distinct society 
and I did so during the campaign. I supported the Charlottetown 
accord, whereas the Leader of the Opposition did not. I supported 
the Charlottetown accord, which recognized a distinct society. I 
know that the hon. member also supported it. I also know he would 
do so again, if he had another opportunity.
<P>

	The House resumed consideration of Bill C-103, an act to amend 
the Excise Tax Act and the Income Tax Act, as reported (with 
amendment) from the committee; and Motions Nos. 1 and 2.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Just before 
the break for question period the member for York-Simcoe was in 
the middle of her speech, but unfortunately because of other 
parliamentary business she will not be able to finish her speech. 
Therefore I think the House is ready for the question on the first 
motion.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Is the House ready for the question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The question is on Motion No. 1. Is it the pleasure 
of the House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> All those in favour of the motion will please say 
yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> All those opposed will please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> In my opinion the nays have it.
<P>
	I declare the motion lost on division. Therefore Motion No. 2 is 
defeated also.
<P>
	Motion No. 1 negatived.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 3</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-103, in Clause 1, be amended by deleting lines 43 and 44, on page 5 
and lines 1 to 6, on page 6.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: While I have the chance, I want to pass on my 
congratulations to you, Mr. Speaker, and also the congratulations of 
many members of the Canadian Association of Broadcasters for the 
wonderful job he did in this Chamber last Saturday night of 
explaining the history of this place and also reminding broadcasters 
and through them, all Canadians of the value of this great country. I 
just want you to know how deeply people appreciated that.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I am here to address Bill C-103. Specifically in 
Motion No. 3, we are asking that the imposition of the 80 per cent 
excise tax in Bill C-103 be deleted.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16032"> 16032 </A></B>
<P>
	I want to speak to this bill in a larger way. I want to address 
some of the things which came from the hon. member for Don 
Valley West and the member for Rosedale. They were talking 
about how Canadians could not compete in the face of the 
overwhelming economic advantage the Americans have when it 
comes to certain sectors of the economy.
<P>
	I guess we have to remind those hon. members that we have 
heard over and over again the debate on how Canadians cannot 
compete against the Americans. I am going to have to point out that 
for 128 years as a country we have faced competition from a much 
larger and much more powerful country to the south of us, but 
inevitably when the trade barriers are knocked down and we 
compete head to head, Canadians do extremely well.
<P>
	I remind hon. members and I remind the Parliamentary Secretary 
to the Minister of Finance that it was not very long ago during the 
free trade debate when wine producers and grape growers were 
extremely concerned about the effect of free trade on their industry. 
It was going to be the end of the production of wine in Canada. An 
American juggernaut was going to roll across this country's wine 
producing regions, southern Ontario, the Okanagan and other areas.
<P>
<B>(1510 )</B>
<P>
	For crying out loud, it was just a few weeks ago that the Calgary 
<I>Herald</I> ran a big edition about how successful the wineries are in 
the Okanagan region. A member across the way from the Niagara 
region has done extremely well with his winery despite the fact that 
we have free trade and despite the fact the Americans had all the 
advantages of the economy of scale which this government says it 
is so concerned about.
<P>
	The government is using that economy of scale as an argument 
for preventing <I>Sports Illustrated</I> and other magazines from using 
split run technology, getting into Canada and going after 
advertisers in this country. Frankly, those arguments do not hold 
water. The economy of scale has always been there. Instead of 
complaining about it, let us use it to our advantage.
<P>
	When we were talking about this legislation in the finance 
committee a gentleman came forward representing the interests of 
Quebec magazine publishers. He talked about the big bad 
Americans and how France was going to come in and roll over 
magazine publishers. He did not just talk about them, he talked 
about the big bad Swedes, the big bad people from Belgium and the 
Swiss. If my memory serves me correctly, I think we are at least as 
big as those countries. We are at least as economically powerful as 
those countries but he was worried about the effect those 
magazines would have on French publications in Quebec.
<P>
	Instead of whining about this, instead of pretending or 
suggesting we are victims, why do we not simply turn the tables on 
them? Why do we not go after their markets? I  would argue that 
the people of Quebec and the people of Canada can produce 
magazines and editorial content that can compete with the best in 
the world. There is no reason in the world we cannot be selling that 
product to the French speaking population in Switzerland. There is 
no reason we cannot go into Belgium. There is no reason we cannot 
go into French speaking and English speaking countries around the 
world. What are we afraid of?
<P>
	I pointed out earlier today that I was at the broadcasters 
convention this weekend. The broadcasting entity CanWest Global 
is doing extremely well in New Zealand and Australia. Just the 
other day Power Corp. out of Quebec as a conglomerate won a bid 
for the fifth channel in the U.K. I am told that Power Corp. is the 
largest broadcaster in Europe. It is a Canadian company.
<P>
	What are we afraid of? What is the parliamentary secretary and 
the government afraid of? Our magazine industry can compete. We 
do it in every other sector. Why in the world should this sector be 
any different? Let us forget about these phoney arguments which 
are old and have been proven to be false in every other sector. Why 
in the world can we not push ahead and compete freely? Certainly 
the Americans compete freely in the magazine publishing industry.
<P>
	I heard these straw men being thrown up by the member for 
Rosedale about how the Americans are protectionist. I agree they 
are in many sectors but they are not in this one. Let us go head to 
head. Two wrongs have never made a right. No one agrees with 
protectionism in this House or at least members on our side do not.
<P>
	Let us forget about those straw men arguments. Let us push 
ahead with real free trade. Let us approve this amendment and get 
on with the business of making sure Canadians can profit from 
their expertise in this industry.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the House for the opportunity 
to rise on Motion No. 3 put forward by the hon. critic from the third 
party, the member for Medicine Hat.
<P>
	He asked a rhetorical question as to why the parliamentary 
secretary for finance was afraid of competition. I would like to set 
the record straight. Neither the parliamentary secretary nor his 
government are afraid of competition.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	If you look at the question differently and ask what we are proud 
of, we are very proud of the Canadian magazine industry. We are 
very proud of the fact that we have within Canada a very strong and 
flourishing industry. In fact one of the associations involved, the 
Canadian Magazine Publishers' Association, has about 300 
members. This gives you an idea of the strength being brought to 
the Canadian market by the Canadian industry.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16033"> 16033 </A></B>
<P>
	This strength has not been there by a wish or by a magic wand. 
The strength of the Canadian magazine industry is in fact 
predicated upon 30 years of actions and 30 years of considerations 
by the federal government. It began with a study that is known 
as the O'Leary royal commission and went on to be studied later 
in the 1960s by Senator Davey, who is still of course in the upper 
chamber, who looked at the problems in the Canadian 
communication industry.
<P>
	It is not simply a case of taking a look at one segment or the 
other. I was happy to see that the hon. member got a chance to meet 
the broadcasters and talk to them about some of their ambitions. He 
too probably heard from the Canadian Broadcasters' Association 
and how proud they are of the regulatory regime, which allowed 
companies like CanWest to grow and prosper.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> No, actually they are 
not.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> I can tell you from many conversations with the 
people from CanWest that they would not exist if a licence had not 
been given to them by the Government of Canada.
<P>
	The regulatory framework set up by this government in previous 
times is what makes it possible for that industry to get together on 
an annual basis. We are very proud as Liberals of the contribution 
we have made. Those people, because of the base they have in 
Canada, have gone off now to compete with the world. But you do 
not compete with the world until you have a company, and you do 
not have a company until you have a regulatory base. They did not 
have a regulatory base until they had a good Liberal government. It 
is as simple and as straightforward as that.
<P>
	In the publishing industry the key thing to remember, which has 
not been pointed out perhaps enough in this debate, is that subject 
to questions of pornography and so forth, any magazine that wishes 
can enter the Canadian market and be circulated and read. It does 
not matter whether you are coming from the American market, 
from the European market, or anywhere else in the world. You can 
come into Canada, put it on the news-stand, set a price, and people 
read it. That is competition.
<P>
	What Canadian publishers have worried about and we as a 
government have worried about for the last 30 years is the ability of 
larger companies to use the strength of their organization to 
undercut the advertising market within Canada. We were 
convinced originally, when we set out these measures, that certain 
protections were needed for the Canadian industry. As a result of 
the steps we took, we have seen an industry flourish. We have seen 
people have careers in writing. We have seen Canadian subjects 
come up. We have seen a great deal of research done. We have seen 
magazines make a profit and we have seen a whole new set of 
publications that  simply were not available to the Canadian reader 
before that.
<P>
	From time to time governments have to review their structure to 
make sure they are up to date with technology. The broadcasting 
industry is changing dramatically and quickly because of changes 
in technology dealing with direct broadcasting techniques, new 
uses of cable, new uses of the telephone system. We are working 
hard with the CRTC to keep up with these changes. In fact the 
government just appointed a commission to look at digital 
television to see the impact it may have on communication 
systems.
<P>
	We have a change in technology, which made the regulatory 
framework we were involved with obsolete. I am not going to 
speak to the motivation and whether it was done by happenstance 
or whatever, but somebody saw an opportunity to come into the 
market and make use of a split run to affect negatively the 
advertising dollars available to the Canadian industry.
<P>
	We did not move on this quickly. The last government set up a 
task force. The last government announced publicly that it was 
concerned about what had happened, that it was likely to make 
changes. That task force met, studied the issue for close to two 
years, and made public its recommendations. Perhaps later I will 
come to those recommendations. They suggested that the 
government update its regulatory framework to take into account 
the new technology. That is what the nature of Bill C-103 is. It is an 
updating of a strategy that has shown itself to be very positive, very 
influential, and supportive of the Canadian publishing industry. 
Those who know Canadian publishing know it is not an industry 
that creates tremendous wealth. It is not one in which there are 
moguls involved in huge companies. They are very much small 
shops in Canada, where people take a great deal of pride in their 
magazines.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	I have a very close friend whose magazine unfortunately did not 
go as far as he would have liked it to have gone, but the love of that 
magazine captured his life for a couple years. He enjoyed trying to 
strike out a market and see it published. Among his friends there is 
a little club of people with failed magazines. It is a proposition that 
is enticing and daunting at the same time. People lose a lot of 
money in magazines. At the same time, the desire to nourish along 
a project and the desire to build something unique in the Canadian 
market is something we admire as a government. We did not want 
to see practices emerge that in fact make it more difficult to survive 
and make the publication industry more fragile.
<P>
	I was struck by the arguments put forward by the Canadian 
Magazine Publishers' Association when they appeared, I believe 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16034"> 16034 </A></B>
<P>
two weeks ago, in front of the finance committee. Their arguments 
were coherent and logical.  They understood their responsibility in 
terms of a product people will read.
<P>
	Everyone in the House probably goes by a news-stand on their 
way to the airport to go home for the weekend. They probably pick 
up some sort of magazine. I do not think any of us would stop and 
not buy something because it was from another country. I do not 
think we would say as a government we do not want to see these 
publications, not at all. If we look at the news-stands we see there is 
easy access to magazines from other countries right in front of us. I 
think we should remember that. We should not raise the spectre that 
somehow the government has arbitrarily taken away the right to 
distribute a magazine in Canada or the right to make profit out of 
this Canadian market.
<P>
	I will bet there are many Canadians, including myself, who 
regularly buy magazines from other countries and do not think 
twice about it because of the news and perspectives they bring us.
<P>
	Simply stated, without Canadian advertising there would not be 
a Canadian magazine industry. Therefore, we have to make sure 
there are opportunities for those advertising dollars to be accessed 
by the Canadian publisher. That is the intent of this act and will 
continue to be the intent of this government in support of the 
industry.
<P>
	In speaking directly about the amendment to Bill C-103 as 
proposed by the member for Medicine Hat, let me make the 
following comment. Motion No. 3 would prevent the application of 
the proposed excise tax on split-run editions altogether. This 
motion is therefore inconsistent with the vote of this House to 
adopt the ways and means motion and the approval in principle 
given to the bill by the House at second reading.
<P>
	By debating the imposition section of the tax on split-run 
editions, this motion fails to recognize the important objective the 
split-run tax is intended to achieve. In particular, the tax will update 
the government's policy instruments in support of the Canadian 
magazine industry and therefore allow the government to support 
the continued existence of a viable and original Canadian magazine 
industry. That is why we are sticking by our original intent in this 
and will not support this particular motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
speak to Motion No. 3, but I do want to comment on a couple of 
things that were said earlier this afternoon by the member for Don 
Valley West and the member for Rosedale. They both talked about 
how our Canadian magazine industry would not be able to compete 
if they did not have some type of protection. I reject that notion. 
They are talking about national security interests. They are talking 
about how we will be dominated by the United States because it is 
so much bigger and has so much more economy of scale.
<P>
<B>(1525 )</B>
<P>
	My colleague from Medicine Hat talked earlier about other 
experiences with free trade. When we entered into a free trade 
agreement with the United States we heard the argument over and 
over that many of our industries would take a mortal hit and not be 
able to compete.
<P>
	We know that this government was not in favour of the free trade 
agreement. They did a flip-flop at the last minute. Now I really 
question their sincerity about their commitment to free trade.
<P>
	What is the experience with other industries? My colleague 
spoke about the wine industry and how well they are doing. I can 
tell members about agriculture, the industry I have some 
knowledge of.
<P>
	Our biggest fear is the destruction of an industry. If we have 
subsidies and protectionism, we are hurt far more from that than we 
are from making trade rules that let us compete internationally on a 
basis of fair play. We think we can compete a lot better on the basis 
of quality product than we can on the basis of having to subsidize, 
because we cannot compete with the treasuries of other countries. 
Canada is simply too small.
<P>
	When we talk about security, what about agriculture, food 
supply security? Do we need regulations to protect that? We found 
that we do not. The cattle industry is a good example. There was a 
big fear that the cattle industry in Canada would be basically 
decimated with free trade. What is our experience? Since 1988 we 
have had something like a 40 per cent increase in cattle sales to the 
United States.
<P>
	We can do very well on the basis of a level playing field and free 
trade. Our cultural industries can also do very well. They can 
compete head to head. We have to produce a quality product to do 
that, but we are up to it.
<P>
	The amendment we are talking about today strikes out the 
section of the bill that would impose an excise tax on periodicals 
equal to 80 per cent of the value of their advertisements. Our 
amendment goes to the heart of the bill and strikes out its most 
offensive part. It is assumed that this excise tax will never be 
collected because it will effectively kill the Canadian edition of 
<I>Sports Illustrated</I> and any similar ventures that could be on the 
drawing board.
<P>
	It is folly for this government to attempt to protect Canadian 
culture in this or any other manner. If our cultural industries 
produce quality products of interest to the Americans or any others 
around the world, let them go out and sell to those markets in 
whatever way they can based on the marketplace. I am confident 
they will be able to compete. If Canadians prefer to buy American 
culture products that have been spiced up with some Canadian 
content, by all means let them, but I do not think we should be 
using cultural protectionism here because it probably hurts our 
industry rather than helps it.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 4</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-103, in Clause 1, be amended by replacing lines 18 and 19, on page 6, 
with the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``39. Where, before the date that this Act is assented to, a particular number of''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise and address Bill 
C-103, particularly this amendment.
<P>
	This amendment is designed to delete the clause that really takes 
an arbitrary poke at one particular magazine, <I>Sports Illustrated</I>. 
The legislation is retroactive and most parliamentarians probably 
feel it is not a good way to approach these things.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	I want to say a little more about the principle behind 
protectionism and whether or not we can all of a sudden set aside a 
particular sector on the basis that it is somehow different, even 
though the facts show that it ain't necessarily so. We have seen this 
over and over again in all kinds of sectors of the economy.
<P>
	When we discussed it in committee we raised the issue of the 
retail industry. One thing I pointed out was that we had 
contradictory ways of doing business. We have the retail sector and 
all kinds of American companies coming into the country and 
doing well. By the way, Canadian companies also go into the 
United States and do well because they are able to provide some 
value to the consumers in those markets. It may create a situation 
where people can go into a store and perhaps get something for less 
than they had been paying because somebody has seen they can 
make a profit by offering products for less. When that happens 
consumers have more choice, better value and ultimately more 
money in their pockets as a result.
<P>
	Let me apply the debate to what has happened with <I>Sports 
Illustrated</I>. <I>Sports Illustrated</I> was coming into the country. It was 
offering the advertisers a product that was at least competitive or 
perhaps at even a little less than what Canadian advertisers were 
charging. That was despite the fact that <I>Sports Illustrated</I> did not 
have access to the tax deductibility provisions available to 
magazines that carry 75 per cent Canadian content. It was still able 
to offer extremely good value.
<P>
	People will ask what that does for Canada. It allows advertisers 
either to get more bang for their buck through their advertising, 
thereby increasing the reach of their advertising message, or it 
allows them to improve their bottom line, to have more profit. 
What does that do for the country? If there is more profit of course 
there is more disposable income that can be spent on other goods 
and services. That is basic economics, economics 101.
<P>
	Even though cultural product is difficult to define, I do not buy 
the argument that just because it is a cultural product we can throw 
the economic arguments out the window. They apply in every other 
sector and they certainly apply in the area of culture.
<P>
	I encourage my friends across the way to remember that 
although culture is important we cannot go around suggesting that 
it runs by a different set of economics. That is not the case at all.
<P>
	I have pointed out with respect to other Canadian cultural 
industries that given a chance they will prosper. They do not need 
government intervention. They do not need government protection. 
We see it over and over again, certainly in the cultural industries 
but in other industries as well.
<P>
	It is a very arbitrary move to go back, to pick out SI in particular 
and to say it is not allowed to do that. Even going beyond that I 
would say it is time we truly had free trade in the country and truly 
applied it to the cultural sector. Canadians would take advantage 
and turn the tables on the Americans and the rest of the world 
because we have a superior product. We have the best artists, the 
best actors and the best writers in the world. They could do battle 
with any country in the world and not only compete but win.
<P>
	I am asking the House to adopt the measure and ultimately 
defeat Bill C-103.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak 
on the last of the amendments proposed by the third party through 
the work done by the member for Medicine Hat.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16036"> 16036 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	The issue of split runs that we are talking about is very important 
to the country and, as I said earlier in the debate, has an historical 
context. One has to go back to  the O'Leary royal commission in 
the early sixties and be familiar with the work of Senator Keith 
Davey. A decade later we dealt with the newspaper industry. 
Canada has constantly had to go back to look at the vehicles it 
should be using to promote its own culture.
<P>
	This will not be an exclusionary role. This will not push away 
other meaningful cultures. We are very involved, for example, with 
the American culture. They are our best neighbours, as they have 
shown in recent weeks, and perhaps our most important ally in the 
world. It will also put into context that which we have to do within 
Canada to promote Canadian culture.
<P>
	In so doing we try to make sure people from around the world 
feel welcome in our markets. If they have products they would like 
to distribute in the Canadian market, whether it be films, television, 
magazines or books, they are readily available to all Canadians.
<P>
	In my former life I was an academic. Nobody more than 
somebody trained as an academic can feel the pressure of 
censorship, the pressure of not having access to information to 
make sure they can contribute to the dialogue in their disciplines, in 
the public and with our students. It is essential to have access to 
information that no one else has filtered.
<P>
	The approach of the government is not in any way, shape or form 
to prohibit access to materials of benefit to Canadian sports fans. I 
know the Speaker has probably picked up an occasional <I>Sports 
Illustrated</I>. I have looked at the <I>New Yorker</I> cartoons to pass the 
time on a flight back to Winnipeg. These things we love to do and 
would love to share with other countries.
<P>
	The Canadian magazine industry has been a particularly 
vulnerable and difficult industry. We are proud of the way it has 
responded to measures in the past 30 years and we hope it will 
continue to do so.
<P>
	The cornerstone of our current policy as embodied in Bill C-103 
is not the work of a group of officials working secretly in a 
department or of an industry led group trying to push through some 
protectionist measures. Rather it is a function as a result of the 
work done by a task force set up in 1993 by another government to 
deal with the issue posed by a Canadian edition of <I>Sports 
Illustrated</I>.
<P>
	In chapter VII the task force talks about a renewed framework of 
support. Because this report is pivotal to our understanding of what 
we are trying to do, I thought I would take some time in the House 
to read some key paragraphs into the record so that we allunderstand why the government is proposing what it is proposing. 
In part it states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Free speech would lose much of its potency if there were no Canadian 
magazines. Without the means to express a distinctive voice speaking to a 
Canadian audience, cultural expression, social cohesion and a sense of national 
destiny would be impaired, if not irrevocably damaged.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As part of their heritage, Canadians are doubly fortunate to have unparalleled 
access to publications from around the world. It is the task force's desire to 
maintain this freedom of choice, and the measures it is proposing do nothing to 
deny Canadians the right to purchase the magazines of their choice. We cannot 
make our borders impenetrable even if we wanted to, which we decidedly do 
not.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The object of the task force recommendations is not to discourage readership 
of foreign magazines, but to maintain an environment in which Canadian 
magazines can grow and prosper in Canada alongside imported magazines. This 
is a high-wire balancing act that the task force is attempting to accomplish.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The measures we are recommending are consistent with the broad principles 
of the cultural and media policies of successive federal governments since the 
1930s. These policies have been developed in response to the fact that the 
cultural industries in this country-film, television, sound recordings, books 
and magazines-are largely dominated by foreign products.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If left to market forces alone, a day could arrive when Canadians would no 
longer enjoy the choice that they have today between foreign cultural products 
and those developed for the Canadian market. There simply would be no 
Canadian product because of the relatively small size and the vulnerability of 
our cultural industries.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	These are words of warning from a group that has spent a long 
time looking at the issue. It goes on to state:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Government of Canada has adopted a variety of policies and measures to 
strengthen the viability of Canadian cultural producers: it promotes, for 
example, Canadian ownership and content in the broadcast media; it requires 
the review of investment by foreigners in businesses relating to Canada's 
cultural heritage and national identity; and it encourages Canadian ownership 
and original content in the newspaper and magazine industries.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The recommendations of the task force follow in this tradition, while at the 
same time seeking to ensure that Canada's rights and obligations under 
international trading arrangements, such as the GATT, the FTA and the NAFTA, 
are respected. We have also been careful to ensure that the measures we are 
proposing represent a proportionate response to the problems being faced by 
Canadian magazines, which have been outlined in detail in the body of this 
report. We are convinced that what is being proposed interferes as little as 
possible with freedom of expression or choice. Indeed, in the final analysis, we 
are seeking to expand choice by ensuring the continued availability of 
magazines with original content.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Later it concludes with the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Although favouring the development of original editorial content, regardless 
of country of origin, goes beyond the narrower focus of promoting only content 
of Canadian origin, the task force is of the view that, on balance, it is better to 
aim wide and comply with trade obligations by promoting original content than 
to target a narrow field and end up in protracted disputes with Canada's 
principal trading partners by promoting Canadian content alone. In other 
words, although it is quite obvious that the task force is concerned with the 
survival of magazines expressing a Canadian perspective and view of the world, 
it believes that the best way to achieve that objective is to promote original 
content, regardless of country of origin.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16037"> 16037 </A></B>
<P>
	By promoting magazines with original content, we will meet 
the objectives and at the same time meet Canada's international 
trade obligations.
<P>
	In conclusion I will spend a minute on the specifics of the 
motion proposed by the member for Medicine Hat on behalf of the 
Reform Party. Motion No. 4 would allow split run periodicals 
distributed in Canada to be exempted from the split run tax based 
on the number of split run issues distributed in Canada during the 
12-month period prior to the day the bill receives royal assent. The 
motion would therefore fundamentally alter the limited 
grandfathering treatment of split run periodicals distributed in 
Canada that is proposed in the bill and is therefore inconsistent 
with the vote of the House to adopt the ways and means motion and 
the approval in principle given to the bill by the House at second 
reading.
<P>
	The motion ignores the fact that on two occasions in 1993 the 
government clearly warned magazine publishers that should they 
decide during the work of the task force on the Canadian magazine 
industry to undertake any new publishing activity that would 
contravene or sidestep the government's policy objectives for the 
magazine industry, they would be doing so at their own risk. The 
motion would also send the wrong signal in that it would reward 
magazine publishers whose actions, while not directly 
contravening tariff code 9958, offend the spirit of the legislation. 
For this reason the government opposes the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Motion 
No. 4 deletes the cut off date which qualifies <I>Sports Illustrated</I> 
from issuing split run decisions in Canada but allows others like 
<I>Reader's Digest</I> to continue. It is ironic that the government is 
bringing in legislation to cut off <I>Sports Illustrated</I> but it is going to 
let <I>Readers Digest</I> continue with the same thing. Obviously <I>Sports 
Illustrated</I> is being unfairly targeted.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	Changing the date of the grandfathering provision allows <I>Sports 
Illustrated</I> to escape the provisions of the bill and averts the trade 
war that could result if <I>Sports Illustrated</I> is suddenly prevented 
from issuing split run editions.
<P>
	It is true that Canadian culture was exempted under NAFTA's 
trade rules, but the Americans did retain the right to retaliate in 
kind if they so wished. The government believes that the 
Americans cannot and will not do that because the bill uses a 
roundabout way to protect Canadian periodicals. I think the 
government is wrong. Americans can make life very miserable for 
Canadian exporters in all kinds of ways and we may see that 
retaliation. They can do that whether it is justified or not, but in this 
case they definitely have the right to retaliate. Some other industry 
is going to bear the brunt of this ill conceived policy.
<P>
	This bill should raise a red flag for the government. Even if the 
government does not have problems with the idea of this bill, it 
should at least recognize it as a provocation for a trade dispute and 
realize that the timing is all wrong. All we need is to get hit in 
another industry with retaliation because of what is happening with 
this ill conceived bill.
<P>
	I support my colleague's amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réginald Bélair (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
a pleasure for me to take part in this report stage debate.
<P>
	Bill C-103 is one element in the longstanding policy supported 
by various governments in Ottawa. Governments long ago 
recognized the importance of the Canadian magazine industry and 
the affirmation of the Canadian personality. Allow me to take this 
opportunity to describe the background of the various measures put 
forward by the Canadian government in an effort to support the 
development of this major sector of our cultural industries.
<P>
	The Canadian government has been concerned about the status 
and survival of the Canadian magazine industry almost since the 
beginning of the 20th century. Government's original concern was 
simply to ensure that Canadians had access to periodicals from 
around the world. It was a question of communication, in other 
words, the possibility for Canadians to have reasonable access to 
periodicals wherever they live.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Another major concern of the government, editorial content, 
came later. Initially, the aim of federal policy was to give 
Canadians an opportunity to enjoy and appreciate the arts, so the 
Canada Council was founded in 1957.
<P>
	The emphasis was on the quality and quantity of the cultural 
product in Canada. There was no specific attempt to find out 
whether Canadian interests were involved in the creation or 
production of this product. There was no concern for culture in the 
broader sense, only for the arts. Since 1957, the Canada Council 
has supported periodicals of an artistic or scientific nature with 
subsidies, modest though they may be.
<P>
	A third concern arose sometime before the Canada Council was 
created and has become increasingly important in the past 30 years. 
I am referring to the issue of Canadian content and Canadian 
cultural identity in the broader sense.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	While we were concerned with promoting Canadian ownership 
and content, we realized that we must not close the door to foreign 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16038"> 16038 </A></B>
<P>
periodicals. We simply must prevent them from gaining too many 
advantages on the periodicals market in terms of economic 
advantages arising from intensive production, distribution, access 
to capital, or a well established reputation among Canadian 
readers. The key to this policy is advertising and postal 
distribution.
<P>
	Thanks to legislative measures implemented progressively 
pursuant to the recommendations of the 1961 Royal Commission 
on Publications, commonly known as the O'Leary commission, 
and the 1970 Special Senate Committee on Mass Media, magazines 
printed in other countries were prevented from entering Canada 
when they contained advertising directed specifically at the 
Canadian market. Canadian advertisers were thus encouraged to 
place ads in Canadian magazines.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to elaborate on the role played by the O'Leary 
commission in identifying measures to promote the development 
of the Canadian periodical industry. In 1961, only 25 per cent of the 
magazines distributed in Canada were Canadian. It became 
imperative for the Canadian government to do something about this 
situation. This led to the appointment of the Royal Commission of 
Inquiry on Publications.
<P>
	Following a long series of hearings and extensive research, the 
commission was able to assemble all the elements it needed to 
establish the status of the Canadian periodical industry in the early 
sixties. It was clear that the industry was facing serious problems 
and that the government had to act. Members of the commission 
found that between the two sole sources of magazine revenue, 
circulation and advertising, there was a durable and mutually 
beneficial symbiosis which they defined as follows, and I quote:
<P>
	``Behind all this is an important spiralling action, fundamental to 
periodical publishing; the larger a periodical's circulation, the more 
advertising it can attract; the greater its advertising revenue, the 
more it can afford to spend on editorial content; the more it can 
spend on editorial content, the better its chances of obtaining more 
circulation.''
<P>
	It became clear that advertising revenue was essential to the 
Canadian periodical industry. Consequently, the government 
decided to do what was necessary to channel Canadian advertising 
revenue to Canadian periodicals. The development of a policy for 
this purpose was instrumental in creating a strong financial basis 
for the industry.
<P>
	Section 19 of the Income Tax Act was adopted in 1965 and 
became one of the main tools for implementing the federal 
government's policy on magazine publishing. According to this 
section, only purchases of advertising aimed at the Canadian 
market and inserted in Canadian periodicals were tax deductible. 
This section also provided that to be eligible for the tax deduction, 
the taxpayer had to advertise in a magazine with at least 75  per 
cent Canadian ownership and a ratio of original editorial content of 
at least 80 per cent.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Second, the members of the Royal Commission on Publications 
recommended that foreign periodicals containing advertising 
intended for the Canadian market should be denied entry. Customs 
tariff code 9958 was created in 1965 pursuant to this 
recommendation. Since these measures were implemented, 
Canadian magazines have multiplied and diversified.
<P>
	In 1959, before the introduction of these two measures, 
Canadian magazines represented 23.3 per cent of the magazines 
distributed in Canada. The proportion rose to 29.9 per cent in 1971 
and 39.4 per cent in 1981. In 1992 Canadian magazines represented 
67.6 per cent of the magazines distributed in Canada.
<P>
	These mechanisms must now be updated in response to the 
advent of new technology in recent years. The electronic 
transmission of proof pages produced in other countries for 
printing and distribution in Canada was not envisaged when these 
policy instruments were designed in 1965.
<P>
	The need to modernize government structural measures became 
particularly clear in January 1993 when Time Warner officially 
announced its intention to publish <I>Sports Illustrated</I> in Canada. In 
an effort to avoid the application of tariff code 9958, Time Warner 
chose to print <I>Sports Illustrated</I> in Canada using editorial material 
transmitted electronically from the United States. This situation 
demonstrated the existence of a loophole in our structural measures 
and the urgent need to update the Canadian policy on magazine 
publishing.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	On March 26, 1993, the government announced the creation of a 
task force responsible for reviewing the various issues affecting the 
Canadian magazine industry, including its trends and evolution, the 
Canadian advertising market, the impact of technological progress, 
the international aspects, the regulations, and the effectiveness of 
current policy implementation measures.
<P>
	The government wanted to ensure that the measures taken to 
promote the development of this industry were up to date and 
effective. These measures included Customs Tariff Code 9958 and 
section 19 of the Income Tax Act mentioned earlier.
<P>
	Barely two weeks after announcing the creation of the task force, 
the government said that this task force on the Canadian magazine 
industry would have two joint chairmen and would be composed of 
volunteer experts representing Canadian magazine publishers, 
advertisers, consumers and the legal community.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16039"> 16039 </A></B>
<P>
	The joint chairmen of the task force on the Canadian magazine 
industry, Patrick O'Callaghan, journalist and  former editor at 
Southam Press, and Roger Tassé, former deputy minister of 
justice, carried out their mandate with the help of a group of seven 
volunteer consultants representing all regions of the country. They 
came from the advertising industry, consumer associations and the 
Canadian magazine industry; some even had some experience in 
international trade.
<P>
	This review of the measures in place to help the Canadian 
magazine industry was aimed at proposing other measures that 
would enable the government to meet its political objective of 
making Canadian information and ideas accessible to Canadians 
through truly Canadian magazines.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In March 1994 when the task force on the Canadian magazine 
industry submitted its final report, the government again 
acknowledged the valuable contribution the Canadian magazine 
industry makes to our economy, our culture and our heritage. On 
December 22, 1994 the government announced its response to the 
recommendations contained in the final report of the task force on 
the Canadian magazine industry. The government indicated then 
that it would address all of the task force's recommendations, 
including the recommendation for a new excise tax on all split run 
magazines containing advertising directed at Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The government then stated that an excise tax would be imposed 
on each copy of a split run edition at the rate of 80 per cent of the 
value of all the advertisements contained in the edition. Periodicals 
that would otherwise be subject to the tax are exempted from the 
tax based on the number of split run editions that were distributed 
in Canada before March 26, 1993, when the creation of the task 
force was announced.
<P>
	Finally, this bill demonstrates the federal government's 
continued commitment to promote the growth of a Canadian 
magazine industry that is viable, original and dynamic.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John O'Reilly (Victoria-Haliburton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to speak on Bill C-103.
<P>
	Bill C-103 will play a major role in maintaining a vibrant and 
flourishing Canadian magazine industry. I would like to present the 
House with the broader perspective of the government's ongoing 
commitment to this industry. This bill should be understood in the 
context of the long established tradition of government support to 
the Canadian magazine industry as well as the industry's 
contribution to the economy.
<P>
	Most important, in a country where natural geography makes 
communications difficult, magazines play a key unifying role. 
Canadian periodicals are an essential  medium of cultural 
expression for Canadians. They serve as channels for conveying 
Canadian ideas, information and values. They are an integral part 
of the process whereby Canadians define themselves as a nation. 
Moreover, beyond the direct social and cultural impact of the 
Canadian magazine industry there are sizeable indirect effects 
which contribute to the smooth functioning of the Canadian 
economy.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	Canadian publications, both consumer and business, inform, 
educate and entertain but they also are an important advertising 
vehicle for Canadian products and services. While it is true there 
are other mass media which can reach consumers, the Canadian 
trade press fills a unique role in the economy by providing an 
affordable marketing tool for Canadian business and industrial 
suppliers.
<P>
	These producers and services often face stiff competition from 
foreign companies which reach Canadian customers through 
spill-over advertising in American trade periodicals. In the absence 
of an active Canadian trade press reaching Canadian customers, an 
important segment of our economy would be left without a major 
communications and advertising vehicle.
<P>
	Unfortunately Canadian magazines are confronted with a series 
of unique challenges: massive penetration of the Canadian market 
by imported magazines; the relatively small size of the Canadian 
population and its dispersion over a vast territory; the openness of 
Canadians to foreign cultural products; the effect of cover prices of 
imported magazines on the Canadian price structure; the impact of 
overflow advertising on the potential advertising market in Canada.
<P>
	Even if the magazine industry had flourished culturally with 
over 1,300 titles, its financial position is fragile, with overall pretax 
profits of less than 6 per cent on revenues of $795 million in 
1993-94.
<P>
	In my opening remarks I mentioned the Canadian government 
has supported the domestic magazine industry and will continue to 
do so for many reasons. The principal reason is the importance 
Canadians place on having a means of expressing their unique 
identity and the difficult and challenging environment which the 
Canadian magazine industry faces.
<P>
	The need for structural measures of support for the Canadian 
magazine industry has long been recognized by successive 
Canadian governments. Over the years a number of policy and 
program instruments have been designed and put into place which 
help to ensure the development of the Canadian magazine industry 
while not restricting the sale of imported periodicals in Canada.
<P>
	Among them, the publications distribution assistance program, 
better known as the postal subsidy program, is one of the earliest 
nation building programs. It is designed to unify a country where 
natural geography  makes communication difficult. Its main objec-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16040"> 16040 </A></B>
<P>
tives are to support Canadian cultural identity and sovereignty, to 
ensure affordable access to subscriptions for Canadian periodicals 
and to provide stability in the level of distribution costs for 
Canadian periodicals in order to permit publishers to develop and 
implement long term business plans.
<P>
	Canadian consumer magazines have limited access to Canadian 
news stands. Less than one-quarter of Canadian magazine 
circulation revenue is derived from news stand sales. As a result, 
the industry relies on subscriptions to reach its audience. The postal 
subsidy, which finances concessionary postal rates for Canadian 
magazines, has been an important instrument in helping the 
industry to reach its market.
<P>
	In 1989 this program was subjected to a cut of 50 per cent, from 
$220 million to $110 million, as part of a larger government-wide 
exercise to reduce public expenditures. I am pleased to say that in 
developing a plan for the implementation of the cut, a decision was 
made to focus support on subscriber paid periodicals versus 
non-paid or free publications. Furthermore, it was believed that 
periodicals, which typically have a national or regional focus and 
rely exclusively on mail distribution, should take priority over 
local publications which have alternative means of distribution.
<P>
	As a result, the most vulnerable component of the industry was 
protected then and also more recently when the government had to 
reduce once again the amount of available funding. For the past 
two years we have limited the increase of the subsidized rates to 5 
per cent a year. Therefore the postal program still enables Canadian 
magazines to reach rural or remote readers at a reasonable cost.
<P>
	Fiscal measures provide another useful tool to support the 
magazine publishing industry without investing a considerable 
amount of money. Two fiscal measures encourage Canadian 
advertisers to use Canadian magazines to reach Canadian readers. 
The first measure, section 19 of the Income Tax Act, has been in 
place since 1965. For advertisements aimed directly at the 
Canadian market section 19 limits tax deductions of advertising 
expenditures to advertisements placed in Canadian magazines. A 
Canadian magazine is defined as one which is 75 per cent Canadian 
owned and controlled and whose editorial content is 80 per cent 
different from the editorial content of any other periodical.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	The second measures is customs tariff code 9958. Tariff code 
9958 prohibits the physical importation into Canada of split runs or 
special editions of periodicals whose editorial content is 
substantially the same as the original edition except for the 
advertising which has been purchased especially to reach a 
Canadian audience.
<P>
	Until recently the tariff code dissuaded offshore magazines from 
soliciting advertising in the Canadian market. Moreover, it 
succeeded in doing so through voluntary compliance. These fiscal 
measures were put in place to ensure that the Canadian magazine 
industry had access to Canadian advertising revenues. There is no 
evidence that our current policy has made the Canadian industry 
any less efficient or less profit conscious than its foreign 
counterparts.
<P>
	Financial support is provided to a number of cultural and 
scholarly publications through the Canada Council, the Social 
Science and Humanities Research Council and through a modest 
distribution program administered directly by the Department of 
Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	Another initiative is the cultural industries development fund 
which was established in 1990 with a budget allocation of $33 
million. Its mandate is to provide Canadian owned and controlled 
firms within the cultural industries with a range of flexible 
financing services with an emphasis on investment loans.
<P>
	The CIDF was created in order to make loan money available to 
Canadian owned and Canadian controlled cultural firms to 
compensate for the shortage of capital available to Canadian 
cultural businesses and improve their financial situation, the 
intention being that these firms will achieve a sound financial base 
through the fund and thereby be eligible at some later date for 
conventional bank financing. The fund was established to reinforce 
and stimulate the growth of Canadian cultural enterprises which 
have proven to be dynamic and which have demonstrated their 
ability to improve their competitive position in the marketplace.
<P>
	The magazine industry is an active user of the cultural industries 
development fund, having set up a travelling consultant program in 
addition to accessing loans through the fund.
<P>
	The reluctance on the part of financial institutions to create a 
new financing instrument, the degree of risk involved and the 
perceived low earning potential of the magazine industry justify 
the government's establishment of mechanisms such as the CIDF. 
With more than 20 per cent of the loans awarded and a repayment 
rate of more than 90 per cent, the magazine industry has 
demonstrated its professionalism and its managerial expertise.
<P>
	We can conclude that all of these federal measures have served 
the industry well. However, with the arrival of the new 
technological contribution to an increasingly competitive 
marketplace Canadian businesses must adapt to those market 
changes and secure and invest new capital in order to bring 
themselves up to date with modern technology. It is the 
government's role to review its initiatives and to make sure they 
still correspond to the new market realities.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16041"> 16041 </A></B>
<P>
	Technology has progressed far beyond what could have been 
foreseen in 1965 when the tariff code 9958 was introduced as a 
measure of the government's support for the Canadian periodical 
industry. New technological developments have changed the 
dynamics of the publication industry. For example, it is now 
possible to transmit information electronically. Thus it is now 
possible to bypass international borders and circumvent tariff code 
9958.
<P>
	The proposed amendments to the Excise Tax Act will contribute 
to maintaining the integrity of Canada's longstanding policy on 
split runs. The proposed amendment to the Income Tax Act will 
add an anti-avoidance rule to section 19 of the act. The purpose of 
this provision is to ensure that newspapers and periodicals that 
claim to be Canadian are Canadian owned and controlled for the 
purposes of the act.
<P>
	The Canadian government has been consistent. Its magazine 
policy has not changed. What the federal government is doing with 
these amendments to the Excise Tax Act and the Income Tax Act is 
modernizing its policy instruments. In this way the entire range of 
government policy and program instruments can better achieve the 
overall objective of a vital and flourishing Canadian magazine 
industry.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
happy to take part in this debate today because Bill C-103 is one of 
the many measures the government has over time designed to assist 
in the development of Canada's cultural industries.
<P>
	It is very important that we ensure Canada's cultural industries 
develop to their fullest. This is an area I have had a great deal of 
interest in since I became a member of Parliament seven years ago.
<P>
	In the last Parliament as deputy critic for Canadian culture, I sat 
on the relevant committee and worked with the hon. member for 
Mount Royal, now the Secretary of State for Multiculturalism and 
Status of Women, in these areas and with other members on a 
number of reports that talked about safeguarding our cultural 
industries.
<P>
	It is interesting to note with our colleagues from the Bloc today 
that whatever our differences may be, all Canadians, within and 
outside Quebec, agree that with our linguistic, regional and 
geographic differences it is very important that our very special 
culture in French and English be protected and that our federal 
government do everything possible to protect that culture.
<P>
	Public policy for cultural industries has always operated on two 
premises. The first is that cultural products are important as a 
transmitter of social identity. The second is that it is difficult for the 
Canadian market to generate economically viable cultural 
enterprises.
<P>
	Nobody knows this better than I. I once said I was going to have 
a sign made that said ``pariah: do not appoint to arts boards''. In my 
small region of Atlantic Canada I have served over the years on 
practically every arts endeavour and cultural endeavour that has 
gone belly up because we did not have the people or the money to 
keep it going.
<P>
	It is terribly important that the federal government take a hand 
and ensure cultural industries do not die aborning because of 
regional disparity, small population, small markets, et cetera.
<P>
	Policy is focused on supplementing the domestic markets' 
internal capacity to generate revenues with financial and 
institutional tools. These tools are an attempt to ensure a minimum 
choice of indigenous cultural works alongside the overwhelming 
presence of foreign ones.
<P>
	In the area of magazine selection, in any store that sells 
periodicals and magazines Canadian periodicals are overwhelmed 
by sheer numbers of those that come from our neighbour to the 
south. It is a fine statement that they are not overwhelmed in 
content or in standard but merely in numbers.
<P>
	As our cultural enterprises matured and in many cases became 
more self-sufficient, the government developed and refined the 
legislative and regulatory framework, the third set of tools within 
which these enterprises could further prosper and compete at home 
and abroad.
<P>
	The challenge for all of us is for government to monitor and 
review its policies and make amendments or realignments when 
these are required. Today clearly, as the explosion of technology 
takes place all around us here in Canada and around the world, 
characteristics that define the current environment are challenges 
that confront our cultural sector.
<P>
	First, the removal of international barriers to trade generates 
increased competition in production and distribution of cultural 
goods and services and global markets.
<P>
	Second, the vertical and horizontal integration of conglomerates 
operating on a world scale is having a profound impact on the 
content of cultural products made available to consumers.
<P>
<B>(1615 )</B>
<P>
	Third, the convergence between information transmitters and the 
producers of the content they transmit is leading to an explosion of 
new types of goods and services available to a an ever increasing 
number of consumers.
<P>
	Take the first challenge as an example, the removal of trade 
barriers and increased international competition. In this area the 
impact cannot be underestimated. Access to production and dis-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16042"> 16042 </A></B>
<P>
tribution networks is paradoxically  becoming both easier and more 
challenging at the same time.
<P>
	Technological innovation has rendered electronic distribution of 
content available to increasing number of creators but the costs 
associated with marketing, promotion and distribution both in 
domestic and international markets challenged the ability of 
creators to exploit their new market potential. We cannot 
underestimate the impact of such issues as control over technology, 
control over access to distribution networks and the capacity of 
governments to regulate the flow into domestic markets of cultural 
products distributed electronically from abroad. Most of us are 
fully aware of this in our own homes on a daily basis.
<P>
	<I>Sports Illustrated</I> Canada is a case in point. I am sorry my hon. 
colleague from Prince Edward Island cannot agree with me on this. 
We talked about <I>Sports Illustrated</I> a few minutes ago. For almost 
30 years the policy tool designed to regulate the importation of 
magazines containing advertising aimed at Canadians worked well 
but it is technologically specific in that it addresses the physical 
importation of foreign magazines today. Sports Illustrated is not 
physically imported but beamed across the border to a printing 
plant in Ontario.
<P>
	Our cultural sector has reached a level of economic maturity that 
will allow it to compete in domestic and international markets but 
only if it can operate within a legislative and regulatory framework 
that will encourage its continued development. That is why we 
have Bill C-103.
<P>
	The government has reached the point at which it has to update 
its policy for the magazine industry because of such developments 
as the beaming of <I>Sports Illustrated</I> to a printing plant in Ontario. It 
is a logical evolution in our policy instruments and it is a necessity 
to protect our investment in cultural industry.
<P>
	The bill demonstrates the federal government's continued 
commitment to the development of the Canadian magazine 
industry that is viable, original and dynamic.
<P>
	Since 1965 there have been two legislative measures in place, 
section 19 of the Income Tax Act and Customs Tariff code 9958. 
The objective of both measures was to ensure an adequate flow of 
advertising revenues to support a vibrant Canadian periodical 
industry. We need to make sure Canadians have the opportunity to 
read their own magazines at home, to reflect upon them the ideas 
that are home grown and home developed in this country, to ensure 
our culture remains strong, our sense of Canadianism and Canadian 
identity remains viable.
<P>
	Until the <I>Sports Illustrated</I> case, the instruments put in place by 
the federal government were not as successful. However, we have a 
loophole that needs to be plugged. This loophole has been 
exploited by <I>Sports Illustrated</I> over the last two years. Tariff code 
9958 applies only in  cases in which split run editions are 
physically imported into Canada. As I mentioned before, <I>Sports 
Illustrated</I> got around this by electronically beaming the magazine 
to a Canadian printing plant.
<P>
	I suppose this is a case in which the letter of the law may have 
been upheld but the spirit of the law was being violated. 
Fortunately the federal government has made a concerted effort 
and come forward with these amendments to change the situation 
so that <I>Sports Illustrated</I> can no longer circumvent the true spirit as 
well as the letter of the law.
<P>
	The amendments to the Excise Tax Act take into consideration 
that the task force on the Excise Tax Act issued its final report in 
March. Its main recommendation was that excise taxes be imposed 
on split run editions and periodicals. The tax is designed to 
encourage original editorial content in magazines containing 
advertisements primarily directed at Canadians. It will impose a 
tax of 80 per cent of the value of all advertisements contained in 
split run editions of magazines circulating in Canada. That 
encourages Canadian advertisers to place advertisements in 
magazines which have original content. It reiterates the 
government's longstanding policy objectives in a manner 
consistent with our international trade obligations.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	The amendment to the Income Tax Act will add an 
anti-avoidance rule. The purpose of the anti-avoidance rule is to 
ensure newspapers and periodicals that profess to be Canadian are 
controlled by Canadians.
<P>
	Canadians throughout history have formed their own identity, 
that mosaic unique to this land and its people. In their periodic 
re-examination of cultural policies, Canadians are continually 
discovering and defining what Robertson Davies has called our 
national soul.
<P>
	In the past couple of days our national soul has gone through 
quite an experiment but has come through and come out the other 
side. As we stand here today reaching out to each other and 
remembering what a joy and a benefit it is to be a Canadian, I am 
proud that our government is doing the nuts and bolts as well as the 
emotions to make that possible.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Bill C-103 is a cultural policy measure designed to assist 
in the development of the Canadian magazine industry. It is one of 
many federal government's efforts to foster conditions under which 
Canada's artists and creators can continue to express themselves 
and give Canadians and the world a sense of our identity as a 
country, an identity which has been enhanced by the events of the 
past week.
<P>
	By culture I mean the creators, producers and distributors of 
films and videos, books and magazines, as well as broadcasting, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16043"> 16043 </A></B>
<P>
the performing and visual arts,  design and the vast array of 
heritage institutions across the country.
<P>
	While I use the term cultural policy in the singular, Canada does 
not have a single policy respecting culture. Rather, a series of 
policy directions has been pursued by federal governments 
throughout time. In this sense cultural policy has been wrought by 
governments of the past and present based on a rationale which has 
remained relevant since the beginning.
<P>
	The rationale for the state's involvement in the cultural sector in 
Canada is important to understand because it is more valid today 
than it was in the 1920s when it was for the very first time 
expressed. This rationale is made up of essentially two 
philosophies.
<P>
	The first is that a cultural product that is work of artistic 
expression in any form is a good that cannot be treated in the same 
fashion a hammer, a nail or a widget. Why? Because a cultural 
product, unlike a widget or a gismo, transmits a set of values rooted 
in the society in which the artist who created it lives. The product 
of an artist's expression often acts as a mirror into which society 
can look for greater understanding of its sense of identity as an 
organized social group. It allows a society to distinguish itself from 
others on the planet. It defines and transmits that identity which is 
unique.
<P>
	Canada and most other industrialized countries have actively 
pursued some form of cultural policy which seeks to encourage our 
own native cultural expression.
<P>
	The number and range of magazines reflect the concerns and 
tastes of Canadians. All regions and most large metropolitan areas 
boast their own magazines. There is a Canadian periodical to serve 
almost every interest group, economic, professional, artistic, 
educational, religious or recreational.
<P>
<B>(1625 )</B>
<P>
	Magazines let their readers see behind the scenes of business and 
politics. They increase national understanding of regional issues 
and translate national issues into meaningful regional terms. They 
exalt Canadian accomplishments, profile the great and the small, as 
well as Canadians who at home and abroad make a difference in 
our everyday lives.
<P>
	The second premise on which state involvement in the cultural 
sector in Canada is based is that in order to produce cultural works, 
a domestic market of a size that will allow costs to be recouped is a 
requirement.
<P>
	The Canadian market, split along language and regionally 
fragmented, has never been large enough to sustain on its own a 
healthy cultural industry sector. This has been made more difficult 
by the overwhelming presence of foreign cultural product, first 
British and French and then American in our domestic markets. 
Hence early on Canadian public policy focused on supplementing 
the domestic market's internal capacity to  generate revenues with 
the financial and institutional tools required to ensure minimum 
choice of Canadian cultural works alongside the overwhelming 
presence of foreign ones.
<P>
	These two premises, the intrinsic merit of a cultural product in 
transmitting identity and the inability of the Canadian market to 
generate economically viable cultural enterprises, prompted the 
Government of Canada to develop policy tools to assist the cultural 
industries.
<P>
	The tax measure we have before us today updates a longstanding 
policy of successive governments which recognizes the unique 
circumstances faced by Canadian magazines.
<P>
	The policy implemented in 1965 introduced two measures to 
assist Canadian magazines in competing for advertising revenues, 
revenues which are essential to the industry's survival. These 
measures were section 19 of the Income Tax Act and tariff code 
9958. Bill C-103 maintains this policy put in place over 30 years 
ago.
<P>
	Tariff code 9958 restricts the importation of magazines 
containing advertisements directed at Canadians. It authorizes 
Canada Customs to stop the entry into Canada of the subsequent 
four issues of a magazine after the publication of an issue that has 
been deemed split run. Before this measure was introduced 
virtually all foreign magazines containing advertisements directed 
at Canadians would have been printed in the country of origin and 
imported into Canada for distribution.
<P>
	The publication of <I>Sports Illustrated</I> Canada has sent a signal 
that it now is possible to contravene the spirit of tariff code 9958 by 
means of technology which was not in existence when the code was 
implemented.
<P>
	<I>Sports Illustrated</I><B> </B>Canada is a split run edition printed in Canada 
using text that is electronically transmitted from the USA. The 
editorial content of<B> </B><I>Sports Illustrated </I>Canada is to a large extent the 
same as the content in the U.S. editions but it contains 
advertisements that have been specifically purchased to reach a 
Canadian audience.
<P>
	Tariff Code 9958 is not applicable to <I>Sports Illustrated</I> Canada 
because it is printed in Canada rather than being imported. This 
case illustrated the limitations of Canada's existing policy 
instruments designed to support the Canadian magazine industry.
<P>
	Consequently a task force on the Canadian magazine industry 
was set up to examine the problem of split run editions and to 
recommend new ways to promote Canada's policy objectives for 
the magazine industry.
<P>
	Concerning amendments to the Excise Tax Act, the task force 
issued its final report in March 1994. Its main recommendation was 
that an excise tax be imposed on split run editions of periodicals.
<P>
	The tax is designed to encourage original editorial content in 
magazines containing advertisement directed  primarily at 
Canadians. It will impose a tax of 80 per cent of the value of all of 
the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16044"> 16044 </A></B>
<P>
advertisements contained in split run editions of magazines 
circulating in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	This measure encourages Canadian advertisers to place 
advertisements in magazines which have original content. It 
underscores the government's longstanding policy objectives in a 
manner which is consistent with our international trade obligations.
<P>
	Section 19 of the Income Tax Act allows deductions for 
advertising directed at the Canadian market, only if the advertising 
is placed in Canadian issues of Canadian owned and Canadian 
controlled magazines.
<P>
	The amendment to the Income Tax Act will add an 
anti-avoidance rule to section 19. The purpose of the 
anti-avoidance rule is to ensure that newspapers and periodicals 
which profess to be Canadian are in fact controlled by Canadians.
<P>
	In conclusion, the government is concerned with creating 
policies conducive to the growth of the cultural sector. Readers are 
essential for magazines to prosper. So too are the other major 
clients of a magazine, the businesses and organizations which 
advertise their products and services.
<P>
	Access to Canadian advertising dollars is critical to ensure the 
economic viability and continued existence of the Canadian 
magazine industry. Advertising revenues support the cost of the 
editorial content and make it possible for the publisher to provide 
the magazine at rates the reader can afford. Therefore, we must not 
allow split run editions to siphon off Canadian advertising dollars. 
We must ensure the passage of Bill C-103.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity this afternoon to 
speak on Bill C-103. I believe I will be one of the last speakers on 
the bill.
<P>
	This is a symbolic time to be dealing with Bill C-103.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In fact, the bill we are debating this afternoon deals with 
Canadian culture and ways of preserving it. I know that some 
members opposite-and I am directing my remarks to Reformers 
in particular today-have it that certain Canadian cultural 
industries for example do not need any additional protection.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I have spoken about this before in the House, both generally and 
more specifically. At a Canada-U.S. interparliamentary group 
meeting, a United States congressman indicated that the motion 
picture industry in Hollywood and elsewhere was a bit upset with 
Canadians because we had what they believed to be rather 
restrictive policies in that sector.
<P>
	I believe it was the former hon. member for Annapolis 
Valley-Hants, Patrick Nowlan, who responded to the 
congressman. He said: ``How would you feel if in your country 97 
per cent of all the films were produced in another country and you 
could watch television for a day or movies for a whole weekend 
and never once see a scene from your country? How long would 
you put up with it?'' The congressman said: ``I guess you have a 
point''.
<P>
	The measures we were using at that time were in reference to 
another cultural industry, but they made the same point which is the 
fact that immediately to the south of us is a cultural giant. It is not a 
matter of our saying that our cultural industries, magazine 
publishers and so on are not competitive. It has absolutely nothing 
to do with that. It has to do with being overwhelmed by the giant to 
the south of us.
<P>
<B>(1635 )</B>
<P>
	My hon. colleague from the riding of Halton-Peel is an artist 
who has participated as an actor and performer in a number of 
productions. I do not say this disrespectfully, but the member for 
Halton-Peel surely knows a lot more about these kinds of issues 
than do many members of the Reform Party across the way. I am 
sure he would agree on the importance of protecting Canada's 
cultural industries.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I think there is something else, in the sense that some members 
of the Reform Party tend to give the impression that the cultural 
industry belongs exclusively to a kind of elite instead of belonging 
to everyone in our society. That is totally wrong. These people are 
trying to convey that idea, and I think that it does not reflect the 
Canadian reality.
<P>
	Poetry, magazines, television programs, and music-how can I 
forget music-are all part of the Canadian culture, and in each of 
these areas there is a Canadian cultural industry, or at least a 
potential industry.
<P>
	Today, we are debating this issue of periodicals, magazines 
published or produced in another country, electronically 
transmitted to Canada and duplicated in Canada in an attempt to 
circumvent Canadian legislation. Reformers say that cultural 
industries can do like other Canadian industries and operate 
without anything to protect them in case they have to compete with 
foreign products.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I see it this way. The members of the Reform Party are looking at 
the cultural industries as if we were strictly discussing a 
commercial product, in other words, whether or not someone can 
produce a hammer in Canada cheaper than in the United States. 
That is not the issue. South of the border there is such immense 
potential for  news and for drawing advertising. There is absolutely 
no parallel in Canada. The economy of scale in those kinds of 
industries operate 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16045"> 16045 </A></B>
<P>
very differently from what they do in other areas of human 
endeavour.
<P>
	Members across the way just will not hear that kind of a 
proposition. They should because if ever there was a time in the 
history of this country where we should all rally around those 
instruments of Canadian culture that could bind us together, surely 
it is today. Surely today of all days we should be reminding 
ourselves of the necessity for keeping those instruments which 
enhance, highlight and make people aware of that which makes us 
different from other nations and which makes us Canadian.
<P>
	It could be books. We have a number of very good Canadian 
authors. There are a number of very good publishing houses in 
Canada, many of them small. As a colleague reminded us a while 
ago, some of these small publishing companies have been assisted 
by what is commonly referred to as the postal subsidy. It has 
assisted small publishing companies in putting out very excellent 
works by Canadian authors. What is wrong with that? Why will 
members of the Reform Party not see that those things are 
important and especially important today of all days? They do not 
understand any of that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> We are not socialist.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria: </B>Mr. Speaker, I have been called many things but 
not often have I been called a socialist. Reform Party cultural gurus 
across the way are now accusing me of being a socialist. I find it a 
little ironic, particularly in view of what has been said by Reform 
Party members in the past about Canadian cultural industries and 
how they should be promoted by the Government of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	I have the little green book of the Reform Party. I am trying 
feverishly to find a page which refers to the Canadian cultural 
industries. Perhaps I will a little later.
<P>
	Some people in the Reform Party are now saying that promoting 
Canadian culture is somehow tantamount to socialism, and they are 
repeating it now. I do not think it is a particularly nice thing to say 
about their leader. He said the same thing not long ago. I have it in 
the little green book. I will defend the leader of the Reform Party 
against those vicious attacks from the backbenchers any time. His 
backbenchers need to be reminded to be more respectful of the hon. 
member from Calgary, the leader of that party. The leader of the 
Reform Party needs all the help he can get. Shall we say he is in a 
pretty tough spot.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would like this House to know that today, we should all support 
cultural initiatives, any initiative designed to promote Canadian 
culture. The Canadian book and  magazine publishing industry is 
certainly one that deserves the support of this House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Other countries are not at all shy about supporting their cultural 
industries. Anyone who has ever visited France and who has seen 
the amount of effort put into promoting and preserving heritage 
sites, promoting culture, promoting art and so on, would know a 
tremendous sector of that nation lives from that alone. That is not 
true of that country alone, although in terms of western societies it 
is probably the country with more in the way of art and promoting 
those fields of human endeavour than any other.
<P>
	We could take other examples. I am told the largest museum in 
the world is in Russia, in St. Petersburg I believe. That country has 
a very different kind of regime, one opposite to the country I was 
talking about previously, but it also saw fit to protect some of its 
cultural goods and property.
<P>
	The Smithsonian Institute is another example of that, certainly 
not located in a socialist country. It is located in a country that is 
very different.
<P>
	I want to end with the following immortal words: ``The Reform 
Party supports the responsibility of the state to promote, preserve 
and enhance the national culture. The state may assist and should 
encourage ethnic culture to integrate into the national culture''. I do 
not know if I agree with that part but in any case that is the 
quotation from no less than the leader of the Reform Party, who has 
just been accused of being a socialist by his own backbenchers.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 1</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-94, in Clause 9, be amended by replacing line 27, on page 3, with the 
following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``(<I>d</I>) the use that is made or is to be made of it;''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 2</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-94, in Clause 10, be amended by replacing line 45, on page 3 and 
lines 1 and 2, on page 4, with the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``of its completion, file a report''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron-Bruce, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to move an amendment this afternoon on Bill C-94.
<P>
	According to the Order Paper, on the first amendment you will 
find that clause 9 of this bill will be amended by striking out line 27 
on page 3 and substituting the following: ``the use that is made or is 
to be of it''.
<P>
	The reason for this amendment is that the clause as originally 
drafted assumes the controlled substance was used within 30 days 
of the transaction, which may not always be the case. In certain 
cases this product could be put in stock until its future anticipated 
use. For that reason, I moved the amendment. I believe it is a good 
amendment and I hope we have concurrence on that.
<P>
	On the second amendment, I would ask of this House if we could 
have unanimous consent because of the fact that the amendment on 
the Order Paper has been further amended. I would like to read that 
amendment at this time if I may. I wonder if we could have 
unanimous consent for this amendment to be changed.
<P>
	The motion would read this way:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That clause 10 of Bill C-94 be amended by striking out line 45 on page 3 and 
lines 1 and 2 on page 4 and substituting the following: ``of each transaction 
under the authorization, file a report''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1650 )</B>
<P>
	The reporting requirement as it is in the draft is too lax to allow 
for effective monitoring by the minister. As an example, if we 
follow the current draft it could be as much as 12 to 14 months after 
the transaction that a report is filed with the minister. This would be 
much too long.
<P>
	Mr. Vena from Environment Canada agreed with the suggested 
amendment. Ms. Fry from the Department of Justice also indicated 
that there was no rationale for the section as drafted, other than that 
this was an arbitrary line-drawing. Therefore I feel that the 
amendment as I have placed it today is in order and should be 
supported.
<P>
	I would therefore seek unanimous consent of this House for the 
amendment I have just presented.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The House has heard the 
terms of the intervention by the hon. member for Huron-Bruce. 
Does the hon. member have the unanimous consent of the House to 
make that substitution?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> So ordered. Debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on behalf of the government I will  concur with the first 
motion made by the member for Huron-Bruce. The addition of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16047"> 16047 </A></B>
<P>
the words he has suggested puts in a much clearer perspective the 
issue of the 30 days authorization.
<P>
	In regard to the second amendment, it would have been the 
position of the government to refuse the amendment the way it was 
previously phrased. Now that it has been changed by making much 
more precise reference to each transaction authorized, we feel 
much more at ease with the amendment proposed by the hon. 
member.
<P>
	To sum up, the government will concur with both the first 
amendment and also the revised second amendment. This is going 
to be our position.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to say a few words to the amendment put forward 
by the member for Huron-Bruce.
<P>
	The member had the opportunity to sit through the committee 
stage of this bill and hear the various witnesses who came forward. 
Had the member actually been listening to what the majority of 
witnesses were saying during the committee, he would not have 
been bringing forward amendments at report stage. He perhaps 
would have been speaking to the minister directly and encouraging 
the minister to scrap the bill.
<P>
	Apparently the member was not at every committee meeting and 
as a result has brought forward two amendments, both technical in 
nature. I am sure that in his mind they strengthen the scope of the 
bill. I ask whether Bill C-94 will be strengthened or improved by 
these so-called technical amendments. The member knows very 
well that really the only way to help this area of concern is to scrap 
the bill, rather than to amend it.
<P>
	The first amendment makes a change to clause 9. In the clause 
there is a reference to the record of a controlled substance. In the 
interpretation section of the bill, controlled substance means a 
manganese-based substance that is mentioned in the schedule and 
includes any other substance that contains such a manganese-based 
substance.
<P>
	We are made to believe with this bill and with the member's 
amendments that MMT is hazardous. The government members 
across the floor know full well that this is not so. When they have 
the opportunity to vote for this bill at final reading stage, they will 
not only be voting in favour of bad legislation, they will be saying 
to the Canadian people that the government can ban a substance 
even if there is no evidence that the substance is hazardous.
<P>
<B>(1655 )</B>
<P>
	I will close by saying that I could speak for a long time on the 
disappointing aspects of the bill, but I know that should be kept for 
third reading and will do so.
<P>
	The amendments proposed by the member for Huron-Bruce 
cannot be supported by the Reform Party. While they may change 
what can or cannot be done with a manganese based substance and 
when a report should be submitted to the minister, they do not 
address the fundamental question. Before a substance can be 
banned, should it not go through a process of independent scientific 
review?
<P>
	The bill cannot be improved by one or two amendments. The bill 
needs to be reworked from scratch if it is to have any credibility in 
both the industrial sector as well as the environmental sector. Good 
legislation would propose a predictable process for any substance, 
not just MMT.
<P>
	The minister failed and the bill will ultimately be her legacy of 
another administrative blunder.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
too would like to speak to the bill and to the amendment just 
briefly.
<P>
	I could not help but notice during the last few minutes some of 
the comments across the way delving into the political garbage 
bucket like the hon. whip for the party opposite often does. I do not 
want to hold up the bill because we are on record as explaining why 
the bill is poorly designed. It is without scientific rationale. It is a 
knee-jerk reaction in support of friends of the Liberal Party. That 
has already been well documented.
<P>
	I repeat for the record that today's activities again are an 
example of how the party opposite does not have any kind of 
political agenda or legislative agenda that Canadians and 
Quebecers can grasp on to with enthusiasm. This is more time 
filling, political time wasting on behalf of a government that seems 
bereft of any new ideas. Its idea of change is that it is already doing 
it. It just does not cut.
<P>
	The bill should not pass. The amendment does not address the 
problems within the bill. Decisions should not be made in Canada 
based on what we felt like when we got up in the morning. There 
should be some scientific facts behind it.
<P>
	The government quotes studies and tests. On and on it goes. It 
will not submit in the House the tests it quotes from. The reason it 
cannot ban MMT is that the health department says it is not a 
hazard. The reason it cannot be banned outright is that there is no 
scientific reason for it. All the government can do is prevent its 
interprovincial trade and prevent its importation at a time when the 
United States of America will go ahead. The court has approved its 
use in the United States.
<P>
	It is a shame the government cannot come up with some better 
idea or legislative agenda that would address the issues of 
importance to Canadians instead of the time fillers we have been 
dealing with today.
<P>
