</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I wish to present a petition signed by 43 of my 
constituents, which states that whereas marriage is and should 
remain the union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all 
others, the petitioners request that parliament take all 
necessary steps within the jurisdiction of the Parliament of 
Canada to preserve this definition of marriage in Canada, and 
they further ask that parliament withdraw Bill C-23 and affirm 
the opposite sex definition of marriage in legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I wish 
to present a petition signed by many constituents from across the 
country, asking parliament to amend the Divorce Act to include 
the provision supported by Bill C-340, which is the right of the 
spouses' parents, that is, the grandparents, to have access to or 
custody of the children.  In the present situation they have to 
go through all kinds of procedures to do that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to present a petition today on behalf of approximately 
200 people in the riding of St. John's East.  The petition 
states:  “Whereas Canadians are horrified by pornography which 
depicts children and are astounded by legal determinations that 
possession of that kind of pornography is not criminal; and 
whereas it is the duty of parliament through the enactment and 
enforcement of the criminal code to protect the most vulnerable 
members of society from sexual abuse; therefore, your petitioners 
pray that parliament take all measures necessary to ensure that 
possession of child pornography remains a serious criminal 
offence and that federal police forces be directed to give 
priority to enforcing this law for the protection of children”.

wish to present a second petition from approximately 100 people 
in the riding of St. John's East, which states:  “We, the 
undersigned citizens of the province of Newfoundland, wish to 
draw the attention of the House to the polluted condition of St. 
John's harbour; and therefore your petitioners request that the 
House encourage the federal, provincial and relevant municipal 
governments to financially support the sewage treatment system 
required for the clean-up of St. John's harbour”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue I have brought to the attention of the House on at 
least four, five or perhaps seven different occasions.  It is a 
very serious issue and I would ask parliament to consider it.

coast by all Canadians. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise on this issue.  My 
interest in transportation goes back a long way, perhaps to the 
early 1990s and probably into 1996, because of a project I wanted 
developed in my riding but there was a lack of federal government 
policy on funding for our national highway system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province of Nova Scotia, faced with a dangerous highway, no 
money and unable to establish an agreement with the federal 
government, tried to come up with an unique and innovative way to 
build part of our Trans-Canada Highway.  It is now known as the 
Cobequid Pass and it is a toll highway.  It is the only toll 
highway on the Trans-Canada Highway system right now and it runs 
entirely through my riding.  It certainly focused the issue of 
transportation for me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not only highways where there is a lack of co-ordinated, 
consistent policy, where there is a policy of long range planning 
rather than just react, react.  It applies to the rail system; 
the airline system, as we have just seen recently; the port 
policies; shipbuilding; and passenger rail service.  Again, there 
is just reaction.  There is no long range plan, no consistent 
approach and no thought put behind these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ferry system in Canada, especially Marine Atlantic, is now 
coming under fire and criticism because again, after years of 
having one system of supplying and managing the Atlantic ferry 
system through Marine Atlantic, all of a sudden there is a new 
system and nobody understands what it is.  The people in charge 
of Marine Atlantic are circumventing the process and nobody knows 
the thought processes, if there is any protection for consumers 
or if there is any accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this debate I will be focusing on some of the issues I have 
just listed.  My very learned colleague from Brandon—Souris will 
be discussing rail and grain issues, which are in his area of 
expertise.  The very distinguished member for St. John's East 
will be discussing the Marine Atlantic issue.  I will also be 
focusing in on some airline issues.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning, for example, when I flew from Montreal to Ottawa, 
the plane was delayed for a little while.  I called my office and 
said that I would be delayed and that I would be in Ottawa for my 
presentation this morning but that it would be close.  When we 
were ready to get on the plane there was another delay. This has 
happened to consumers right across the country.  I do not want to 
hone in on that because I know there are transitional issues, but 
delays for consumers now are completely unacceptable.  There are 
consistent delays.  I hope the new dominant airline can address 
these issues and bring them back to the former standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the problem is not Air Canada or the airline mergers. 
It is that there was very little government involvement in this 
merger issue.  It was almost all private sector driven.  The 
government should have been establishing plans years ago to 
predict the collapse of Canadian Airlines.  It should have been 
prepared for it but it was not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As things got worse and worse for Canadian Airlines, another 
private sector company, Onex, became involved and made a 
proposal.  It looked like that was going to happen, then it did 
not happen.  Then we had all kinds of other proposals and 
jiggery-pokery with American Airlines and many other partners in 
this whole issue.  Again the private sector determined the 
aviation policy in this country, not the government.  The 
government was behind the eight ball and it fell far short of the 
expectations of the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first issue that I brought up was highways.  This is 
probably the only country in the world that does not have a 
highway policy.  Right now there is not one provincial 
transportation minister who can tell us what the federal 
government's policy is on highways.  They have been making sounds 
about maybe some day establishing a policy, but right now there 
is no policy on highways.  It is amazing that a country that is 
so dependent on highways like Canada, perhaps more than any other 
country in the world, has no highway policy.  Years ago the 
provinces could make co-operative highway funding agreements with 
the federal government and now they have all expired except for a 
few.  The remaining policies are now completely inconsistent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To point out the inconsistency in my area over the next two 
years, the province of Newfoundland will get $55 million this 
year and $50 million in funding next year from the federal 
government, for a total of $105 million.  That is on one side of 
Nova Scotia.  On the other side of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick 
gets $102 million over the next two years.  Nova Scotia, in the 
middle, gets zero.  I point out that this is completely 
inconsistent.  I do not say either one of them is right but the 
point is that it is completely inconsistent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The road builders, the governments, the shippers, the 
manufacturers and the industrial parks cannot make plans on how 
they will establish their facilities, where to build their 
buildings, where they will hire people and how they will ship 
their products to market without a co-ordinated, long range, long 
term policy.  That policy has to tie in rail with highway, 
highway with air and all these have to be tied into municipal 
passenger systems too.  None of that is being done.  We are 
addressing the issues as they come up:  bang, there is a highway 
program, we will build a toll highway; VIA Rail is broke, we will 
give it more money; Canadian Airlines is in trouble, we will let 
them merge or whatever.  This country, which is so dependent on 
transportation, perhaps more than any other country in the world 
because we are so big and our populations are so focused in 
certain areas, needs a transportation policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to grow, compete and be in the global market but we 
cannot be without a transportation policy that ties them all 
together.  That means the government must work with the 
provinces, the industry, the shippers and the transportation 
industry to come up with a co-ordinated policy that handles all 
these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, we have piecemeal deals where the government decides to 
privatize the airports.  This has not happened yet, but I predict 
that some of the smaller airports in Canada, which are the 
lifelines and the hope for economic development in small 
communities like Saint John, New Brunswick for instance, will 
suddenly find themselves unable to survive and compete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is critical that the small airports be brought into an 
overall policy of the government.  We must not just diversify, 
privatize, commercialize or divest all the airports in Canada. 
They have to be part of an overall plan.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The big airports will survive.  They will do well and prosper. I 
see great things in the future for the major airports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I neglected to mention that I will be splitting my 
time with the very hon. member for Brandon—Souris.  He is very 
anxious to get up and talk about wheat.  He knows a lot about 
wheat and I know very little about wheat, but I do know something 
about transportation.  I do know that there should be a policy 
that co-ordinates all these issues together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has happened is that instead of having a department of 
transportation, we now have a profit centre.  When the government 
came to power in 1993, the department virtually broke even or 
lost money.  According to a Manitoba study, in the year 2002-03 
the department will have a profit of $3.9 billion, counting all 
the fuel taxes, all the taxes it brings in, the rents from the 
ports and the rents from the airports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know how members feel, but the Department of Transport 
should not be a profit centre.  It should not be an avenue to 
make money on behalf of the government.  It should provide the 
very best transportation and infrastructure possible for this 
country.  It cannot be done on a wing and a prayer.  It has to be 
long range.  Highways, rail lines, and airports take decades to 
plan and decades to build.  It cannot be done in the haphazard 
manner that is happening now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will just go back to the aviation merger which changed things 
so much in the last few months.  The divestiture of the ports and 
the airports are not all bad but they are not part of an overall 
plan.  They have to be part of an overall plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no plan for highway construction in the country.  When 
I was first given the position of transport critic for the 
Progressive Conservative Party, I wrote every provincial minister 
of transport in Canada.  I asked them what the number one issue 
was facing ministers of transport.  Every single one said that it 
was highways and that they needed highway money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a critical issue because there is now such a large 
transfer of goods and services to the highways from rail. It is 
more economical, more efficient and more practical to ship by 
truck.  Trucks are getting bigger.  The provinces are all asking 
for permission to have bigger trucks and bigger regulations, 
which will put more workload on the highways, causing more damage 
to the highways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provincial ministers of transport, absolutely together, say 
that they need a transportation policy for highways, one that 
they can plan on for 10 to 20 years and one which they can count 
on for certain amount of funding based on the gas and oil tax 
that is collected.  It is only fair.  Right now only 5%, 6% or 
less than that goes back into highways.  If 15% of the gas and 
diesel oil tax went back into highways it would resolve most of 
the issues in the country.  It is not a lot to ask. 
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé (Madawaska—Restigouche, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I thank my hon. colleague for his speech on transportation today. 
I also arrived late from New Brunswick.  I was caught at the 
Montreal airport with my colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does my hon. colleague think can be done to rectify the 
problem with transportation in Canada?   When I talk about the 
problems with transportation, I am talking about VIA Rail and the 
airlines.  Should there not be a national policy on 
transportation that includes every region of every province? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>VIA Rail was taken away from Saint John, New Brunswick not too 
long ago under this government.  Today that region is looking for 
new ideas on transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does my hon. colleague think can be done if the government 
has done everything it can to guarantee access by all Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not think the 
government has done anywhere near enough to address the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is fundamental.  We need a co-ordinated 
transportation system.  We cannot make these decisions based on 
putting more money into small projects, or making a deal on 
certain provincial highways, or pouring more money into VIA Rail 
to help it survive but not making a change.  There is no 
fundamental change. 
The minister should co-ordinate fundamental meetings with agendas 
to address all our transportation issues to try to co-ordinate 
all our modes of transport.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the issues are being dealt with in the airline merger 
now with competition from companies like WestJet and all other 
charter airlines.  My colleague just raised delays and such 
things a minute ago.  I believe they will be addressed 
eventually, but still we do not have a co-ordinated approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we go to other countries we can see where they have had 
long range planning.  They have the rail lines co-ordinated with 
the ports, with the subway systems and with the highways systems. 
They have highways that go directly from the airports non-stop 
right into the centres of towns or industrial areas.  The rail 
lines and the subways come directly to the airports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a total co-ordinated transportation package in Canada, 
not piecemeal approaches to resolving the issues. 
<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my hon. colleague for bringing this issue to the floor of 
the House again.  Obviously it is a serious issue.  There is no 
question that there is a lack of vision in the transportation 
policy within the country in all modes of this sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to comment on one of the points the hon. member made.  We 
have privatization of the airports.  Certainly some airports will 
make dollars but there are those that will not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the hon. member's view is it okay to privatize as long as the 
privatized company or authority will make money but not okay if 
the others will not?  Is it one or the other, or should we be 
looking at a policy that is there for all of Canada where we all 
support each other? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member's question is 
interesting.  That is exactly the policy we used to have.  The 
member for Churchill has described a policy we used to have 
wherein the Department of Transport managed and operated all 
airports in Canada.  The stronger ones which had more economic 
opportunities and were more viable supported the weaker ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a matter of poor management on the part of small 
airports.  They just do not have the volume of passengers going 
through the small airports to establish alternative sources of 
revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An airport like Calgary, for instance, has established itself 
almost as a destination point.  It is almost worth going to 
Calgary just to see the airport.  Such a dynamic business 
community has been created within the airport because millions of 
passengers go through there every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A small airport like Saint John, as I mentioned earlier, does 
not have the traffic to support the alternative sources of 
revenue like the stores, the food shops, the rental car 
facilities, et cetera.  The small airports have no ability to 
generate alternative revenue.  They have just a fraction of the 
revenue of big airports from terminal fees and landing fees. They 
do not have a chance to compete.  Even though their expenses may 
be lower, their opportunities for revenue are much lower than 
those of the big ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada has to go back and revenue this 
decision.  I do not disagree with turning the airports over to 
the communities, but the government has to review the decision 
and find a way to make it equitable for the small airports 
through negotiations on rental deals, a supply of capital or 
operating expenses to maintain their operations.  We cannot let 
our small airports decline, become unsafe and deteriorate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will start by thanking my illustrious colleague from 
Cumberland—Colchester who without doubt is the best and 
certainly the most informed member of the transportation 
committee and a critic par excellence.  Other members of the 
other opposition parties could take some lessons from the 
illustrious member for Cumberland—Colchester. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me indicate exactly where I was heading.  I would feel much 
more confident in the national transportation policy and where 
the country would be heading in the future if my colleague from 
Cumberland—Colchester were sitting in the minister's seat.  He 
could put into place at least some of his understanding with 
respect to national transportation and some of his vision with 
respect to where the country could and should go with those types 
of policies put into place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk about the motion before us today.  We had some 
difficulty as a party trying to figure out which of the 
ministries was the most mismanaged because there was a 
smorgasbord of mismanaged departments. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1035"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT7"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT7"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1035

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could talk about health care, which was put on the agenda 
previously by the NDP.  We could talk about mismanagement of 
HRDC, which has been in the House continuously.  We could talk 
about agriculture, which this party put forward as a topic of 
debate in a supply motion.  That department is totally mismanaged 
to the point where there is no vision as to where agriculture in 
the country will go.  However we came upon national 
transportation.  When we started looking at a national 
transportation policy we discovered very quickly that there was 
none and that the government was heading in an ad hoc direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transportation breaks down into a number of areas.  I will speak 
to one on which I have a bit of understanding.  Obviously that is 
grain transportation.  I will not talk at length about it because 
there are other deficiencies in other areas of transportation and 
the non-transportation policy of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us first open debate with respect to the grain 
transportation.  Back in September of last year Arthur Kroeger 
tabled a report on grain transportation.  Grain transportation is 
not something that just fell out of the sky.  We have been 
talking about grain transportation in western Canada since the 
first kernel of wheat was planted in the western prairies.   The 
fact is that the government did away with the crow rate benefit 
back in 1995.  Since that point in time there has been absolutely 
nothing in place to help serve the farmers of our great country, 
particularly those in western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that one-third of the total value now being 
achieved through commodities that are grown is going to 
transportation costs.  Unfortunately farmers cannot survive on 
two-thirds of the commodity price, pay their costs or make any 
type of a profit so they can continue on in the business.  This 
should have been dealt with a long time ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will happen today, tomorrow, this week or early next week 
is that the Minister of Transport will be tabling a bill.  That 
bill could have been tabled two months ago when we could have 
debated that piece of legislation logically, openly and 
transparently.  We will have to push the bill through before we 
rise in three weeks so that the government can put forward the 
legislation and it is effective by August 1, the new crop year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will have opportunity to tell the country why it is that the 
government has failed in its responsibility to put forward 
possibly the best legislation for producers and farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about other transportation issues which the hon. 
member talked about in his dissertation.  One of them is 
highways.  The country was built, developed and started on 
transportation.  Does anyone remember the last spike?  Does 
anyone remember bringing our country together from coast to coast 
with a transportation web, a rail web? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our country still depends on transportation.  The majority of 
what we produce is exported.  It is either exported by sea, by 
land or by air.  We depend on export commodities.  We depend on 
international markets.  Our transportation infrastructure is 
coming to the point now where it is deteriorating beyond that of 
a third world country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about those three areas.  Let us talk about highways 
on which I have some knowledge.  In a previous life I was a 
chartered member of an organization called the Highway No. 1 West 
Association.  Our major land link, our number one highway, the 
Trans-Canada Highway, is absolutely deplorable.  In areas of 
western Canada the number one highway is to the point now where 
truckers and people moving commodities and goods will no longer 
use it.  They now go through the United States of America 
bypassing Canadian highways, come back up into Canada and deliver 
their goods.  That is deplorable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government takes a gasoline excise tax every year in excess 
of $4.4 billion.  The same government puts back less than 4.4% of 
that into our great highway system throughout Canada.  The 
responsibility falls on the shoulders of the provinces.  The 
provinces have a road network.  They have to deal with provincial 
roads and municipal roads.  Now they have to deal with national 
roads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my hon. colleague from Cumberland—Colchester asked, why is 
it that we cannot work with the provincial governments?   We 
tried to work with the provincial governments when we were in 
power and were getting to a point of putting together a national 
highways program. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1040"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately this government does not wish to deal with a 
national highways program.  When I talked with the minister of 
transportation and highways in the province of Manitoba, he too 
came forward and said that the best thing we could do now is to 
have a long term national highways program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does that mean?  That means stable funding over a period of 
years that will be distributed equally, honestly and fairly 
between all provinces to put in a national highways program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now we have ad hoc programs that come forward from the 
government whenever there is an election.  What a wonderful way 
to run our infrastructure, particularly our national highways 
program.  Whenever there is an election the government will drib 
and drab a few dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have $175 million now for rural roads in the grain 
transportation strategy the government put forward.  We have an 
infrastructure program of $100 million for this coming year for 
all of Canada.  I believe that works out to $3.5 million for the 
province of Manitoba for its infrastructure program next budget 
year.  Whoop-de-do, $3.5 million will do three kilometres of 
highway.  It is not a sufficient program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about air service.  My hon. colleague certainly 
understands air service better than the government side does. 
There is no vision.  There is no policy.  There is no 
understanding which is necessary so that we can continue to 
compete internationally and nationally with our competitors.  No 
strategy has been put forward on transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue is sea transportation.  Being from 
Brandon—Souris, I can honestly say that I do not speak with a 
lot of experience on open sea transportation, but the hon. member 
for St. John's East will speak to it a little later because he 
understands marine transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue we are talking about now is the ideology or psychology 
that has escaped the government.  It is an ideology or psychology 
on what we have to put into place so Canadians can compete in the 
international market for years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard that the majority of our future will be with 
knowledge based industries.  I do not dispute that, but there has 
to be a balance.  Not only are our knowledge based industries 
very important for us so that we can sell that knowledge 
throughout the world, which, by the way, the government does not 
really have a grasp of.  We can talk about the numbers of 
knowledge based industries personnel leaving the country in the 
brain drain.  At least we recognize there is a real advantage. We 
also have to recognize that the country was built on 
manufacturing, processing and commodities that have to be 
transported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In western Canada the major transportation requirements are for 
potash, grain and fertilizers.  We need rail transportation that 
is of a proper standard.  We need infrastructure that can be 
continued into the future.  We have nothing put forward by the 
government which indicates that it is prepared to invest in that 
infrastructure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the Minister of Transport to put before the House a well 
thought out, long term strategy and plan for a national highways 
program for rural roads throughout the country, as a well as a 
rail transportation policy not only for passengers but also for 
commodities.  There is nothing I can put my hands on that will 
show me where those issues will be within the next two, five or 
ten years.  I find it deplorable that the government has no 
vision for transportation.  I would like to move the following 
amendment:

Mr. Speaker, I will be giving the government's view in a minute, 
but both the member for Cumberland—Colchester and the member for 
Brandon—Souris took us to task on a lack of vision with the 
airline policy.  That party supported the government on Bill C-26 
and I was very glad of that support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask my colleagues over there what was the 
alternative they wanted to what we actually did.  Did they want 
the Government of Canada, the taxpayers of Canada, to bail out 
Canadian Airlines yet again?  Did they want a bankruptcy of 
Canadian Airlines like some of their columnist friends in the 
national newspapers?  Did they want 16,000 people put out on the 
street, including many in western Canada, Manitoba, the province 
of the hon. member for Brandon—Souris?  I put that to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would they have wanted an incredible disruption at Christmas 
where there was not capacity from Air Canada, U.S. carriers or 
our own charters?  Thousands and thousands of people would have 
been stranded and in chaos at the airports.  Is that the kind of 
chaotic policy response the Conservative Party follows? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see the chaos in their own party on an ongoing basis. It 
is okay for them to muck up their own party but do not ask us to 
muck up the airlines system just to emulate their own lack of 
cohesion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if anybody mucked up the 
airline industry it was the government.  I would suspect that 
anyone with an ounce of management ability would be a little bit 
proactive and would be able to see what was happening in the 
airline industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why was the country put into that position?  Why is it that 
customers of those airlines were made to have no choice on that 
December rush that the minister speaks about?  Why was the 
government minister sitting back in his chair on his tush without 
putting something proactive in place instead of just simply 
reacting to a very, very serious circumstance? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why were there plans not in place prior to Bill C-26?  Why did 
the minister not have some discussions and put into place some of 
those solutions prior to the urgency with which it came forward? 
I still blame the government and will always blame the government 
and the minister for putting Canadians in that situation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
truly a treat to be here today to listen to the members on the 
government side of the House and members from the opposition 
party down at the far end argue over who has been the worst at 
managing Canada's transportation system.  That should tell 
Canadians up front and absolutely positively that neither of 
those parties or any like them are going to do what is best for 
Canadians in regard to the transportation industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both of those parties have fought time and time again to 
privatize our entire system solely on the basis of privatization 
being the best answer to transportation in Canada and it has 
failed.  What they should do is look back at what was really best 
for transportation in Canada which was a policy that was there to 
meet the needs of Canadians, not just for companies to make a 
profit off the backs of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I assume the member for 
Churchill is speaking in favour of the motion. What it says right 
now is what we would like to put forward to the Canadian people. 
It calls upon the government to establish a comprehensive 
national transportation policy that demonstrates that leadership 
she is speaking of on this issue and which will provide solutions 
to the problems shared coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suspect that the member is speaking in favour of the motion 
because we agree with her.  We believe there has to be a long 
term, well thought out transportation policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, that also includes the port of Churchill with 
respect to grain transportation.  We as a party have always 
accepted Churchill as part of the grain transportation system.  I 
know she would agree with us in saying that.  I thank the NDP for 
supporting the motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member 
asked where the government was in foreseeing the problems with 
the airline industry.  Where was he last August when we invoked 
section 47 of the Canada Transportation Act for the first time 
because we foresaw the difficulties, we foresaw the bankruptcy of 
Canadian Airlines at Christmas? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did it.  We set in motion a private sector practice that 
brought forward three alternatives, one of which we now have in 
place today. That was foresight on the part of the government. 
That was good planning and it has made for good airline policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that was not good 
planning.  It was a response to one corporation, Onex 
Corporation, which came forward with a suggestion as to how it 
could fix the airline situation.  The government did not have any 
understanding as to what was happening until Onex made its 
proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why was it that the government was not looking for proposals 
from other corporations that could make the system work a lot 
better than what the Onex Corporation put forward? 
<P><A NAME="LINK44"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, there are so many erroneous assertions and false 
assumptions being made that I am pleased to rise in this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened with amazement to the criticisms from my colleagues 
opposite. I believe this motion has it all wrong. When the facts 
are looked at, and I hope to put those facts rather succinctly in 
the next few minutes, I think I will have demonstrated that we do 
have a transportation policy which addresses the needs of 
Canadians from coast to coast. The government has demonstrated 
strong leadership in the transportation sector.  As a result, 
perhaps even the Conservatives could rethink their motion and 
work with all of us tonight to defeat it when it comes to a vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is the many reforms the government has put in place in 
the transportation sector since 1993 have followed a pattern and 
a philosophy that work today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, as the hon. member knows, we came into power in 
1993 with a $41 billion annual deficit courtesy of the Mulroney 
Tories.  We came here with no money having been spent on airports 
and infrastructure for nine years.  While the Tories wantonly 
raised taxes to the highest levels in Canadian history, they 
never invested a nickel except some highway money in the 
transportation sector. We had to look at every single component. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We looked at airports.  We had to get an investment of $8 
billion or $9 billion into airports within a short period of 
time. How were we to do that?  Transport Canada was taken out of 
the day to day management of the airports and local airport 
authorities were put in place.  Those local airport authorities 
do not constitute privatization.  We followed the Canadian model 
and the crown and the people of Canada still own the airports. 
They will be ours forever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have entered into 60 year management agreements with local 
airport authorities whose members come from the surrounding 
communities and understand their communities.  I am speaking of 
people such as those the hon. member for Saint John knows who 
know all about the specific needs of her community.  They are 
running the airport authority. They are coming forward with plans 
for new terminals and new infrastructure.  This is working at the 
larger airports in the country. I grant that at smaller airports 
we have to keep an eye open especially given the airline 
restructuring.  We have to keep an eye open to what has happened 
and we are monitoring the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also looking at the larger airport authorities and 
reviewing all the leases.  We want to see whether there are 
inequities.  The Tories came into power and gave one deal to 
Vancouver, one deal to Calgary, one deal to Edmonton and another 
deal to Montreal. There was no consistency like all the other 
programs they put in place during those nine years.  There was no 
consistency to the local airport authorities.  We did some 
amending and we will be doing more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we came into power we brought in an airport policy which 
standardized the rules across the country.  In this lease review 
we want to bring all of the airports under the ambit of the 
Canadian airport authority so there is transparency, 
accountability and a proper management regime which all Canadians 
can be proud of.  A bill will be brought in later this year to 
effect these particular changes.

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is one example of where we took the lead.  We have put the 
financing of these airports to the users, financed through 
charges, new rents and new revenues that come from the airports. 
That is much better than what Transport Canada was doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the railways.  There is the Canadian National 
Railways, an amalgam of bankrupt railways.  To the credit of the 
Tories they came up with a good idea.  It was either the 
government of Arthur Meighen or R.B. Bennett, one of those two 
shortlived Tory governments back in the nether part of the last 
century.  They put the railways together under Canadian National 
Railways and the government invested heavily over the years. 
That railway was fat.  It was inefficient.  It was improperly 
managed.  As a result we privatized Canadian National Railways 
and it has been a success story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are aspects of the Canadian National privatization which I 
am uncomfortable with but we cannot cry over spilled milk.  We 
have to look at the success.  The fact is it is a company that 
has pared down its labour force, opened new markets, forged new 
alliances in the United States and is truly becoming a North 
American railway and an institution of which we can be proud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It wants to go even further with a consolidation with Burlington 
Northern Santa Fe Corporation.  That is a subject of controversy. 
The U.S. service transportation board has said it wants time to 
think about it.  It has put a moratorium on such discussions, 
although CN is appealing it in the U.S. courts. CN knows and hon. 
members know that I have asked the transport committee to look at 
that merger to see if it is in the best interests of Canada. The 
fact is this was a bold move that worked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Air Canada was privatized by the Tories.  That party loves 
privatization.  Some people say that maybe we should have 
commercialized it and kept the ownership but they privatized it 
and got rid of the whole thing.  Not only did they privatize Air 
Canada in 1988, the year before, they deregulated the domestic 
airline system.  Part of the problem we have had with Canadian 
airlines over the last 10 years is that the Tories truly mucked 
up.  They privatized a national carrier which was heavily 
invested in by the state.  At the same time they deregulated and 
put Air Canada at an incredible advantage to all those other 
private companies that were then consolidating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Remember in the 1970s and the 1980s Canadian Pacific, EPA, 
Transair and PWA were making money and even Québecair made money. 
What happened was the Tories came along and deregulated it.  They 
would deregulate their uncles, brothers, everybody just out of 
ideology.  And they privatized at the same time.  This created an 
incredible problem for them and for us.  Quite frankly, we should 
have moved to effect the private sector reorganization of the 
airline industry earlier in our mandate but we had so much on our 
plate we could not do it.  We did it last year and I think it has 
worked extremely well. I will come back to that a little later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also commercialized the air navigation services.  We were the 
first country to do so.  Other countries around the world are 
emulating us.  This has caused a great reorganization and 
investment in new capital equipment for air navigation.  Now 
Canada has the best air navigation system certainly in North 
America if not the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The poor U.S. cannot cope.  It has an explosion of flights and 
passengers.  The air navigation services in the United States are 
creaking under the strain.  Hopefully this will not cause a 
safety problem.  In Canada we took a bold move.  We have new 
systems and new equipment coming in.  We will continue to have 
the safest and the best air navigation system in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We commercialized ferry operations.  We commercialized the St. 
Lawrence Seaway.  We deregulated the trucking industry. Forget 
about the reorganization, we liberalized the air market and 
recently the charter market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Charters almost have the ability to operate both as charters and 
scheduled carriers. There are no stopoff provisions and 
prepayments have been waived. The charter companies have 
responded.  How have they responded?  They responded by putting 
in new orders for equipment: Canada 3000, four A319s; Royal Air, 
another 757; Air Transat, a new A330; and so on. 
The charters are responding and filling the void that needs to be 
filled.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The CTA, the Canada Transportation Act, was brought in in 1996. 
It has had some success, but there have been some criticisms. 
Those criticisms can be examined in the debate that will follow 
in the next year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there is no denying that under the Canada 
Transportation Act, of all of the railway lines that are up for 
abandonment, 80% are still being operated by short line railways, 
operating under provincial charters, responding to local needs, 
such as the Essex Terminal Railway in Windsor, which is operating 
on small trackage, Omnitrax to Churchill, and RailTex.  These 
railways are there, they are making money, they are providing a 
service and they have allowed CN and CP to concentrate on their 
core activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Transportation Act is up for review as of July 1. 
Very shortly I will be appointing prominent individuals to 
conduct that review.  That review will be very important.  If the 
hon. member for Cumberland—Colchester does not think we have a 
transportation policy, this review will give him and his party 
the chance to say “Let's have a national transportation policy 
that we, the Tories, can live with”, because the whole act will 
be up for review.  It will take one year.  We can look at every 
single aspect of the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members from the west are not happy about the abandonment of 
track, we can look at that.  With regard to urban Canada, I am 
meeting with my friend from Vancouver Quadra this afternoon about 
the Arbutus Corridor, a freight line that goes to downtown 
Vancouver which should be saved for a link to the airport.  CP 
wants to sell it for $100 million.  Is it right that the railways 
have the latitude, unfettered, to get rid of these rail lines in 
urban corridors?  That is a matter that we should be looking at 
in the CTA review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parallel to that the committee will be looking at the BN-CN 
merger to see whether it is in the best interest of public 
transportation policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only is there a transportation policy, not only has it 
worked, we now have a vehicle, the CTA review starting in July, 
where for the next year we will be able to embellish that policy 
and change it however hon. members would wish to improve the 
entire transportation system in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of the things we have done in the last seven years have 
contributed to the prosperity of Canada and have resulted in 
reduced transportation costs.  In fact, if we had not brought in 
the reforms of the last seven years transportation costs would be 
$8 billion higher today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the intense competition brought about by deregulation 
and all of the changes, most of the gains, which amount to $8.1 
billion, have been transferred to consumers and shippers in the 
form of lower prices.  Because transportation is part of 
everything that we buy, import or export, these gains have 
contributed to making the Canadian economy more competitive and 
to improving the standard of living for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not supposed to talk about what goes on in cabinet, but we 
had a good briefing from my colleague, the Minister of Industry, 
about the various productivity in industrial sectors in the 
country.  Do you know, Mr. Speaker, what the most productive 
sector was in the last seven years?  It was transport.  Do you 
know why it was transport?  Because of the policies of this 
government.  I am saying we got it right.  We can refine some of 
our policies, we can deal with airport leases, and we can even 
look at the rents.  We will do that because we are not dogmatic. 
We are flexible.  We can build on all of these successes and 
improve the transportation policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say a few words about my time in this portfolio.  Let 
us look at the accomplishments:  Bill C-9, the Canada Marine Act. 
Two of my predecessors worked on that bill.  We were not able to 
get it through the Senate.  We got that bill through the House 
with the co-operation of colleagues on either side and in the 
other place.  That bill allowed the 18 biggest ports to be 
commercialized, which has been a success that is working well. 
Great ports like Vancouver, Montreal and Halifax are doing even 
better because of those reforms that we brought in, as well as 
all of the smaller ports across the country.

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Secondly, there was the airline rationalization.  I gave my 
views the other week at third reading of Bill C-26, but somebody 
from outer space could only come to the conclusion that the 
government did not do the right thing.  We have taken the largest 
airline in the country, the second largest airline in the 
country, 41,000 employees, 350 aircraft, serving hundreds of 
destinations, and have merged them in an almost seamless fashion 
across the country, without a nickel from the taxpayer by way of 
subsidy or bailout, with no job losses, with no communities 
disturbed.  In fact, Charlo and Miramichi have had their air 
services restored.  No one has lost their air service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Air Canada can compete with the biggest and the best in the 
world.  That will be good for overseas pricing because it will 
take on British Airways, Alitalia and Cathay Pacific.  Before the 
merger we had 55% of the transborder routes between Air Canada 
and Canadian Airlines, and now it will grow even higher.  We have 
beaten the Americans at their own game.  That has been done by 
Canadian air carriers and we will improve their ability to 
compete even further with the Americans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will grant that we have a problem in domestic competition.  As 
I have said in the House before, we will not open up the skies 
and let the Yanks come in with their huge fleets.  United 
Airlines has 1,100 planes.  It wants to merge with U.S. Air, 
which has 500 planes.  Mr. Speaker, do you know what they could 
do?  I know they are part of the Air Canada lines, but let us 
take American Airlines and let us take Delta Airlines.  They 
would come in here like vacuum cleaners.  They would not be 
interested in serving Churchill.  My NDP friend from Churchill, 
our colleague from Yukon and my friend from Saskatchewan would 
not be served.  Those airlines would not want those smaller 
communities.  They would want to gobble up all the big bucks 
between Toronto and Vancouver or Montreal and Calgary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is like the old argument to privatize the post office. 
Remember all those people, those flat earth people, who said we 
should privatize the post office.  We know what would happen if 
we privatized the post office.  All of the FedExes, the 
Purolators and the UPSs would have their trucks whipping around 
between Toronto and Montreal on Highway 401, and they would be 
charging a premium.  Who would give mail service to Iqaluit, to 
Amherst, Nova Scotia, to Medicine Hat, to Churchill or to any of 
those small communities?  The good old muggins, the Government of 
Canada, the taxpayers would have to do that.  We would have to 
subsidize it.  We will not let the U.S. carriers in because I 
believe and this government believes that Canadian entrepreneurs 
can do the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read all of the editorials and columns by all of the so-called 
experts.  I do not want to debate with them on every point, but 
what a pathetic lot.  They say “We cannot compete.  We let the 
Americans in.  They are the only ones who can do it”.  If that 
is where the Canadian journalistic elite is going today, this 
country is in sad shape.  They have no faith in Canada and no 
faith in Canadian entrepreneurs.  All they have to do is look at 
the charter airlines.  Look at the WestJets.  Look at the smaller 
carriers.  Look at First Air, which is owned by aboriginal 
Canadians.  These carriers make money.  These are Canadian 
entrepreneurs and we will give them time to fill the slack and 
give us the competition.  It is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ken Rowe from Halifax has six 737 aircraft, plus he has his 
feeders.  He is starting on August 1 and he will take on Air 
Canada in Halifax.  He will take them on in Toronto, in Montreal, 
in Ottawa and in Winnipeg.  I say more power to him.  He is from 
Nova Scotia, a great province with entrepreneurs.  Why do we need 
Americans when we have people from Nova Scotia, western Canada 
and elsewhere to do these jobs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I finish I want to say a little about VIA Rail.  That is 
an accomplishment.  All the cuts the Tories made cut the 
lifeblood out of the passenger rail system.  For the first time a 
government said “No more.  We are committed to passenger rail. 
We will give you the subsidy for 10 years.  More than that, we 
will give you $401 million for capital expenditures”.  It has 
not been done before in Canada.  This is a seminal mark in our 
history.  The Government of Canada is committed to passenger 
rail.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Cumberland—Colchester says we are just 
throwing good money after bad.  He should tell that to his 
constituents because VIA Rail goes through his constituency.  We 
just restored the tourist train up to Cape Breton and we want to 
do more.  Is he going to tell the people of Nova Scotia that $400 
million should not be spent because it is throwing good money 
after bad?  I dare him to say that to his constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My last point, before I get totally wound up, is on grain 
transportation.  This was a tough file.  As a guy coming from 
Toronto, I had doubts sometimes about whether we could get a 
deal.  We consulted stakeholders.  We had two of the finest minds 
in the country, Mr. Estey and Mr. Kroeger, who came forward with 
reports.  We spoke with everyone:  the railways, the grain 
companies and the producers.  Not all producers are happy about 
it.  Some are opposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We studied this to death.  We had tough arguments in our own 
caucus.  I talked to opposition members.  We got a compromise 
which starts us on the path to true commercialization in grain 
transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I apologize for the fact that it comes so late.  I will come 
back at 12 o'clock, after I go back to cabinet and get 
authorization for the bill, and introduce it.  I cannot believe 
that anyone in the House would want to delay the grain bill and 
stop $178 million from going into the pockets of Canadian 
producers. 
<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé (Madawaska—Restigouche, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the minister says he does not speak out of cabinet and he has 
been briefed.  I hope he was briefed by the HRDC minister 
throughout all of this mismanagement. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister was singing the government's praises earlier. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the same government that said it would scrap the GST in 
its red book.  Remember that?  This is the same government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister stands today, looks Canadians in the eye and talks 
about Charlo Airport in New Brunswick.  I am glad he knows about 
Charlo Airport.  It was because of this government that this part 
of the country was cut off from the rest of the country with no 
air transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I want to thank the Charlo Airport commission for the 
excellent work it did in restoring air service to Charlo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about rail service in New Brunswick?  VIA Rail was there 
during the Tory government, but when the Liberal government came 
in it was taken out of Saint John and Edmunston, New Brunswick. 
These people as well were cut off from the rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I met with some students from McGill University and the 
University of New Brunswick.  They said that the problem with 
Canada is that people do not know the country.  They do not know 
what goes on in Quebec City.  They do not know what goes on in 
western Canada.  They do not know what goes on in Atlantic 
Canada.  We have one part fighting with another part.  They said 
it is too expensive to travel within Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has the government done?  What does the government intend 
to do to restore VIA Rail service in New Brunswick, to Edmunston 
and to Saint John? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I wonder if my 
friend listened closely to my speech.  The $400 million is to 
provide new equipment, track improvements and signalling, not 
just in the Windsor-Quebec corridor, but right across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the business plan, which I happen to have on my desk, which I 
am reviewing, I am asking VIA management to take a look at every 
single line which was cut in the last 10 to 15 years to see if 
there is a business case to bring that service back over a 
certain period of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assume the hon. member from Madawaska—Restigouche agrees with 
me, but he should talk to his buddy in front of him, his 
transportation critic, who was the only person in the country who 
slammed the government for providing $400 million to revitalize 
passenger rail.  Where is the consistency?  Where is the logic in 
the Conservative Party? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to Charlo and Miramichi, that had nothing 
whatsoever to do with the merger.  InterCanadian was a private 
company, not part of Canadian Airlines.  It was badly managed. 
It was overextended.  It tried to blame airline restructuring for 
its own follies.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I felt badly for those people in those two communities and those 
in the other two communities in Quebec and Newfoundland.  Happily 
the service has been restored, which shows how there can be 
flexibility.  The experience has always been, and that is why we 
improved the exit provisions in Bill C-26, that someone will come 
into a market and offer the service if the market is there.  The 
market is there in northern New Brunswick and it should be used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the last point, the hon. member from Saint John was heckling 
me about Saint John, Moncton and Fredericton.  I want to pose a 
question to her and maybe she will answer it.  She has to 
understand that there are three airports, Moncton, Saint John and 
Fredericton, all within a two to three hours drive.  I guess the 
market will have to make some choices as to which airport will 
actually be the main airport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from greater Toronto.  We have one airport that serves 
eight million people.  Someone coming from Cobourg or Kingston to 
Pearson has a three hour drive on Highway 401 and then has to 
park at alarmingly expensive rates.  The minister of state for 
Parks Canada is up in Muskoka.  He has to drive another two and a 
half hours.  We are used to that kind of sacrifice, and I hope 
the people in New Brunswick could make some accommodations during 
this very difficult transition.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Transport certainly 
is waxing eloquent in a high, wide and handsome fashion with the 
facts as far as I can see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two short questions.  The minister spoke about no one in 
the House delaying the bill with regard to the rail 
transportation of grain in western Canada in particular.  When 
did the minister receive the recommendations of the Kroeger-Estey 
commission that he commissioned?  Why did it take until the first 
of June to bring forward the changes to the rail transportation 
system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the minister received that report, with the tremendous 
amount of research and consultation that went into it, did he not 
implement the very recommendations of the Kroeger-Estey report 
including the backup from the five big grain companies?  In order 
to help the minister a little, I will just point out that I know 
the reason that did not happen.  The reason is that the Canadian 
Wheat Board minister and the Minister of Foreign Affairs told him 
that he could not implement that report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we had the views 
of the experts, Mr. Estey and Mr. Kroeger.  They were asked for 
technical opinions, their best work on what would make an 
efficient system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not live in a perfectly technical world.  We live in a 
world with real people who have real aspirations and we in this 
Chamber are all engaged in politics.  Mr. Kroeger and Mr. Estey 
did not address the political issues.  Someone had to, and it is 
us in the Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Granted, there was intense debate on this side of the House and 
trade-offs were made, but ultimately the package that came 
forward starts us on our way to a true competitive system and 
puts $178 million in the hands of prairie farmers.  I think it 
will herald even more reforms once the logic of those reforms is 
accepted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a procedural matter, I said I would come back in a little 
while once we get approval in cabinet for the bill to try to get 
consent for first reading of the grain bill.  I should also say 
that I have been talking with my colleague responsible for the 
wheat board because we together and our bureaucrats have been 
working on the MOU with the wheat board.  I would like to have 
that MOU in the hands of the opposition before debate starts on 
Monday.  We will try to get that organized. 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
minister mentioned airports and one large airport.  I want him to 
know that I have the largest city in the province of New 
Brunswick.  It is Saint John, New Brunswick, not Moncton. That is 
the largest city.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When our party was in government we had 4,000 men working at the 
shipyard.  What has happened?  No one is working at the shipyard. 
We had 325 people working at the sugar refinery.  What has 
happened?  The sugar refinery, which dates back to 1903, closes 
down today.  We had VIA Rail and a brand new train station built. 
What has happened?  Mr. Doug Young closed down the train station 
and took away VIA Rail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time the government sat down to look at what this means to 
the economy.  The minister should come to Saint John.  For the 
first time in the history of Saint John, New Brunswick, he will 
find paper bags on windows in the business sector of our city. 
This has never happened before.  We need this turned around.  If 
we are to have one airport, it better be in Saint John, New 
Brunswick, the industrial and business centre for the province of 
New Brunswick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think my 
colleague from Saint John got me wrong.  The government is not 
advocating the consolidation of the three airports in New 
Brunswick or the building of a superairport at Sussex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am saying is that I would hope the people of New 
Brunswick would understand that, given the kind of commercial 
environment we live in, it will be the marketplace that will 
determine which of those three airports in effect gets the best 
options from the travelling public.  It is not for us to say it 
is Moncton, Fredericton or Saint John.  We have to give the local 
authorities there the ability to market their services and to go 
out and compete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the last point, the hon. member talked about the dearth in 
shipbuilding jobs in Saint John.  I sympathize with her.  I am a 
great advocate of the Canadian shipbuilding industry.  The 
government is working on a new policy.  The hon. member talked 
about all the jobs in shipbuilding from the frigate program. 
Guess who started the frigate program?  It was the government of 
Pierre Trudeau in 1978.  I was a proud member of that government. 
It carried Saint John through for 15 or almost 20 years. They 
built great ships.  Let us try to build some more.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is not the first time that 
transportation in the history of this great place has been a hot 
topic.  It probably will not be the last time.  It is probably 
the reason that the transport committee room is the largest and 
at one time was considered the most important committee as the 
country developed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note the sparring between the Progressive 
Conservatives and the government.  This is May 2000.  We have to 
look at what we have now and we have to look to the future. 
Trying to score political points on the past does not solve any 
transportation problems across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the member for Cumberland—Colchester who serves 
on the transport committee.  He is indeed a good member.  His 
colleague inferred that he was the best member of the transport 
committee.  I have been on the committee for three years.  All 
parties are represented.  No one on that committee behaves in a 
manner superior to somebody else.  I find that a great insult to 
a committee that has worked on issues very co-operatively over 
the last three years.  We may disagree on philosophy at points, 
but we have turned out a lot of work for the House.  I take 
exception.  I know the hon. member from the PC Party is on that 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes without saying that we cannot talk about Canada without 
talking about transportation.  I do not suppose we ever will.  In 
the first class on Canada at university one of the statements 
heard is that the very existence of Canada is a sin against 
geography, and it still is.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There are members sitting to my right from Churchill and from 
Yukon.  What is their big problem?  Transportation.  What is the 
big problem in the prairie provinces, particularly in my 
province?  Oh, boy, it is transportation.  Members from the 
maritimes today raised their unique problem.  Transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has always been a Canadian problem.  It will always be a 
Canadian problem because the existence of Canada came about in a 
contradiction to geography.  We are here and we are proud of it, 
but in the year 2000 we are facing some very difficult times in 
transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From time to time Canadians have overcome many of their 
transportation problems.  Let us look at the history of our 
country and the promises made.  British Columbia came into 
Confederation because of a promise.  What was that promise?  It 
was the promise of a railway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not possible to provide transportation to the scattered 
areas of Canada without transportation being expensive.  Let us 
make no mistake about that.  I happen to come from a province 
that has 240,000 kilometres of roads and one million people. With 
the railways disappearing, we have a serious problem.  Is this 
the first time we have ever had a serious transportation problem? 
No.  Is the problem today as serious as it has ever been?  The 
answer to that question is yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is asking the Government of Canada to pull together 
with its counterparts in the provincial and municipal governments 
to develop a strategy so that we do look ahead into planning for 
the future.  Some bad things have happened in the last two 
decades.  Let us take a look at them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The west has lost thousands of miles of railways.  For the most 
part of the prairies we have basically lost VIA Rail service.  It 
is gone from most areas.  I can catch an Amtrak train at a point 
south in the United States with fewer miles to travel than if I 
drive to Saskatoon.  We have those problems, but those problems 
will not be fixed without a politically unbiased move to bring 
the country together to take a look at what has happened.  I want 
to mention just one or two points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious that today's Minister of Transport of Canada does 
not carry the same clout in federal financing as his predecessors 
once did.  I could not believe it when I looked at past budgets. 
At one time the transport file was the big spender.  That is not 
so today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many provinces including my own at one time 100% of 
everything taken in by Saskatchewan in fuel tax was spent on 
roads.  Some provinces spent 110% or more than what was taken in. 
I believe the province of Manitoba was in that general area.  To 
have that happen in Saskatchewan at the present time may not be 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today our economy depends on a very good seamless transportation 
system.  Earlier this morning I had the privilege of having 
breakfast with the Canadian Trucking Association.  It desperately 
needs this policy to be in place.  It desperately needs a sound 
transportation policy from the government in co-operation with 
the provinces and municipalities.  We must interconnect all modes 
of transportation and we cannot do it on an ad hoc basis.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What must happen is that the federal government has to quit 
using fuel taxes as a cash cow. Therein lies the problem. Last 
year the federal government collected $4.5 billion in fuel taxes, 
I repeat $4.5 billion, and it has put back only $150 million. 
That is a national disgrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one on this side of the House and I am sure no one on the 
government side would even come up with the idea that 100% has to 
be put back.  The Canadian Automobile Association has stood by a 
figure of 20%. If 20% of the fuel tax collected by the government 
were to go back to the provinces, we would be in good shape. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A study by the University of Manitoba Transport Institute shows 
that the government collects a disproportionate share of fuel tax 
from the prairie provinces.  I know we all guard our own little 
areas, the maritimes and so on. I want to point out very clearly 
that in the fiscal year 1998-99, the federal government collected 
$4.4 billion.  The same year, according to the study by the 
University of Manitoba, the federal expenditures on road 
infrastructure were $198 million, less than a nickel out of every 
dollar collected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether we are in the maritimes, on the coast, in the north or 
in the prairie provinces we cannot maintain our transportation 
road network on a mere five cents on the dollar being returned. 
It cannot be done.  I cannot even travel my constituency now and 
use all of the highways. I have to go on gravel country roads 
because the highways are unsafe to travel. We could blame it on 
heavy trucking, we could blame it on many things but it is simply 
a fact. If Saskatchewan were to get 60% of the money that has 
been allocated through the grain transportation bill and if I 
could somehow persuade that it would all go to my constituency, 
it would not bring Highway 13 up to standard, it would not bring 
all of Highway 18 up to standard, it would not bring Highway 47 
up to standard and it would not bring Highway 8 up to standard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are at a point in our history where the money has to be 
refunded.  If we do not move up the scale to 25%, there are parts 
of Canada, including Saskatchewan, which will have to take away 
what pavement is left and return the roads to gravel. That is a 
conclusion which most people could draw. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no national highway program.  There was when the 
Trans-Canada Highway was built.  Some 25,400 kilometres was 
identified in 1992, eight years ago, by a joint 
federal-provincial highway policy study.  There has been no 
administrative framework for maintaining or upgrading that 
highway and no national program since that time, for eight years, 
in a country that is totally dependent on its highway network. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, in the United States when I cross the border into North 
Dakota and get gas I see on the bowser the federal input, the 
state input and how much taxes are being paid.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the United States transportation equity act, $26,174,381,000 
in federal funding is going to be invested over the next five 
years.  That is a tremendous amount of money. Almost 50% and in 
some cases 80% of what they collect goes back and we send 5% 
back. It just will not work.  There are areas of Canada which 
just will not be able to do it. I believe if the House takes a 
look at our policy and the motion by the member, the need is very 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Politics in fuel tax is a recent thing in our history.  If we go 
back 25 years, a tax on fuel was used for that purpose.  Now, in 
particular in this House and in some provinces the motor vehicle 
fuel tax is not being directed to roads.  I suppose one could say 
politics is the art of the impossible and the federal government 
is severely addicted to tax revenue.  That addiction is killing 
transportation in Canada. I wonder if the government would 
consider a proposal like that of the Canadian Automobile 
Association, that 20% of the funds be returned to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My parents asked me to drive them to Ontario. Anyone who leaves 
my province and drives to Ontario, what route do they do?  Those 
people who live in the southern part get on Highway 39 and get to 
U.S. 2 and come all the way through the United States.  Why? 
Because of the roads and because of the cost factor.  The trucks 
are doing it as well.  It is because we have not had the ability 
or the common sense to put back into our transportation system 
the money that has been taken out. Is the money there? 
Absolutely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When my colleagues and I on the transport committee discussed 
the airline bill, Bill C-26, I was amazed at the entrepreneurship 
out there to bring good air travel to Canada.  I am amazed at the 
number of private entrepreneurs like WestJet and there are many 
more.  As a result we are going to be well served in the future. 
I am not even questioning it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However we should not expect a return in Canada to the VIA Rail 
service we once had.  There is not enough money in the country to 
support that service as we have in the past. There is no 
passenger rail link anywhere in the world that does not have to 
be subsidized.  When we in Canada have to subsidize up to 40% of 
what is called the most lucrative runs in Canada, we can readily 
understand why Canadians cannot expect to have the passenger rail 
service they once had. Would I like to see it?  Yes I would like 
to see it.  Does it sound good?  Yes it sounds good.  But let us 
deal with reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at these problems in the light of what we are facing 
in the year 2000.  Never mind the bickering of the past and the 
political points to be scored. 
Let us go forward here.  My colleague's motion is a good one. It 
does not deal with ideology.  It does not deal with privatization 
against crown ownership, knowledge, regulatory features and so 
on.  It is a good motion.  The motion simply says that we should 
on a non-political non-partisan basis get together and establish 
a framework whereby we can look at the various transportation 
issues facing Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I support that motion simply because Canadians need it. 
Canadians look forward to having some concrete body in place. The 
provinces are looking for it. The municipalities are looking for 
it.  The lead has to come from the government.  I will brag a 
little and say we certainly have a good transport committee to 
deal with it and to feed that information out to our counterparts 
in the municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, it is 2000.  Let us go on.  We cannot forget the 
past, but let us not let the past dictate what we are going to 
have in the future.  We must look ahead and we must do it 
co-operatively.  When it comes to transportation, Canadians 
really do not care too much about the political debate in the 
House. They want to see something concrete. 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the hon. member for Souris—Moose 
Mountain.  He has given us a very passionate and common sense 
view of this issue.  That is what is sometimes absent from the 
debates. He hit the nail on the head when he said that this is a 
straightforward issue, one of practicalities and one of 
priorities. When it comes to an issue such as this one, much like 
health care, one of the fundamentals has to be that the funding 
must be there at such a level and standard that the objectives 
can be achieved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member brings that same common sense approach to the 
committee, as does the member from Cumberland—Colchester, the 
mover of the motion.  They call upon the government in a very 
straightforward and principled way to address the issue at the 
very least by restoring funding to a level that will allow the 
fundamental aspects of transportation to be achieved.  Whether it 
be a national highways program, whether it be a return to some 
sort of fundamental approach to shipping, or shipbuilding, all of 
this has to be given at least a base level of support from the 
government in terms of resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue is analogous to health care. The pivotal point in the 
history of the country when deterioration started, whether it be 
in health care or our national transportation system, was when 
the government changed in 1993.  I do not want to come across as 
being too partisan, but I ask him to be honest. This is a 
question of truth and reconciliation. Is it not fair to say that 
when the government changed in 1993 and the funding was 
withdrawn, whether it be from health care, social transfers, or 
transportation, that was the point in our country's history when 
our transportation policy deteriorated, our roads deteriorated, 
and the shipbuilding policy started to come apart at the seams? 
Will the hon. member acknowledge that under a Conservative 
government things were better? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is exactly not the 
political move I would like to get in.  I do not want to go back 
and have those mind-boggling deficits and debt because that does 
not serve any purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say to the hon. member if we are going to have a highway 
program, we are not going to have it without co-operative 
funding.  The funding must be known ahead of time.  For example, 
if the Canada Health Act and health care across Canada is to be 
successful, it can only be successful with a promise of 50:50 
sharing. 
Whatever reason the government can give for taking that away is 
exactly the same reason we are facing a health crisis today.  It 
is exactly the same reason the highways, particularly in western 
Canada, are depreciating at a rate faster than ever before in our 
history.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is quite right.  I will not get into the 
political part of this issue, but the premise upon which he posed 
the question is quite correct. 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I agree that this is a parallel situation to medicare 
because this is an instance where the federal government has been 
asked to spend in an area that is 100% provincial responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to the percentage of fuel tax that the federal 
government is collecting, I remind the member opposite that the 
federal government under the constitution has an obligation to 
guarantee supply.  Our percentage of the fuel tax goes toward 
guaranteeing the oil supply from Saudi Arabia, for having the 
Department of National Defence helicopters, the border customs 
controls and the trade infrastructure.  We have to spend on those 
areas in order to guarantee supply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a great deal of sympathy for our national highway 
program.  The member is asking the federal government to invest 
in the national highway program, which is essentially a 100% 
responsibility of the provinces.  Is it not a conflict, 
especially with his party, when he asks that the federal 
government cut back in taxes, cut back on the debt, and in the 
same breath he wants the federal government to spend in areas of 
provincial jurisdiction? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me make one point clear. 
I never said that the government should cut back on taxes.  It is 
how it uses the taxes after it gets them.  That is the 
difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All I am saying is that if the government wants to keep the 
federal excise tax on fuel at its present level that is its 
responsibility.  The reason that tax went on in the first place 
was for highways.  There is no question about that.  All we are 
asking for is a mere 25% to go back to highway structure across 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To answer the second part of the member's question, the Canada 
Health Act was formulated and came into being on the assumption 
that Canadians would have a universal health system providing 
that 50% of the funding came from Ottawa.  Now we find ourselves 
in the position where it is not coming from Ottawa.  Health care 
across Canada is in a crisis and the crisis is growing.  There is 
the answer.  They cannot have it both ways. 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the comments of the member for Souris—Moose Mountain. 
I probably agree with 80% or 85% of what he had to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very familiar with Saskatchewan.  The member obviously has 
some firsthand knowledge as to the deplorable state of 
Saskatchewan highways and roads, particularly municipal roads. He 
is absolutely correct that 25% of the excise tax raised could go 
into a long term, well thought out infrastructure plan and 
program which would be accepted by tripartite municipal, 
provincial and federal funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the one point the member mentioned that perhaps he and 
I would disagree on was VIA Rail.  I would like to extend it into 
public transportation and I would like to hear his views and 
thoughts.  He said that a 40% subsidy is too much money to be 
putting into any type of transportation.  He referred to VIA 
Rail, but there is other public transportation such as buses, 
LRTs in Alberta and subways in other major metropolitan areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member believe that any type of subsidization for 
public transportation is certainly not within the parameter of 
the federal government?  Does he wish that public transportation 
did not exist? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I indicated, there is not 
a passenger rail system anywhere in the world which does not 
receive some form of subsidization, even the great passenger rail 
service in Japan or in France.  It does not make any sense to 
provide a service that would break the country and bring it to 
its knees.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us make it clear.  If the most profitable route of passenger 
rail has to be subsidized by some 40%, what would it cost Canada 
to return VIA Rail service to all places?  We would not have 
enough money in the whole Department of Transport to keep it 
going.  We have to use logic.  I am not against subsidizing 
transportation, but there comes a point in the philosophy of 
things that we have to say no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know of any city in Canada that has a public 
transportation system which makes money.  There may be some but 
they all receive some subsidy.  If we have to spend billions and 
billions of dollars to provide a passenger rail train which 
people are not using then governments have to make a decision. 
They should be subsidized but within reason.  That is where the 
federal, provincial and municipal governments come in.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise to speak to this motion tabled by my 
colleague from Cumberland—Colchester, who, like me, sits on the 
Standing Committee on Transport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of those watching, it might be relevant to 
reread the motion in order to properly establish the position of 
the Bloc Quebecois regarding the vote that will be held on this 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House recognize the urgent need to address the serious 
transportation problems facing the Canadian people, and call 
upon the government to establish a comprehensive national 
transportation policy that demonstrates leadership on this issue 
and which provides solutions to the problems shared coast to 
coast by all Canadians. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out right off that the Bloc Quebecois members will 
vote against this motion, and I will explain why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will look at parts of the motion.  It reads “That the House 
recognize the urgent need—”. We agree that there is some urgency 
and that there is an urgent need “to address the serious 
transportation problems”. 
Yes, there are serious transportation problems.  It goes on 
“—facing the Canadian people, and call upon the government to 
establish a comprehensive national transportation policy—”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is where the problem arises.  It is primarily because 
nowhere in the motion is there mention of respect for provincial 
jurisdictions that the 44 members of the Bloc Quebecois will 
oppose the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want my colleague from the Progressive Conservative Party to 
know that, had the motion contained reference to provincial 
jurisdictions, the situation would have been quite different. 
It is primarily for this reason that our party cannot support 
this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since they have been in power, the Liberals have shown a total 
and obvious lack of concern for transportation matters.  The 
last thing that we of the Bloc Quebecois would ask of them is 
for them to set up national transportation policies in areas 
that are not under their jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, we have differing visions of Canada.  That is why I 
say this will never work.  The Canada of today does not work, 
and it never will.  We in Quebec no longer believe the attempts 
to revise the federal system, the fine promises the Canadian 
Alliance candidates are making about redesigning Canada and have 
a more decentralized country. 
We have been there, done that, and it will not work.

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present, in the House, we have two visions of Canada.  On the 
one hand, we have the MPs from pro-centralist provinces or 
parties, those who envision a Canada in which the central 
government would set national policies and the provinces would 
be branch plants of this central power, no more and no less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other, we in Quebec are calling for a state of Quebec 
that is capable of managing itself, taking its own decisions.  I 
do not think that Quebec has to take a back seat to any province 
of Canada, still less to the central government, in the area of 
transport. Our lack of faith in the Liberal government makes it hard for us 
to vote in favour of this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the geography of Quebec and Canada, transportation 
infrastructures are especially important.  The great distances 
and the difficult winter weather conditions have often isolated 
regions far from the major urban centres that are economic 
centres as well.  Our metropolis, Montreal, whose economy is on 
the upswing, will be dynamic if the regions in Quebec are 
dynamic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen this happen with air transportation.  The airports 
of Montreal, Dorval or Mirabel, will only develop effectively if 
passengers from the regions use these airports. 
If we were compiling statistics, I am not sure that the vast 
majority of passengers passing through Dorval airport are 
Montrealers necessarily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Airports are primarily transit points, we must not forget. 
People pass through them to take another form of transportation 
or to get to another destination.  A lot of people using the 
Montreal airports come from Quebec's regions as well, be it from 
the Saguenay Lac-Saint-Jean, Lower St. Lawrence, North Shore or 
Abitibi-Témiscamingue areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, transportation is a factor in regional economic development. 
This fact has been all too often ignored by the Liberal 
government since 1993. 
Whether it is deregulation of airlines, bus companies or 
railways, divestiture by the federal government of ports and 
airports that are not cost-effective, icebreaking fees, the 
present cost of gas, or possible restructuring of the airline 
industry, the present Liberal government is systematically 
ignoring the vital importance of effective and accessible means 
of transportation to the development of regions, such as the 
North Shore or the Gaspé, which need to be linked more closely 
to large centres through effective means of transportation, not 
isolated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us remember how the Bloc Quebecois succeeded in getting the 
federal government to backtrack on its bill to deregulate bus 
transportation, Bill C-77.  We know that the Liberal government 
wants to revive this bill in the fall. 
We are certain that our partners in the bus industry, the 
members of the Association des propriétaires d'autobus du 
Québec, will support us in our fight against deregulation of bus 
transportation.

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know about the plans there were to cut back Via Rail 
services in the regions, the plans to franchise Via Rail.  There 
is no guarantee that there will be franchisers fighting over the 
Montreal-Gaspé line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois remains vigilant so that these regions, not 
just the Gaspé, but all outlying regions of Quebec, can have an 
effective transportation system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that trucking is costly in time, because of distances, 
but also in money, because of the price of gas. 
As I have said, bus travel from one region to another would have 
ceased to exist if the Minister of Transport had been allowed to 
deregulate it as he intended to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, for many months now, the devolution of regional 
airports by that same minister has been at a standstill, as he 
nibbles away at the envelopes designed to support those 
airports, which are not always cost-effective from a business 
point of view, but are cost-effective from the point of view of 
well-thought-out economic development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the ports, the minister has decided to devolve 
unprofitable ports, once again based on a short-sighted approach. 
Is the role of a government to administer only cost-effective 
facilities and to refuse to support infrastructures that are a 
little less profitable but still an essential instrument of 
economic development? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that the people of Quebec, who pay $32 billion 
in taxes every year, are not asking for handouts when they ask 
for services from the federal government.  I trust that no one 
here in this House and no one in our audience thinks that the 
government is doing us a favour when it maintains ports, 
airports or transportation infrastructures such as VIA Rail.  I 
trust no one sees this is a gift.  Those are our tax dollars. 
We in Quebec pay $32 billion in taxes annually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us stop believing that the federal government, in its 
generosity, in its great goodness, is agreeing to maintain some 
facilities that are a little less cost-effective.  It is quite 
simply just part of our tax money we are getting back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993, the government's general transportation policy, 
whether land, sea or air transportation, has been one of 
withdrawal. 
Naturally, the most distant regions are the ones that suffer 
most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last throne speech, the government reminded us of our 
19th century role as coureurs des bois.  It seems that this 
Liberal government's policy for the 21st century is to revive 
this tradition in the regions by destroying all other means of 
transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To remind hon. members of the background, let us recall how this 
abandonment of the transportation networks in the regions has 
taken shape since 1993.  There was a policy of devolution of 
ports and airports, which left many a distant community with no 
transportation infrastructure, or with very little. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the financial abandonment of rail passenger 
transportation, despite its essential nature for distant regions. 
We must not forget that the federal government has some 
responsibility under the Constitution in interprovincial 
transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are the icebreaking fees proposed by the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, who wanted the ships using Quebec ports to 
pay 80% of the fees, although they use only 33% of the services. 
With a coalition of shipowners and the various users of the St. 
Lawrence—Great Lakes system, the Bloc Quebecois succeeded in 
getting the Liberal government to back down, otherwise the ports 
of Quebec would have been at a competitive disadvantage compared 
to the ports of the maritime provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already mentioned another example: the minister's desire 
to put an end to the principle of cross-subsidization in bus 
transportation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would like to stress that the Bloc Quebecois 
will not be able to vote for this motion by the Progressive 
Conservative Party for, among other things, one very important 
reason: nothing in the motion confirms respect for provincial 
jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since we do not trust the Liberal government, which has been so 
slipshod in a number of areas relating to transport, we cannot 
give it carte blanche to establish national transportation 
policies as it likes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague from the Progressive Conservative Party will 
recall, the Minister of Finance was gloating in his latest 
budget speech in February over the $95 billion in budget 
surpluses for the next five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do you think we are going to let this government spend without 
control and run roughshod over provincial jurisdictions?  No 
way.  This is why agreeing with this motion would mean 
supporting the government's, especially the Liberal 
government's, desire to steamroller over provincial 
jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the reasons why we will oppose this motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I acknowledge the remarks made by the previous speaker 
from the Bloc.  He said that he was not going to support the 
motion because there was nothing in it that dealt with the 
jurisdiction of the provinces over the feds.  I just wondered if 
he would elaborate on his view of the subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we need a policy to correct some of the wide variety of 
problems, which he has outlined in his speech, on air, sea and 
land transportation from an economic development perspective, and 
on the problems with airports, including Montreal? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aside from the fact that the motion does not acknowledge his 
concerns about the jurisdiction of the provinces, does he 
acknowledge that there are problems in our transportation 
situation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he acknowledge that there is an inconsistent approach to 
transportation where some provinces may get a highway agreement 
and some provinces may not, where some may get money for the 
elimination of the Atlantic freight rate assistance program and 
some may not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he agree that there are inconsistencies in the applications 
to privatize the airports, and that the way the government 
applies its policies are inconsistent and unco-ordinated from one 
transportation mode to another? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he agree that we need an overall policy that should be 
developed by all of the stakeholders, including the provinces and 
the provincial ministers of transport? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would he agree, other than the fact that the motion does not 
address the provincial jurisdiction, that there are problems and 
an inconsistent, unco-ordinated system by the Department of 
Transport? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond:</B> Mr. Speaker, in fact, I share the member's 
views.  There is a problem, and a much more consistent approach 
needs to be developed.  Thought should also perhaps be given to 
intermodality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no problem with that, but the motion we are debating 
today does not mention respect for provincial jurisdiction.  It 
does not talk about a role for the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member's explanation with respect to consulting the 
provinces is all very well, but there is nothing in the wording 
of the motion requiring respect for provincial jurisdiction.  I 
will give him an example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada-Quebec municipalities infrastructure program should be 
in place by the end of the year.  There were negotiations and 
agreements with the provinces. 
The Bloc Quebecois agreed with this program.  We agreed that the 
municipalities should get two-thirds of grants for municipal 
projects such as water systems, sewage systems, asphalting, the 
construction of recreation centres or community centres.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bloc Quebecois members agreed, provided that provincial 
jurisdiction was respected and that, in the case of Quebec, its 
department of municipal affairs had the last say in the 
selection of projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the federal government came back with an infrastructure 
program that did not include this obligation to consult and that 
did not respect provincial jurisdiction, the Bloc Quebecois 
would not be in agreement.  The same is true for transportation 
infrastructures.  A $600 million envelope will apparently be set 
aside for the provinces for transportation infrastructures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will have no problem with that, as long as the exclusive 
jurisdiction of the provinces is respected and the provinces are 
consulted and take part in the decisions, always bearing in mind 
their jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key is there, and that is what I wish to say to my 
colleague.  There is nothing in his motion about a consultation 
process and respect for exclusive jurisdictions, so that the 
provinces have the final say in their respective areas of 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we are unable to support the motion as moved. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>]

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today on behalf of the New Democratic Party to speak to the 
motion from the hon. member for Cumberland—Colchester. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read the motion just so that everybody can hear it.  My 
hon. colleague from the Bloc had some issue with the provinces 
not being acknowledged.  Personally, I do not see anything in the 
motion that negates the provinces from being involved in this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I think it is extremely important for the government 
side of the House to hear and think about the motion because the 
minister said that he could not support it.  I am at a loss to 
understand why he cannot support it because if the government is 
not doing these things it has a serious problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what the motion states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House recognize the urgent need to address the serious 
transportation problems facing the Canadian people, and call upon 
the government to establish a comprehensive national 
transportation policy that demonstrates leadership on this issue 
and which provides solutions to the problems shared coast to 
coast by all Canadians. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How on earth can the government not support that motion?  If it 
is not doing that, what the heck is it doing there?  If it is not 
doing that it should not be there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the members on the government side vote against this motion, 
everybody in Canada better be giving their heads a knock in the 
next election.  If the government cannot address this issue and 
have a transportation policy in place, we have serious problems. 
It would be like the finance minister not having a plan for what 
we will do years down the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I go any further, and before I get too involved in the 
whole issue of transportation, I want to mention that I will be 
sharing my time with my hon. colleague from the Yukon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without question, my fellow New Democratic MPs and I will be 
voting yes to this motion.  There is also no question that the 
Liberal government has completely dropped the ball when it comes 
to transportation, and we will see that clearly tonight for sure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also no question that Canada needs the federal 
government to show leadership in dealing with national 
transportation issues.  As the New Democratic transportation 
critic, I have been saying this for a long time, and I am glad to 
see that the Conservative Party has been listening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to say that it seems very odd that this motion today is 
coming from the Conservative Party.  After all, when that party 
was in power during the Mulroney years—and the transport 
minister mentioned this as well—it was just as bad in 
transportation policy as the Liberal government is today.  In a 
lot of areas, the Liberal government has just continued with the 
policies put in place by the Mulroney Conservative government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of a sudden the Conservatives say that the government has to 
show leadership on national transportation policy.  Where was the 
leadership when the Conservatives were in power? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look for a moment at the Mulroney Conservative 
government's record.  This is the party that deregulated the 
airline industry in Canada causing the crisis we have today. Of 
course the Liberal government continued the deregulation so it is 
just as much to blame.  It can go ahead and blame it on the 
Tories, and go back and forth, but the bottom line is that it is 
just as much to blame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of deregulation, Air Canada drove its only 
competitor, Canadian Airlines, out of business and now we have a 
monopoly, making things very tough for Canadians to get around 
and to fly.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where was the reform alliance?  Where were its members through 
all these last six or seven years while all this was going on? 
They were there cheering the Tories and the Liberals on 
deregulation and privatization and not doing anything to force 
the government into going against the policy of privatizing. They 
were doing nothing to force the government to come up with a 
transportation policy that addressed the social needs of 
Canadians as well as just making a buck. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Mulroney Conservatives were also the ones who made the 
deepest cuts to VIA Rail.  Of course the Liberal government 
continued that policy too which has caused a lot of problems for 
communities in my riding of Churchill and many others across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look closely we see that the Liberal government did not 
change much of anything when it replaced the Mulroney 
Conservative government in 1993.  It reminds me of a fable Tommy 
Douglas used to tell, the story of Mouseland.  Many New Democrats 
and people with any kind of social conscience in Canada have 
heard the story of Mouseland, but I would urge those who have not 
to take the time to watch it on video or read it.  It is fairly 
easy for people to understand if they are willing to take the 
time to view it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mice in Mouseland always elected cats to parliament. There 
was one party of white cats and one party of black cats, and we 
all know who those are, the Tories and the Liberals.  But no 
matter which party the mice elected, the government always made 
laws that benefited cats instead of mice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For anybody out there who has not figured it out, all of those 
ordinary Canadians out there, the everyday people putting in 
their 8, 10, 16 hours of work every day toiling to make a dollar, 
and all those people out there fighting to improve things for all 
Canadians are the mice that are not being represented by those 
parties and not having policies come forth that benefit all 
Canadians. What the mice needed to do was elect a government of 
mice instead of cats.  It seems pretty obvious does it not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point Tommy Douglas was making is as true today as it was 40 
years ago.  There really is not much difference between the 
Liberal government and the Mulroney Conservative government.  The 
Liberals are red, the Conservatives are blue, but they are both 
cats.  That is why no one should be surprised when the Liberal 
government gets elected and continues Conservative policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we are talking about cats, we now have the green cats, the 
reform alliance.  I mention reform alliance because although the 
party has changed its name, people still see the Reform Party. 
The Canadian Alliance tries to get them to not think of reform 
because a lot of Canadians now realize that what the Reform Party 
did was to continue to support those policies.  Those members 
will try to fool a few Canadians as to who they are voting for in 
the next election, but Canadians are a whole lot smarter than 
that.  They will know, and we will make sure they know, that the 
reform alliance party is still the party that supports 
Conservative and Liberal policies that do not benefit all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The man who set most of the Liberal government's transport 
policies was none other than Doug Young.  Doug Young was a 
minister in the Liberal government until he lost his seat in the 
1997 election.  For a lot of that time he was the transport 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the first things he did as transport minister was to 
eliminate the Crow rate subsidy for western farmers. There was no 
question the Mulroney government would have eliminated the Crow 
subsidy.  It would have taken a period of time to eliminate it, 
but the bottom line is that it would have eliminated it.  This 
was the single biggest blow to the western farmers.  It is one of 
the biggest reasons for the crisis facing so many farm families 
on the prairies today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is pretty obvious that if we do one thing downward, we see 
the crisis that develops as a result of it.  What did members of 
the Reform Party say when Doug Young and the Liberals got rid of 
the Crow rate?  They supported it.  The Reform Party out there 
fighting for farmers in Canada supported the elimination of the 
Crow rate.  Meanwhile other countries were still receiving 
subsidies.  The party which says it supports the west sided with 
the Liberal government, the big banks and the rail companies 
against farm families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whatever happened to Doug Young?  We all know what happened to 
Doug Young. He is with the reform alliance.  What is extremely 
interesting is that Doug Young, the former transport minister who 
set all these policies the Liberal government is following is now 
with the reform alliance.  And the Liberal government continues 
with the policies he set as transport minister.  Is there any 
difference? Not a bit; Canadian Alliance, Conservative or 
Liberal, there is no difference.  As Tommy Douglas would have 
said, a cat is a cat whether it is red, blue or green.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about the New Democratic Party's transport 
policy.  The most important thing is that our transport policy 
benefits ordinary Canadians, not corporate special interests. 
Canadians pay millions each year in fuel taxes and only a tiny 
fraction of that money goes back into transportation.  The roads 
and highways in many parts of the country are in terrible shape 
because of federal neglect.  This hurts our economy because most 
trade in goods is conducted by road and it makes the roads less 
safe for Canadians to drive on.  For the amount Canadians pay in 
fuel taxes, they deserve quality roads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also goes beyond that.  We heard my hon. colleague from the 
Bloc talk about it.  The people of Quebec have given up hope on 
the federal government because they have seen that unless there 
is a federal government which supports all communities and all 
the provinces, we cannot survive.  They have given up hope on 
Canada. The rest of us have not.  We are not going to give up 
hope. We are going to fight. We are going to keep the federal 
government honest and make it put some dollars back into all of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to conclude my remarks by reiterating that the New 
Democratic Party believes the federal government has a vital role 
to play in transportation.  Federal investment in transport is 
important for the economy as well as the safety of Canadian 
travellers. Transportation is vital to linking the communities in 
our country from coast to coast to coast.  It has been falling 
apart under the Liberal government.  Train stations are closing, 
airlines are shutting down, communities are being cut off and 
highways are crumbling.  The federal government has to make a 
commitment to ensure that our country has a safe, effective and 
efficient national transportation system and it has to do it now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government does not agree it has a part in that, it will 
vote against this motion tonight.  But if it truly is a 
government that is out there to ensure we have a national 
transportation policy, I cannot see how it could possibly not 
support this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point 
of order.  I wonder if I could have the indulgence of hon. 
members to get unanimous consent so that we could briefly revert 
to introduction of bills to permit the introduction and first 
reading of a bill entitled an act to amend the Canada 
Transportation Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You may remember, Mr. Speaker, that I tabled a draft bill 
yesterday afternoon at three o'clock. This is the so-called 
famous grain bill.  If we could have first reading right now, we 
could proceed expeditiously to debate this matter later in the 
week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent to revert 
to introduction of government bills at this time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I want to thank the member from the NDP for her support even 
though we have fundamentally different perspectives on how this 
should work out and how it should be handled. I do take exception 
to her statement that the Conservative policy is much the same as 
the Liberal policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to refer her to a study done by the University of 
Manitoba Transport Institute.  It is from a very distinguished 
province with a very distinguished university.  I am sure she 
will agree with me on that. It reports that when the Liberals 
came into power there was zero revenue surplus in the Department 
of Transport.  Considering all the revenue in and all the 
expenses out, it pretty much broke even according to the Manitoba 
study.  It projects that by next year the Department of Transport 
will have a surplus of $3.9 billion based on revenue from gas 
taxes, fuel oil taxes and all the other sources of revenue and 
its expenses. That is $3.9 billion that has been taken out of the 
transportation system since the Liberals came to power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member think that the $3.9 billion would have had 
an impact on the roads in Manitoba, perhaps the viability of the 
airports and the possibility of a mass transit system in the 
country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not think there is 
any question that more dollars should be going from the federal 
government to the provinces on transportation throughout Canada. 
That is all the provinces. There is no question those dollars 
need to go there. Taking dollars from the fuel taxes is what 
Canadians are indicating they want to see happen.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a lot easier for government to go out, spend dollars and 
have support for spending those dollars if Canadians can see the 
direct relationship of fuel tax dollars going into roads, 
infrastructure and also the environment.  There is no question 
that people think that dollars coming in from fuel taxes should 
be going into the environment as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen the Liberal government create one slush fund after 
another with taxpayer dollars.  It is not providing the services 
such as health care and education.  It is not putting enough 
dollars into the environment and transportation. It is creating 
its own little slush fund.  I do not know about other Canadians, 
but quite frankly I expect to see a lot of those slush fund 
dollars pop up in Liberal ridings prior to the next election. The 
bottom line is, that is not how government should operate. We 
should not have to wait until prior to an election to see some of 
our taxpayer dollars benefiting all Canadians.  Those services 
should be provided all the time.  That is what we want to see the 
government do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Forget about the slush funds, a slush fund for the HRDC 
minister, another for the justice minister and another for the 
transport minister.  There is nothing for the speakers, but there 
are slush funds here, there and everywhere. The government is 
going to get everybody onside prior to an election and then it is 
just going to give them a good one after the election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point 
of order.  I was on my way over to see the member for 
Cumberland—Colchester when my friend from Churchill finished her 
speech.  I did not have the opportunity to ask him and his party 
for consent to revert to introduction of bills, which I had asked 
of the other parties earlier and to which they agreed. We are not 
trying to put anything on anybody.  We are just trying to get the 
bill read for the first time right now so that we can start 
debating it.  All members have the bill.  It was tabled 
yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I would ask you to seek unanimous consent to revert 
to the introduction of bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is it agreed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  No. 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I find it 
fortunate that we are having this debate on transportation for a 
few reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A short time ago I listened to the Minister of Transport say 
before the merger of the two major airlines that we faced a 
duopoly which was not very good, that it was a terrible situation 
to have a duopoly and that somehow having a monopoly was going to 
be a better situation. I have a couple of current examples since 
the merger has taken place to show quite clearly that it is not a 
benefit to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first is a letter I received from a constituent.  I have to 
explain that in the Yukon and all of the north we depend on air 
travel more than any other mode, beside the one road out of the 
Yukon which is the Alaska Highway.  The Yukon has the Frostbite 
Music Festival, the Sourdough Rendezvous Festival, the Arctic 
Winter Games and various conventions.  The storytelling festival 
is coming up, as well as the Dawson City Music Festival. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A very able travel agent managed to negotiate a special rate to 
assist cultural groups to bring people north.  Otherwise one 
positively could not afford any of this to happen.  I will quote 
from her letter. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the merger took place, Air Canada has done the following. 
Individuals who had purchased regular fare tickets and had asked 
to change their flight dates by a few days were told that their 
tickets could only be changed if they paid full fare rates, 
$1,500, as opposed to the $100 to $200 fee that Canadian Air used 
to charge for such a transaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who have electronic bookings, tickets, now can't get them 
changed to hard copy regular tickets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian Air used to have zone fares for arts groups which 
allowed tickets to be purchased at less than regular fare rates. 
Zone fares have now been cancelled. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the end of cheap fares to the Yukon. She mentioned that 
it is almost impossible now to get a booking on air mile points 
out of the north and that there are rumours that the requirements 
will go up to 25,000 points.  It used to be considered a short 
haul of 15,000 points out of the north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another example. As a member of parliament, I travel 
extensively.  I was heading home from Ottawa last week. 
We were told that our regularly scheduled flight No. 3139, which 
was supposed to be direct from Ottawa, leaving at 6.30, would be 
delayed.  It did not have enough gas so we would be stopping in 
Winnipeg to refuel.  When we got to Winnipeg we were informed 
that the pilots had already exceeded the time they were allowed 
to work but out of consideration for their passengers they would 
continue on the flight all the way to Vancouver. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1230"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT30"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT30"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1230
<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no way they would not have known these pilots would be 
exceeding their allowed working time before they had even left 
the airport in Ottawa.  The fact is we could not get off the 
plane in Winnipeg.  There was no choice of airline to take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like assurances from our Minister of Transport that this 
is not the regular practice and that this is not what travellers 
will face.  We are talking about the safety of Canadian citizens 
in the air as well as the pilots.  What kind of choice did the 
pilots have?  Obviously there were none.  They were expected to 
carry on with the flight.  The fact that we were given the 
impression the pilots had agreed to do it at the last moment was 
completely unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada does not have a national highway policy.  The motion 
today is a chance for us to highlight that point.  It is also a 
chance to highlight what we are looking for in transportation 
policy overall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has to be linked to a rational energy policy.  It has to be 
linked to our use of fossil fuels.  It has to be linked to our 
environment and the effect of fuels on our environment and on the 
ozone layer.  Canada is a northern climate and is more 
susceptible to the ravages of environmental degradation from the 
use of fossil fuels.  We should take all those issues into 
consideration when it comes to transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point I wanted to raise is that as a representative of a 
northern riding I want to stress that the north depends on air 
travel.  Yukon has one road.  There is one road into the 
Northwest Territories.  We have to fly into Nunavut.  The rest of 
transportation depends on either water in the summer or airlines 
in the winter.  It makes living extremely expensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned the effects on cultural travel, but the effects on 
medical travel can be considered a crisis in some situations.  In 
case anybody does not know the cost of a ticket out of Yukon, it 
is $1,500 just to Vancouver.  If one needs to get anywhere 
eastward one is looking at $4,000 for a regular ticket to Ottawa. 
There are no bargains for people who have family crises outside 
Yukon.  They have to pay $4,000.  The flights are absolutely, 
incredibly packed and oversold.  If one has an emergency one is 
lucky to even get out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very few people can come up with $4,000 for one person to get 
out of Yukon if he or she has to go to a funeral, attend a family 
member during a medical emergency, or accompany a family member 
who has been Medivaced to either Vancouver or Edmonton.  Those 
are the usual places.  They cannot afford to do it.  I do not 
think that is fair.  I do not think that is what we should be 
accepting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to raise one last point.  The last part of the 
motion indicates that the government needs to demonstrate 
leadership on this issue and provide solutions to the problems 
shared from coast to coast.  We have a third coast.  I would like 
the Conservative Party to think about that today and for the rest 
of its tenure.  Canada goes from coast to coast to coast.  We 
have an Arctic coastline as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of being a northerner is being forgotten about.  It is like 
a huge piece of our country somehow does not exist.  Often I will 
get maps from different people which completely cut off all three 
territories.  I do not think a political party that claims to 
represent the complete country should neglect the north and not 
recognize the third coastline which belongs to this country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest to 
the two NDP members and the specific examples they gave regarding 
the kinds of problems in our transportation network. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must keep in mind that we are talking about a network that is 
composed of thousands of components.  One of the most crucial 
components besides the federal government is the provincial 
governments.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear from the NDP representatives the definition 
of co-operation to which they keep referring, the co-operation of 
the federal government with the provincial government.  How in 
their policy would they be able to get provincial input into 
their so-called co-operative model and liaison with provincial 
governments if the provincial governments have only one track or 
one goal in mind, would like to have everything their way and no 
other way is acceptable to them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I did not raise 
co-operation though I think it is critical.  The northern 
highways I have been on are in incredible shape.  The last time I 
drove out I took the B.C. highway.  I swore I would never take 
the Stewart-Cassiar again.  It was beat to pieces by the great 
big trucks travelling on it.  It had not been maintained. I drove 
for hours and hours and hours, 10 hours in some cases, and there 
is no gas station.  I do not think that is acceptable and I have 
decided that I will not drive on it again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as co-operation goes, we have one road and one airline 
out of the north.  Who are we supposed to be co-operating with? 
We do not have a choice.  Transportation is very limited.  The 
provinces and territories should co-operate federally so that we 
can have a cohesive transportation network which makes it 
possible for Canadians to get where they need to go and to be 
able to afford it.  It is a three day drive from Whitehorse to 
Vancouver or a three day drive from Whitehorse to Edmonton.  The 
distances are immense.  The cost of gas is immense.  People still 
have to eat and sleep and need places to go.  Yes, we do need to 
co-operate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to safety, I gave an example of flying from Ottawa 
to Vancouver where for me the issue was safety.  I do not want to 
fly with pilots who have overworked.  I know what I feel like 
when I am tired.  I do not want to be in a bus when someone is 
tired and driving.  I certainly do not want to be in an airplane 
when somebody is flying who should not be flying and has exceeded 
his or her hours of work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not see safety as something that can be compromised or 
about which we can say we will have some sort of voluntary safety 
standards.  Safety has to be clear cut.  We have to expect a 
standard of safety.  Now that we have a monopoly does not mean we 
should not expect a level of safety that will keep us all getting 
from one airport to the next.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to the hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Transport in his questions to you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  They were not to me. They were to 
her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais:</B>  I thought I had to go through you, 
Mr. Speaker.  I know there was an implication from the 
parliamentary secretary that the reason the government could not 
accomplish anything is that it cannot seem to get the provinces 
onside.  My question to you is that I am— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The question is for the member for 
Yukon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is almost becoming 
like a trick way to get my question out.  Fair enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The implication is that the government cannot get the provinces 
onside.  Is the member willing to accept the defeatist attitude 
by the government that we should give up if we cannot get the 
provinces to agree with everything?  Should we just not bother 
with anything and say to heck with a national transportation 
policy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government is doing that, as far as I am concerned it is 
doing exactly what the Bloc is saying with respect to Quebec.  It 
has given up on the federal government.  It will not work so it 
wants out of here.  Is that what she thinks the parliamentary 
secretary is saying as well, that they will just give up on the 
provinces? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I hope that is not what 
the parliamentary secretary was saying because it just leads into 
the whole sense that parliament is irrelevant and why are we 
bothering to be here if we have no role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do have a role.  We cannot compromise when it comes to safety 
and issues of national importance.  We have to expect, demand and 
put in place the laws we need to make sure we have what we need 
and that parliament is worth something.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will be sharing my time with the member for Saint John.  I would 
like to say a few words in the transportation debate.  Coming 
from an island province, transportation is very important to us 
and is always uppermost in our minds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a physically huge country.  From the very beginning of 
its history as a nation, transportation issues have been very 
prominent on the national stage.  At first it was the building of 
our Transcontinental Railroad.  Then came the highways and the 
airports.  It seems we are always talking about transportation in 
the House of Commons.  Well we should be, because it is very 
important to every province in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Newfoundland joined Confederation back in 1949, our 
transportation link to the mainland was written into our terms of 
union, which are part of the Constitution of Canada.  It meant 
that we had a constitutional guarantee of passenger and rail 
ferry service between the island and the mainland of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1980s, with the railway still losing money and the 
service being taken over more and more by trucks in the province 
of Newfoundland, the federal government and the province of 
Newfoundland signed a deal to give up the railway in exchange for 
about $1 billion.  Those $1 billion were used to upgrade the 
Trans-Canada Highway, to rebuild it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However we still have a constitutional guarantee of a car-ferry 
link to the mainland.  That link is often in the news, as we are 
all very much aware.  When I say our current ferry service is 
often in the news, it is not often good news.  It is generally 
bad news with continual complaints of poor scheduling, poor 
accommodations, long lineups and whatnot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very costly service for the people of Newfoundland.  Let 
me give an indication of how costly it is.  A family of four, 
travelling in a car from North Sydney to Port aux Basques pays 
$62 for the car, $20 for each of the two adults and $10 for 
children under 13, for a total of $122 not including the cost of 
food and other incidentals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the family were travelling by way of Argentia to the mainland 
of Canada it would cost $124 for the car, $55 for each adult and 
$27.50 for each child, for a total of $289 to travel that small, 
narrow body of water between Nova Scotia and the province of 
Newfoundland.  That is cost prohibitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no wonder that three-quarters of American tourists who 
head into the maritimes never make it to the province of 
Newfoundland.  The Atlantic Ocean is there.  The ferry lineup is 
there.  The cost is there.  All these factors serve to deter 
tourists from coming to the province of Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in Newfoundland have always made the point that our ferry 
link with the mainland is part of our Trans-Canada Highway. 
Therefore, why should it cost a traveller more to travel by ferry 
than it does to drive a similar distance on the Trans-Canada 
Highway?  There is no reason in God's earthly world why that 
should happen.  Instead the rates keep going up and the service 
seems to be continually getting worse. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1245"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT33"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT33"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1245

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not long ago I raised in the House of Commons the possibility of 
freezing these rates for an indefinite period of time.  The 
minister was not very receptive to that idea.  The government did 
freeze the rates for this season only, mainly because of the St. 
John's West byelection.  In order to strengthen our growing 
tourism industry I feel there is a case to be made now for an 
extended freeze. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would prefer that the rates be reduced to reflect the cost of 
equivalent highway travel.  Given the reaction last week when I 
raised this issue with the minister in the House, I do not think 
he would agree with that.  In any case, there is a case to be 
made for it.  Prince Edward Island has a fixed link.  Therefore, 
I cannot see why the people of Newfoundland and Labrador should 
not have a fixed rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another matter which comes up continually in Newfoundland with 
respect to the ferry service is the labour relations issue.  The 
workers on the ferry are unionized and have the right to strike. 
Year after year we are threatened with a strike at the height of 
the tourism season, about this time each year, just as that very 
important season is about to begin.  That takes its toll on 
tourists, who do not want to run the risk of being stranded on 
Newfoundland because of a labour dispute.  Sometimes the 
possibility of a strike is almost as detrimental as the strike 
itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solution here—and I want to offer the minister a solution 
instead of a complaint—is to have the ferry service declared an 
essential service, with workers being given the right to some 
kind of binding arbitration mechanism.  That way both the workers 
and the travelling public would be protected.  However, to date 
no federal government has come up with a satisfactory answer to 
that problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The majority of the board of directors of the ferry service 
should be from the province of Newfoundland.  Unless it has been 
changed recently, I do not think the majority of the board of 
directors is from Newfoundland.  After all, the only reason the 
ferry system exists is to serve the people of Newfoundland and 
Labrador and people who want to visit the province.  The reason 
the majority of the board of directors should be from 
Newfoundland is because if we inundate Marine Atlantic's 
corporate culture with Newfoundlanders we can make service to the 
Island of Newfoundland its reason for being, instead of a 
sorrowful duty that it is compelled to perform under the 
constitution of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government and Marine Atlantic make the people of 
Newfoundland feel that they are doing us a favour by providing 
the service.  That attitude seems to permeate the entire 
operation.  That attitude has to change if the service is to be 
improved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The importance of improving the ferry service has been made even 
more important, given the fact that the airline industry has 
become a monopoly.  Air Canada has a virtual monopoly in the 
outlying areas of the country, making it even more difficult for 
the travelling public.  It is hard to get a flight.  Flights are 
overbooked and flights are cancelled.  The service, generally, is 
not what it used to be.  Competition is the best cure. 
Competition is very important for people who live on an island.

difficult to get a break.  Fighting those circumstances was one 
of the reasons I was sent here to the Parliament of Canada with 
six other MPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very disappointed with the Liberal members from 
Newfoundland.  They do not seem to be doing the job of raising 
the important issues that need to be raised, like Marine 
Atlantic, like harbour clean-up, like the health issue which is 
plaguing our province, like Voisey's Bay and Churchill Falls and 
so many more issues that are vital to the people of Newfoundland 
and Labrador.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am a bit surprised and 
shocked by the comments which the member for St. John's East has 
presented to this House regarding the ferry service.  He knows 
very well that this government has gone full speed ahead, has 
increased capacity and has leased a larger vessel.  We will have 
a brand new vessel crossing the strait next year.  We are dealing 
with the huge problem of capacity.  Millions of dollars have 
already been devoted to that service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to go back to the comment the member made pertaining to 
the freezing of the rates, and even the lowering of the rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rates are determined by a multitude of factors, which are 
cost factors, such as the depreciation of the vessel, labour 
costs, fringe benefits, maintenance and landing fees.  I could go 
on and on.  Collectively, those result in what we call a fee per 
customer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the member is recommending is that this whole host of costs 
be frozen.  I would ask the member if he and his party are 
recommending cost controls, cost freezes and the freezing of all 
prices in his province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle:</B>  No, Mr. Speaker, I am not saying that 
there should be cost controls on everything in the province, if 
that is what he is asking.  I am not saying, either, that some 
significant improvements have not been made to the ferry service 
in Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am saying, however, is that there has to be some 
recognition of the fact that we are an island province.  There 
has to be some recognition of the fact that the distance between 
Nova Scotia and Newfoundland should have a rate charged which is 
equivalent to what it would cost to travel the same distance on 
the Trans-Canada Highway.  I do not think that is an unreasonable 
request. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, I am very much aware that there are heavy costs associated 
with running the ferry service between Nova Scotia and 
Newfoundland.  No one can deny that.  However, the point has been 
made continuously to the federal government over the last 15 or 
20 years that people should pay an equivalent cost to that which 
people pay when travelling on the Trans-Canada Highway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quoted to him a moment ago the rate if we were travelling from 
Port-aux-Basques to Argentia.  The fee is $124 for the car, $55 
for each of the adults and $27.50 for each child, for a total of 
$289.  That is cost-prohibitive.  Is it any wonder that people 
travelling from the United States to Atlantic Canada will very 
often stop in Nova Scotia?  They will not take the time to go 
across to Newfoundland because it is cost-prohibitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking the federal government to recognize that and to 
say that the costs will be the equivalent rate that travellers 
would pay on the Trans-Canada Highway for that distance.  That is 
not an unreasonable request.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I just wondered if the hon. member for St. John's East 
could help us.  It is my understanding that Marine Atlantic had a 
board of directors that spent about a year travelling around the 
world looking for alternative craft, alternative ferries, to 
provide better service.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not only money that discourages tourists from travelling 
to Newfoundland; it is also the service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This week a lady asked me how to contact Marine Atlantic.  She 
wanted to make a reservation.  She was unable to make a 
reservation for her family to travel to Newfoundland this summer. 
We are trying to help her.  If she and her family are not able to 
go to Newfoundland, that will mean lost tourism dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member enlighten us as to how Marine Atlantic 
goes about purchasing new ferries?  These are substantial 
investments of $40 million to $70 million.  There was a recent 
deal on one new ferry, plus a short term fast ferry for the 
summer.  Could the hon. member elaborate on the process? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle:</B>  Mr. Speaker, arrangements were made for 
the purchase of a new ferry.  We have been receiving quite a 
number of complaints from brokers who were supposed to be given 
an opportunity to bid on the purchase of the ferries.  Some of 
the brokers have been telling us that the system that is 
currently being used by Marine Atlantic for the purchase of these 
ferries is not a good system, that it leaves a lot to be desired 
and that it does not seem to be a transparent system.  We have 
received quite a number of complaints about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The making of reservations on the ferry continues to be a 
nightmare for people who want to travel to the province of 
Newfoundland. 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my hon. colleague from St. John's East, Newfoundland for sharing 
his time with me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning we heard the hon. Minister of Transport state that 
I was not going to lose my airport in Saint John.  I want him to 
know that I have a few questions and I wish he were in the House. 
I would like to know why the minister has made a deal whereby I 
have to pay $800 and only get a muffin when I fly to Ottawa.  If 
I was to fly out of Moncton, I would pay $300 and I would get a 
full course meal.  I have not figured this one out yet.  I will 
speak to the Minister of Transport to see if he can get me a 
little more than a muffin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government wants the economy to boom, there is a need for 
all modes of transportation.  If the government wants the economy 
in the maritime provinces and Newfoundland to boom, give us all 
our modes of transportation, which we had before the Liberal 
government came into power.  We had all modes of transportation. 
We had VIA Rail.  A brand new train station was built.  Then, Mr. 
Young, who was the minister of transport, came to Saint John and 
closed the brand new train station that was built just six months 
before the 1993 election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the most modern shipyard there is in Canada.  When it 
comes to the shipbuilding industry, let me say that we would like 
to have built a ferry for Newfoundland.  Why was the government 
going all around the world looking for a ferry?  We could build a 
ferry.  My understanding was that there was some sort of 
agreement that if the government needed ferries they would be 
built in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 8, 1999, Frank McKenna, the previous premier of the 
province of New Brunswick, openly criticized the federal 
government's lack of vision for Atlantic Canada.  He is quoted as 
saying that the Liberal record is terrible and that the 
government exhibits total ignorance when it comes to 
shipbuilding.  This is from Frank McKenna, who the government 
just asked to run as a Liberal in the next election.  I have to 
say that he knew what it was doing was wrong for Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My understanding is that a report was presented by the members 
of the Atlantic Liberal caucus which states that the Atlantic 
Canadian economy is hitting an all time low and that part of the 
solution to the problem is to bring the shipbuilding industry 
back up to its potential and proven strength by adopting a new 
national shipbuilding policy. 
This is the Liberal's Atlantic caucus making this statement.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Minister of Industry, with whom I have spoken, has 
told me that I also have to deal with the Minister of Transport. 
I want to know what we can do about shipbuilding.  As everyone 
knows, we need ships if we are going out on the water.  We are 
not going to swim across the Bay of Fundy, that is for sure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been asking for a national shipbuilding policy.  All we 
have been asking for is to make us equal with all the other 
countries around the world.  The contents of a shipbuilding 
policy would be the provision of an improved export financing and 
loan guarantee program, similar to the title 11 program in the 
United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are with the Jones act.  What do we do?  The U.S. is 
allowed to bid on ship repairs throughout Canada.  It can also 
bid on shipbuilding contracts if the ships are needed in Canada. 
Can we do that down in the United States?  No we cannot.  It is 
now time for the government to take the stand it must take to 
correct this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the exclusion of new construction ships built in 
Canadian shipyards from the present Revenue Canada leasing 
regulations, and also a provisional refundable tax credit to 
Canadian shipowners or shipbuilders who contract to build a ship 
or contract for conversion with change of mission, mid-life refit 
or major refit in a Canadian shipyard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could put our shipyards to work in Quebec, Ontario, Nova 
Scotia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and right out to B.C., right 
across the country.  I am talking about 25,000 people.  They have 
to get the parts and the equipment and it is all produced right 
here in our own country.  Why are we not doing this?  Why has the 
government not done this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was an Ernst & Young report that was done in 1993 for the 
government on the future of shipbuilding in Canada.  On page 119 
of that report it stated that if the government did nothing to 
help the industry become more competitive, then an estimated 
5,000 jobs would be lost just in the shipyards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now 4,000 jobs have been lost in Saint John, New 
Brunswick.  They came up from Louisiana, U.S.A. and interviewed 
our people.  They said that they were the best shipbuilders they 
had ever interviewed and they offered them jobs down in the U.S. 
Why would we train and put our people to work building the best 
ships in the world and then turn around and see them going to the 
United States or to other parts of the world building ships 
because we have not done anything? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier today I mentioned that I had never seen Canada's first 
incorporated city by royal charter, which is mine and which had 
its 215th anniversary two weeks ago, like this.  Our city was 
booming in 1993.  The young people who went to Bishop's 
University used VIA Rail.  When the last VIA Rail passenger 
service came into my city I went down to meet with the passengers 
and there were tears in their eyes.  They said “Mrs. Wayne, we 
have to do something”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We tried.  I have to say that if we want to put the people to 
work, where the men and women can feed their families, if we want 
to give them dignity, educate them and look after them, we must 
make sure they can go to work each day and have money in their 
pockets to do that.  The only way this can be done, the only way 
jobs will be created and the only way industry will move is to 
provide all modes of transportation.  We need to get the politics 
out of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked earlier about what has been happening to us back home. 
I look at our sugar industry.  Do members know that our sugar 
refinery was upgraded by the previous government?  What did this 
government do with Canada's oldest sugar refinery when it came to 
power?  It went to the United States and worked out a deal for it 
to ship in by truck, by ship and everything, over 100,000 tonnes 
into Canada and we lowered our quota to 8,000. 
This put the truckers out of work, the shippers out of work and 
even the airplanes, everything.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has not been a good vision for the future.  I am really 
concerned about what will happen to us in the maritime provinces. 
The Ernst & Young report definitely stated that there was a need 
for a shipbuilding policy.  Of the 68 shipbuilding nations on the 
planet today, 67 of them have a national shipbuilding policy.  We 
are the only country that does shipbuilding that does not have 
one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of IMF money supporting Asian shipyards is cause for 
concern.  The bottom line is that tax dollars from our own 
shipyard workers are potentially being used to put them out of 
work by unfairly subsidizing the competition through the IMF. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want our people to have their dignity.  I want our people to 
be treated fairly.  I want the House of Commons to have a better 
understanding of the Atlantic region, for there has not and it 
has hurt the people dramatically.  I will continue to fight for 
our people until we get all modes of transportation back where 
they should be. 
<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there is no stronger defender of the province of New 
Brunswick than the member who just spoke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member mentioned the shipyard in our home province of New 
Brunswick, specifically the Saint John shipyard.  About 10 years 
ago the Government of Canada awarded the largest contract ever, I 
believe, to the private sector to build our frigates.  It 
accomplished a couple of things.  Not only did it put our 
shipbuilders to work—and the member commented on the expertise 
and the level of proficiency in those shipyards—but it also 
strengthened our military, something that the present government 
has not done very much about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I want to make and the question I have for the member 
is on a national shipbuilding policy.  The member mentioned in 
her speech that there are now 4,000 workers less in the port city 
of Saint John because of the lack of a shipbuilding policy.  In 
fact, I think we are the only industrialized country in the 
western world without a national shipbuilding policy.  The United 
States has one, although we never want to admit it and neither 
does it, but it does have one in terms of tax incentives and 
whatnot.  It is the same for the European countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the province of New Brunswick went out to secure a new 
ferry for the Grand Manan run in my riding of New Brunswick 
Southwest I believe that the shipyard that was awarded that 
contract was from the Netherlands.  Again, that is another 
country that has a shipbuilding policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation we now have in New Brunswick and the rest of 
Canada is that when provinces, communities or the private sector 
go out to secure a vessel they are often underbid by those other 
countries, those jurisdictions that do have a policy that 
supports their shipbuilders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What reason does the government give her as to why we do not 
have a shipbuilding policy to help those people who need help, 
and in fact helping Canada and the provinces along the way by 
doing that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have risen 28 times in 
the House of Commons with regard to shipbuilding and I have 
received the same reply each time from the Minister of Industry. 
The reply is “We have a national shipbuilding policy”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national shipbuilding policy that we have dates back to the 
early 1980s when all the countries in the OECD entered into an 
agreement.  However, we are the only country adhering to that 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about what is required, there are only three or 
four things that are required in order to make us competitive. We 
must become competitive. 
It is estimated that for every shipyard worker's job there are at 
least two others created in the support industry.  It is not just 
us, it is the industries out there as well.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I had an opportunity to speak to the Canadian Construction 
Association in Ottawa a couple of weeks ago.  At the present time 
the Canadian Construction Association pays out $31 billion in 
wages.  Of the $31 billion, $16 billion in taxes goes back to 
Ottawa so we can create more jobs in other industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must have a national shipbuilding policy.  When we do, we 
will see what will happen to the people in the maritime 
provinces.  It tugs at my heart when I hear people say that they 
are sitting there with their hands out.  No, they are not sitting 
there with their hands out.  We have been exporting grains from 
central and western Canada to other countries for centuries.  We 
want to keep our people.  We want them and their families to 
stay, and we can do that if we get a national shipbuilding 
policy. 
<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I actually wanted to rise to ask a question of the hon. member 
for Saint John.   However, I am sure she is listening carefully 
and will ponder what I will ask and then get back to me later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, the member for Saint John is a very passionate 
person who always defends what she thinks is appropriate, and I 
quite respect that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the recent policy convention that the Progressive 
Conservative Party held, it seems to me that it wanted to spend 
$23 billion a year in debt reduction and another $100 billion in 
tax relief over the next number of years.  This would total in 
excess of $200 billion.  This was all before even a cent was 
allocated for infrastructure in this all important transport 
area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member spoke a minute ago about the early 1980s, which was 
the time of Mr. Mulroney and high deficits.  She knows this 
better than I, but the hon. member's former colleague, Mr. 
Crosby, one of those great Mulroneyites, even questioned the 
wisdom of that.  I thought that would be a good question to ask 
the member for Saint John, but I am sure she will get back to me 
at another time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a great honour to speak to this particular issue.  It is 
very important in terms of what we on the government side are 
doing in this area.  I am pleased to speak on the many 
initiatives that are under way that respond directly to the 
motion that has been raised by the Progressive Conservative 
Party, misguided as that motion may be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transport Canada's top priority is safety.  We all know that and 
we support it because that is a key objective.  Our objective in 
that fashion has always been to ensure high standards for safe 
transportation systems.  Because of these, Canadians can count on 
one of the safest transportation systems in the world.  It is not 
every country that can say that, so I think we should be grateful 
for the kinds of benefits that are in place as a result of these 
initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The safety and the security of Canada's transportation system 
continues to lead the federal government's initiatives.  This 
commitment is reflected in all the activities of Transport 
Canada.  I would argue and the people of Waterloo—Wellington, 
the area that I represent would argue that indeed is a good 
objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department's focus is on developing practical safety 
programs, effective regulations and on ensuring that these 
regulations and standards are followed, in particular, it 
regulates and co-ordinates safety related matters in several 
areas.  I want to take a moment to outline what they are: 
Aeronautics at airports, air and marine navigation, marine 
shipping facilities, commercial shipping, new motor vehicle 
standards, railways, bridges and canals connecting provinces with 
each other or with the United States of America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Responsibility for transportation safety in Canada involves many 
stakeholders, including the federal, provincial, territorial and 
municipal governments as well as industry and non-governmental 
organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transport Canada works closely with all stakeholders to ensure 
high standards in transportation safety, but especially with the 
Transportation Safety Board and the provincial governments to 
maintain nationwide system safety. 
Co-operation with foreign government agencies and organizations 
on several international safety initiatives is also being carried 
out.  That is important in bilateral and multilateral ways.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, the Canadian transportation system is 
considered one of the safest in the world.  Transportation 
occurrence statistics published by the Transportation Safety 
Board for the marine, aviation and rail modes show long term 
downward trends in accidents, accident rates and fatalities. 
Similarly, Canada's road safety record has continued to improve 
steadily over the last decades.  That is important because 
Canadians want that and Canadians expect their systems in place 
to ensure that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1999 accidents in aviation, marine and rail were down 8%, 16% 
and 6% respectively, below the previous five years average. 
Fatalities in aviation were 20% lower, in marine 17% lower, and 
in rail 6% lower.  The aviation sector showed the fewest 
accidents involving Canadian registered aircraft in the last 25 
years.  Likewise road collisions also represented the lowest 
number during this period as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transport Canada has a vision to have the safest transportation 
system in the world, a vision shared by all of us I would hope, 
with long term outcomes of protecting life, health and the 
environment, as well as property and maintaining public 
confidence in the safety and security of our transportation 
system. The department continues to strive for this through 
education, safety awareness, the establishment of effective 
policies and rules, continuous monitoring of the transportation 
system, as well as the enforcement of the laws governing 
transportation safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is recognized that transportation safety is a shared 
responsibility between the federal and the provincial governments 
as well as industry stakeholders.  And let us not forget of 
course the travelling public who are all important in this 
equation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is moving toward a greater emphasis on 
performance based regulations where demonstrating the achievement 
of results is key.  People want that kind of accountability.  Mr. 
Speaker, you want it, I want it, parliamentarians want it, and 
all Canadians want it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Greater emphasis is placed on industry to demonstrate that its 
practices are safe, that safe practices are reinforced, and 
safety information is systematically shared among the partners in 
a meaningful way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Greater use is being made of the full range of compliance tools 
available to promote the use of safe practices and to reduce 
risk.  This does not imply that the department's resolve to 
interfere where necessary is lessened; rather its intention is to 
rely less on traditional policing and prescriptive approaches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On another front I want to point out because it is important 
that the department is pursuing broad strategies to respond to 
its business environment.  For example, it is continuing to build 
a new safety culture in transportation circles by collaborating 
with industry and other interested parties in the development of 
systems and programs to encourage the adoption and reinforcement 
of safe practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alternatives to regulation are encouraged.  Where regulations 
are required, the focus is on regulatory efforts, on the safety 
objective to be achieved, rather than on the process by which it 
is to be achieved.  That is an important point to note because it 
speaks volumes in terms of the department's direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this technological world government organizations need to 
bring together data that is held in a number of disparate ways 
and areas.  Organizations that put safety as a priority need to 
be available to selectively access and share that data with 
partners and stakeholders so that we can serve Canadians more 
effectively and efficiently.  That is important for all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these reasons Transport Canada undertook to establish a 
safety data management framework to promote sharing constant 
access and integrity of safety data.  For the same reasons 
internationally and nationally, Transport Canada is also playing 
a strong role in modernizing information management systems and 
focusing on collecting data and safety information that 
contributes to the measurement of results.  The analysis of the 
resulting policies will also contribute significantly to the 
safety culture.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along with partners, Transport Canada is developing common 
measures of safety performance and broadening systematic and 
constructive consultation feedback.  As I said earlier, safety is 
not a responsibility of Canada and of Transport Canada alone, we 
all share collectively in that responsibility.  In recognizing 
this the department is fostering constructive relationships with 
stakeholders by developing or participating in joint safety 
promotion and safety awareness programs, continuing to 
participate in forums and exchange programs, identifying and 
responding to stakeholder concerns, recognizing and rewarding 
stakeholders' contributions to transportation safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the best ways to establish constructive and beneficial 
relationships with industry, other government identities, 
transport operators, user associations and the public is to work 
with and consult extensively with them on important safety 
programs.  Together we are developing new methods of intervening 
to promote safety and to better serve the public as a result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transport Canada intends to enhance its contribution to Canadian 
transportation safety by looking ahead and ensuring that what we 
do is linked to clear objectives and outcomes for instance by 
adopting a more systematic approach to risk management.  That 
will include engaging the public and other stakeholders in an 
ongoing dialogue about what constitutes an acceptable level of 
risk, improving data collection, data quality, data sharing and 
enhancing analytical tools to measure results, identify hazards, 
identify trends and finally, by assessing the level of risk in 
adapting its safety programs and resources to respond 
appropriately to any emerging safety issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the right information and analysis the department can do a 
better job of identifying safety trends, tracking safety 
deficiencies and targeting its resources to where they can be 
most effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the regulatory side I want to take a few moments to talk 
about tools, practices and techniques that are being improved by 
identifying alternative policy instruments and compliance tools 
to promote and reinforce safe practices ensuring that transport 
policies, rules and standards are accessible and written in plain 
language and by increasing the use of explanatory material, 
guides, training and support of departmental policies, 
regulations and standards.  This is done by clearly defining 
measurable objectives and evaluating policies, regulations and 
standards against them and by linking the use of policy 
instruments with safety objectives, those very objectives I spoke 
about at the outset. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department is also involved in intervening on the 
international scene by contributing to the development of 
international standards and other initiatives that can lead to 
cost savings for the department and for all Canadians.  We should 
be proud of that in terms of celebrating the good work and vision 
that Transport Canada has in this very important area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department is also participating in national and 
international transportation safety forums and by using all 
available opportunities to develop, improve and promote Canadian 
safety technology and practices.  These are complementary aspects 
of our safe transportation system but they represent important 
assets for Transport Canada to maintain our high safety 
standards.  What a great goal that is not only for 
parliamentarians but for all Canadians wherever they live in this 
great country of ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By doing this Transport Canada is also opening doors to 
international markets for safety, environmental practices and 
technologies for Canadian industries.  What an enormous benefit 
that is to our economic cycle and our businesses as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department at the same occasion takes advantage of the 
international recognition its safety and security professionals 
have earned to promote best practices and expertise.  Transport 
Canada is working closely with stakeholders to market Canadian 
safety transportation and practices internationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have taken some time to present the overall strategies in 
place to maximize impact on transportation safety.  Transport 
Canada has completed or has under way several initiatives 
consistent with the strategic directives I have just provided.

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To name a few, the department has revised the Railway Safety Act 
and is in the process of modernizing the Canada Shipping Act. 
Clear language regulations have been developed in dangerous goods 
and regulations on safety for railway management systems and they 
have been recently published in the Canada <I>Gazette</I> part I. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There presently exists well structured consultation mechanisms 
such as the Canadian Aviation Regulatory Advisory Council, the 
Canadian Marine Advisory Committee and the Railway Safety 
Consultative Committee.  These are important to note because they 
underscore the commitment of the government in this all important 
area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several awareness and educational initiatives are under way such 
as Direction 2006 in rail and Vision 2001 in road with strong 
participation from industry and the provinces as well. The 
department has also developed modal strategic plans such as 
Flight 2005 in civil aviation and The Way Ahead in marine. These 
are visionary moves that underscore the commitment of the 
government in this all important area of transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department and my speech underscore the established specific 
strategic objectives that determine Transport Canada's long term 
vision as well as strategic direction with respect to the safety 
and the security of the transportation system in Canada.  It sets 
out a vision for proactive measures to maintain our world class 
safety system, something we should applaud and celebrate knowing 
that around the world Canada is known as having one of the 
finest, if not the finest and safest system that exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all the safety initiatives under way, Canadians can have 
the assurance that we are constantly striving to improve an 
already very good system and an already very good transportation 
safety record that we have acquired over the years.  We should be 
proud of that as I know most Canadians are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to the matter raised by the opposition, I can simply 
state without a doubt that the federal government continues to 
exercise the leadership Canadians expect in this all important 
area.  I can reinforce and say that not only do the folks in 
Waterloo—Wellington, my constituents, but most Canadians 
wherever they live in this great and wonderful country of ours 
understand that and are proud of the kind of safety initiatives 
we have put into place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are proud of what we have done over time.  They have 
faith and assurance in the government's ability to carry forward 
into the future, not only with vision and insight, but with the 
kind of notions in place that underscore our commitment to doing 
the right thing when it comes to transportation in Canada.  We 
know it is what Canadians want, need, expect and deserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians know that we on the government side will continue to 
provide good government essential to Canadians from coast to 
coast. I can assure the House that the government will continue 
to do that in a manner consistent with the values of Canadians. 
Why do we do that?  We do it because it is the right thing to do 
and it is the right thing Canadians want us to do in this very 
important area.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I come from 
Nova Scotia, specifically the riding of West Nova. A couple of 
issues stand out clearly when we talk about transportation, but 
specifically Highway 101 which has seen some 50 fatalities since 
1993.  It is a fairly dangerous stretch of road and a couple of 
concerns come to mind. First, further twinning is required from 
Halifax toward Yarmouth as much as possible.  Second, there is a 
stretch of highway between Digby and Weymouth in my riding that 
is not completed and it basically is still the number one 
highway.  This creates a lot of difficulty when it comes to 
safety, tourism and other issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A government that collects over $4 billion in fuel tax every 
year and returns just a mere 4% of that to the provinces concerns 
me greatly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other issue is that in the estimates for Nova Scotia in 
1999-2000, under a Liberal government I might add, a $1.8 million 
fund was set out for highways. 
In 2000-01 under a PC government the amount to be transferred is 
zero.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for my colleague across the way.  What will 
the federal government, along with the provinces, do to ensure 
that we have safe highways and that there is a proper amount of 
funding from the federal government for highways? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue I forgot to mention in my comments is that it is 
not just the twinning or the completion of the Highway 101.  It 
is also the condition of those roads.  They have been left to 
deteriorate to the point where it is almost dangerous to drive on 
some highways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there are places across 
Canada where we continue to do the kind of work necessary to 
ensure that roads are consistent with what local residents and 
constituents want.  As a government we will continue to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is right and I thank him for it.  We will work very 
hard with our provincial and territorial counterparts, as we have 
done in the past, to ensure that the roads will be fixed in a 
manner consistent with local needs.  It is important that we work 
with our provincial partners as well as with our territorial ones 
to do precisely that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member spoke about fuel taxes and moving money around for 
highways.  I find those kinds of comments quite disturbing in the 
sense that there disingenuous, if I might use that term.  It was 
not so very long ago, during the last election to be precise, 
that Progressive Conservative Party members talked about 
Transport Canada's budget being cut by $35 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They said one thing before and now they are saying something 
again today. They are masters of the flip-flop as usual.  Once 
again they are sucking and blowing when they should come straight 
to the heart of the matter and say the right thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on the government side say the right thing.  We are 
consistent in terms of what is needed.  We are consistent with 
the wishes of our constituents.  We work very hard.  Instead of 
flipping around as the PCs do, the Minister of Transport and his 
provincial and territorial counterparts worked very hard to 
ensure they were consistent in what they do and to ensure that 
the transportation infrastructure is what Canadians want, need 
and quite frankly deserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue to provide that without the disingenuous nature 
of the Progressive Conservatives and in a manner consistent with 
what Canadians want.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it takes a great deal of courage to 
stand and make a speech like the one of my hon. colleague 
opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member to bring forward information on any country in 
Canada or in Europe that returns to its provinces a mere four 
cents on the dollar of the excise tax.  I can say right now that 
no country in the world contributes 4% of what is taxed out of 
motorists and truckers.  I would be ashamed to say that the 
government is marching forward with a vision.  That is stealing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I remind the member opposite 
that there is no country in Canada.  We are a country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the reformed alliance members were called Reformers, those 
extremists opposite, they brought out that party's now infamous 
policy blue book which said that the Reform Party supported 
removing all measures that insulated businesses, industries, 
financial institutions, professions and trade unions from 
domestic and foreign competition.  They would strip away every 
support necessary for transportation and its infrastructure. 
They would support the stripping away of every kind of subsidy 
that exists for this all-important area.  They would strip away 
everything that they could to defend the regions of our great 
country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would they do that?  Why, pray tell, would they do that? The 
reason they would do it is that they are a bunch of flat taxers, 
17% flat taxers.  All they want to do is strip away good 
government.  They want to strip away effective and safe 
government.  They want to strip away the very things that 
Canadians depend on.  These extremists are outrageous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  On 
numerous occasions the Speaker has ruled as to the name to be 
used for the party on this side.  It is the Canadian Alliance. 
This member has frequently today used different terminology.  I 
wonder whether you would call him to account and ask him to be 
respectful of the ruling of the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The Chair was being very attentive to 
what the hon. member for Waterloo—Wellington was saying.  My 
recollection of the words was when hon. members opposite were 
called Reform.  He then quoted from a document that apparently 
had been a Reform document.  I sensed he did it for that reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe that he was referring to hon. members in the 
official opposition currently as Reform members.  He said the 
alliance members when they were Reformers.  I believe those are 
the words he used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member for Elk Island reviews the blues and comes 
back to the Chair with some other error, the Chair will only be 
more than happy to look at the matter and enforce the consistent 
rulings of the Chair on this important point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will conclude by saying 
that the very same policy document of those reformed alliance 
people went on to say that the Reform Party opposes the use of 
infrastructure funds for projects which could be better managed 
by the private sector.  Shame on them.  Imagine saying that then 
and today supporting the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Talk about the masters of flip-flop.  Talk about people saying 
one thing when it is convenient and saying quite another when 
they want to get their point across in another part of the 
country.  They are good at that.  They are good at saying one 
thing in the east and another thing in the west.  They are good 
at saying something in the north and quite the opposite in the 
south.  That is who those people are.  It is unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was listening to the member for South Surrey—White 
Rock—Langley.  What did she say?   She went so far as to say 
that when it comes to transportation their party wants a central 
plan for a national continental strategy.  Imagine.  Imagine them 
saying that.  These people are extremists in the extreme, if that 
is possible.  Imagine what they are saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to think about where they are going.  They are doing the 
kinds of things that would strip away the very foundation of what 
it means to be Canadian.  They would strip away the very values 
of our great country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side of the House, the government, will not allow 
that nonsense to be brought forward by way of their agenda.  We 
will stand firm, knowing that we have the safest and most secure 
transport system in the world, bar none.  We will continue on 
that track because that is what Canadians want.  They do not want 
the politics of grievance as those people do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  The member has used the word extremists in regard to me 
and other opposition members on this side of the House.  He used 
it in such a derogatory sense that my privileges and my 
reputation in the House of Commons have been denigrated by the 
member.  As an example of extremism, I think he is providing a 
good example of Liberal extremism, to the point of being 
ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I think the hon. member has made a 
good point in debate perhaps but not on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>   Mr. Speaker, the hon. member opposite 
gives me the opportunity to point out once again the very thin 
skin of those opposition members.  They are very thin skinned. It 
is interesting in debate to watch them try, and try is the 
operative word, to dish it out.  When it comes to taking it they 
cannot seem to take it very well.  They cannot have it both ways.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is that we on the government side continue to provide 
safety and security for our transportation system.  We will 
provide the resources necessary to have infrastructure in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask all members to vote accordingly when it comes to this 
motion.  It really is out of place and not in order in that 
sense.  We will continue to work very effectively on behalf of 
all Canadians, unlike those people opposite who seem to want to 
rip Canada apart province by province. 
<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased on behalf of the 
Canadian Alliance to bring this debate back to the intent of 
parliament to have honest interaction between the parties 
debating the issue as opposed to the type of extremism being 
experienced by the House due to the Liberal speakers on this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party has brought forward its 
supply day motion with regard to transportation issues in Canada. 
I have to agree this is an important issue that we should be 
debating.  The reason for that is that the federal government and 
the provincial governments across the country have not been able 
to manage their moneys to the point of being able to keep our 
basic infrastructure, primarily roads and rail, in a condition 
that our economy can continue to flourish.  As a result we find 
that we are approaching a crisis situation with regard to roads 
across the country, not only in western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I go through my speech I think we will find that what is 
giving rise to this crisis is not the lack of money.  As a result 
of the taxation of the Liberal government this place is awash in 
money.  It is the problem of how the Liberal government is 
spending the tax dollars it is taking from Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transportation is the fabric and the economic lifeblood of the 
country.  It is of such importance that it should not be let to 
slide as the government has done through its heavy taxation and 
not returning taxation dollars to the provinces with regard to 
road programs, which has caused us to lose a certain level of 
competitiveness.  One good example of that lack of 
competitiveness is in our international grain trade where some of 
our major customers like Japan and the Asia-Pacific rim countries 
have found that we cannot deliver our grain to port on a basis 
that would give them confidence that we are suppliers that can be 
totally trusted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I bring that forward is that it has to do with rail 
transportation.  The government on this very day has the 
opportunity to fix our rail transportation by bringing in a 
commercial competitive contract based system of rail 
transportation.  However, what we find is a continuation of the 
very highly regulated, top down, government driven transportation 
system which all parties have found to be inefficient, 
unaccountable and incapable of supplying our customers with the 
amount of grain they need at the time they need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government bears a lot of the fault for our transportation 
system being in the state it is and our now having to debate it 
in the House to try to give the government suggestions as to what 
can be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Besides exports, interprovincial transportation is of vital 
importance.  We consume and sell many product between provinces. 
We only have to drive from Manitoba to northwest Ontario to see a 
road that is virtually incapable of carrying with any efficiency 
the amount of goods that move between Manitoba and Ontario and 
east to west.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious that this national highway, which the federal 
government has responsibility for, has not been upgraded over the 
course of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Selkirk—Interlake we have export companies such 
as Gerdau Steel.  Many of our agriculture products have to be 
exported both by rail and by road to different countries.  We 
also export fresh pork products by air to places such as Russia 
and Asia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If road, rail and air transportation are not kept in good shape 
our economy will continue to suffer because of a lack of 
direction in spending by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People ask: “The government is spending.  The Canadian Alliance 
is advocating more spending on roads.  Where would the money come 
from?” That is one of my favourite questions.  With the amount 
of money that comes into the federal government, there is plenty 
enough for health care, roads, rail transportation and whatever 
else is needed with respect to transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason there are not sufficient moneys, aside from the 
patronage appointments and waste and abuse that we see in HRDC, 
is the spending.  I would like to give some examples.  I will not 
belabour the point because these things are disgusting for people 
to hear.  In Manitoba $15,000 was spent to hang dead rabbits in 
trees as an art exhibit.  Our local humane society did not even 
see fit to condemn this artist or the fact that federal money was 
being used for the exhibit.  That can only be classified as 
waste.  In Paris, foreign affairs was setting up what could only 
be called a call girl situation in the embassy. People from 
France could go into the embassy and engage a woman dressed as a 
prostitute.  Once again, federal tax money was spent.  I could go 
on and on with these disgusting examples of government waste, of 
money that could have gone into our transportation system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The importance of rail transportation to the economy is 
important for those of us who are here today.  However, as 
members of the Parliament of Canada, we are supposed to be doing 
everything with reasonable prudence and forethought for the 
benefit of our children, our grandchildren and their children. 
That is not happening because of the high taxation policy of the 
government, which is being abused.  Instead of the money being 
left in municipal and provincial coffers to be used for roads, it 
is taken away and used for a lot of useless things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give a couple of facts.  Federal gas tax 
increased over 500% between 1985 and 1995, from approximately 1.5 
cents to 10 cents per litre.  The argument for fuel taxes was 
that the money would be used to keep our infrastructure and roads 
up to snuff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ottawa spends only 5% of its $5 billion in gas tax revenues on 
highway renewal.  I assume that I can use the word deceptive. 
The people of Canada have been deceived into believing that if 
they pay their fuel taxes they will be able to drive on roads 
that are safe and an efficient mode of transportation. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1350"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These billions of dollars flowing to Ottawa, sent by Canadians 
to be used for our roads, are not being used for our roads, but 
are going into general revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ottawa increased the federal gas tax from 8.5 cents to 10 cents 
per litre in 1995 as a deficit reduction measure.  The deficit is 
gone, but the tax remains, to my knowledge.  Once again I ask, is 
this deception?  Is it mismanagement?  What is the reason for 
this?  Maybe we will hear it from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is also taxing taxes.  That is a most vile 
situation.  The GST is charged on the full pump price, gas taxes 
included.  It is a tax on a tax.  It looks to me like the 
government has no intention of spending the fuel tax on roads and 
in fact is just using it as a tax grab. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gas prices in Canada are a big issue in all parts of the 
country.  According to facts which were compiled, without 
provincial and federal taxes our gasoline prices would actually 
be cheaper in Canada than in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem we are facing has a solution.  It is a problem that 
has been made primarily by the actions of the federal government, 
which has been in power for two terms, so it cannot say “We 
would fix it if we had time”.  It has had since 1993 to come up 
with a national road program, to increase funding, to cut waste 
and to use that money for road and rail transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In essence, all the money for roads and other modes of 
transportation comes from the public purse.  Some people would 
argue that if we put a toll on a road, that is not a tax. 
However, I would point out that tolls on roads are a tax the same 
as any other user fee.  Roads are for the use of everyone and 
when we impose a toll we are in essence imposing a tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I once wrote a letter to the revenue minister asking him why 
fuel taxes could not be dedicated to road construction and 
repair.  He wrote back, clearly stating that the government does 
not believe in dedicated taxes; that is, identifying a clear 
problem or issue for spending every year.  There should be road 
spending every year throughout the life of this country.  The 
government refuses to acknowledge that it has a responsibility 
for the infrastructure of the country, including transportation 
and, in particular, roads.  Until we get the government to admit 
there is an ongoing need for funding for roads we will be up 
against the same crisis year after year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been mentioned that Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta 
will receive some $175 million as offset compensation for the 
lack of rail transportation which is due to the abandonment of 
branch lines by the railways.  Farmers are incurring greater 
costs to haul their grain to the main terminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, that money is inadequate.  The $175 million will be 
spread over five years and over three provinces. 
I do not know how much good that will do in repairing some of the 
roads.  It certainly will not build new ones.

athletic accomplishments of Brad Bowden, a high school champion 
in my riding who has the golden touch in sports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even at his young age, Brad is no longer a stranger to winning 
gold medals.  In March, he and his Team Canada teammates struck 
gold when they won the Ice Sledge Hockey World Championship in 
Salt Lake City, Utah.  Brad managed this incredible 
accomplishment while continuing his studies as a student at 
Westside Secondary School in Orangeville. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently, Brad helped to lead another team to gold winning 
victory. He was named the most valuable player when his Variety 
Village team won the Canadian Wheelchair Basketball Association's 
junior championship in Toronto.  They also won gold in 1995 and 
1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The year 2000 is shining brightly on Brad Bowden.  I join with 
other proud members of our community in congratulating him on his 
great accomplishments in sports.

<P><A NAME="LINK75"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, one of the cruel anomalies of our 
criminal justice system must surely be the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act, which allows for statutory release and 
automatically paroles all inmates after serving two-thirds of 
their sentences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A justice subcommittee studying this mockery of the sentencing 
system came close to recommending an end to the statutory 
release.  That was before the Liberal MPs on the committee 
changed their minds after a short visit to the whip's office 
decided to give credence to the corrections commissioner that 
statutory parole was a great thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a litany of abuse of the statutory release, but none as 
glaring as Kelly James Bedard.  In 1994 he was arrested for 
murder, having slashed the throat of his victim.  His rampage 
came three months after being released from prison, having served 
the necessary two-thirds of his sentence for aggravated assault. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today Kelly is on the street despite a parole board assessment 
that Kelly was at high risk for violent offences.  I hope the 
Liberals are happy with themselves.

For this reason, I organized the first International Day this 
past February, and I am doing it again now for the ridings in 
central Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This day offers an opportunity to discuss international trade, 
the contracting process, CIDA and Team Canada.  It is a day for 
acquiring information on matters of an international nature, 
which may prove useful for municipal politicians and those 
responsible for economic development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate my fellow MPs, particularly the hon. member for

encouraging efficiency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Mundell just received an honorary degree from Queen's 
University at its spring 2000 convocation.  His endorsement of 
Estonian and Hong Kong tax systems is fitting.  Single rate 
income taxes result in less complexity and greater productivity. 
That is why Alberta is adopting a 10.5% single rate tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance has adopted a 17% across the board federal 
income tax rate.  Further, personal exemptions of $10,000 and 
ending tax discrimination against married people would remove 
thousands from the tax rolls altogether. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Congratulations to Robert Mundell and single tax rate advocates 
everywhere.  May even Liberals one day learn to embrace less

rate tax.  Praise Robert Mundell, a son of freedom and single 
rate taxes.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am particularly proud of the Oceanic team members, not just

increases in the quota and scientists acknowledge that there have 
been wild fluctuations in the snow crab population over the past

opposition simply to score some pre-election points.  He is 
jeopardizing the long term sustainability of the crab fishery in 
order to make a good news announcement from a government with 
nothing but bad news announcements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At what cost?  When fishers applaud conservation efforts and 
smaller crab quotas, why is the minister providing a 240%

massive files violated individual privacy rights, or was she 
afraid of how people would react when they found out how closely 
their government watches them?

lurched into damage control with the all too familiar refrain, 
“Don't worry, trust me”.  Canadians do not trust her.  They

</I></B></P><P align=left>The summit included a presentation by Dr. Schindler from the 
University of Alberta who said that considering the importance of 
water to all life, it is strange that freshwater has been 
Canada's most mistreated and ignored natural resource.  Canadian 
citizens are paying the price for governments not protecting our 
water supply and the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The quality of drinking water is a major issue in Ontario.   For 
the north the concentrations of PCBs and other pollutants in 
fish, caribou and birds are high enough to require human 
consumption of traditional aboriginal food to be restricted.  The 
government is fully aware that in the north we have PCB levels 
five times higher than anywhere else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time that the Liberal government changed its cavalier 
attitude toward the environment and enforced environmental laws 
and regulations.  We demand action and remedies on the cumulative 
effects of organic pollutants.  The government is responsible for 
the price that northerners are paying due to these pollutants.

written to the human resources department asking for copies of 
their files from the big brother database.  According to the 
Privacy Act, the minister has 30 days to respond to that and 
comply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday the minister suggested that Canadians who have asked 
for that information will have to write again and tell her that 
they really, really want copies of their file. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the minister not complying with the Privacy Act? 
<P><A NAME="LINK113"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member should quit chasing 
headlines and get her facts straight.  No one has to reapply.  If 
they have asked us for the information, they will receive it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She is right that it will take us some time because we have 
dismantled the files.  We have been working with the privacy 
commissioner's office so that we will not have a significant 
delay.  No one who wants the information will have to reapply. 
<P><A NAME="LINK114"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not think we are chasing 
headlines, we are chasing the truth.  It would be just slick if 
we could find it as soon as possible in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday the minister claimed in the House and in her press 
release that she had dismantled the big brother database.  She 
also claimed that she would respond to the thousands of requests 
from Canadians to see their personal files.  On the one hand she 
said that she had destroyed that database, and on the other hand 
she said that she will provide copies of it to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is pretty simple:  Does she have access to that information 
or does she not? 
<P><A NAME="LINK115"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, maybe the hon. member should review 
<I>Hansard</I> from yesterday where I said that indeed the system 
had been dismantled and that we would ensure that those Canadians 
who want their information will get it.  We will help them 
facilitate getting that information from agencies like the Canada 
Customs and Revenue Agency which now has its information that was 
in our consolidated files back in its hands. 
<P><A NAME="LINK116"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B> Mr. Speaker, now you see it, now you don't.  The 
minister's track record proves that she simply cannot be trusted 
and yet she does have access to all Canadians' most private 
information.  Her own press release said that access to the big 
brother database would still be granted on a case by case basis. 
Not only is the information still there somewhere buried in a 
computer, I bet she can find it, but it also will still be used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is this: Is it not true that the only thing this 
minister has really dismantled is her own credibility?

hearts of Canadians.  She should pay attention to what happened 
yesterday, look at the response of the privacy commissioner and 
actually accept that we are in the process of dismantling the

She can go to him and ensure that the job is done.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Canadian

said that she acted quickly to deal with concerns about the big 
brother database. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It turns out that what really happened was that the privacy 
commissioner spent months trying to get the government to 
dismantle the database and only when he hit roadblocks with the 
minister did he go public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the minister give the impression that she acted quickly 
when in fact her hand had to be forced? 
<P><A NAME="LINK119"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

that from the outset the department recognized that major changes 
had to be made and I did not have to persuade them at all”. 
<P><A NAME="LINK120"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Canadian

<I>Hansard</I> where the minister said “I announced the 
dismantling of the longitudinal labour force file.  It comes less 
than two weeks after the privacy commissioner tabled his last 
advice on this file”.  This gives the clear impression that the 
minister acted very quickly.  That in fact is not the case, is 
it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The privacy commissioner has been urging this minister for 
months to get rid of this big brother database file and she 
refused.  Only after the public found out about it did she act. 
Why did it have to take public disclosure to force her hand? 
<P><A NAME="LINK121"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have been consistent on my views on 
this issues right from the start.  I continue to believe that 
good information is required to build good public policy.  I 
continue to believe that the privacy of Canadians is paramount. 
I have said in the House that I will work with the privacy 
commissioner to ensure that we continue to have the balance, and 
that is exactly we have done.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Action was taken because the matter became public.  The Prime

necessary and useful.  Those were his words. This same government 
is today guaranteeing that the file will not be rebuilt in some 
other way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we to understand that our only guarantee of protection of

completely compliant with the Privacy Act.  Indeed, as the 
privacy commissioner indicated, there were no breaches of 
information.  What is important to look forward to is the future. 
With the actions we took yesterday, in full compliance, 
recognition and support of the privacy commissioner, we have a 
system that will take us in secure privacy into the 21st century.

Mr. Speaker, I am happy to report to the hon. member and to the

increased budget contributions substantially to the Department of

Davenport and members of the NDP were calling for a national safe 
drinking water act.  Pearse himself said that if nothing was 
done, that the federal government should show leadership in this. 
It is clear that whatever policy we have in place at all levels

some accommodations”.

Mr. Speaker, it would be better to pursue this line of

participate in that debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I made is that the marketplace will determine under

means of serving the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I raised was that while a lot of people had talked 
about how far it is to drive to and from the various airports in

who have to drive to Pearson airport.  These are accommodations 
that people make on a daily basis.  I assume they make them in

Mr. Speaker, once more I thank the hon. member for her pertinent 
question.  We have had an increase in some greenhouse gas 
emissions since the period she suggested, 1990, and particularly, 
I might add, since the tremendous burst of economic activity that 
took place since 1993 when this government took office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result however is that we do have a bigger problem to deal 
with greenhouse gases than we would have had if the party over

the environment would have disappeared.

</I></B></P><P align=left>They have been funded by federal-provincial agreements for such 
things as the infrastructure program, being one-third municipal, 
one-third provincial and one-third federal.  The point is that 
the money in Atlantic Canada came through ACOA.  It was the 
agency that delivered on behalf of the three governments.  That 
is where the confusion exists.  ACOA does not fund golf courses.

Mr. Speaker, once more one of these questions from the NDP, which

</I></B></P><P align=left>I outlined to the House very recently the steps that are being

Mr. Speaker, it was the environment commissioner himself who said

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member should know this is question period

</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the programs we are putting in place, I trust 
the NDP will support us and make sure the provincial governments 
which are controlled by the NDP similarly support us because, as

to proceed which is at the core of our problem.

asked the minister about freezing the rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that he continues to evade that answer, let me try him on 
this one.  Quite often the threat of a strike by workers disrupts 
tourists headed for Newfoundland.  Given the importance of this 
ferry link to the economy of Newfoundland, would the minister 
consider having that service declared an essential service with 
no strikes facing the travelling public and some form of binding 
arbitration for the workers?

not totally fair to the president of the CBC.  What he did say,

go again.  Today the commissioner for the environment released 
another damning report over the government's dismal environment 
record.  He pointed out the government's lack to grasp or 
understand the benefits of aggressive tax incentives to support 
energy efficiency initiatives, not just lip service.  Alberta's 
environment minister, Gary Mar, has recognized the need for this 
particular initiative in his best effort strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the reason the government continues to flounder on climate

<A NAME="LINK205">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the 
amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK206"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, before question period I was talking 
about toll roads as being one method by which some governments 
have seen fit to put spending back into roads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I received a letter from Bruce Law from the Lundar area of 
Manitoba.  His opinion was that tolls on roads are another form 
of taxation.  He was also concerned that the money collected from 
tolls on a specific road or bridge would eventually find its way 
to another fund.  There is an element of distrust on the part of 
many Canadians with regard to the government taking in user fees, 
tolls and those sorts of thing for a specific purpose and then 
using those moneys for a totally unrelated initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I recognize that provincial jurisdiction primarily 
prevails in regard to highways, the federal government does take 
in the larger portion of tax money from Canadians and, as a 
result, has a responsibility not only for the national highway 
system but also to assist the provinces with their major roads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason we have a crisis in transportation, particular on 
roads, is because the government has given no long term plan in 
conjunction with the provinces for infrastructure.  It has 
indicated no long term funding.  It is more a case of letting it 
get bad, letting it become a crisis and then it will do 
something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the railways, in the past, when the Government of 
Canada owned the Canadian National Railway it was at the height 
of being a regulated system.   However, we saw that the Canadian 
National Railway, in its contracts with employees and different 
things, was a very inefficient railway.  It signed contracts out 
of convenience.  It made it hard for the normal competitive 
commercial industry.  It is only now, with Canadian National 
being a private company, that we see it moving toward a more 
efficient system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see some of the same problems that Canadian National Railway 
had showing up in the case of VIA Rail.  It is my personal 
opinion that the user fees being charged by VIA Rail are probably 
not sufficient and should be a little higher.  As long as VIA 
Rail is totally protected from the marketplace, I think it will 
continue to have to be highly subsidized by the federal 
government.  There needs to be some marketplace discipline 
associated with the operations of VIA Rail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My final comment on transportation and this supply day motion is 
with regard to the airline industry. 
This is a current issue that is underdeveloped and is continuing 
to evolve.  However, the one thing I do know is that we need 
airline competition in this country, real competition that puts 
the consumer and the air traveller first, not second.

<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have a question for the member with regards to the 
transportation policy or the lack of a transportation policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the member would agree that there is a huge difference 
between western and eastern Canada.  I contend that one of the 
reasons that eastern Canada does not have the economic clout that 
it should have and deserves to have is because of a lack of a 
cohesive transportation policy that allows us to transport goods 
in and out of Atlantic Canada.  This goes back to the free trade 
debate in 1988. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you well know, Mr. Speaker, and I know the member knows, the 
party opposite railed against the free trade debate.  After 
forming the government, it embraced it as if it had invented it. 
If there has been any shortcoming in that free trade agreement 
with the Americans, it is the fact that we never actually 
developed transportation links in Atlantic Canada heading north 
and south which would have allowed us to move our goods out of 
the area.  This has hampered development in Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To this day I cannot understand why the government has not come 
up with a policy that recognizes that difficulty.  From 
confederation up until 1988, our trade links were east and west 
which benefited, for the most part, central Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member have any understanding as to why the national 
government, the Liberal government of the day, has not addressed 
the problem of modern transportation to our neighbours to the 
south? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I agree with those 
comments in general.  The Liberals do have a history of saying 
one thing, doing another and not living up to promises.  The 
member pointed out many times the example of the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The maritimes and western Canada do have a lot of similarities 
as well as some differences.  The similarities are that they are 
small in population and that they have limited influence in the 
Parliament of Canada at times when Ontario and Quebec seem to 
hold sway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The west has traditionally had north-south trade routes but they 
were artificially changed by government policies.  The Crow rate 
was one example of artificial regulation by the federal 
government that did not let normal commercial patterns develop. I 
think the maritimes suffered from that same situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the government should now do is make sure that trade 
between the maritimes and the United States is not hampered and 
that there is harmonization in any area where there is a need, 
for instance on trucking regulations and criteria like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has a valid comment in that the federal government 
should make sure there is road infrastructure.  It should also 
get out of the way of the railways so that they can put in the 
type of rail service that is needed to deliver goods both north 
and south from the maritimes to the U.S. 
<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, our point with this motion today is not actually on 
specific issues but on the concept, approach and inconsistency of 
the transport policies and unco-ordinated approaches.  I am sure 
the hon. member does not have the 1999-2000 estimates at his 
fingertips, but I will read a couple of numbers for him and ask 
him to comment on them. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1515"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT63"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT63"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1515

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the estimates for transport the government has allowed for 
funds to pay provinces under the elimination of the Atlantic 
regional freight subsidy program.  The province of New Brunswick 
for instance gets $500,000 under the elimination of the Atlantic 
regional freight subsidy program whereas the province of Quebec 
gets $15,747,000. Perhaps the hon. member could comment on why 
the province of Quebec gets $15.7 million and the province of New 
Brunswick only gets a half a million dollars under the 
elimination of the Atlantic regional freight program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, certainly I do not know 
the details of those agreements.  No doubt there is some 
justification for Quebec receiving more.  It is a much larger 
province with its economy being that much larger.  I am sure it 
was prorated on an equitable basis. If it was not, I would ask 
that the member submit the figures which show that it was done on 
an inequitable basis or in preference of one province over the 
other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bigger issue in rail transportation is that the federal 
government continues to want to highly regulate and micromanage 
every aspect of the rail economy when it comes to grain 
transportation in the west.  I am not sure what the major use of 
rail transportation is in the east.  Certainly logging is a major 
issue there and mining is coming along with the nickel mines. 
Railways are important in the east too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a matter of the government making sure that the 
marketplace is free to work in the manner in which it was meant 
to.  It should not be artificially designed through freight rate 
subsidies to help one region over the other.  That probably did 
not occur with Quebec and New Brunswick. 
<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I was particularly interested in the comment made by the member 
of the Conservative Party who said that his party put the motion 
not to deal with specifics but rather to deal with the big 
picture. I am not surprised.  I do not think the Conservatives 
would want to deal with specifics when we consider that at their 
recent policy conference they approved $23 billion a year to be 
spent in debt reduction and over $100 billion over five years for 
tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just about everybody who knows anything about what is going on 
around here knows that the total surplus that has been announced 
as available is about $95 billion.  Both private sector and 
government figures have confirmed that. I would not want to get 
into specifics too much about a transportation policy if my 
party's policy called for spending in the area of tax relief and 
debt reduction $123 billion out of a surplus of $95 billion. That 
would not leave a lot for specifics or spending on 
transportation.  That was just a side point with regard to the 
member's comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When talking about national transportation in this country, it 
is most helpful if there has been an opportunity to travel in 
Canada and see exactly what our transportation networks are 
about. I recently had the distinct privilege of spending four 
days with my wife travelling through Nova Scotia up into Cape 
Breton and around the Cabot Trail.  I would also point out that 
it is a province which is represented by many Progressive 
Conservatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had the pleasure of landing in Halifax, renting a vehicle and 
travelling to Digby.  Members will know that Digby scallops are 
the finest in the world.  We enjoyed the wonderful friendship of 
the people, the seafood, the ambience.  Interestingly, we enjoyed 
some incredible highways.  Having travelled in every province in 
this country, the transportation network in Nova Scotia is second 
to none.  It is quite remarkable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We drove almost 2,000 kilometres exactly.  When we got the 
rental car back to the airport, we had done 2,000 kilometres 
around Nova Scotia and Cape Breton. 
I do not intend to give a travelogue, but I was so impressed with 
the quality of the roads, the lack of congestion, the monitoring, 
the safety and everything that I saw. Of course to do that kind 
of mileage we were in the vehicle eight and nine hours a day 
travelling from point to point.

<A HREF="#LINKT63"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We left Digby and went up through Mahone Bay. My wife did a bit 
of shopping.  This was a vacation opportunity for us to see that 
part of Canada.  We went into Lunenburg and from there up to 
Truro where we spent the night.  Once again I was immensely 
impressed with the quality of the roads.  Even the roads that 
were off the beaten path seemed to be very well maintained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From there we travelled across the Canso Causeway into Cape 
Breton and the home of Al MacInnis, a terrific hockey player in 
the NHL.  We went up what I believe is the north coast of Cape 
Breton Island along the Cabot Trail.  It was spectacular scenery 
but I must say quite spectacular roadways. The Cabot Trail of 
course is historic and known throughout the world. There is a 
transportation system that is truly a marvel. We went right into 
Sydney, then on the last day from Sydney down the south coast and 
back through the heartland to the Trans-Canada Highway at 
Antigonish and from Antigonish back into Halifax.  We flew home 
the next day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is that the quality of the roads was superb. The 
traffic management systems were superb.  It is interesting to 
have the party that represents most of the ridings in that 
province, unfortunately for us at the moment, telling us that we 
need some kind of transportation strategy.  I think Nova Scotia 
has obviously done very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On other occasions I have had the privilege of driving from 
Halifax through New Brunswick and across the bridge into Prince 
Edward Island.  The fixed link is truly a wonder of the world. It 
finally brings P.E.I. into the world of modern transportation.  I 
am not 100% sold that the islanders necessarily want to be 
brought into that world.  I think they quite enjoy their 
beautiful island and are happy to be left alone in some 
instances.  But in all seriousness, they understand the 
importance not only for tourism, but also for moving goods to and 
from their island for export.  They are very successful in 
exporting a number of their products, in addition to potatoes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the east coast we see a situation where transportation on the 
roads is second to none.  I did not hear members opposite 
representing the Conservative Party say that.  If I lived in that 
province I would be shouting about the successes that exist in 
that spectacular part of Canada.  I would be telling Canadians to 
come and enjoy Nova Scotia, Halifax, the Cabot Trail, Sydney, 
Rita MacNeil's beautiful tearoom in Big Pond and all of the 
spectacular things that are there, and to admit that there is a 
physical infrastructure in place in that province that is second 
to none. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It brings me to the concept of a national policy.  Let us look 
at Ontario.  People would recognize in my case at least, I come 
from the city of Mississauga where one of the great strengths is 
the transportation available to us on the Great Lakes, on the 
roads, on the rail system and certainly in the air with Pearson 
International Airport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been some concern about toll roads.  The province has 
sold Highway 407 to a private sector consortium which in turn 
will be increasing the tolls to replace the income that was lost 
in the share that goes to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a double sided edge with toll roads.  Was it Nova 
Scotia that eliminated the toll road?  The member opposite would 
know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  New Brunswick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  It was New Brunswick.  I thought it 
was.  Premier Lord closed the toll road. 
The problem is that it is fine to do that, because I am not 
particularly a fan of toll roads, but what was it replaced with? 
It drove up the debt.

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal party has decided to endorse that.  I guess that is 
not a great shock when we consider the fact that the 
Conservatives left a $42 billion deficit when they were in 
government.  They shout over there because they hate for us to 
remind them of that, but it is the truth and it needs to be told. 
It needs to be spoken about because the obvious solution to 
their spending plans is to somehow take us back into the era of 
deficit financing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am really surprised at that.  I would have thought that the 
Progressive Conservative Party had learned its lesson and had 
realized that the running of deficits every year is like running 
an overdraft.  I have said it many times.  When they run an 
overdraft, how do they pay it off?  They pay it off by piling it 
on top of the national debt.  If we equate it to a family, it 
would run an overdraft and pay it off by putting it on top of the 
mortgage on the family home.  We all know we can only do that for 
so long.  At some point in time something has got to give. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have the answers. It is so easy to stand and 
pontificate, as the Conservatives have done in their motion, that 
we need to address the serious transportation problems facing the 
Canadian people.  They do not have any specifics.  They do not 
have any answers.  They do not have any solutions they are 
prepared to put forward.  They simply want to say that someone 
has to fix this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us address the problem.  I have already spoken about what 
would appear not to be a problem.  Look at the shipping which 
comes into Halifax harbour.  Are they going to tell us that there 
is not an infrastructure in the harbour in Halifax to accommodate 
international ocean-going vessels that come there on a regular 
basis?  Are they going to tell us that the airport in Halifax is 
not capable of handling the traffic that comes into that 
province?  Are they going to sit there and tell us that their 
province is full of congested roads with potholes when we know 
that it is not true? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that the crisis they are talking about is a 
fabrication in their own minds.  It is all because of one issue. 
It has to do with the so-called merger, although it is more of a 
takeover, of Canadian Airlines by Air Canada. Let us analyze 
that.  Certainly there have been and will continue to be some 
route justifications in parts of the country, but the government 
realizes the importance of providing good quality service in the 
air.  Look at the size of the country.  We cannot expect that 
people are going to be able to get around without some kind of a 
national airline system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cry is that we need more competition.  I hear the official 
opposition—I can never remember the new name, I am going to have 
to sit down and write it out 100 times or something, but whatever 
it is, the reform alliance conservative progressive whatever— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes:</B>  CCRAP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Oh, I would not say that.  This is a 
family show so I cannot use that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. On 
numerous occasions the Speaker has ruled that the name of this 
party should be used as it is properly registered.  It is 
Canadian Alliance and I would urge the member not to demonstrate 
his total inability to learn two words by actually using the name 
Canadian Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Mississauga West is correctly admonished and I hope illuminated 
and elucidated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have two words for the 
member and they are not Canadian Alliance, but that is another 
story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stand to be corrected but I think that it is the Canadian 
Conservative Reform Alliance Party.  That is five words.  That is 
the registered name or something like that. There are five words 
in the registered name, not two, so if the member thinks that I 
have a problem, maybe that explains why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I want to get back to the issue of a national 
transportation strategy, because the reform party, or the 
Alliance Party, pardon me— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Canadian Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  The Canadian Alliance Party. They have 
a party.  I will call them what they want but the people will 
understand what they are voting for, believe me. 
They will be voting for the same old thing when they get an 
opportunity after the same leader is re-elected.  We know that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know that party's position.  By the way, they are all 
over the map in this regard.  The position of the official 
opposition is that all transportation issues should be run by the 
private sector, that there is no reason for government to be 
involved in providing any kind of infrastructure.  Its own 
members have criticized the infrastructure program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They love to throw around the word boondoggle.  I think they 
learned it as a new phrase this year when they were away at a 
caucus retreat.  We can just see them all gathering around going 
boondoggle, boondoggle.  Anyway, they learned this word and have 
suggested that the infrastructure program is in some way not a 
proper expenditure of federal government money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has never been in my view a more successful uptake of a 
program that I can recall than the infrastructure program 
launched in 1993.  Why?  Because it involved the entire 
community.  It was not the government coming out, cutting a 
ribbon and passing out a cheque: “Me and the Prime Minister 
brung you the cheque”.  It was not done that way.  There was 
involvement with the municipalities across Canada.  All the 
provinces had an opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  How can members opposite say that is 
nonsense?  It is absolutely the truth.  There was involvement 
with the private sector, the municipal sector, the provincial 
government, the territorial governments and the federal 
government.  It was a true partnership.  By and large, with a few 
exceptions, the money was used to build core infrastructure which 
included things like sewers, water pipes and roads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Don't forget the golf courses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  We need roads to get to the golf 
course.  There are some beautiful ones in his part of the world. 
The roads to get there are wonderful.  I was not talking about 
them.  I was talking about the official opposition and its 
position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is a statement by the member for St. Albert, a man for whom 
I have respect as chair of the public accounts committee.  I 
serve as vice-chair.  It is meeting at the moment so I will try 
to hurry.  The member for St. Albert said that the newly 
announced infrastructure program had all the makings to become 
another administrative fiasco. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Was it an administrative fiasco in 1993?  No.  Was it a success? 
Absolutely.  It was a success from sea to sea to sea.  It seems 
that members of the official opposition in particular cannot take 
yes for an answer.  If we looked in every one of their ridings in 
addition to the Conservative ridings that I referred to, I 
suspect we would find infrastructure programs where the entire 
community including the provinces were all involved in delivering 
high quality transportation systems to the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us ask another question.  We all know that opposition 
parties submit closet budgets, phantom budgets, would be budgets 
or hoped for budgets.  How much money did the official opposition 
budget for transportation infrastructure?  Never mind the Tories. 
We know what the Conservatives have done.  They said they would 
spend about $30 billion more than already is available on debt 
reduction and tax reduction to help their rich friends.  They 
would not do anything for transportation except maybe pray to the 
sky and hope that someone would solve the big picture problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How much has the official opposition put in?  Nothing.  How can 
its members stand with any kind of credibility and vote for a 
motion like this one?  What do they call their alternative 
budget?  They call it solution 17. 
In their budget there was not one dollar, not one loonie, toonie, 
or anything for transportation infrastructure.  Their finance 
critic wrote about an alternative budget.  He put the entire 
surplus of $95 billion over the next five years toward a plan of 
tax cuts in debt retirement.  The official opposition is actually 
a bit better than the fifth party.  The reason is it has spent 
all the surplus whereas the fifth party spent the surplus plus 
$30 billion and still did nothing for transportation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I listen to the policies and to the ongoing leadership debate in 
the official opposition.  I listen to candidates like Tom Long 
from Ontario.  He goes around the country and gives one message 
in the west and another one in the east. He insists on telling 
people that he will cut their taxes and get an economic boom 
going in the country even though we are currently sustaining an 
unprecedented economic boom that is second to none. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is amazing to see what is going on all over the country.  All 
we have to do is travel to find out.  Yet we have no commitment 
from any of the candidates who would be prime minister of this 
great land on what they would do for transportation 
infrastructure.  At the same time we have a fifth party who 
stands in this place and whose leader will not run for a seat in 
the House.  I wish he would.  I would love to see him in here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should officially welcome the new member from St. John's to 
his new seat.  I guess they did not tell him that it would be 
that far back in the corner.  I am sure, with his credentials, 
that he will be moving up.  He is a former minister of education 
in the wonderful province of Newfoundland.  I sincerely welcome 
him to the House and into the fray. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hopefully he will bring some good old down home Newfie common 
sense and recognize that when you put forward a statement on a 
national transportation policy you should try to gild the lily a 
bit and include some specifics.  You should not just stand to 
make grandiose statements that everybody else should fix all the 
problems, especially when you come from a part of the country 
where you would be hard pressed to try to convince anyone who has 
been there that transportation is not in any kind of difficulty.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I find it interesting that the hon. member who just 
finished speaking has been in the House for many years and does 
not even yet know the most rudimentary rules of this place.  For 
example, he spoke about our new colleague in the first person. He 
cannot learn anything.  He cannot learn the name of our party. He 
is clueless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two or three questions or comments.  The first one is 
with respect to debt retirement.  We in the Canadian Alliance are 
promoting that we should get the debt reduced because it has a 
huge impact on our budget.  Large amounts of money go to pay 
interest.  To retire our present debt in 25 years would mean 
applying a total of $50 billion in surplus every year for 25 
years to pay the principle and interest on it.  That is assuming 
that interest rates do not rise too much above what they are now. 
I do not think that I will get— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes:</B>  From where will you get the money? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  The question is from where will we get the 
money.  That is a good question.  Meanwhile the Liberals are 
trying to figure out how to spend the bit of surplus they get. 
They should be applying more of it toward the debt.  That is 
exactly my point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other question I have is for the hon. member who gave his 
speech and not the parliamentary secretary who feels obliged to 
heckle me while I am making this wonderful dissertation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes:</B>  You cannot get it right. I am not a 
parliamentary secretary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Are you not a parliamentary secretary? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes:</B>   Not for over a year now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  The hon. member is not a parliamentary

</I></B></P><P align=left>In his speech the member indicated that the infrastructure 
program had nothing to do with politics.  Then I have a very 
simple question.  If it does not involve politics, why is it that 
the cheque was delivered by none other than the Liberal Minister 
of Justice who found it necessary to travel to my riding in a big 
flurry for only one purpose, to deliver the cheque? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, perhaps the minister 
wanted to ensure that the cheque arrived safely.  I am not sure 
why it was done.  In any event, it is nice that the member has 
acknowledged that indeed the cheque did arrive and the project 
was a go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me just make one correction.  I referred to the newest 
member in the House as the member from St. John's.  Some may 
think he is a saint.  People in his riding may think he is a 
saint but that is not his name.  I did not refer to him in the 
first person.  I referred to him as the member from St. John's. 
There are five names in your new silly party, not two.  You 
should perhaps learn them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>   Let us just stop 
there and stick to the debate on transportation at hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I guess you could say he 
started it but I will not get into that.  Who cares?  You are 
right, Mr. Speaker.  We should stick to the debate on 
transportation.  That is the important thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we pay down the debt and the government has 
started to do it.  If we put all our eggs in one basket we wind 
up with nothing but broken eggs.  That is exactly what the 
official opposition is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of eggs, if we take a look at the policy of the fifth 
party, that is exactly what it is doing.  Its members are not 
only putting all the eggs in one basket.  They are adding eggs to 
it that they do not even have yet, that the chicken has not laid 
yet.  How in the world will they fill a basket with non-existent 
eggs? 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>   Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the nice travelogue about 
Nova Scotia.  He is absolutely right.  It is entirely beautiful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  A great transportation system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey:</B>  Yes, there are some good highways in Nova 
Scotia, but there are also some bad ones.  It is interesting that 
he missed those highways.  He missed the 101 where in the last 
few years 50 young people have been killed because there is no 
federal-provincial agreement to upgrade that highway.  For 
decades there was money available from the federal government to 
be applied to main highways, but now there is none.  Not one cent 
is budgeted for this year or next year in Nova Scotia where for 
years there was money to address those dangerous issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to go through some of the points he made.  He mentioned 
that the fixed link is a wonderful piece of transportation 
infrastructure.  He is absolutely right.  That was a Conservative 
project right from beginning to end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He did not mention the toll highways in Nova Scotia and New 
Brunswick. He missed the toll highways in his travelogue.  He 
went all around the toll highways.  He did not go across the toll 
highways.  He probably does not like paying tolls any more than 
we do every day of coming and going.  He avoided that toll 
highways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell the hon. member who did not avoid the toll highways. 
It was the voters in the last elections in Nova Scotia and New 
Brunswick.  We cannot find a Liberal anywhere near either of the 
toll highways in Nova Scotia or New Brunswick.  The hon. member 
may think the Liberal policy is great, but I can tell him the 
voters know that it is not a good policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to talk about the great port of Halifax.  He is 
absolutely right.  There is infrastructure there, but last year 
when Halifax needed help to compete with other ports in the 
United States for post-Panamax containers where was the federal 
government?   It was hiding somewhere.  It was completely 
invisible.  Even though other governments in other countries 
helped, Canada did not help the port of Halifax and it lost that 
competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member mentioned that we were complaining about 
potholes.  We are not complaining about potholes in our 
infrastructure.  We have a highway in Nova Scotia, to go back to 
the highway that he missed, highway 101.  It is between Halifax 
and a large university community.  Some 50 people have been 
killed on that highway since 1993.   A lot of them were young 
people.  We are not talking about potholes.  We are talking about 
serious business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to read something from the <I>Globe and Mail</I> this 
morning and then have him comment on it.  It is a comment about 
France's policy on highway reconstruction.  It reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to <I>Le Figaro</I>, even though France has Europe's 
third highest road mortality rate...bureaucrats won't fix deadly 
stretches of highway if the work costs most than...$750,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>German planners, however, will spend up to $937,000 to save a 
life while the Swiss will go as high as $2 million. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a highway in Nova Scotia on which we have lost 50 lives 
in seven years and not one penny has been assigned to Nova Scotia 
for highway work this year.  I would like to hear the member's 
comment on that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, when we talk about issues 
concerning young people who are killed on what could be 
considered low grade roads, those are not matters which should be 
bantered about in this place.  These are matters on which all 
levels of government have to work together.  They all have a 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, I was close to that highway, but the hon. member is 
right in that we turned off at Highway 104 to go into Halifax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Nova Scotia has a strong responsibility within 
its local community, if it has those kinds of tragic numbers, to 
ensure the road is upgraded.  As I have said, and the hon. member 
has agreed, it has managed to do it throughout the entire 
province with a transportation system that is second to none.  If 
the hon. member can point to the stretch of highway that has had 
the carnage and loss of lives of the nature and the magnitude he 
has just told us about, then I believe he should take it up with 
the minister of transportation in that province and he should ask 
that it be addressed as quickly as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have problems in our own communities.  In Ontario young 
people are killed on our roads.  Tragedies occur and we must do 
something to stop them.  We must continue to fight drunk driving. 
We must continue to educate our young people through better 
licensing programs and better education to try to deal with the 
carnage on our roads.  To turn it into a political issue by 
saying that the federal government has somehow not addressed a 
national roads policy or a national transportation policy and to 
use that kind of statistic is most unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would support the hon. member in his attempts to have that 
road upgraded and fixed so that we can put an end to the terrible 
tragedies. 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is unfortunate that I did not have a chance to 
question the hon. member from Ontario who just spoke.  As usual, 
he is fast and free with the information, but when he is taken to 
task by anyone in the House to either back up what he is saying 
or provide us with some real information, he always falls short 
of the mark.  Is that not the Liberal way?  We have been waiting 
seven years for a national highways program.  The hon. member 
completely ducked the issue because the Liberals do not want to 
take responsibility.  It is as simple as that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year, just as a note, the federal government will take in 
about $4 billion in fuel taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel. 
Transport Canada will have a surplus of approximately $3.9 
billion this year, but again there is no highway policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to compare our position with that of the United States to 
give an example of where we are really falling behind in terms of 
infrastructure; that is, highways and those things that are 
needed, whether it is highways or air transportation, to move our 
goods and people around and to grow the economy as we would like 
to see it grow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the hon. member 
for West Nova.  I am sure you will be interested to hear another 
Nova Scotian go into detail on some of the shortcomings of the 
federal government in that province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting back to our case versus that of the United States, just 
a couple of years ago the President of the United States 
announced the TEA-21, the transportation equity act for the 21st 
century.  I have a summary of the act which I would be pleased to 
table for any member who might want to take a look at it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 9, 1998, President Clinton signed into law the 
transportation equity act for the 21st century.  This guaranteed 
a level of federal funding for surface transportation.  I will 
give an example of how much the Americans are putting in at the 
federal level on highways alone.

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amount guaranteed for surface transportation under that act 
is estimated to be $198 billion.  In essence, the guaranteed 
amount is the floor.  It defines the least amount of the 
authorizations that may be spent.  The least amount that would be 
spent is $198 billion.  Let us assume, and for the most part 
everyone would agree with me, that the American economy is 
basically ten times that of Canada's.  At a minimum, if Canada 
were to reflect what the U.S. is doing, we would be spending $20 
billion on surface transportation in this country.  We simply are 
not doing that.  We are falling behind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Cumberland—Colchester mentioned the number of 
deaths on the infamous Highway 101 in Nova Scotia.  There have 
been over 50 deaths in the last seven years alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only from the public safety point of view should the federal 
government be doing something, but also from the standpoint of 
growing the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a question for one of the Reform members— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  The Canadian Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Excuse me, the Canadian Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question concerned the free trade agreement.  We remember 
the huge debate that we had in 1988 leading into the election. 
In fact, the 1988 election was called the free trade election 
because that was the number one issue that dominated the 
hustings.  We know that the Liberals, in fact every member seated 
opposite, raged against the free trade agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Liberals took office in 1993 the economy was growing 
and it has been grown ever since.  We have not had a downturn 
since they took office.  Eventually it will happen and none of us 
wants to see that.  However, the truth is that the Canadian 
economy has grown largely because of our export capacity, largely 
because of the free trade agreement which they railed against, 
but now they embrace it as if they invented it. We know full well 
they did not invent it.  In fact, they were going to tear it up. 
They were going to nullify it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that growth in the economy comes an obligation on the part 
of government to do something about transportation.  What I am 
leading to is that there are some parts of the country which are 
suffering because of our transportation links.  One of those 
areas is Atlantic Canada.  Unfortunately, the Canadian Alliance, 
formerly the Reform Party, looks at Atlantic Canada and says 
“What is wrong with you people?  Why can you not get your act 
together?  Why do you not have the kind of prosperity that we 
witness in western Canada, particularly Alberta and B.C., or the 
type of economic growth that we see in Ontario?”  That party 
misses the point that we have been trying to make for years in 
this House, particularly the last three or four years, with 
respect to transportation.  If we are going to grow the economy 
we have to have links in and out of our provinces to trade goods, 
which other areas of the country have been able to do 
successfully. Ontario has great transportation links to the 
United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We embraced the free trade agreement, along with the Liberal 
premier of New Brunswick at the time, because we saw it as an 
opportunity to enhance our markets to the south of us, because we 
are always forced to trade east and west from one end of Canada 
to the other.  Since then we have not seen growth in 
infrastructure, particularly highways, to move our goods and 
people in and out as efficiently as might be the case.  That has 
certainly hampered us.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really believe the government has a responsibility to build 
that infrastructure.  What we are saying is, give us a chance to 
compete and we will compete successfully, which we are doing. 
However, we are certainly denied some of the growth that other 
parts of Canada have experienced because of the lack of efficient 
transportation in and out of Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To add insult to injury, when the member for 
Cumberland—Colchester questioned the minister in the House 
today, the minister alluded to the airport in Toronto and the 
travelling time of two to three hours for people travelling to 
that airport.  He inferred that in the province of New Brunswick 
we will at some point be left with one airport.  Which one will 
it be?  Will it be Moncton, Saint John or Fredericton?  The 
government does not understand Atlantic Canada and it is not 
willing to do anything to help Atlantic Canada.  It does not 
understand the big picture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party is saying that the government has to come up with a 
policy.  The Liberals cannot fly by the seat of their pants on 
every issue.  They have done it on health care and 
transportation, and the Canadian public will simply not tolerate 
that type of make it up as they go along, fly by the seat of 
their pants attitude. 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I want to compliment my colleague from the Conservative Party on 
his perspective as an Atlantic Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would concur with him that for far too long those of us in the 
Atlantic region have been disadvantaged because of the historical 
trading links that went east to west.  At the time of 
Confederation, we in the Atlantic region gave up the natural 
north-south trading routes, and we did so in good faith.  As the 
member said, today we find that without the necessary 
infrastructure it is difficult to compete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would question my colleague on the issue of airports because I 
found his comments to be most interesting.  We have a small 
airport in Cape Breton that is absolutely essential if we are to 
develop and grow an economic base.  Yet we are threatened at 
various times with the loss of the flight service station and the 
loss of the people who operate the runway.  We have been told 
that this could be centralized and done from Halifax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member spoke about the loss of two airports in New 
Brunswick, but I think we face the same thing in all of the 
Atlantic region. The government's philosophy might be to have one 
central airport, not in New Brunswick, but maybe in Halifax.  I 
wonder if the member would care to comment on what the loss of 
these vital airports would do to areas like Prince Edward Island, 
New Brunswick and Cape Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his comments.  I do not think we disagree on what we see 
happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if Doug Young is going to be the author of the 
privatization or the elimination scheme when we take a look at 
airports in eastern Canada, as he was with port privatization. 
That is a name that would probably shell shock everyone on the 
Liberal side and send them into hiding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is frightening to think about what might happen.  Who knows? 
We will just have to wait and see.  That could be in the works 
for New Brunswick. 
I know the airport authorities in Fredericton, Saint John and 
Moncton are pretty concerned about it, but there is no evidence 
coming out of Ottawa that we want to grow those areas. They could 
abandon them at a minute's notice.  None of us know.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite disturbing, and it goes back to what I concluded in 
my speech, it is sort of like flying by the seat of our pants, 
with no long range planning.  The premiers across the country are 
screaming for a plan.  If there is a plan, not everyone will get 
everything their way, in particular premiers or even the federal 
Minister of Transport, but there is always a little give and 
take.  Canadians deserve a plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only in that way can we plan for the future.  We want to make 
the right decisions as we go along but we cannot make the right 
decisions if we are flying by the seat of our pants in a sort of 
ad hoc planning committee, if there is one.  We want to see a 
plan.  Until we see it we are going to be pretty concerned about 
what might happen in Sydney or in Saint John, New Brunswick.

unanimous consent to go on and on because I am sure the

about $56 million, which would build about 10 kilometres of 
highway if we are lucky, not to mention any bridges or 
infrastructure.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
indeed a pleasure to have a chance to participate in this debate. 
It is an issue that all Canadians, regardless of where they 
reside in Canada, feel that parliament should have had quite some 
time ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take this particular moment to commend the hon. member 
for Cumberland—Colchester for his work as transport critic in 
actually raising this particular issue and bringing this debate 
to the floor of the House of Commons today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I know that you understand this particular issue as 
I do.  When it comes to long range planning, whether it is on 
transportation issues, environmental issues, climate change, or 
the development of tax policy or trade policy, the government is 
absent in terms of actually having a long term vision, regardless 
of what the actual topic might actually be.  Whether it is the 
need to develop an implementation strategy for the Kyoto climate 
change, whether it is planning in advance to avoid a pollster 
strike which we had just a few years ago, or whether it is the 
same kind of vision that we actually had when we were in 
government with respect to trade—our trade with the United 
States was around $90 billion each and every year and today we 
trade over $260 billion each and every year—it was that kind of 
long term planning for which this government is absent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What all the provinces have been advocating for quite some time 
is to have some federal leadership with respect to a 
transportation policy for this country.  One of the greatest 
challenges that a country as complex and as large as Canada is, 
is the geography from coast to coast to coast. 
The size of this country gives us as a nation an immense amount 
of challenges that we have to recognize.  It was the same kind of 
challenge and vision that actually built the railroad that we 
have from coast to coast.  Now we need to take that vision that 
we had for the 19th century and put it into a 21st century 
context.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The transportation challenges that we have right now in this 
modern, globalized world is that we need to be able to move our 
goods and our people from point to point in rapid fashion in 
order to stay competitive, to be able to function as a modern 
country and to maintain our place in the global economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know now that the stresses of our cities, which have changed 
just over the last two or three decades in the population growth, 
whether it be in Vancouver, Halifax or Toronto, is that from an 
urban planning and an urban transportation perspective the 
federal government has a role to help maintain that public 
transport infrastructure so it does not wear down our roads and 
wear down our other infrastructure so that we spend so much money 
in maintenance.  More importantly, we need to encourage and have 
modern up to date transportation policy so that people can 
commute to and fro from our cities which would actually put less 
stress on our infrastructure and less environmental pollution 
with respect to smog or that of climate change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government went to Kyoto in 1997 to establish and agree to a 
target and a timeline without any consultation with the 
provinces, the municipalities or Canadians in terms of accepting 
a target to reduce greenhouse gases by 6% below 1990 levels by 
the year 2008 to 2012 with no plan on how to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things the government should be doing, and with what 
I call no regrets, things that we should be doing for many 
reasons, whether it be human health, smog or just saving money on 
urban infrastructure, is to develop a sound urban transportation 
policy.  The federal government has a role to work with the 
provinces and municipalities in that particular fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to comment on some callous remarks that were made by 
the Minister of Transport earlier today to the member for 
Cumberland—Colchester and to the member for Saint John.   When 
it comes to an airport perspective in the province of New 
Brunswick, he said that he would let market forces decide what 
happens in terms of the principal airports between Saint John, 
Moncton and Fredericton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can let market forces actually make that decision to some 
degree or we can do what the Progressive Conservative Party wants 
to do and our transport critic wants, which is for the federal 
government to demonstrate leadership for the maintenance of those 
three airports or to actually develop a vision in terms of what 
air transport policy should be in the province of New Brunswick, 
but not from a top down perspective by waiting to see what 
happens or letting the chips fall where they may. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should be working in conjunction with the 
province of New Brunswick, with Premier Bernard Lord and with the 
municipalities that are serviced by those three cities to 
determine what the best thing would be to do, as opposed to just 
ignoring the remarks by the member for Cumberland—Colchester. At 
a minimum, the government should be stating that all three 
airports will be maintained in their present fashion unless the 
federal government provides some vision that the province, the 
municipalities and all citizens in southern New Brunswick could 
actually concur with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to upgrade our transportation system because it is 
deteriorating.  We do have challenges today that we did not have 
a few years ago.  The member for Cumberland—Colchester showed me 
statistics from 1993 and the number of accidents involving 
dangerous goods was approximately 250.  Today, on average, each 
and every year there are almost 450 accidents involving dangerous 
goods.  I maintain that because of our growing economy, our 
growing population and the growing stresses in our transportation 
infrastructure that these kinds of things are bound to happen 
unless we actually make the investment in our rail systems, our 
trucking system and our roads, including the Trans-Canada 
Highway. 
We are bound to have these kinds of accidents time and time again 
unless we actually modernize our infrastructure to maintain the 
record growth that we have had.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces have stated that the government's policy with 
respect to transport has been inconsistent, unco-ordinated and 
perhaps, above all, reactionary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look back to the airline merger, everybody knew that 
Canadian Airlines was in financial trouble and that it was about 
to unfold but instead, the federal government allowed the market 
forces to decide the airline's fate.  In some communities for a 
number of months transportation strategies were causing an 
immense amount of problems with respect to air transport and 
being able to move people the way that we wanted to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also maintain that when this government took office in 
1993 the revenues for the Department of Transport from fuel taxes 
and user fees, whether it was leases on airports or whatever, 
were essentially equal to its expenditures.  Right now the 
Department of Transport takes in $3.9 billion more each and 
every year from resources, such as fuel taxes and leasing fees. I 
guarantee that the provinces are not getting anywhere near that 
kind of return on their highways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a minimum, the federal government should be dealing with 
these four particular issues:  first and foremost, working in 
collaboration with the provinces to develop a national 
transportation strategy for highways; second, having a clear 
vision in terms of urban transportation; third, working with the 
municipality so that we can develop the infrastructure for public 
transport; and fourth, to recognize that the transportation 
strategy that it has will assist in its strategy with respect to 
greenhouse gases and climate change.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have enjoyed listening to the 
comments from that part of Canada.  It is rather interesting to 
compare the thinking in different areas of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my province we have two airports, which is all we have ever 
had and I guess all we can ever expect.  The minister and other 
members mentioned three airports this morning.  I believe they 
were Moncton, Fredericton and Saint John.  I can appreciate that 
those members have the airports, and I hope that they can keep 
them, but it is very difficult for me to understand the concept 
of distance.  Where I come from the joke is that if our dog runs 
away we can see the dog going for two days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to draw a comparison here.  I come from a rural 
constituency.  If I really step on it I can get to the airport in 
an hour and a half to two hours, and I am one of the the lucky 
ones.  My colleague from Yorkton—Melville is two to two and a 
half hours from the airport.  My colleague from Cypress 
Hills—Grasslands is five hours from the airport.  In those 
terms, I have never heard anyone in my province complain about 
having only two airports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In getting to the airport, is it the time restraint the member 
for Fundy—Royal has or is it the mileage?  For instance, when I 
stayed with my brother in Burlington it sometimes took him two 
hours to get me to Pearson airport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we have to put things in perspective.  I am not trying 
to criticize the hon. member's position.  I am just trying to get 
a picture in my mind of what the problem is with the airports. Is 
it the distance or the obstacles in getting to the airport?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the issue at hand here is 
that the three towns, Moncton, Saint John and Fredericton, are 
about the same size.  If they were on their own, clearly they 
would have some kind of an airport.  It is paramount for economic 
development reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I accept the argument that those three airports are within an 
hour or an hour and a half driving distance.  As opposed to 
taking a hands off approach and saying whatever happens happens 
between those three airports or whatever happens happens to the 
economic development in those three towns, the federal government 
owes it to the citizens in those three towns to step forward and 
provide leadership in terms of other solutions with respect to 
air transportation, whether it is one centralized airport or 
whether it is rebuilding one of the existing airports. That 
becomes a very difficult issue to manage.  It is very parochial 
in nature regardless of where we live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is that the federal government at a minimum should 
maintain those three airports unless it has agreed with its 
provincial partners and the citizens who reside in those three 
towns to build a better transportation system.

with respect to the motion by the Conservative Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently in Nova Scotia Premier Hamm announced his government's 
intentions to privatize a large portion of the department of 
transportation.  From what I understand after talking to 
individuals, Cumberland—Colchester is going to see about 
two-thirds of the department of transportation privatized.  I 
heard the member talk about the federal government's obligation 
for a national transportation policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is he in agreement with the premier of Nova Scotia's intentions 
to privatize the department of transportation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am quite proud of the 
initiatives John Hamm is taking for the province of Nova Scotia. 
Because of the tax and spend liberalism and the socialist 
individuals who have created the financial crisis in that 
province, Premier Hamm has had to make some choices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a mere experiment within the government to see how it 
can deliver some services in a more cost effective manner. My 
perspective is I support my provincial cousins in their 
initiatives to deliver services in innovative ways. If it turns 
out that it was not the best course, it was an experiment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Nova Scotia has been forced into making some 
tough choices.  We should give that government the chance to get 
its fiscal house in order.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do 
not know quite where to begin. There is so much to offer on the 
motion of the day by the Conservative Party, particularly the 
member for Cumberland—Colchester. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard the Tories say it was the Liberal way.  Then we heard 
some Liberals say it was the Tory way.  A constituent just called 
me and said, “You can all take the highway”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate has to centre around whether or not it is the 
responsibility of government to proceed in the fashion it is 
proceeding and to gain the support of the public that elects it. 
So far since 1993 that has happened and as far as I can tell, it 
may happen again for another four years at least.  Why is that? 
The Canadian public sees that the government does have control of 
the agenda and that it does have a plan for the many different 
ministries the opposition are raving about today in the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us read again the Tory motion by the member for 
Cumberland—Colchester: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House recognize the urgent need to address the serious 
transportation problems facing the Canadian people, and call upon 
the government to establish a comprehensive national 
transportation policy that demonstrates leadership on this issue 
and which provides solutions to the problems shared coast to 
coast by all Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Establish a comprehensive national transportation policy that 
demonstrates leadership.  The member for Fundy—Royal kicked off 
his address by talking about the need for infrastructure in a 
country this size in order to maintain the transportation links 
in a safe manner so that we can proceed to build economically in 
this country and be successful as a country in a globally 
competitive world, or something to that effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us start from the premise that Canada's transportation 
infrastructure extends over some nine million square kilometres, 
includes almost one million kilometres of road, 50,000 kilometres 
of rail lines, 646 certified airports, and over 300 commercial 
ports and harbours.  This network involves millions of components 
and thousands of people all working together to keep the system 
running smoothly.  It is not the member for Hamilton West saying 
this, that is according to the World Economic Forum's global 
competitiveness report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's transportation infrastructure is ranked first among the 
G-7 countries. Why do we suppose that is?  Is it because, as the 
member for Cumberland—Colchester suggests, the government has 
not established a comprehensive national transportation policy 
that demonstrates leadership?  Nonsense.  This is a nonsensical 
motion that we are debating today quite frankly for many of us in 
the House, and there are not too many of us probably because the 
motion is highly partisan and quite ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What have we been doing for infrastructure over the years we 
have been in power?  Before I get to that, before we came to 
power in 1993, I had the privilege of being elected back in 1988. 
From the first week that I was elected in 1988 I sat on the 
Standing Committee on Transport.  I remember fondly old Pat 
Nowlan sitting in the committee in 1988.  In those days we could 
smoke in the House of Commons.  He would be charged there with a 
huge cigar and next to me was Les Benjamin.  Now there was a guy 
who knew about trains.  And there was Iain Angus.  We could 
always judge how long the transport committee meeting would be by 
the number of cans of Coke Iain Angus had lined up in front of 
himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did a lot talking back then.  We travelled the world and 
looked at high speed rail systems.  After having been here for 12 
years I look back at those five years fondly and as a great 
experience being in opposition with a Tory government. But then I 
look back and ask what we accomplished back then. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the five years that I was there in transport, we accomplished 
zip as a government.  We travelled a lot.  We went around the 
world and saw many countries.  We saw ports.  We saw harbours and 
did not do anything with them under the Tories.  We studied all 
kinds of high speed rail in five or six countries.  Now the TGV 
is a huge success in Paris.  We did not do anything with it back 
then.  The Conservatives did not want to touch it.  Why did we 
study it if we did not want to touch it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then I remember fondly, or maybe not so fondly, Mr. Corbett. I 
think the hon. member for Cumberland—Colchester will remember 
Mr. Corbett who was the chairman of the Standing Committee on 
Transport.  Now there was a leader among leaders.  Imagine, and I 
do not like to speak disparagingly about people, but we did not 
have a committee meeting of the Standing Committee on Transport 
for nine months.  Why?  Because the chairman was recreating the 
sailing adventure of Christopher Columbus from his east coast 
riding to Europe.  For nine months we did not have a meeting of 
the Standing Committee on Transport and the Conservative Party 
has the gall, the unmitigated nerve to stand in the House today 
and say that the government does not have a plan for 
transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I recall it was this government two weeks after we were 
elected in 1993 that brought forward an infrastructure program. 
Why did we bring it forward?  Because this government recognized 
that the cities, the municipalities, the provinces, indeed the 
country, needed help with infrastructure.  We did not want to go 
the way of Pittsburgh or Buffalo where the infrastructure of the 
city, the very heart of the city, the water, the sewers, the 
roads, was crumbling underneath their feet.  We did not want that 
to happen.  We did not want to go that far.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a comprehensive plan and a commitment.  We have a 
commitment to negotiate an agreement by this fall with the 
provinces, the municipalities and the private sector for a 
multi-year plan to improve provincial highways and municipal 
infrastructure in cities and rural communities right across 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have a plan to allocate hundreds of millions of dollars 
over the next five years for municipal infrastructure in cities 
and rural communities right across Canada, including affordable 
housing, green infrastructure and up to $150 million for 
highways.  Does that sound like a government that has not 
established a comprehensive national transportation policy that 
demonstrates leadership?  I do not think so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have just invested hundreds of millions of dollars into VIA 
Rail.  We did not do that under the Tories.  In fact I remember 
the member from London and I getting on a train going across 
Canada and wearing yellow VIA Rail hats trying to convince the 
Conservative government of Brian Mulroney to spend some money on 
VIA Rail to keep it alive.  It did not happen, but it did under 
the Liberal government.  This government has demonstrated some 
foresight.  It has demonstrated some investment in VIA Rail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Cumberland—Colchester who moved this nonsensical 
motion today sat in committee with us.  There were 53 meetings of 
the Standing Committee on Transport that dealt with airline 
restructuring. The government was not about to put tens of 
millions of dollars into an airline called Canadian.  We tried 
that.  We had promises from it. We tried it and it failed.  Why? 
There was a lot of capacity and not enough people flying.  It was 
a simple business response. Canadian Airlines did not have the 
passengers and could not compete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Cumberland—Colchester sat with us in committee 
day after day.  The committee produced a solid report which was 
unanimously endorsed by members of the standing committee who 
told the government that it had to address the issues of fair 
pricing, competition, Canadian ownership and control, service to 
small communities and fair treatment of employees.  We all agreed 
on that.  We had a terrific report which was praised even by the 
<I>National Post</I>.  Imagine that.  Everybody thought it was 
great. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we came back with legislation in short order because we 
realized the circumstances facing the airline industry in Canada. 
The committee sat again for weeks and came up with legislation. 
Was it good enough for the committee as it came to us from the 
government?  No.  It was the committee that struck nine 
amendments to the bill.  Everybody agreed that it was the right 
thing to do and the amendments carried and they made the bill 
stronger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member who moved today's motion sat in committee and said 
that he was going to move a motion because he felt we should have 
an ombudsman to look after customers' concerns.  The committee 
said it was a good idea.  But the government had the foresight 
and it had a plan.  It said, “We do not want to create a new 
infrastructure for an ombudsman with the staff and all the costs 
associated with it.  We already have something in place”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government moved an amendment to have a watchdog. The 
Canadian flying public and businesses could complain to that 
individual.  This individual was put under the auspices of the 
CTA because the infrastructure was there already.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister had the vision and the foresight to realize that we 
had to have something in place for the flying public.  We were 
already down the road.  The minister had already initiated a 
venue for the public to make complaints. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Cumberland—Colchester even admitted that it 
was a lot stronger than even his amount.  He pulled his limit and 
went with that of the government.  That is good planning.  Then 
he came to us with the motion today saying that the government is 
not establishing any kind of comprehensive national 
transportation policy that demonstrates leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a great speech on intelligent transportation systems which 
I could give.  It is a wonderful speech.  It talks about 
government planning an intelligent transportation system and 
about how we are planning ahead and dealing with provinces and 
the private sector.  We are dealing as a government to have a 
comprehensive plan on how to deal with the new way we do 
transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The transportation system has changed.  We no longer depend on 
the ribbon of steel taking us from coast to coast.  People want 
to get to where they are going yesterday and so they hop on a 
plane.  That is the way it is.  If that is what the people want 
then the people shall receive that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look back over my five years in opposition, sitting on the 
committee day after day and researching everything we had done to 
try to move transportation ahead.  Nothing seemed to come of it, 
but when we took government in 1993 things sure changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members opposite spoke a bit about Doug Young. Let me tell 
the House about Doug Young.  At least Doug Young had a vision and 
it certainly has worked out.  The first thing the Standing 
Committee on Transport did when we became government was to 
privatize CN Rail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP said it was a terrible thing to do that to the national 
railroad company.  It was the most successful privatization in 
the country.  It has done a magnificent job.  Look at the stock 
exchange.  There it is and it is doing well.  The government had 
a vision with respect to a railroad and decided to move ahead, 
and we did with 51% Canadian ownership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did we do next?  It was the commercialization of airports 
across the country.  The taxpayer was looking after hundreds upon 
hundreds of airports.  It was incredible.  Some of them were 
landing strips with gravel on them perhaps twice as long as the 
House of Commons.  We were paying money out hand over fist to 
keep the airports.  What did the airports look like?   We did not 
know but we had to give them money to keep them going.  Now look 
at our airport system.  It is highly successful.  Nav Canada 
privatized our air navigation services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill:</B>  And don't we all feel a lot 
safer? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes:</B>  Yes, we should feel a lot safer.  If the 
hon. member has a complaint about Nav Canada and its record of 
safety, I challenge her to walk out the door and say it in 
public.  She knows she would not do that.  I do not think she 
would because she knows that Nav Canada is doing the job and is 
doing a much better job than I dare say the government did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then what did we do?  We looked after the airline industry. 
We came up with something called the Keyes report.  I am damned 
proud of it because the Keyes report was the result of weeks of 
work by the Standing Committee on Transport and all its members 
travelling the country from port to harbour to port.  We obtained 
all the information we could from those witnesses on how to make 
a better port system.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We created a report much like the airline industry report our 
committee wrote and we submitted it to the government.  The 
government took it in hand, said that it was a damned fine report 
and built legislation around it.  What was the result?  The 
Canada Marine Act.  Again more vision and more planning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Marine Act today is successful because every port and 
harbour on that list, save one, is now a Canada port authority. 
They are all very successful because they are community led.  The 
community is doing with its port what it thinks is right to do 
with its port. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>NDP members laugh.  That is typical of the NDP.  It drives me 
crazy.  They have no idea how many ports and harbours there were 
in the country before we brought forward the Canada Marine Act. 
There were hundreds upon hundreds.  Can we imagine a port being 
no longer than 30 feet off the end of some soil and going out to 
wherever on the east or west coast with a harbour master being 
paid to look after it?  The taxpayers were supporting it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had to look at the whole picture and ask how much the 
taxpayer could really support.  We changed it.  Again, does that 
demonstrate, as the hon. member for Cumberland—Colchester 
stated, that the government has not established a comprehensive 
national transportation policy and leadership?  I do not think 
so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am standing here living proof that for five years under Tory 
rule we did nothing.  From 1993 to this day we have looked after 
harbours and ports, air navigation, airports, highways, ferry 
services and many other things.  That demonstrates leadership.  I 
would hope the hon. member would now take the opportunity to rise 
in his place to say that the chairman of the transport committee 
is absolutely correct and withdraw his motion because it truly is 
a foolish one. 
<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am not sure I heard the last sentence.  I think the 
member said I should stand and say that he is foolish.  Is that 
what he said?  It sounded something like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly that was nothing less than what we should expect from 
the chairman of the committee who I certainly acknowledge ran a 
very tight committee in which we did a lot of good work.  However 
he has certainly taken a lot of licence with the things that have 
happened and what we did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I notice both he and the minister focused on the airline merger. 
It is just part of the transportation infrastructure although an 
important part of it.  They both focused on it, on Bill C-26 and 
on how they managed to negotiate a wonderful merger which they 
did not negotiate at all.  Mr. Robert Milton negotiated the 
merger and they are playing catch-up, as we all are.  They cannot 
take credit for establishing an aviation policy because Air 
Canada did that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also suggested that he had travelled a lot when he 
was an opposition member.  He said he travelled all over on VIA 
Rail issues.  It seems to me he travelled in government on VIA 
Rail issues looking for options.  He went to Europe and the 
committee went several places.  I did not go myself, but I 
understand committee members travelled a lot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did they do?  They did not do a thing.  They did not come 
back with any innovative ideas.  They did not come back with one 
new innovative approach.  All they did was say that they had to 
put back in some of the money they had been robbing out of the 
VIA Rail system for years.  It was not to increase capacity or 
improve the system but to replace the rail cars that had fallen 
apart and to replace the switches that were failing and things 
like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not to increase capacity, availability, routes or 
anything else.  It was just to do some maintenance and repairs 
and to replace the deficient equipment that expired for all 
intents and purposes years ago.  To say they did something with 
VIA Rail is just not true. They put some money back in after they 
reduced it year after year after year.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also talked about $150 million for highways over so 
many years and over 10 provinces.  That will not do anything. 
That is a joke when it comes to highway work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Almost every provincial transportation minister has written to 
me.  I will just read from a couple of letters.  The chairman of 
the committee keeps talking about how they have leadership.  The 
minister from Alberta wrote that the federal minister expressed 
his support for the strategy of a highway system and further 
outlined his views on the essential components of a possible 
program but that there was no discussion on how the program was 
to be funded.  Is that leadership? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister from Newfoundland said that the province would be 
pushing for a national highways program that addresses the 
serious concerns.  I could quote the minister from the Northwest 
Territories, and on and on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no leadership.  There is a complete hodgepodge of 
highway programs right now.  Actually there are very few.  I 
think Newfoundland will get $100 million over the next two years. 
New Brunswick will get $100 million over the next two years. 
Nova Scotia will get zip. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I ask the chairman of the committee where is the 
leadership.  Where are the programs?  Where is the overall 
comprehensive policy on transportation that ties it all together? 
There is none. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I always do, I take the 
hon. member's question very seriously.  He said that the minister 
and I had focused somewhat on the airline industry. Rightly so, I 
say to the member.  Quite frankly the government should take 
credit for the work it did on the airline industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member opposite who just asked the question, the member 
for Cumberland—Colchester, should take credit for the hard work 
he did on the Standing Committee on Transport in order that the 
government, with his assistance, could save 16,500 jobs in the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One week before Christmas last year, that is how many people 
could have been out on the street without a job.  It was the 
government, with the assistance of the hon. member opposite as a 
member of the committee, that decided what the criteria would be: 
fair pricing to look after the consumer; competition to look 
after the consumer; Canadian ownership and control, a big bugaboo 
of the NDP; service to small communities, very important to the 
Conservatives especially on the east coast that they represent; 
and fair treatment for employees.  We answered every call.  Every 
one of those calls were answered thanks in part to the member who 
moved this motion.  We did demonstrate leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his second question he mentioned that we travelled a lot and 
he did not see much happen as a result.  I was in opposition.  If 
he wants me to, I will supply him with every one of the reports 
produced by the Standing Committee on Transport and he will see 
the opposition at the time and its dissenting views of the 
government in those reports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His third point was that the commitment to highways is a joke. 
Only a Mulroney Tory would call $100 million in 2000-01, $350 
million in 2001-02 and $550 million per year for the next four 
years up to 2006 a joke.  Only a Mulroney Tory would take all 
that money and say it is a joke. 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to ask the member a very pointed question. 
He likes to talk about the rating among the international scene 
of Canada as one of the best in infrastructure.  I am sure we can 
go to countries where the infrastructure is not as good, but we 
have some large problems in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though it is not in my riding, I am thinking of that area 
in Saskatchewan where my kids live.  The roads are being beaten 
to pieces by huge trucks hauling grain, now that the rail system 
is being dismantled.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Trans-Canada Highway is the country's major artery from east 
to west.  In Saskatchewan and I understand in other parts as well 
including parts of Ontario, it is a narrow two lane road which is 
so incredibly dangerous it is not acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had the occasion to visit Swift Current shortly after a 
horrendous accident on the Trans-Canada Highway just west of 
Swift Current.  It involved a half-ton with some workers for a 
siding outfit.  Two new buses that were being transported were in 
that accident.  They all were completely destroyed in the fire 
that ensued.  It involved two semi-trailer trucks. If I remember 
correctly there were three deaths on that one occasion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My brother took me over to see the wrecks.  Our hearts went out 
to the families whose loved ones had been needlessly killed on a 
highway that is totally inadequate as the Trans-Canada Highway, 
the main transportation artery across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely the member must feel at least a little tinge of 
conscience and must admit that our system is just not quite up to 
where it should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I feel more than a tinge, I 
tell the hon. member.  If we were flush with money and we could 
put it into changing every road in this country to make it a 
better road; if we could put up medians in the middle to ensure 
that cars would not cross over; if we could ensure that every 
driver knew how to drive properly, wore their seatbelt, did not 
drive drunk, obeyed all the rules of the road, did not tailgate 
and did not speed, it would be perfect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all the highways across this country that the federal 
government looks after, we would have to come up with $17 billion 
to repair them all.  It is a lot of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are trying to do it incrementally.  We have made commitments 
of hundreds of millions of dollars.  We will attempt to fix each 
one of these roads.  Everything has to be done in balance.  Roads 
and highways are not the only preoccupation of the government. 
There are many issues that are very important to Canadians. We 
have to find that balance and we have to stay within our means so 
that, and I am sure the hon. member would agree, we do not climb 
back into a deficit situation again. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will be splitting my time with the very eloquent member for 
Palliser. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to comment on some of the comments made by the chairman 
of the transport committee on a number of issues.  He bragged 
today about the privatization of CN.  He bragged today about 
Nav Canada.  He bragged about the privatization of the airports. 
He bragged today about the privatization of the ports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He pointed the finger at the NDP.  He said that this was the 
bugaboo of members of the NDP, that they believe the government 
should be involved to ensure that communities do not face 
economic devastation.  He is right. We do believe that. I thought 
at one time he might have believed that as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote from a book I picked up the other day.  “The 
question is who puts bread on the table when the private markets 
fail to do so?  The long term role of the state will not be 
determined by the necessity in the short run to solve fiscal 
problems. There are signs now that the fashion of denying on 
principle a positive role for the state is losing its grip.  The 
avoidance of social disharmony makes it imperative that those in 
authority will not lag behind their public in realizing that the 
state still has a role in keeping bread on the table.  The people 
as a whole will have the final say in determining the future role 
of government and I am content to rely on their judgment”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the words of the Hon. Allan MacEachen, a well 
respected former Liberal. 
I wonder how he would feel about the comments of the 
transportation chair about the great, wonderful role of 
privatization of the transportation industry in this country. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1650"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also think that the chairman and some of the members need a 
little history lesson.  In condemning the Conservatives, he 
talked about how the Liberal plan has benefited the country. 
There may be some truth that it benefited parts of the country. 
Probably Toronto is doing very well.  I pick up the <I>Globe and 
Mail</I> and I read about the economic growth in parts of Ontario. 
However there is a history here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a time a hundred years ago when the economic centre of 
growth was Atlantic Canada.  The transportation routes to 
Atlantic Canada were the most travelled in the country.  A deal 
was made.  It was called confederation.  As part of the deal, 
some of the transportation routes would be bypassed in order for 
the country to forge into the west. For a hundred years we 
developed a transportation policy that allowed that to happen. We 
enhanced the St. Lawrence Seaway which allowed some of the ships 
that would normally stop in Atlantic Canada to find their way 
through the continent to the port of Montreal and the ports of 
Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now Atlantic Canada finds itself in a most difficult situation. 
As the government of the day decides that privatization and the 
natural market forces are the way to compete, we find ourselves 
scratching our heads asking what happened to the concept of 
confederation where we were going to give a little bit in the 
interests of building a nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that the playing field is tipped a little bit in central 
Canada's favour, all of a sudden that does not matter anymore. 
All of a sudden we are all supposed to compete.  Atlantic 
Canadians, and when I say this I know I will be supported by my 
colleagues in the Conservative Party who represent Atlantic 
Canada, can compete with the best of them when the playing field 
is level.  But it is not and it has not been for some time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the member of the government says that there is a 
transportation policy in place that has created economic growth 
in this country, I say again maybe for some parts.  In the region 
of the country I represent we are fighting desperately to keep in 
place a rail system so that when the federal government withdraws 
from the Cape Breton Development Corporation we have something to 
attract businesses so they can ship goods out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They keep telling us in Atlantic Canada to pull ourselves up, to 
be competitive and to manufacture goods.  We agree with all of 
that, but it is not much good to manufacture goods if we cannot 
get them to market.  We do not have a sufficient population base. 
We rely on markets to the east where Europe is, to the south 
where there are huge markets in New England, and to the west, to 
Ontario.  Without substantial investment from the government in 
the infrastructure of Atlantic Canada, we simply cannot compete 
and find our way to the same level of prosperity as other parts 
of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We require a strategy that will invest heavily in those areas of 
the country that are not benefiting from the current economic 
growth.  Atlantic Canada is one of them.  That can be done in a 
number of ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have advocated for some time the restoration of passenger rail 
service in my own hometown.  We had a passenger rail service 
until the Conservative government took it out in the 1980s.  It 
was a well used and profitable VIA Rail line.  There was no 
reason to take it away. The city of Saint John found itself in 
the same situation. It had a rail service that was profitable. 
Prime Minister Mulroney said if the rail line was used, he would 
not take it out.  We used it.  We took him at his word and it was 
gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently the community I represent is faced with an aging 
population.  The major medical centres are in Halifax. People 
have the choice of driving to Halifax in a minivan at 
considerable cost or driving themselves on highways which have 
become incredibly terrifying for senior citizens because of the 
trucks and increased traffic. 
It is not like it was 25 or 30 years ago.

<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things the government could do is re-establish 
passenger rail service in the communities where it was 
profitable. That would maintain the rail lines so that as we try 
to develop some economic growth, the rail line is there and is 
used and maintained for both passengers and freight on which we 
could build an economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk a little about the airports. The chairman of the 
transport committee talked about what a wonderful job Nav Canada 
was doing, how good it was that it had been privatized out to a 
private corporation. Let me relate some of the experiences we 
have had. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a period of time about two years ago where Nav Canada 
decided it would downgrade the airport in Cape Breton.  Again, as 
we are trying to build an economy, trying to take the government 
at its word and trying to be innovative and entrepreneurial, not 
only did we have a problem with the rail lines, but we also heard 
that the flight service centre would be removed from our airport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Being a member of parliament and a community activist, I got the 
community involved.  I said, let us talk to the people at Nav 
Canada.  Surely they would be reasonable and understand that we 
need to maintain this service.  Their response to me was that 
this was community consultation but they would make the final 
decision.  They said, “We are a private corporation.  What 
matters to us is the bottom line.  It does not matter that you 
guys are trying to pull yourselves up.  It does not matter that 
you need this airport if you are going to build any kind of 
economic infrastructure.  We are interested in the bottom line 
and whether you are making money right now”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately we are a tough lot in Cape Breton.  The community 
got together.  We fought hard enough and we kept the flight 
service station.  Had it been government that was involved in 
that, it would have at least understood there was a social policy 
attached to the dismantling of that airport.  However, the 
Liberal government in its move to privatization and its newfound 
zealot's belief in the private market, decided it would disband 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was the consequence for small communities in the country. I 
know what we face is no different from small communities in the 
west and in northern Ontario that are trying to build up their 
economic base. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chairman of the transport committee, with some wry humour I 
suppose, talked about the small little ports in the east and the 
west.  Those little ports represent an opportunity for economic 
growth for many of those communities.  Maybe it is because I 
represent an island that has an inland sea in the centre of it 
that we are so sensitive to the ports.  Those small communities 
rely on the ports to ship gypsum and lumber in and out.  They 
rely on them as they plan their economic future for tourism and 
all kinds of activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we got word that the government was divesting itself of the 
ports, the community was concerned because the economic base is 
not there for the community to say it can afford to take it over 
and have a port authority maintain it.  Many communities in 
Atlantic Canada cannot afford that at this point in time, yet the 
port is essential if they are ever going to get to a point where 
they can afford to maintain their own ports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again the playing field has been shifted.  We have to run 
uphill and just as we are about to get there the ropes are being 
pulled away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I accept the motion moved by the Conservative Party today.  It 
provides important debate in terms of the transportation problems 
facing the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about one other aspect of transportation.  It is 
one which I do not think has been mentioned yet, although it may 
have been by the newest member of the House of Commons.  I am 
sure he will find some interest in it as will my other colleagues 
from Newfoundland, and that is Marine Atlantic.  It is a vital 
transportation link for the people of Newfoundland.  It is a 
partnership between the Government of Canada and the province of 
Newfoundland.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude by saying that those are all vital 
transportation links to Atlantic Canada.  We will fight to 
maintain them and we will demand from the government the 
honouring of the contract that was made so long ago. 
<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for his words today.  I share with him many 
of the views he expressed relative to the malaise in our federal 
transportation policy, if I could call it that, particularly 
relative to Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not certain whether the hon. member was able to hear the 
member for Mississauga West speak of the highways and roads in 
Nova Scotia earlier today.  The member for Mississauga West went 
on at great length about how Nova Scotia had excellent highways, 
that there was nothing to complain about, that the main highways 
were excellent and that the byroads were terrific. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know whether the hon. member agrees with me that 
the member for Mississauga West was clearly misinformed.  He is 
one who is sometimes prone to hyperbole and exaggeration and 
maybe he had fallen into that trap.  Would the hon. member agree 
with me that rural roads in Nova Scotia are in significant 
disrepair and that the issue has to be addressed from a tourism 
perspective? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where I live, in Cheverie, Hants County, it is so bad that I 
have to go to the dentist every six months to have my fillings 
replaced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Secondly, not just from a tourism perspective, but from a safety 
issue, Highway 101 has been an issue for a number of years. 
There have been over 40 deaths on the highway since 1993.  It has 
the highest level of traffic in the province of Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is now investigating the notion of a cost 
share program with the provinces.  Does the hon. member share 
with me the concern I have about cost sharing programs?  Because 
of the mess that the current government in Nova Scotia inherited 
from the government of Russell MacLellan, the province does not 
really have the ability to match funds.  Should the federal 
government not be more proactive in addressing these safety 
issues and spend some of the money that it receives by way of 
fuel taxes, of which only 5% is invested in highways? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In view of the fact that the province of Nova Scotia is clearly 
not in a financial position at this time to enter into a cost 
sharing agreement, why is the federal government not recognizing 
the safety issues, including Highway 101, and spending a greater 
level of the tax money collected from fuel taxes on highway 
priorities like Highway 101 instead of simply creating these 
straw man arguments around cost sharing programs in which clearly 
the province is not in a position to participate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
the question.  If we wanted to look at what was the growth 
industry in Atlantic Canada or where we should invest funds, the 
auto repair industry, the shop industry, is probably the only 
bright light in Cape Breton and Nova Scotia at the current time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I share with the member that concern.  That is not just my 
concern.  I have received a number of letters from constituents 
in my riding who talk about that very issue.  They say that we 
are supposed to be developing tourism as an alternate industry in 
Cape Breton.  As the government withdraws from Devco it keeps 
pointing to tourism as one of the areas of potential economic 
growth.  However, as the member says, for people to get from one 
place to another with their car intact is no easy feat.  We could 
all participate in some international races because we have 
learned to weave in and out and around the potholes.  I share 
with him that concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also share the concern that the smaller provinces or the 
provinces that find themselves economically strapped simply 
cannot afford the kind of extensive repairs that are needed.  If 
the federal government wants to enter into some kind of 
agreement, there has to be the recognition that not all provinces 
have the same resources.  That is one of the founding principles 
of this country and Confederation.  I will be getting a sign 
again, but I would concur with the member and his comments.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the member for Sydney—Victoria for allowing me to share his 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Hamilton West, who is the chair of the 
transportation committee, talked a few minutes ago about what has 
transpired in this country for the last 133 years with 
governments alternating between the Liberals and the 
Conservatives.  When the Liberals are in everything is great and 
it is the fault of the other guys.  It is a game that is wearing 
a bit thin.  I am sure it is for you too, Mr. Speaker, as it is 
for those of us in the New Democratic Party caucus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about transportation policy from the point of 
view of Saskatchewan, which is a landlocked province.  I want to 
talk a bit about air, rail, highways and roads.  There is not 
much point in talking about shipping unless we want to go 
canoeing in northern Saskatchewan where there are some terrific 
canoe routes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transportation for the New Democratic Party and for our 
constituents is absolutely vital to Canada's future economic 
development.  We need an efficient, high quality and safe network 
of highways, railways, ports and airports to move not only goods, 
but people as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our transportation infrastructure has deteriorated under this 
government, as it did under the Mulroney government in the 1980s 
and early 1990s.  Despite the member for Hamilton West, we insist 
that this government lacks the vision and the will to develop 
transportation infrastructure worthy of the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk a bit about the airline industry.  We feel it has 
been in a state of perpetual crisis since the late 1980s as a 
result of unregulated competition.  More recently we saw the 
total demise of Canadian Airlines and the creation of one big 
airline.  On this side of the House we have consistently called 
for a modern regulation regime to protect the public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will make a few observations on air travel as it has affected 
people coming in and going out of Saskatchewan since the merger 
took place.  I do not believe that I have been on a flight 
recently from Ottawa to Regina—and other members fly the same 
route—that has not been positively and absolutely booked. Of 
course, the flight from Ottawa to Regina is not a direct, 
non-stop flight.  It either goes through Winnipeg or Toronto, and 
occasionally both.  Often they try to bribe people with $300, for 
those who do not need to get there yesterday, as the member for 
Hamilton West was suggesting.  The flights are full, there are 
fewer seats on the planes and it is very expensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not everybody needs to get there yesterday.  Some people would 
enjoy taking the train.  In the southern part of Saskatchewan 
that is very difficult to achieve.  People either have to go to 
Saskatoon, which is almost a three hour drive from Regina, or 
perhaps two and a half hours from Moose Jaw, to get a train 
usually at 2 o'clock in the morning, or they can go to Melville, 
which would take a couple of hours, to get the train at 4 o'clock 
or 5 o'clock in the morning, depending on whether the person is 
heading east or west.  The train station in Regina is now a 
casino.  The train station in Moose Jaw just recently reopened as 
a state of the art liquor store. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the injection of hundreds of millions of dollars into 
VIA Rail which the government announced recently, I doubt very 
much whether VIA passenger train service will ever be restored in 
southern Saskatchewan, except perhaps for the occasional high 
priced tourist train that will go through in the summer months 
between Winnipeg and Vancouver.

<A HREF="#LINKT85"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not all need to get to our destination yesterday.  Some of 
us would like to take the leisurely route, but it makes it very 
difficult given the logistics of getting to where the train is at 
these days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The riding of my colleague for Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar is 
situated on the VIA line that goes from east to west.  The train 
that runs through Biggar in the middle of the night requires 
people to stand outside in summer or winter because the station 
is not open to allow folks to board the train.  People stand at 
the side of the tracks, which is clearly not an incentive to take 
the train. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me turn to the highway system.  I think we are the only 
country in the world that does not have a national highway 
transportation system.  About three or four years ago the 
Government of Saskatchewan committed some $1 billion over the 
next 15 years to be spent on upgrading highways.  Work has been 
undertaken to twin the highways.  There is work being done in the 
area of Gull Lake, on the east side of the province, that the 
member from the Canadian Alliance spoke about.  There is no 
question that work would be done much faster if some federal 
money went into the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read recently that the twinning which is scheduled to be 
completed in about five or eight years could be cut in half if 
the federal folks would step up to the plate and put some money 
into our highway infrastructure program to get the death traps 
cleaned up and turned into four lane highways.  It would be safer 
for the travelling public and a lot more enjoyable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that big trucks are a cause for grave 
concern.  That is part and parcel of our grain transportation 
system.  I will not get into that issue because we will be 
debating it over the next couple of weeks.  As farmers have to 
move their grain farther and farther to inland terminals and 
other elevators to get to the main lines, it is putting 
additional pressure on roads that were never intended to carry 
the kind of weight that the tandem and the Super Bs are putting 
on our highways.  That is part and parcel of the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The $175 million announced by the government a couple of weeks 
ago as part of the grain transportation bill that is coming 
forward will be welcome news.  However, we need to note that it 
is $175 million for western Canada, so it will not amount to a 
heck of a lot.  If it were $1.75 billion it would be significant. 
Nobody is going to turn down $175 million, but nobody is jumping 
too high about it either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the NDP support the motion presented by the Conservative 
member for Cumberland—Colchester, my well travelled colleague. 
We support this call for collaboration between all levels of 
government and the private sector.  These groups must work 
together to make sure that our national transportation 
infrastructure serves the public interest and meets the needs of 
all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government must, in partnership with the provinces, 
invest in highways to facilitate the movement of people and 
goods.  If the government allows the deterioration of our 
highways to continue, the economic cost will continue to rise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government must commit to ensuring that our national 
transportation system serves all parts of the country.  That is a 
concern of my party.  The member for Sydney—Victoria indicated 
that it is a concern in Cape Breton.  I am trying to signal that 
concern from my part of the world.  The government has 101 seats 
in the province of Ontario.  It has very little understanding or 
recognition of the problems that many constituents in the 
so-called hinterland of this nation feel, the difficulty we have 
in getting our products to port and getting our people, goods and 
services moved from our part of the world to tidewater, to the 
big smoke of Toronto or wherever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a timely motion.  I hope the government takes it very 
seriously, although I am skeptical that will be the case.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC)</B> moved 
that Bill C-428, an act establishing Samuel de Champlain Day, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, this is an interesting bill that we will 
be debating.  I have had a lot of support from my colleagues on 
both sides of the House.  To begin, I want to go through exactly 
what the bill really does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a bill to establish what we would call a day for Samuel 
de Champlain.  What would happen is that beginning in the year 
2004, June 26 from then on would be known as Samuel de Champlain 
day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that raises a number of questions in the minds of 
everyone here and some of those listening, particularly those 
back in Quebec.  There has been a lot of interest in the province 
of Quebec on this bill for obvious reasons.  Champlain is known 
as the founder of New France and has been recognized as a 
significant part of their history for many years. The question 
that I often get asked is why an anglophone member from New 
Brunswick would come up with the idea of recognizing Champlain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Champlain first settled on a little island on the St. Croix 
River in the year 1604.  Just as a note, it was the first 
European settlement on the north Atlantic coast.  If you are a 
historian, Mr. Speaker, this might be of interest to you.  It 
preceded both Jamestown in 1607 and Plymouth, Massachusetts in 
1620.  There is a lot of history on this little island on the St. 
Croix River, the island being situated about halfway between the 
town of St. Stephen and the town of St. Andrews, New Brunswick. 
It has international implications as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Americans have taken a great interest in this little island 
called St. Croix Island because it is actually American property. 
The island itself now belongs to the United States government. 
Although we are more closely associated with it, the Americans 
recognize it as a piece of their territory.  They themselves have 
been doing a number of things to commemorate this event, marking 
just slightly short of four years from the 400th year celebration 
of the founding of this little settlement by Champlain. The 
United States is getting ready to celebrate the historical 
significance of the settlement on this island in a big way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to quote an editorial from the St. Croix <I>Courier</I> 
that was written on this very topic.  It is entitled “It's time 
for Canada to move on St. Croix Island's 2004 celebration”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The editorial goes on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Congratulations to the Maine Delegation in the U.S. Congress. It 
is taking major steps to celebrate the heritage of our area and 
Saint Croix Island.  Maine Senators Susan Collins and Olympia 
Snowe are co-sponsoring The Saint Croix Island Heritage Act, 
legislation which will help develop a heritage centre in Calais. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most Francophones pronounce Calais the French way but the 
Americans have anglicized it.  It is a little border town that is 
across from St. Stephen, New Brunswick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people in the United States are making moves to recognize 
the importance of this island.  What I am suggesting to the House 
is that we do the same thing, hence, the idea of recognizing a 
Champlain day.  The date that is mentioned in my bill identifies 
June 26 as being the most likely date for this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have talked to some of my friends in Quebec, and in particular 
René Lévesque, a historian and archaeologist in Quebec City, who 
many of my colleagues from the Bloc will know.  The last time we 
met he suggested to me that we might consider altering the date. 
In other words, I am suggesting June 26, because that is the 
likely date in the year 1604 that Champlain settled on that 
island, but he has said that because July 1 is Canada Day and 
July 4 is the American Independence Day, where they celebrate 
their birth as a country, that some date in between might be 
better.  He has suggested that July 3 might be the date because 
it has historical significance in Quebec.  I am very open to 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very open to any changes that have to be made in this bill 
to make it work.  We are not fixed on anything that cannot be 
changed to make the bill better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The trick now is to make this bill votable, which it obviously 
is not at at this time.  Therefore, I will call on my colleagues 
from the Bloc and the other parties to help me expedite the 
passage of this bill.  We must make this bill votable and get the 
attention of the government on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I met with the heritage minister she told me that she was 
anxious to help.  She recognizes that as Canadians we do not 
acknowledge our heroes as much as we should.  She has suggested 
that we do something for the schools so there will be pamphlets 
and historical reference to Champlain, et cetera, so that when we 
get to the year 2004 our children and teachers will know a bit 
about him and the historical significance of this man who has 
played such a huge role in the development of what we now know as 
Canada and whose early beginnings was on that little island in 
the St. Croix River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aside from giving credit to my colleagues on the American side, 
Senators Snowe and Collins, I want to acknowledge the work that 
the mayor of the town of St. Stephen has done on this issue. He 
is a bit of an amateur historian and is really working hard to 
get this date recognized and get some celebrations on the 
Canadian side of the border in recognition of this date.  That 
would be Mayor Allan Gillmor of the town of St. Stephen, New 
Brunswick.  St. Andrews is also working on this, but I wanted to 
single out the work of the mayor of St. Stephen, New Brunswick, 
in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>St. Stephen has also hired or commissioned a young lady for this 
project, so that by the time we get to the year 2004 we will have 
something for which we can be proud.  This is little bit of 
history that we simply do not want to lose.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope I will get support from my colleagues tonight.  I hope 
that in their remarks they will suggest ways we can improve the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did hear one complaint about the bill.  We often hear of 
Champlain and de Monts.  Mr. de Monts is sometimes credited with 
being the leader of the expedition.  I think that is legitimate 
but I want to point out that de Monts went back to France and 
left Champlain basically in charge of the outpost.  It was 
Champlain who was buried in Quebec City. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was in Quebec City not too long ago, René Lévesque, who 
has done a lot of work on this file, actually took me to the 
gravesite which is considered the gravesite of Champlain.  It is 
in the basement of one of the older buildings in the historic 
section of downtown Quebec City.  It was quite a moment to get 
into the building and witness firsthand what is considered to be 
the gravesite of Champlain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the argument on the de Monts side is worthy of comment, 
discussion and debate, but the true historical character who has 
to be recognized is Champlain.  It is important that we do that 
simply because we can also have be a day for de Monts if we wish. 
We do not have to limit the scope of the bill or limit the 
possibility of bringing other names before the House in terms of 
discussion on a day of recognition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am certainly not trying to diminish the role of de Monts. He 
obviously is a very important part of this picture.  At some 
point some of the other members can stand on their feet and 
introduce a bill that would in some way honour his contribution 
to the country as well.  I am not against that at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the points that the heritage minister made to me was that 
maybe we should have a day honouring our first prime minister, or 
perhaps Sir Wilfrid Laurier.  I think that is all credible and 
worthy of discussion, but the point I go back to is that we do 
not do enough to recognize our own heroes in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of us know who Davy Crockett was but a lot of us never paid 
attention to Champlain.  I have because when I leave my door I am 
looking at this little piece of history in my backyard.  It is 
significant I guess that I should do something in the House, as 
opposed to any other member, but I am going to count on the 
generosity of the members in the House, which we often see in 
this place, to help me get this through the system.  It is very 
seldom that we get a private member's bill through here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is actually the start of the process.  I know it is not 
votable at this point, but I am going to ask my colleagues to 
help me get this votable.  I have even suggested that if the 
government, in its generosity, wants to take control of this file 
and introduce the bill itself, I have no difficulty with that.  I 
do not care who gets credit for it, I just want it to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc members can also introduce it if they wish.  If there 
is some way they can introduce the bill to make it votable, they 
will have my support.  In fact, a senator in the Senate of all 
places, to show just how nonpartisan it is, told me “Greg, I can 
introduce it in the Senate and we will bring it over to the 
House”.  That is a possibility as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are attempting to do is use the generosity of this place 
to pay tribute to someone I think is important to this country. I 
do not think there is anyone any more important than Champlain. 
The discovery of New France, the settlement in Quebec, is a rich 
part of our history and we do not want to lose that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I would appreciate any suggestions from you, 
because I know you are somewhat of an amateur historian. 
I hate to use the word amateur because you are a professional in 
your own league.   However, if there is any way in terms of the 
rules and procedures of the House that we can use to expedite 
this bill, please let me know because I am open to suggestions 
and I certainly need help to recognize Samuel de Champlain in the 
way that we should.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The date that we have in mind is June 26 but that date can 
change subject to debate in the House.  The year we are looking 
at is 2004.  For once we are doing something ahead of time.  We 
have a four year lead on this project.  The way things move 
around this place, four years might not be enough to make it 
happen but I am certainly hoping it will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask for unanimous consent to make this bill 
votable? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent to make 
this bill votable? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> No.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak to Bill C-428, an 
act establishing Samuel de Champlain day.  The bill is sponsored 
by the hon. member for New Brunswick Southwest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this bill, commencing in 2004, June 26 will be designated 
as Samuel de Champlain day.  The timing of the enactment is to 
coincide with the 400th anniversary of the establishment of the 
first French settlement by Champlain on St. Croix Island in 1604. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member, when introducing the bill in the House, 
mentioned that passage of this bill would be important to those 
in New Brunswick due to the planned celebrations for the 400th 
anniversary of Champlain's first North American settlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be remembered that Champlain's association with New 
Brunswick is but one small component of a life of much larger 
travels.  If Champlain were to be honoured for his discoveries, 
that honour should be shared by southern Ontario, the northern 
United States, southern Quebec, as well as New Brunswick.  It 
should also be remembered that Champlain's discoveries were on 
behalf of France.  His reward for those discoveries was to be 
named the governor of New France. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While Champlain's voyages were on behalf of France, some might 
argue that there was no Canada at the time to reference 
Champlain's accomplishments.  People might then be inclined to 
argue that Champlain's discoveries were closely tied to the 
French origins of New France.  In my view this misses the point. 
If Champlain is so important to Canada as we know it today, he 
should be equally heralded in the United States.  After all, the 
majority of the territory that Champlain discovered and mapped is 
now part of the northeast United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Champlain's famous 1632 map of New France, while lauded as a 
demonstration of the extent of his discoveries, in fact includes 
land that was mostly explored by others.  Who explored the 
Labrador, the Hudson Bay, the Rupert's Land and the Northwest 
Territories coastlines?  It was not Champlain.  It was Henry 
Hudson, the discoverer of Hudson Bay;  Captain Vancouver, after 
whom the city of Vancouver was named; and John Cabot, considered 
to be the first discoverer of Canada.  Their discoveries are no 
less significant to the establishment of Canada than those of 
Champlain, yet we do not honour them or accord them any 
particular federal honours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, exalting Champlain's accomplishment in the 
manner proposed demonstrates an elitist-centrist approach to the 
discoveries of our country.  Many appear more than willing to 
honour anyone who explored in the area around the St. Lawrence 
rather than those who bravely mapped our significantly more vast 
northern and western territories.  People who consider the north 
to be Lake Nipissing ignore the reality of geography and history 
of 80% of Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view, an appropriate manner by which to view Champlain's 
accomplishments is illustrated by how he was honoured by Canada's 
Merchant Navy during World War II.  The Merchant Navy fleet had 
many ships known as park ships.  In time of war, when an accurate 
representation of a nation was crucial, there was no Champlain 
fleet delivering supplies to the troops.  Rather, Champlain's 
name was on but one of the ships in the fleet. 
In a similar vein Champlain's accomplishments should be viewed as 
part of a much larger group of discoveries.  No one person is 
accorded a federal honour.  Rather the federal honour is to the 
collective effort.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is too narrowly focused and it is for this reason that 
I am reluctant to support it.  Samuel de Champlain is more 
commonly more known as the father of New France, relative to his 
later establishment of settlements in Quebec.  This fact is 
acknowledged in the preamble of the bill where it is stated that 
he was influential in the development of two further settlements: 
one at Port Royal on the Bay of Fundy and one at Quebec.  The 
Quebec settlement was established in 1608, four years after the 
events which are to be commemorated by the bill currently under 
consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue raised here is whether it is more appropriate for 
Samuel de Champlain day to be proclaimed by the New Brunswick 
legislature rather than by this House.  At the federal level we 
should acknowledge Champlain for his discovery or for the 
discovery that he is best known nationally.  Even the Acadian 
Centre in a publication on Champlain acknowledges that Champlain 
is above all recognized as the founder of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Champlain exemplified the multi-talented nature of many of our 
nation's heroes.  He was both an explorer and a cartographer.  He 
also wrote much about his travels and lived from 1567 to 1635. 
His first voyage in 1599 is when he explored the West Indies and 
Mexico.  In 1603 at the age of 36, sponsored by a fur trader, 
Champlain commanded a ship that explored the St. Lawrence River 
as far as Montreal is located today.  The purpose of this voyage 
was to colonize the new world though this objective apparently 
was not accomplished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Champlain's 1604 actions in Acadia on the Isle of St. Croix 
appear to be categorized by its nature as a trading post 
creation.  While Champlain arrived in Acadia in 1604, the first 
fort in the area, Fort Latour, was not constructed until 27 years 
later in 1631.  In fact, at least one historian considers that 
Champlain essentially lost his optimism for the future of Acadia 
after having spent three winters there.  This is one of the 
explanations given for Champlain's 1608 voyage and consequent 
founding of Quebec City. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was in 1608 that Champlain is regarded as having established 
his first European settlement in what is now known as Quebec 
City.  One reason for this is the official capacity in which 
Champlain returned to North America.  He was the lieutenant 
governor of New France.  The Quebec City settlement was followed 
by the establishment in 1611 of a settlement in Montreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1629 when Quebec was captured by the English the 62 year old 
Champlain was sent back to England as a prisoner.  Champlain only 
was able to return to Quebec after New France was returned to 
France.  He returned to his trading post in 1663 and to his 
position as governor of New France where he died two years later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Acadians in New Brunswick understandably have an identification 
with Champlain and he should be honoured accordingly.  His 
identification with Canada as a nation as well as his association 
with North America generally are somewhat different. In Acadia 
Samuel de Champlain is honoured by an educational school and a 
community centre being named in his honour as of 1985. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Champlain's name is also encountered on educational and other 
buildings throughout Canada.  Lake Champlain is named after him, 
a lake that Champlain discovered in 1609.  The Centre for Study 
of Canada at Plattsburgh State University has an annual scholarly 
symposium named after him.  Ironically the theme of this year's 
Samuel de Champlain symposium 2000 is “The Quiet Revolution in 
Quebec: Looking Back After 40 Years”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on the foregoing sentiments Champlain may certainly be 
viewed as having involvements in some significant events prior to 
the founding of Canada.  I believe that his official role as 
governor of New France points to the greater appropriateness of a 
Quebec based commemoration of his life.  Accordingly I cannot 
support the bill before the House as it is currently worded 
because it focuses too narrowly on one man when many more 
explored and established Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-428 
proposes the creation of a Samuel de Champlain Day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you and everyone else are aware, Mr. Speaker, Samuel de 
Champlain founded what was to become Quebec City, where I had 
the pleasure of growing up.  He is commemorated all over the 
city, by statues and in street names, with the boulevard 
Champlain and an absolutely charming street called rue du 
Petit-Champlain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for New Brunswick Southwest's bill proposes that 
a federal statute institute a Samuel de Champlain Day.  In his 
opinion, the contribution of Champlain merits a day right across 
Canada in his memory. 
The date the hon. member recommends to us to honour Champlain is 
June 26, because he supposedly established the first French 
settlement on that day in 1604. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member refers here to the colony on St. Croix Island in 
New Brunswick, an island the hon. member for New Brunswick 
Southwest says he can see from his home every day, when he is in 
New Brunswick, not when he is here, of course.  His bill 
proposes that throughout Canada, in each and every year, 
beginning in the year 2004, the 26th day of June be known under 
the name of “Samuel de Champlain Day”, because that date will 
mark the 400th anniversary of the founding of that island 
settlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For Quebecers, Samuel de Champlain is first and foremost the 
founder of Quebec.  In 1608, Samuel de Champlain founded what 
was, in fact, the first city in New France, and now the national 
capital of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just Quebecers who associate Champlain primarily with 
the founding of Quebec.  There are also thousands of Canadian 
and foreign tourists who visit Quebec City every year and who, 
walking along the famous Dufferin terrace, admire the imposing 
statue erected in honour of the founder of the city.  As you can 
see, Quebec did not wait for the federal parliament to act in 
order to honour this great man. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But let us talk about the Isle of St. Croix.  The French settled 
first on this island under lieutenant general de Monts, assisted 
by Champlain.  They numbered about 80.  The winter of 1604-05 on 
the Isle of St. Croix was disastrous because of the terrible 
cold and scurvy—35 colonists died.  The colony was therefore 
moved the next year to Port-Royal, an area Mr. de Monts hoped 
would be more favourable to the establishment of a permanent 
colony. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Life in Port-Royal was no doubt more comfortable for the 
colonists.  It was here in Port-Royal that de Champlain founded 
what is known as the Ordre de Bon temps in an effort to break 
the monotony of the long North American winters.  Thus, the 
Ordre de Bon temps was a sort of brotherhood where members took 
turns putting game or fish on the table for a festive and well 
lubricated meal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can we say, though, that Champlain played a greater role in 
establishing this second colony?  Historian Trudel, in an 
authoritative publication, the <I>Dictionnaire biographique du 
Canada</I>, answers the question, saying that in Port-Royal Champlain 
was a simple observer.  He says that Champlain was not in 
command either on the Isle of St. Croix or in Port-Royal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, we have before us today a bill which, in order to 
commemorate Samuel de Champlain's contribution to history, picks 
the anniversary of an event in which the person in question 
played, to all intents and purposes, a secondary role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, I understand the member, who probably chose this date 
because of a sentimental attachment to St. Croix Island, which 
he can see out his window every day, but I feel that the 
commemorative date chosen should have reflected the historic 
contribution for which Champlain is really recognized, which is 
the founding of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is where he made his real mark.  In 1608, on his fourth 
voyage to North America, Champlain landed at Quebec and built a 
settlement there.

<A HREF="#LINKT101"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was thus that Quebec's history began.  The settlement was to 
become the birthplace of New France and that is why historians 
referred to Champlain as the Father of New France. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the decade following the founding of Quebec, Champlain 
travelled back and forth between North America and France.  It 
was in 1620 that he really began developing the new colony. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between 1620 and 1624, on his tenth voyage, he set about 
constructing fortifications and renovating the settlement, which 
was home to about 60 people.  During an eleventh voyage in 1625, 
he strengthened the fort.  Quebec was captured by the Kirke 
brothers in 1629, but was returned to the French in 1632. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Champlain's twelfth voyage in 1633 was his last, since he died 
in 1635 after serving as governor of the colony for two years. 
At the time, Quebec was simply a trading post.  Despite 
everything, Champlain had time to note the promising start of 
the colony before he died. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although he was given the title of the father of New France, 
Champlain is one of a gallery of historical figures who built 
New France.  In other words, he is not the only famous person of 
the period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was, to start, Laviolette.  Sent by Champlain in 1634, he 
had a fort and a settlement built at the fork of the 
Saint-Maurice and St. Lawrence rivers.  Missionaries arrived 
there the following year.  Trois-Rivières was founded.  After 
Laviolette came Maisonneuve, who founded Ville-Marie in 1642. 
Ville-Marie later became Montreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were courageous women as well in the gallery of heroes of 
New France.  There was, first, Jeanne-Mance, who established the 
first hospital in Ville-Marie.  Marguerite Bourgeoys established 
the first school in New France. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dollard des Ormeaux is also an uncontested hero of New France. 
While the natives were preparing to destroy Ville-Marie, des 
Ormeaux decided to fight and save the colony.  He and his 
companions died in the fight, but they saved New France from 
destruction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And what about Madeleine de Verchères, who, in 1692, for eight 
days in a wooden fort, fought off almost single-handed an 
Iroquois attack until reinforcements arrived from Ville-Marie. 
Her courage was heroic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the historic figures of New France must also include 
those who explored the vast North American continent. 
I am thinking here of Joliet and Marquette, who discovered the 
Mississippi, and La Salle, who was to follow them and take 
possession of the Mississippi delta in 1682, giving these 
territories the name of Louisiana in honour of the King of 
France. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are just some of the heroes who have left their mark on 
the history of New France along with Samuel de Champlain.  I 
could name many more, but I will stop there in order to go on 
with my argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Were we to comply with the wishes of the hon. member of the 
Conservative Party to establish a Samuel de Champlain Day, it 
would be difficult, in my opinion, not to also recognize all of 
the other men and women who built New France.  Would there have 
to be one for Maisonneuve, one for Laviolette, one for Madeleine 
de Verchères, and so on? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for New Brunswick Southwest certainly means 
well, but he is putting us in a problematical situation.  Bill 
C-428, which is intended to honour an important figure in the 
history of Quebec and of Canada, leaves in the shadows all the 
other historical figures who have marked the history of Quebec, 
Canada and the United States.  Indirectly, the bill obscures the 
accomplishments of all these other builders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I cannot subscribe to the good intentions of this 
bill, out of respect for all these other men, all these other 
women, who left their mark on the history of Quebec over 300 
years ago.

Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is often said that 
Canada is a young nation.  But our heritage and our development 
as a society can also be measured by criteria that go back much 
further than our 133 years of official existence as a country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada of today has been shaped by events and people whose 
importance and contributions we must not allow to be forgotten or 
diminished by the passage of time. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So let us take a brief look at this important explorer.  For 
over 40 years of his life, between the time of his first visit 
to Canada in 1603 and his death on Christmas Day, in 1635, in 
the settlement at Quebec, Samuel de Champlain devoted himself to 
building what would become a strong and vibrant French colony in 
North America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Samuel de Champlain's courage and perseverance in pursuing his 
dream left a legacy that we should preserve and celebrate.  That 
is the underlying purpose of the bill before the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-428, an act establishing Samuel de Champlain Day, calls on 
the government to pay tribute to this great Canadian explorer 
each year on June 26, beginning in 2004. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to some, this date is an extremely important one in 
our nation's history because it is recognized, at least by some 
historians, as the 400th anniversary of the establishment of the 
first French colony on St. Croix Island, in Acadia, on the 
border of New Brunswick, in the Bay of Fundy.  Marking the 400th 
anniversary of the founding of this community is quite an 
occasion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Champlain, who was a geographer on the de Monts expedition, which 
landed in Acadia in 1604, was looking for a location for a 
permanent French colony. 
With Mr. de Monts, Champlain chose this island at the mouth of 
the St. Croix River, because of its central location and its 
accessible and sheltered harbour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His interest in this region in southern Acadia also had to do 
with his primary concern, which was to find a passage to reach 
China's riches. The west facing slopes of the Atlantic coast in 
the area made Champlain believe that such a passage might exist. 
As we now know, Champlain was going to be disappointed in his 
quest for the East's wealth, but very pleased with his discovery 
of Canada's riches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As some members mentioned, the first winter in New France for 
Champlain and the members of the new settlement was terrible. Of 
the 79 men that accompanied him, 35 died of scurvy. This was 
definitely not a promising start, but these difficult beginnings 
eventually led to a lively and solid French presence in the New 
World. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Champlain spent three consecutive winters in the Bay of Fundy. 
During his stay, he explored the region between the Isle of St. 
Croix and the settlement of Port-Royal, now Annapolis, in Nova 
Scotia. He also ventured south as far as Cape Cod. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For Champlain, the second voyage in New France was soon followed by 
a third one. The highlight of this trip occurred on July 3, 
1608, when the great explorer founded a small colony in Quebec—a 
colony that slowly grew to become the very heart of the French 
language and culture in North America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Samuel de Champlain had done great things as early as the summer 
of 1608, but many of his trips and discoveries would come later. 
One year after founding Quebec, he travelled with the Hurons, 
the Algonquins and the Montagnais to explore the area, including 
the lake south of Montreal which now bears his name. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Married to Hélène Boullé during a brief trip to France, in 1610, 
Champlain returned to Canada less than a year later, continuing 
his exploration of the St. Lawrence and opening a trading post 
in Mont-Royal.  Those who have visited Place Royale in the 
historic old port of Montreal have been struck by the spirit of 
one of its first European visitors, Samuel de Champlain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1613, Champlain left the island across from the port of 
Montreal, Île Sainte-Hélène, which he had named in honour of his 
wife, and began to explore the sites familiar to generations of 
Canadians who have visited Parliament Hill, the Gatineau River, 
the Rideau River and the Chaudière Falls. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsequently, Champlain would extend his travels as far westward 
as Lake Huron in 1615 and southward along the Trent River to the 
Bay of Quinte crossing Lake Ontario to portions of what is now 
New York State. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be remiss not to mention Explorer's Point Park in my 
hometown of Mattawa which was dedicated to the memory of Samuel 
de Champlain, and the Samuel de Champlain Provincial Park a few 
kilometres up the Mattawa River between Mattawa and North Bay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Honoured for his accomplishments, Champlain was entrusted with 
the overall direction of political affairs in New France.  The 
explorer's considerable talents and stamina had already been 
tested by his arduous journeys, hostile encounters and struggles 
against the harsh Canadian climate.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The task of colonizing this new outpost of the French empire 
proved equally challenging for Champlain.  He understood the need 
to encourage and foster human settlement, agriculture and 
commerce if these new territories were to remain under the flag 
of France.  While dealing with the challenges posed by his 
various political enemies at home, his repeated trips between new 
and old France gave him the opportunity to encourage settlers to 
join him in building a new society on the shores of the St. 
Lawrence River. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1629, Quebec fell to the English forces.  The colony 
surrendered, and Champlain was taken to England as a prisoner. 
Four years later, following the signing of a peace treaty, he 
returned to Quebec with the title of commander and remained 
there until his death in 1635. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All told, Samuel de Champlain made more than a dozen crossings 
between Europe and the new world, changing both the map of the 
known world and the course of history. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Champlain might be surprised to know that almost four centuries 
after the founding of the first French settlement on St. Croix 
Island his name and legacy enjoy an honoured place in the history 
of our nation.  Today a country called Canada flies neither the 
flag of France nor England but proudly celebrates the heritage of 
both these founding cultures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through his remarkable achievements Samuel de Champlain helped 
to secure the presence of the French language and culture in 
North America.  In very real terms Champlain helped define who we 
are.  At the dawn of this century and millennium, Canada is a 
modern outward looking nation that recognizes and celebrates the 
contributions of cultures from every corner of the world. 
Anchoring this vision of openness and accommodation is our 
official recognition of not one but two official languages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Samuel de Champlain was a key contributor to Canada's evolution. 
Because of our history based on two of the great languages of the 
world, we are a society that easily communicates and interacts 
with a great number of other nations. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's role as a leader in the Francophonie is an important 
example of this scope and influence.  In this major 
international forum, Canada plays an active role in promoting 
French language and culture and building ties among the 
francophone peoples of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an achievement that would no doubt bring great 
satisfaction to Samuel de Champlain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The approaching 400th anniversary of Champlain's participation 
in the first French colony on the Isle of St. Croix will provide 
an opportunity to mark this stage in our life as a nation 
significantly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would be a proud anniversary for Acadians, who can trace 
their heritage back to these courageous ancestors, for all the 
people of New Brunswick, the frontier where this modest first 
colony was built, and for all the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This serves as a reminder that, while our country is considered 
still relatively young, we are beginning to measure our history 
in centuries.  We can be justly proud of our history and of the 
famous figures, such as Samuel de Champlain, not to exclude the 
others, who contributed to the writing of that history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The spirit of Champlain is a presence for us until today.  Not 
far from this House, visitors to the Museum of Civilization in 
Hull can see the astrolabe Champlain used to navigate his way 
through the Ottawa valley four centuries ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is highly unlikely that this great explorer would have 
expected his lost instrument to someday find a place in a major 
national institution.  It is even less likely that he would have 
dreamed that the nation he helped found would one day be 
recognized as one of the best in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our history teems with examples of women and men whose heroism, 
leadership, energy and vision have contributed to the growth and 
development of Canada.  Samuel de Champlain is among their 
number. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without question we must ensure that Canadians keep alive the 
memory of this great explorer.  We must ensure that his 
extraordinary efforts to help the French language and culture 
take firm root in North America are both remembered and 
celebrated. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the debate on this motion, it is obvious that the concept 
on which it is based is worthy of our recognition and 
appreciation.  This concept is of vital importance, and we hope 
to be able to continue to celebrate our heritage, through either 
legislative measures or some other means.  Building our future 
together requires us to keep alive the memory of our past, and 
to honour that past.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will say from the outset that I am a little disappointed in the 
remarks that were made by the member of the CA, formerly known as 
the Reform Party. I guess that is what we would expect from that 
party in terms of recognition.  I was extremely disappointed when 
he termed the bill “an elitist centrist approach”.  I cannot 
believe he would say that.  I think he loses the generosity which 
this bill encompasses.  I am very disappointed in his remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I am somewhat disappointed by the Bloc.  I was told by 
some people that the members of the Bloc would probably not 
support the bill simply because they did not invent it.  I am 
very disappointed.  It does not exclude anyone who contributed to 
the establishment of Quebec and those other great explorers and 
cartographers. This bill simply does not do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other members who do support it and I am somewhat 
encouraged by what the government has had to say.  The generosity 
of this place indicates that we should go back to the drawing 
board and find a way to make this happen, whether it is through 
the legislative process of a bill or something else.  I think 
this is a Canadian who deserves recognition.  I do not think we 
should get lost in the semantics.  Was he Canadian, was Canada a 
country, et cetera, is all lost in debate. Nobody wants to debate 
those issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about an individual who very much contributed to 
what we know as Canada today.  It is not at the exclusion of 
anyone else regardless of who that anyone else might be, whether 
it is Henry Hudson or Jacques Cartier.  That is not the point of 
the bill.  It is simply to give recognition to someone who had a 
significant contribution to the founding of what is now known as 
Canada.  It is as simple as that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take heart from the support I have had in the House.  I am 
sure that with a little re-engineering and ingenuity we can find 
a way to honour what we consider to be one of Canada's heroes in 
what we now know as Canada.  We will continue the debate on this 
issue at a later date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The time provided for the

<A NAME="LINK253">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House take note of the Order amending the Schedule to 
the Migratory Birds Convention Act to incorporate the Parksville 
Protocol, which amends the 1916 Migratory Birds Convention, 
tabled on Thursday, May 18, 2000. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK254"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Paddy Torsney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the 
Environment, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, amending the migratory birds 
convention represents the fulfilment of a goal particularly to 
ensure its conformity with the aboriginal and treaty rights of 
the aboriginal peoples of Canada.  The migratory birds convention 
is North America's oldest international wildlife conservation 
pact.  Together with the sister treaty between the United States 
and Mexico, it provides the framework for the management and 
conservation of migratory birds in North America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The convention was created to preserve species of migratory 
birds considered beneficial or harmless to people.  Since 1916 
Canada and the United States have achieved a remarkable story of 
conservation success.  This act enabled us to end an era of 
severe overexploitation of migratory birds by market hunters and 
nest collectors.  Today together with Mexico our unique 
tri-national partnership is continuing to respond to the changing 
conservation needs of these species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The conservation of habitat is key to the conservation of 
species.  For migratory species like birds, it is essential that 
our countries work together to conserve breeding areas in the 
north, staging and stopover sites along flyways and wintering 
areas in the south.  The North American bird conservation 
initiative ensures we accomplish that goal. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1930"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me tell all members of the House that I had the great 
privilege of being at Last Mountain Lake in Saskatchewan where we 
have the most amazing flyway.  I encourage everyone to take the 
chance to get out there and see the magnificence of our nature 
and the great conservation system that is in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are relying on sound science.  We are identifying bird 
conservation priorities, expanding traditional partnerships and 
working on a co-operative basis, particularly with landowners and 
users, to conserve birds and their habitats.  The foundation of 
this effort is the international migratory bird treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The need to amend the convention has long been recognized, but 
previous efforts were not successful.  The protocol to amend the 
migratory birds convention is the product of extensive 
consultations in Canada and the United States that began early in 
the last decade.  The protocol was negotiated and signed in 1995 
and was formally ratified by Canada and the United States in 
1999.  Its entry into force is an important event. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At their core, the convention amendments are migratory bird 
conservation amendments.  They make more explicit the 
conservation principles underlying the management of these 
continentally shared species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The protocol itself represents the first ever amendments to the 
convention and sends a compelling message that we cherish the 
richness of our shared migratory bird species and their critical 
habitats, that we respect the diverse cultural traditions and the 
subsistence way of life of our aboriginal peoples, and that we 
understand the imperative to expand and strengthen our 
partnerships for responsible conservation and stewardship of 
migratory birds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among its amendments the protocol removes inconsistencies 
between the 1916 migratory birds convention and aboriginal and 
treaty rights protected under section 35 of the Constitution Act, 
1982 by recognizing that aboriginal and treaty rights to harvest 
migratory birds may exist.  It opens year-round hunting 
privileges to qualified non-aboriginal residents of Canada's 
northern communities who depend on a subsistence lifestyle where 
relevant aboriginal agreements permit the activity.  It permits 
an earlier opening date for the fall hunting season in northern 
Canada, allowing more equitable access for qualified northern 
residents.  It recognizes the traditional harvest of murres in 
Newfoundland and Labrador, an activity not recognized in the 
convention which was signed more than three decades before 
Newfoundland joined Canada in Confederation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The need to amend the migratory birds convention has existed 
since the convention was first drafted and was heightened with 
the Constitution Act, 1982.  It must acknowledge the customs, 
traditions and rights of Canada's aboriginal peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The protocol accommodates traditional and customary hunting 
patterns that were not part of the 1916 treaty and brings 
provisions into line with Canada's constitutional obligations to 
our aboriginal peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The migratory birds convention prohibits hunting migratory game 
birds from March 10 to September 1 and all other migratory birds 
year-round.  Migratory birds have left large areas of Yukon, 
Northwest Territories and Nunavut by mid-September and in these 
areas they generally do not return before March 10.  As a 
consequence, much of the traditional harvest of migratory birds 
in the territories has taken place, and continues to take place, 
during the closed season portion of the year, especially in the 
spring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aboriginal and subsistence hunters in Canada want to hunt within 
the law when they take what is often the first meat that is 
available in the spring.  It is an important part of their food 
supply.  Aboriginal and subsistence hunters want to participate 
in managing the birds they share in common. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Active participation by aboriginal hunters and co-management 
councils will help make sure that these important changes to the 
convention are successful both legally and practically, leading 
to substantive improvements in the conservation of waterfowl and 
other migratory birds.  The protocol before the House will do 
this. 
It provides a platform to involve aboriginal people in the 
management of these species.  It will improve efforts to conserve 
migratory birds by allowing sound scientific data and traditional 
and local knowledge to be collected on the spring harvest.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Included in the amendments is the authority for Canada to manage 
the hunt of murres by the people of Newfoundland and Labrador. 
This issue was in need of being addressed since Newfoundland 
joined Confederation in 1949. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Amending the convention has heightened the ability of Canada and 
the United States to manage for sustainable use the migratory 
bird populations of North America.  It contributes to our 
government's “Gathering Strength” initiative aimed at renewing 
our relationship with our aboriginal peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>May I offer my congratulations and the congratulations I am sure 
of the entire House to the team members responsible for bringing 
this important initiative to fruition.  It is a crucial step 
toward protecting wildlife species and their habitats across 
North America and in acknowledging the customs, traditions and 
rights of Canada's aboriginal peoples. 
<P><A NAME="LINK255"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have looked at the Migratory Birds 
Convention Act and the amendments thereto, and I have boiled it 
down to three main messages that I would like to deliver tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first is, basically, that this take note debate tonight and 
the lack of a ratification process in Canada points out the 
inadequacies of our Canadian parliamentary practices and our 
system very clearly.  Here we have a bilateral agreement with the 
United States and essentially this agreement comes into play when 
the U.S. ratifies it through its senate and then through 
presidential signature.  In our case we do not have any checks or 
balances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second major message is that there is another bilateral 
treaty on migratory birds in North America.  It is not the one 
between Canada and the U.S., it is the one between the U.S. and 
Mexico.  That migratory birds convention treaty will have some 
ramifications on the Canada-U.S. treaty.  I think we ought to 
recognize that and talk about it a bit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third message that I have is that the language which Canada 
has chosen to use in dealing with a very important amendment to 
the migratory birds convention, which is a schedule to the 
Migratory Birds Convention Act, that deals with aboriginal issues 
uses open ended language that will lead to open ended issues.  It 
requires better clarity and better language in order to avoid 
creating the problems that will derive because, once again, 
Canada chooses to use a waffle in the language.  It is very 
apparent when we read the U.S. legislation that enables the 
amendment that applies to indigenous peoples' issues in Alaska 
that they have done everything they can to narrowly define their 
terminology, and we have done everything we can to do just the 
opposite.  Those are my three main messages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The migratory birds convention was ratified by the U.S. and 
Canada in 1916.  The parliamentary secretary described quite well 
why that came about.  There were many vanishing species of birds 
as a consequence of things that were happening at the time.  It 
is a pioneering document.  It was an important international 
treaty. 
The main thing it did was to control the hunting of migratory 
birds, primarily by prohibiting hunting during closed seasons.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The other treaty I referred to between Mexico and the U.S. came 
along 20 years later, in 1936.  The Canada-U.S. model was there 
to act as a prototype. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the inception of the migratory birds convention there have 
been problems in the U.S. and Canada where the act or the 
convention has not corresponded with the traditional hunting of 
birds by aboriginal or indigenous peoples and aboriginal people 
have been charged under the Migratory Birds Convention Act.  This 
has been an ongoing conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would be the first ones to agree that amending the migratory 
birds convention, because it is an international treaty, is 
politically and procedurally difficult.  Therefore, there have 
been no amendments to date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since at least the 1975 James Bay and northern Quebec agreement 
the federal government has been promising the aboriginal peoples 
that there would be amendments.  In 1990 the Canadian Wildlife 
Service began meetings with governments, non-governmental 
organizations and aboriginal people.  Finally, in December of 
1995 this led to the U.S. and Canada signing a protocol to amend 
the migratory birds convention to allow traditional hunting by 
aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 the U.S. senate gave its advice and consent.  That is 
what the U.S. senate is for.  It is the elected senate.  The 
President of the United States finally signed the protocol to 
allow its implementation in late 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the Canadian side we had the Minister of Canadian Heritage. 
I am not sure in what capacity she signed that document in 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Paddy Torsney:</B>  She was then Minister of the 
Environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  The Minister of the Environment.  In our 
system there is no check or balance whatsoever.  In our system 
that constitutes ratification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a basic fundamental problem with that, as does the 
opposition.  However, that is the way it is.  Our signature meant 
nothing until 1999 because it was not ratified by the other 
party.  Now that it has been ratified by the other party, our 
signature is taken for granted.  That is a fine way to do 
business.  I am being facetious, of course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The protocol entered into forced when the instruments of 
ratification were exchanged on October 7, 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 a protocol on changes to the Mexico-U.S. migratory birds 
convention was also consented to by the U.S. senate.  That has 
happened along the same timeframe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are debating tonight is basically an amendment to the 
old 1916 migratory birds convention, which is a schedule or an 
appendix to the Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1994.  That is 
what we are talking about.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ours is called the Migratory Birds Convention Act.  The American 
legislation is similar but different.  I think theirs is called 
the migratory birds conservation act, for example.  There 
certainly are major differences in how they deal with aboriginal 
peoples in our case or indigenous peoples in their case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new regulations include a whole new section, section 4, 
which basically talks about harvesting by aboriginal peoples.  It 
says that migratory birds and their eggs “may be harvested 
throughout the year by aboriginal peoples of Canada having 
aboriginal or treaty rights”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It further states that inedible byproducts may be sold but the 
birds and eggs so taken shall be offered for barter, exchange, 
trade or sale only within or between aboriginal communities as 
provided for in the relevant treaties, land claims agreements, 
self-government agreements or co-management agreements made with 
the aboriginal peoples of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is one of the proposed sections in our amendment to the 
Migratory Birds Convention Act.  I just want to point out that 
the old language did not use the term aboriginal.  The old 
language, which is still in the regulations, does not talk about 
aboriginals.  It talks about Indians and defines the word as 
having the same meaning as in the Indian Act.  It talks about 
Inuk and defines it as meaning a person who is a direct 
descendant of a person who is or was of the race of aborigines 
commonly referred to as Eskimos and possesses at least 
one-quarter Inuk blood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very familiar with the Indian Act.  I am very familiar with 
all the definitions surrounding the terms Indian, Inuk, Inuit, 
Metis and several others.  I was unaware until today that 
Canadian documentation anywhere referred to blood quotient, but 
indeed I find it in the regulations attached to the Migratory 
Birds Convention Act when it talks about Inuk.  I was quite 
surprised to see that.  It tends to be an American convention or 
way of doing things.  I had not seen it in Canadian statutes or 
regulations at any time before.  It was a bit of a surprise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At least we have a pretty clear definition in the regulations. 
Where we have a problem now is that this new amendment states 
that migratory birds “may be harvested throughout the year by 
aboriginal peoples of Canada having aboriginal or treaty 
rights”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was probably imported from the constitution because similar 
language is used in section 35.  However, if one wanted to define 
aboriginal it is simply not there.  I looked.  It is not defined 
anywhere in the act or the regulations.  Neither are aboriginal 
rights defined.  We all know what a treaty is.  It either is or 
is not, but aboriginal rights are not defined either.  This is 
totally open ended and I will relate some the ways it is open 
ended.

<A HREF="#LINKT109"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We may have one definition in Canada but we cannot constrain 
this agreement to Canada alone.  This is a bilateral agreement. 
Let us talk about the Nisga'a treaty which we debated at some 
length in this place.  It said that Nisga'a citizens had the 
right to trade or barter among themselves or with other 
aboriginal people any migratory birds harvested under this 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I went to the glossary in the Nisga'a agreement.  There is no 
glossary in the Nisga'a agreement.  I went to the definitions. 
There are definitions in the Nisga'a agreement but they do not 
cover that part of the alphabet or do not cover aboriginal, 
aboriginal rights or aboriginal people.  None of those words were 
defined.  The only thing relied upon in the Nisga'a agreement 
once again is the Indian Act definition of Indian.  That is how 
the Nisga'a define themselves in terms of whether or not they are 
eligible to become Nisga'a citizens.  That does not help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why am I expressing a concern?  One of my concerns is who are 
other aboriginal people.  Are they confined to Canada?  Are they 
confined to British Columbia in this case or are they not?  Is it 
confined to status Indians and Inuit?  Is it confined to status 
or non-status Inuit?  Is it confined to status or non-status 
Metis and Inuit? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not good enough.  Let us look at the American language 
and the following terminology: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The protocol establishes eligibility for the indigenous 
inhabitants of Alaska.  Indigenous inhabitants are defined as 
permanent residents of a village within a subsistence harvest 
area, regardless of race.  Subsistence harvest areas are 
established to include most village areas within the Alaska 
peninsula, Kodiak archipelago, the Aleutian Islands and areas 
north and west of the Alaska range.  Areas that would generally 
not qualify include the Anchorage, Matinooska, Susitnu and 
Fairbanks North Star Burrows, the Quini peninsula roaded area, 
the Gulf of Alaska roaded area and southeast Alaska.  Exceptions 
to these areas can made through a deliberative process which 
includes the management bodies established by the service. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is pretty definitive.  There is a lot of clarity.  Is this 
important?  I believe it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the primary goal of the whole treaty process is 
conservation.  Conservation is achieved most successfully when it 
is rules based and everyone knows what the rules are and to whom 
the rules apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we are now at the point where what was clearly 
aboriginal harvest for domestic use has been expanded by the 
amendment and by the terms of the Nisga'a agreement.  It is 
clearly a new direction to include the sale or possible 
commercial exploitation of migratory birds. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1955"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT110"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any sale of migratory birds will be in accordance with federal 
and provincial laws of general application and with any Nisga'a 
law in respect of the sale of migratory birds harvested under the 
agreement.  Nisga'a citizens have the right to sell inedible 
byproducts including down of migratory birds harvested under the 
agreement.  It does not even constrain that by saying they have 
that right to sell only to other aboriginals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that we do not have a high level of historical 
exploitation, I am suggesting that this could lead in that 
direction.  We ought to be concerned about the clarity of the 
language and the clarity of the language is simply not good 
enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go back a bit to the second major point I want to talk 
about.  The Canada-U.S. treaty is impacted by the Mexico-U.S. 
treaty on migratory birds.  We could look at that plus the fact 
that we want the agreement to deal with conservation of species. 
We also want the agreement to allow for the fact that some 
species listed under the migratory birds convention have become 
pests since 1916 or even since 1985. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Snow geese are one example.  The nesting grounds in the Arctic 
were getting beat up.  They were taking a major hit.  It took 
quite an effort by the federal government to come up with a way 
to get around the constraints of the migratory birds convention 
and allow a targeted hunt of snow geese to prevent the habitat 
destruction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We currently have a similar situation in the middle part of our 
country and the middle part of the U.S.  I spoke with a 
congressman from Minnesota last week who said they have the same 
problem there with cormorants. Cormorants are a listed species. I 
understand one of the reasons has everything to do with the 
reverence attached to blackbirds by the people of Mexico.  That 
kind of got translated into the Canada-U.S. agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be able to deal much more quickly with that issue than 
we have done up till now.  Cormorants are major fish eaters. They 
are cleaning out lake habitats in the spring and summer in the 
prairies and in the mid-west.  They are becoming very much a 
pest.  We need to do something in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the points that I wanted to make.  I very much want to 
say that I think we all agree with the intent of the migratory 
birds convention.  It is the role of the opposition to point out 
some inadequacies.  We have some shortcomings here.  We have some 
inadequacies in the way we have handled this issue. Because these 
agreements are so difficult to amend, when we do it we should do 
it right.  We should clarify our language very precisely.  That 
simply has not happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope we do better next time.  Who knows when the next time 
will be?  There is no doubt that an agreement which dates back to 
1916 has basically stood the test till now.

simply because the world is changing and we are much more attuned 
to the environment that surrounds us.  There is a degree of 
management that has to happen.  Species do require some 
management from time to time.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to the order in council introduced on May 18 to 
amend the schedule to the Migratory Birds Convention Act so as 
to include the Parksville protocol, which amends the 1916 
Migratory Bird Convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's proposal is merely intended to inform us about 
the change which will be made to this legislation.  Members are 
not required to comment in any way on this legislative 
amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like the member for Beauharnois—Salaberry, I find this situation 
unacceptable because I feel it is essential to debate the issue 
of migratory birds today.  I cannot but deplore the fact that 
the House of Commons is not permitted to take a stand with 
respect to international treaties, such as the biosafety 
protocol, which Canada did not sign, despite its fine promises 
in Montreal last winter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The biosafety protocol is based on the concept of prior 
agreement reached with all the facts on the table, so that 
countries will consider the harmful effects that a genetically 
modified organism could have on their biodiversity before 
importing it and introducing it into the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am dismayed to note that the right to ratify international 
agreements is limited to the executive arm, which is peculiar to 
the British parliamentary regime on which our system is based. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be noted that the situation is very different in the 
United States, where the separation of the legislative, 
executive and judicial arms proposed by the French philosopher 
Montesquieu is followed to the letter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now address Bill C-214 introduced by the member for 
Beauharnois—Salaberry, which would correct this situation.  Under 
this bill, the Canadian government could not negotiate or 
conclude a treaty without first consulting provincial 
governments and the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, Bill C-214 would not in any way limit the royal 
prerogative of provincial governments to negotiate and sign 
treaties in an area under provincial jurisdiction.  Bill C-214 
would mean that Canada could not ratify any important treaty 
without the members of this House having first approved that 
treaty by resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The case before us today is the order-in-council amending the 
schedule to the Migratory Birds Convention Act, which constitutes 
an important treaty because its implementation has, among other 
things, brought about the enactment of a federal statute.  Why 
then does this government not want to consult members of 
parliament on this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as was the case for MOX, it is obstinately forging ahead 
without consulting parliamentarians or the population, despite 
the recommendations of the Seaborn report, which stated as 
follows, in subsection 6.2.1.1 that the public must accept the 
plan for importing and stocking nuclear wastes before it is 
implemented.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that, when Canada plans to ratify a treaty, this must 
not be done unless the Minister of Foreign Affairs has first 
tabled the treaty in the House of Commons, with an explanatory 
memorandum concerning the subject matter and the effects of the 
treaty, not later than twenty-one sitting days before it is to be 
ratified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, Canada should not ratify a treaty amending a treaty that 
it has ratified, as is the case today, unless it has notified us 
with an order making it possible to include in its federal 
legislation the amendments to the international agreement that 
has already been in place for some time. The Minister of Foreign 
Affairs should also have first tabled it in the House of Commons, 
not later than twenty-one sitting days before the amending treaty 
is to be ratified, with a note explaining the contents and 
effects of the treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one very important point still to be mentioned. 
The intent of this bill is to fill a democratic gap resulting 
from the lack of real participation by the House of Commons and 
its members in all stages of the conclusion of international 
treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We parliamentarians do not have a very high trust rating with 
the public.  According to a poll taken in 1995 for the magazine 
<I>L'Actualité</I>, 4% of the population had full confidence in us. 
This poll stopped me in my tracks.  At the time, I was not a 
member of parliament, but I was political assistant to the late 
member for Jonquière, André Caron, and I could not imagine such 
a thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation before us today does not improve our image with 
the public.  I would hope that the bill of my colleague, the 
member for Beauharnois—Salaberry, will be passed thus correcting 
the current situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing is sure.  The government could have arranged for the 
provinces and the House of Commons to have a say on this piece 
of legislation.  We must not forget that the federal government 
asked the provinces to decide on the coming into force of the 
free trade agreement with the United States in the 1980s.  Doing 
the same with the order amending the schedule to the Migratory 
Birds Convention Act would not have set a precedent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that I have concluded these few introductory remarks, I will 
focus more specifically on the government's motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the beginning of the century, in 1916, Canada and the United 
States recognized the need to protect certain common species of 
migratory birds. They signed an international agreement to 
protect those migratory birds considered useful or harmless to 
humanity.  For almost 80 years, the 1916 Migratory Bird 
Convention provided the framework for the conservation of 
populations of migratory birds common to both the United States 
and Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994, the Canadian parliament introduced the Migratory Bird 
Convention Act, paving the way for tougher legislation to better 
protect migratory species.  This legislation is administered by 
the Department of the Environment's Canadian Wildlife Service in 
co-operation with the governments of the provinces and 
territories.  In fact, the provinces are responsible for 
enforcing the legislation. It is the provinces who are in a 
position to keep an eye on the public.

<A HREF="#LINKT113"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the enforcement and administration of this legislation 
in Quebec, the Government of Quebec was able, in April 1996, to 
hand out an initial important sentence in a case where the former 
owner of an outfitting operation was fined for using bait to hunt 
ducks, which is contrary to the regulations under the Migratory 
Bird Convention.  Quebec is thus doing its job under the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, certain species seen as harmful at the beginning of the 
century, and subsequently left unprotected, are now recognized as 
important to the environment and to our ecosystems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, the guidelines set down at the beginning of the 
century are no longer completely consistent with today's reality. 
Increasingly, there is agreement that effective protection of 
species is not possible if we do not take into account all the 
factors that affect them, such as their habitats.  Close and 
ongoing co-operation is essential between the various levels of 
government involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will, if I may, quote from the report by the Commissioner of 
the Environment and Sustainable Development tabled this morning 
in the House, which says, and I quote “—the shared nature of 
environmental jurisdiction requires close co-operation between 
federal, provincial and territorial governments”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is sad to see this increasingly centralizing attitude on the 
part of government members regarding environmental issues. 
Instead of working with the provinces, the federal government 
ignores their specificity and comes up with new programs or acts 
that encroach on their jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Migratory birds know no borders. Therefore, it is important to 
legislate at the international level. The protection of 
migratory species comes under federal jurisdiction, while the 
protection of their habitats is a provincial responsibility. 
This is why it is important to have sound agreements between the 
provinces and also adequate provincial laws. We do not question 
that reality, but we have a right to expect that much from the 
federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Still, as I said before, what upsets me about the Migratory 
Birds Convention Act is not the need for international 
agreements on the protection of migratory birds, but the way the 
negotiation, signing and ratification of international 
agreements are conducted in Canada. That approach is seriously 
flawed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel as though we are back in the 19th century, when it was 
common to sign bilateral agreements, including mutual defence 
agreements, in absolute secrecy. How can parliamentarians fulfil 
their responsibilities if the executive branch does not allow 
them to do so? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind members of the executive branch that they do not enjoy 
more public legitimacy than I do. They were elected, just like 
me, as parliamentarians and, if they hold a cabinet post, it is 
simply because the Prime Minister decided so, not because they 
were mandated by the public. 
But the public should be aware of our frustration as 
parliamentarians when we cannot express our support for or 
opposition to a treaty ratified by the executive branch. The 
public might wonder, and rightly so, what we are doing here. 
What is the point of going to the polls if members of parliament 
only enjoy limited power? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these questions remain unanswered with the government's 
proposal before us.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
want to start off by saying that the migratory birds convention 
in North America has a history dating back to 1916. The 
amendments that are taking place today are probably long overdue 
in terms of the relationship this country and the nation to the 
south of us called the United States have with aboriginal people. 
It would be more clearly rectified on the rights and the 
privileges that the indigenous populations have here in this 
country and this continent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We sit in the House of Commons.  The original protocol was 
signed in 1916 and was between the United Kingdom and the United 
States of America, which brings us back to recognize that Canada 
at the time was a colony of Britain.  Under these perspectives I 
draw to the attention of the House that the indigenous and 
aboriginal peoples of this country should have been dearly 
respected right from the creation of this country as opposed to 
being marginalized by an Indian Act, by the crown defining who is 
an aboriginal person, who is an Indian child, or who is an Indian 
mother. All these terminologies are a grave mistake. To correct 
and update the migratory birds convention to May 30, 2000 is what 
we are debating in the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to draw to the attention of the hon. member who 
spoke on behalf of the opposition that we do not share some of 
these views.  The views may change in light of respecting one's 
place and one's rights, Canada being a country which is part of 
North America. I wanted to jump up and say something at one point 
in time here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are dealing with the migratory birds convention and luckily 
so.  Ducks may fly high enough that we do not get them all when 
we are harvesting or hunting, but we should have had a migratory 
bison convention.  The buffalo were wreaked to the point of 
extinction on this continent for the mere purpose of 
marginalizing the dependency of aboriginal people. It is truly a 
travesty in our history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bison should still be roaming free on the prairies and plains 
but we did not have regulatory systems. There were no regulatory 
systems because they wanted to make the indigenous population 
dependent on the newcomers and their new foods.  An independent 
nation or an independent people would be a lot freer to negotiate 
their way into this constitution or to any other constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time in the year 2000, we now have a government that is 
willing to negotiate on behalf of the aboriginal people of this 
country, to negotiate with another country a rightful place for 
harvesting for food and sustenance, and down to protect ourselves 
from the winter cold.  Down comforters are probably the best way 
to fight off the winter cold no matter where we live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The snow goose and the cormorant are two contentious issues.  I 
have never heard that the U.S. and Mexico migratory birds 
convention deals with cormorants as a recognized black duck.  I 
call them Daffy Ducks because that is what they look like when 
they fly by. 
They do wreak havoc in the fishing population in our northern 
lakes and northern states.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The culling of the snow goose may have been too reactionary.  I 
believe a proper harvest could have been planned without being 
detrimental to its habitat as was highlighted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a need for an international convention and that is what 
this is. The protocol that was negotiated after some public 
consultations brought forward three provisions:  to provide 
year-round access to migratory birds for food by qualified 
non-aboriginal residents of northern Canada living in a 
subsistent lifestyle; to allow for earlier opening of the fall 
hunting seasons for residents of the northern territories; to 
enable partnerships to be developed for migratory bird 
conservation and provide a mechanism for input by aboriginal 
communities into the continental management regime for migratory 
birds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the major components of the protocol.  A specific 
convention in this protocol states to be aware that changes to 
the convention are required to ensure conformity with the 
aboriginal and treaty rights of aboriginal peoples of Canada.  As 
I mentioned, this is a long overdue amendment.  It can be found 
in subsection 4, “In the case of Canada, subject to existing 
aboriginal treaty rights of aboriginal peoples of Canada under 
section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982, and the regulatory and 
conservation regimes defined in the relevant treaties, land claim 
agreements, self-government agreements and co-management 
agreements with aboriginal peoples of Canada”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this language is required today because there has been an 
evolution of different terminologies, different arrangements and 
also court decisions.  I would also like to challenge the present 
environment minister to have a legal grasp of some of the recent 
decisions being made and to acquire an up to date knowledge on 
the matters of aboriginal rights and treaty rights that have been 
brought down by supreme courts and lower courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other point I would like to raise is the signature at the 
bottom of the protocol.  As we all know, in 1995 the then 
Minister of the Environment signed this protocol. We also have a 
history of some other protocols and agreements that the 
government has signed, one of them being on MMT.  The hon. former 
Minister of the Environment had signed this agreement recognizing 
the international concern of MMT and banning the interprovincial 
trade of MMT as an additive in this country. Now the government 
has reversed its perspective on MMT.  It has signed off, paying 
off the MMT Ethyl Corporation and has now sanctioned MMT as a 
fuel additive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would just like to stay on the record of the government for 
the time being. There might be differing opinions of our minister 
or some international criticisms that come his way.  I just want 
to share this one with the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently an esteemed environmental guest visited our country. 
Robert Kennedy Jr. was here on the Hill speaking on issues of 
concern.  He is an internationally respected and recognized 
conservationist.  Upon reflection our minister stated that Mr. 
Kennedy should have perhaps thought about politicking and failed 
to understand the constitutional division of Ottawa's powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our environment minister had high hopes of improving the 
environmental standards and the reputation of Canada.  I say to 
the House that a lot of improvement is required in the present 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current federal government has had a lengthy record since 
1993 of signing protocols and then not following through with its 
international commitments.  This has been an embarrassment to 
Canada's once noble and honourable reputation on the 
international environment stage.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government's limited effort to meet our limited protocol 
requirements is proven by the increase in our targets and our 
lack of hitting these targets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the government's refusal to sign the Basel 
convention side bar agreement to ban toxic waste shipments to the 
developing world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the government's continual refusal to appoint a new 
ambassador for the environment, who plays a major leadership role 
in negotiating international protocols.  The new ambassador of 
the environment should be named immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That role is needed now for a protocol such as the precautionary 
principle.  It was needed in the POPs protocol at a recent 
meeting in Bonn, Germany.  The persistent organic pollutants 
treaty is an international United Nations protocol yet Canada 
neglected to follow its Rio protocol to which we are all 
signatories.  Domestic law has included the precautionary 
principle but it is rarely followed in our country.  The list 
continues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We welcome this protocol to the Migratory Birds Convention Act. 
It is a much needed amendment to bring us to the point of 
recognizing aboriginal rights in dealing with migratory birds. 
But do we believe in our hearts that the government can ensure 
the commitments and timetables can be met? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are commitments here that our country would stand by 
protecting the habitat. If pollutants have infiltrated the 
migratory birds' habitats, would our country uphold these 
obligations to stop polluting the habitats?  The government has 
not recognized and has not been able to enforce the adequate 
habitat protection commitment.  It is weak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also highlighted in terms of the new legislation being 
debated in Canada now, the endangered species legislation. If the 
Americans are listening, we do not have an endangered species act 
in this country.  Many Americans may be surprised to hear this 
since they have had theirs for many decades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our American neighbours would be more surprised to learn that 
specific recommendations of endangered species listings would be 
political as opposed to scientific decisions.  If an endangered 
migratory bird flew from a rock on federal land and landed on a 
field outside federal land, it could be shot.  These issues have 
to be resolved here in this country and by a government that has 
the will and the resources to enforce these protocols and 
regulations and the protocols we have with other nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to an issue that is dear to our community, I just 
came back from my constituency.  Many residents back home, my 
father included, for years have harvested duck eggs. Little did 
we know it was illegal.  He is a Metis person and all his life he 
has been illegally harvesting eggs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Birds are a good source of nutrition.  Ducks are usually saved 
in the spring because they provide young ones.  Nowadays a lot of 
hunters will not select a duck arriving in the spring because it 
comes from polluted areas down south.  They prefer a cleaner duck 
that has been hatched and is ready to fly south in the fall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Migratory Birds Convention Act is certainly a much needed 
protocol between two countries to save the species.  At this time 
this amendment has corrected the wrong by our country in 
overlooking aboriginal rights to harvest migratory birds, giving 
special preference to northern locations where the hunting and 
harvesting seasons might be different from those in the south. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time, I congratulate the former Minister of the 
Environment for boldly negotiating an issue that is really needed 
at this time.  I also caution some of the hon. members who have 
raised a concern about specific rights, privileges and 
definitions.  This continually requires a whole new will from the 
government and the House to find a rightful place for the 
indigenous and aboriginal peoples in the government, this 
parliament and the legislatures of this country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as a 
blue heron it gives me great pride to participate in the debate 
this evening concerning migratory birds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will come as a surprise to no one that what we are talking 
about this evening is an act about protecting and maintaining the 
populations of birds of a migratory nature between Canada and the 
United States.  This is an environmental initiative and I know, 
being the knowledgeable man that you are, Mr. Speaker, that it 
comes as no surprise whatsoever that this environmental 
initiative was brought forward by the Conservative Party of 
Sir Robert Borden when he was the prime minister of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the true essence of the word conservative, he was a 
conservationist of the finest kind before we even thought about 
having an environment minister.  It was because of that kind of 
leadership that was brought forth by perhaps one of Canada's 
greatest prime ministers that his legacy remains and the act 
remains on which we are having the opportunity to speak in this place 
this evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This convention was a response to a drastic decline in migratory 
bird populations in the early 1900s.  The legislation was the 
first legislative effort designed to regulate hunting, prevent 
trafficking and control the uses of migratory birds through 
permits.  It also created migratory bird sanctuaries that were 
intended to control and manage areas important for the protection 
of migratory birds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Behind the legislative framework between the United States and 
Canada, I would like to take this opportunity to point out the 
many private citizens who reside in the United States and indeed 
within the borders of this great country, Canada, who have taken 
it upon themselves to maintain wetlands for migratory species. 
The organization I am speaking about, which I am quite sure 
members are familiar with, is Ducks Unlimited.  I have witnessed 
the preservation activities of the DU groups in the wetlands of 
Fundy—Royal and throughout Atlantic Canada.  More money is 
raised for the preservation of wetlands on a per capita basis for 
Ducks Unlimited in Atlantic Canada than in any other region in 
North America.  That initiative is fundamentally critical 
because, from a wetlands and waterfowl perspective, Atlantic 
Canada is one of the most critical migratory habitats that 
exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, weaknesses in the convention such as the lack of 
protection of habitat led to the call for strong endangered 
species legislation.  We now are debating the initiative brought 
forth by the government known as the species at risk act, Bill 
C-33, which is intended to help maintain the biodiversity legacy 
that we wish to leave to future generations. My primary analysis 
of the bill is that it dovetails with the Migratory Birds 
Convention Act quite importantly.  The issue we are concerned 
about primarily is the fact that the species at risk act is 
perhaps too discretionary in nature.

<A HREF="#LINKT118"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our first objection to Bill C-33 is that the very listing of 
whether a species is at risk is a matter of political choice and 
not merely that of science. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly the Progressive Conservative Party understands that the 
listing of a species, and the habitat restoration perspective, is 
that we must take into account social and economic implications 
as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Paddy Torsney:</B>  Let's talk about the Migratory Birds 
Convention Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  The parliamentary secretary, once in a 
while, gets a little concerned when we criticize a particular 
piece of legislation that is part of the framework.  The 
Migratory Birds Convention Act and the species at risk bill are 
critical pieces of legislation in the overall framework.  We only 
have to refer to the position paper of the Minister of the 
Environment released at the Calgary zoo.  He referenced that act 
when he brought forth his species at risk bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is indeed very relevant to speak about both pieces of 
legislation, and I am sure there have been other speakers who 
have referenced both pieces of legislation this evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our concern is that there are not enough financial incentives, 
not enough carrots, and there is too much emphasis on sticks. 
The carrots are needed to help the stewards of this land.  The 
best stewards of this land for quite some time have been the 
farmers and the woodlot owners.  They have been the best stewards 
at maintaining species at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether it is a migratory bird which is of concern or whether it 
is another species, it is critical that we have legislation that 
works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cite this example to illustrate my point.  Because the 
burrowing owl is not deemed to be a migratory bird, it does not 
have the same protection as a bird that might be migratory in 
nature, such as a blue heron. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fundamental for us to maintain the biodiversity of the 
country and for us to have strong species at risk legislation as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the parliamentary secretary is listening so intently, I 
want to reiterate where this species at risk legislation is at 
fault.  Listing is a matter of political choice, not of science. 
The protection of habitat is discretionary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Habitat loss represents 80% of the reason a species becomes at 
risk in the first place.  The species at risk bill does not 
necessarily make habitat protection mandatory for a listed 
species.  That is part and parcel of why this bill, if it becomes 
an act, would not work.  It does not have the financial levers or 
incentives to help the stewards of our land, our farmers and 
woodlot owners, to maintain those good practices which are 
required to protect species that are endangered in Canada, 
whether they are migratory in nature or whether they are a 
species maintained within our own borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it was healthy to have a chance to speak about this 
pioneering piece of legislation, which was founded long before we 
ever thought we would have a Department of the Environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative government of Sir Robert Borden recognized the 
fact that it was imperative that we conserve the biodiversity of 
the country.  The fact that we are speaking about that 
Conservative prime minister's legacy in the House is indeed a 
pleasure.  I reiterate that we need to have a species at risk act 
which is strong and effective, which does not penalize our 
farmers and woodlot owners, so that it will complement, dovetail 
and support the initiatives that first began in 1916, which we 
are discussing here tonight.

for you to attend our Tory Tuesday activities in West Block after 
you finish your activities here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Paddy Torsney:</B>  Was that for me too? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  If I may, I think the Progressive 
Conservative Party wants to build a broad coalition.  We have 
always been successful when we have invited a number of 
individuals to actually form coalitions, whether it was the 
Cartier and Macdonald coalition, the coalition that Robert Borden 
of whom we spoke today formed during wartime leadership, the 
coalition that Diefenbaker formed with the Union Nationale, or 
the coalition that was formed by the Conservative government of 
1984 and 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to invite the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of the Environment and the Speaker tonight—I am not 
sure if he is independent.  I know he will soon be a provincial 
Tory and I wish him all the best in that election—to our Tory Tuesday 
activities.
