Agri-Food, Lib.)</B> moved that the bill be concurred in.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to.)
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock (for the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food)</B> 
moved that the bill be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as members 
prepare to give Bill C-75, an act to amend the Farm 
Improvement and Marketing Co-Operatives Loans Act, or as we 
refer to it in the abbreviated form of FIMCLA, consideration for 
third reading, I would like to review some of the reasons we are 
anxious to have the bill passed into law as soon as possible.
<P>
	FIMCLA is designed to increase the availability of credit on 
reasonable terms to farmers and farmer owned co-operatives. 
Farmers can borrow up to $250,000 to invest in new technology 
and equipment or for a wide range of farm improvement 
projects. Farmer owned co-operatives can get loans up to $3 
million to invest in facilities to add value to their farm products, 
for example the washing or packing plants for vegetables, fruit 
juice plants or many other applications.
<P>
	These loans to co-ops must be approved by the Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food. This is the only national loan 
guarantee program that can be accessed by farmers across 
Canada. Like other business sectors, the farm economy goes 
through cycles and changing credit conditions. Loan guarantees 
are an important tool that governments can use to ensure that 
credit is readily available to viable farm enterprises throughout 
the business cycle.
<P>
	Bill C-75 will change only one clause in the act. That is the 
raising of the total amount of loans which can be guaranteed 
under FIMCLA over a five-year period of time from $1.5 billion 
to $3 billion. If this amendment is not passed we will soon reach 
the loan cap and we will have to suspend the program possibly 
for as long as two years. We have almost reached the point of 
having to suspend the program already it is so successful.
<P>
	The Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food should give 
lenders 60 days notice if it will not be able to guarantee loans 
under the program. Since we expect to reach the present 
guarantee limit of $1.5 billion by the end of July, it is imperative 
that the legislation be passed as quickly as possible. Clearly, we 
do not want to reach the point of having to suspend the program.
<P>
	The Farm Improvement and Co-Operatives Loans Act 
program is very popular. It is becoming more so every year. 
Over the last five years the number of loans registered under the 
program has more than tripled, from about 4,890 loans in the 
year 1990-91 to over 18,000 loans in the year 1994-95. The 
value of those loans has climbed from just under $82 million in 
the year 1990-91 to $515 million of loans that have been 
guaranteed in the year 1994-95.
<P>
	We expect the activity for this year to reach $550 million. 
That will bring the five-year aggregate to the $1.5 billion level. 
With the current level of approvals, it should stay there for the 
next few years. At that level, a $3 billion cap will allow us to 
continue offering the program.
<P>
	We attribute the increased loan activity to a number of 
factors: sustained lower interest rates and an improved farm 
debt situation, not as improved as we would like to see it but it 
certainly has improved from where it was in the past; greater 
participation by independent rural lenders; improved marketing 
of the program; and increased competition between lending 
institutions.
<P>
	I would like to expand for a moment on the point about 
increased participation of rural lenders. In the early 1990s the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13164"> 13164 </A></B>
<P>
department began to encourage credit unions and caisses 
populaires to make the program more available to their 
customers. This has resulted in the addition of about 600 new 
designated lenders across the country. Besides adding more 
outlets for getting FIMCLA loans, this marketing change has 
also generated more competition between institutions for loans, 
all to the benefit of the borrowers, being the co-ops and the 
farmers themselves.
<P>
<B>(1010 ) </B>
<P>
	I said that the program had become more popular recently. 
Quebec and Alberta are the sources of most of the new growth. 
In Quebec we can thank the caisses populaires Desjardins. That 
movement has become a major participant. We can credit it for 
the rapid growth of loans in Quebec under FIMCLA. Quebec has 
now the third highest number of loans.
<P>
	Just ahead of Quebec is Alberta which has the second highest 
number of loans. In that province the government owned Alberta 
Treasury Branches has become a significant lender under 
FIMCLA Saskatchewan. However, it is still the biggest user of 
the program. In 1994-95 that province accounted for roughly 
half of all the registered loans.
<P>
	FIMCLA has proven to be a very inexpensive way for the 
government to support the agri-food sector. Over 30 years, costs 
have averaged over just $1 million a year, roughly 1 per cent of 
annual loans. Over the past three years the program has returned 
$6.3 million to the consolidated revenue fund.
<P>
	In order to reduce the program costs even further, we will be 
increasing the registration fee by a small amount, one quarter of 
1 per cent. This will raise the average registration fee by $67. It 
will now become $202 on average. Still, we must agree it is a 
very reasonable cost to provide such a guarantee and program to 
the co-operative movement and to the primary producers, the 
Canadian farmers. Had this fee level been in place over the past 
30 years, net costs would have averaged $434,000 a year instead 
of $1 million.
<P>
	To allay the concerns that the government's 95 per cent 
guarantee is actually a subsidy to lenders, I should point out that 
the net losses under FIMCLA have historically been lower than 
the losses lenders have incurred on loans guaranteed outside the 
program. We are certainly proud in the agri-food industry that 
those losses are at less than 1 per cent. That is a tremendous 
record and one which the agri-food industry should be and is 
proud of.
<P>
	The program and the amendments have the support of the 
major farm groups and the commercial lenders across Canada. I 
urge members on both sides of the House to support quick 
passage of Bill C-75 so that there is no disruption in the program 
for the agri-food industry in Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
with pleasure that I rise this morning to participate in the debate 
on Bill C-75 at third reading.
<P>
	As we said earlier, the purpose of the only amendment to the 
Farm Improvement and Marketing Cooperatives Loans Act is to 
double the number of loans guaranteed under this act.
<P>
	As the parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Agriculture 
and Agri-Food explained so well, this change simply increases 
the limit of guarantees on loans made by banking institutions. 
The current limit is $1.5 billion. Bill C-75 would increase this 
limit to $3 billion.
<P>
	This increase is said to be in line with the increased needs of 
many farmers and would facilitate access to financing.
<P>
	Our position on Bill C-75 has not changed. To benefit our 
farmers and make their lives easier, we in the Bloc Quebecois 
will support the amendment proposed by Bill C-75. We 
therefore endorse raising the limit from $1.5 billion to $3 
billion.
<P>
	However, I wish to point out that, although we support Bill 
C-75 for our farmers' sake, this short term solution is not the 
one favoured by the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	In the current federalist context, the provinces face the 
``mission impossible'' of obtaining even a minimal degree of 
autonomy from the federal government, which is trying to take 
one power after another away from the provinces through its 
spending power. That is why we must support this temporary 
solution, to allow the government to go forward with Bill C-75 
so that farmers in Canada and Quebec can have access to more 
funds, of course.
<P>
	Although this is a fundamental aspect, I want to draw your 
attention to the duplication bills such as this one generate. The 
real question we should ask this morning is not whether the limit 
established by the Farm Improvement and Marketing 
Cooperatives Loans Act is high enough, but whether the 
program itself is basically sound.
<P>
	According to Agriculture Canada figures, the increased 
demand for loan guarantees justifies the amendment proposed 
by Bill C-75. Farmers must, of course, have access to financing 
in order to improve or expand their facilities. We are not 
questioning this fact. The question we must ask this morning is, 
``What is the most efficient way to meet farmers' needs?''
<P>
	In Quebec at the present time, there are three organizations 
that help farmers secure financing or can do so. There is the 
Société de financement agricole, which is under provincial 
jurisdiction, the Farm Credit Corporation, under federal 
jurisdiction, and the bill before us today, to amend the Farm 
improvement and Marketing Cooperatives Loans Act, the latter 
also coming under federal jurisdiction.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13165"> 13165 </A></B>
<P>
	This is a fine example of this government's and this country's 
mismanagement. You have two different wickets at the same 
level of government offering loans to the same group of people.
<P>
	Let me share with you what three farm producers from the 
federal electoral district of Frontenac told me when I had the 
chance to visit them a while ago. One of them described the 
problems he encountered trying to get funding to expand his 
family farm.
<P>
	I phoned him this morning and took a few notes, because I 
wanted to be able to quote specific figures. I asked him if he was 
aware of the three choices he had. And that, I must point out, 
contradicts what my colleague, the parliamentary secretary to 
the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, said a moment ago. 
He told me he was aware of only two sources of funding: the 
Société de financement agricole and the Farm Credit 
Corporation.
<P>
	I said: ``There is a third one, you know'', and I gave him the 
seven or eight letter acronym. ``Pardon my ignorance, he said, 
but I had never heard of this Farm Improvement and Marketing 
Cooperatives Loans Act until 8:20 this morning, when you told 
me about it''. And this is a farm producer who had been 
negotiating with both the Société de financement agricole and 
the Farm Credit Corporation for five long months, from 
December to May. This is a good example of duplication.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	If this government wishes our farm producers well, why does 
it not have a single wicket? At present, there are three choices, 
three wickets, and the third one, which we are debating this 
morning, is all but unknown to Quebecer producers. To decide 
whether to borrow from the Quebec Société de financement 
agricole or the federal Farm Credit Corporation, in many 
instances, our producers must set out on long and difficult 
consultations with financial institutions to make sure they get 
the best deal possible.
<P>
	I asked that farmer: in the end, did you go to the Farm Credit 
Corporation or the Société de financement agricole? The Liberal 
members opposite, who are supposed to represent farmers from 
the Pacific to the Atlantic, should listen carefully. That person 
said that the best option for him was to go to the Société de 
financement agricole, which is under Quebec's jurisdiction.
<P>
	I was happy to hear that, and I asked him how he came to that 
conclusion. It is not because he is a PQ or BQ partisan. He made 
that decision simply because it was the best option. He told me 
about contacting other lending institutions, namely the Royal 
Bank, the National Bank and the caisses populaires, and how he 
managed to get for his $750,000 loan a rate which is 0.75 per 
cent lower.
<P>
	I am proud to say that our farmers have now become 
businesspeople running small businesses requiring investments 
which are often in excess of one million dollars. Consequently, 
they have to do some calculations,  to think carefully and to 
choose the option best suited to their needs. This morning, that 
farmer also told me that this 0.75 per cent lower interest rate 
would result in annual savings of $6,000 to $7,500. He added 
that, by using these savings to lower the borrowed capital, he 
will, over the next 25 years, save an enormous amount of money, 
which is in the six figures.
<P>
	This is the story of a farmer who talked to me this morning 
about these three borrowing options, one of which he was not at 
all aware of. I fail to see why the government is so intent on 
duplicating existing structures, with the result that in the same 
city and region there are two offices to deal with the same group 
of farmers.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	Another friend of mine, who is involved in the dairy industry, 
said, in reference to the 50/50 split between industrial and fluid 
milk, that dairy producers were privileged in that they have two 
ministers of agriculture. One, whom they do not know, does not 
understand them and looks after two teats-that is, those which 
give the industrial milk-and the other one, whom they know 
very well, Marcel Landry, the Quebec minister of agriculture, 
who is a Quebecer like them, who is accessible, who can be 
reached any day, who understands them, and who visits them not 
just once a year, but whenever they want to see him.
<P>
	Can the same be said of the federal Minister of Agriculture? 
Unfortunately, he never has time for people from Quebec, but he 
always manages to make time for western grain producers. It 
sounds a little like the Supreme Court, this tendency to favour to 
the West.
<P>
	I agree that these three agencies-the Société du financement 
agricole, the Farm Credit Corporation and the FIMCLA we are 
discussing this morning in this debate on Bill C-75-offer 
programs that differ in a number of respects, so they do not 
interfere with each other. That is the impression we get initially. 
However, if we take a closer look, we soon realize that farm 
producers would be better served if all these programs could be 
accessed in a single location. It would be much more efficient to 
have programs that are complementary but with the same 
requirements, than to face filling out three different applications 
because the criteria are not the same.
<P>
	If for instance the Société de financement agricole had access 
to the resources of the two other agencies, it could offer new 
programs. The SFA could become a single wicket centre. For 
years, the federal government has made a habit of making 
certain programs unnecessarily complex and in some cases 
almost inaccessible. A good example in Quebec is manpower 
training, where we are losing $265 million because two levels of 
government are involved. And even worse, our people do not get 
full value for the money that goes into these programs. There is a 
lot of interfering and shoving, and the neediest members of our 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13166"> 13166 </A></B>
<P>
society end up having to pay for this  exercise in futility. Need I 
repeat that manpower training is a provincial matter.
<P>
	In fact, a province like Quebec, may decide to set criteria that 
are not compatible with what the federal government has 
decided to do. These criteria may be better adapted to the 
province's needs and current situation but not fit into the federal 
mould.
<P>
	Let us assume that in Quebec, the Société du financement 
agricole has standards that are stricter than those of the 
FIMCLA referred to in Bill C-75. By setting up parallel 
programs, the federal government would undermine what the 
provincial government is doing, in this case the Government of 
Quebec, and if the province's objective is part of a strategy to 
develop the agricultural industry, that is just too bad.
<P>
	Let us assume that the SFA wanted to do something about the 
alarming increase in farm debt by adopting certain criteria.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	But it would not really be free to implement its decisions, 
because some federal agency would come along and decide that 
this would conflict with its priorities. Period. Once again, the 
federal government, with its unlimited power to spend, has the 
bigger end of the stick. To hell with the deficit. In 1970, this 
country was almost deficitless. And now, 25 years later, it is 
saddled with an accumulated deficit of over $550 billion, and 
need I remind you of the unpleasant fact that, during those 25 
years, with the exception of the nine year Conservative reign, 
this country has been governed by the Liberals.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, BQ):</B> Two 
and two make four.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> In this case, apparently two and 
two makes four and a little more, it would seem. And now, I will 
open a chapter which will again be unpleasant for some of the 
hon. members opposite. The government of Quebec has decided 
to launch an investigation into the mismanagement of the crown 
corporation Hydro Québec. I must say that, when I was a teen, 
Hydro Québec was the pride and joy of all Quebecers.
<P>
	Unfortunately, today, public satisfaction with this crown 
corporation of which we were so proud 20 or 25 years ago has 
sagged so low that obviously it has almost become a source of 
public shame. But, the government of Quebec was not afraid to 
launch an investigation. I ask my dear colleagues across the way 
why they refused to launch an inquiry into the attempted 
privatization of the Pearson Airport, from which, as everybody 
knows, the big wheels of Canadian finance made hundreds of 
millions? Why are you refusing to hold an independent 
investigation?
<P>
	Because, my friends, the Conservative majority in the Senate 
overrode you on this issue. So, who will conduct the 
investigation now? Four Conservative and three Liberal 
senators. Of course, I have complete confidence in our senators. 
The Prime Minister just appointed Mrs. Bacon to the Senate. I 
have complete confidence, it goes without saying, that 
everything will be conducted above board and with the 
transparency that we should rightfully expect.
<P>
	But, in Quebec, these people would not be selected to carry 
out such a task. Quebec will select truly independent 
investigators, who will probe the real wounds. If the wounds are 
infected, they will be lanced, and the infection will be drained 
off. I invite my Liberal colleagues opposite to reconsider their 
decision. If you are blameless, my friends, you have no reason to 
be afraid. Establish a royal commission of inquiry into the 
privatization of the Pearson airport. It would appear, however, 
that both parties, blue and red, are equally involved in this 
privatization. The numbers would appear to be the same on both 
sides, and, of course, they are. The situation is a bit like what 
happens with the leaves at this time of the year. When the wind 
blows, they turn over and their colour changes. When the blues 
are close to power, they change colour; when the reds are, they 
change colour too.
<P>
	If the party that is currently running the country is blameless, 
it has nothing to fear. Let it establish a commission of inquiry, 
following the government of Quebec's proper lead.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	To come back to Bill C-75, the federal government's entry 
criteria are not always what the provinces want. Federal 
agencies can therefore end up competing with provincial 
agencies, which may have different criteria.
<P>
	Here again, rather than eliminate overlap and give the 
provinces what is rightly theirs, the federal government is 
insisting on keeping everything for itself.
<P>
	By keeping the overlap, the federal government reserves the 
opportunity to intervene in the way we manage our agricultural 
sector in Quebec.
<P>
	It is very odd, I must point out, for the department to 
administer this legislation rather than the Farm Credit 
Corporation. Although the programs differ, the Farm Credit 
Corporation already guarantees loans. This, I repeat, is another 
striking example of administrative duplication. We are not 
talking any more just of duplication among different 
governments but duplication within in a single government.
<P>
	With this duplication, the deficit continues to grow. When we 
reach the point of paying $40 billion a year just to cover the 
interest costs of the debt, and the deficit is likely to reach $25 or 
$26 billion, we are entitled to question previous 
administrations.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13167"> 13167 </A></B>
<P>
	When I was the mayor of my small community before 
entering federal politics the government of Quebec, which 
governs municipalities, forced us to balance our budget every 
year, and I am grateful to the government for that.
<P>
	A municipality is not allowed to have a deficit, but it can have 
a surplus. So in the beautiful municipality of Garthby, where I 
was the mayor, every year we had a nice little surplus. People 
were happy, and told us they were proud of their town council.
<P>
	My colleague of Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, behind me, 
was also the mayor of his municipality for a number of years. He 
understands very well what I am talking about.
<P>
	However, if you want a surplus you must do what you have to 
do for it. When it was time to say no, we said no, and when it was 
time to increase taxes, we did so. I would never have taken a 
mortgage on my house to buy food for my family. No one can 
afford the luxury of borrowing week after week to buy food. Yet, 
that is what my colleagues across the way are doing. Even worst, 
the Trudeau government did not know how to count. 
Unfortunately, the Conservatives were in power for nine years. 
They wanted to make up for lost time, and we did not stop them.
<P>
	I was saying that municipalities have an obligation to present 
balanced budgets. Maybe the government should also consider 
passing a law which would force it to table balanced budgets. 
Since to have enough you must have a little more, municipalities 
used to set property taxes a little higher than they normally 
would, in order to have a little 1 or 2 per cent surplus, which is 
quite reasonable.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	Consequently, we are not opposed to the amendments put 
forward in Bill C-75. However, we object strongly to 
maintaining overlap and duplication, whether they are in the 
federal government, in the federal machine, or between federal 
and provincial jurisdictions.
<P>
	A moment ago, I spoke of the existence of two departments of 
agricultre for the dairy industry, one for industrial milk, and one 
in the government of Quebec for fluid milk. It does not make 
sense.
<P>
	In closing, I can assure my colleague, the parliamentary 
secretary to the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-food, that 
despite all these small flaws, we will vote in favour of this bill at 
third reading. This will accelerate the process. Yet, we will do so 
without much enthusiasm, because it is not in the interests of our 
farmers, in the long term. In the short term, it is not that bad.
<P>
	I extend an invitation to my colleague, the parliamentary 
secretary, to visit Quebec. His is probably not as busy as his 
boss, and he could come to explain this bill. For my part, I will 
explain it to the farmers of my riding. They do not know very 
much about this measure. Is is incredible how often we have to 
explain to our  constituents measures that are taken by the 
federal government, but that people are totally unaware of, 
especially in agriculture.
<P>
	I spent a week in my riding, and when I meet farmers in my 
capacity as agriculture critic, which I have been for seven 
months now, I like to ask this trivia question: ``Who is the 
Minister of Agriculture in Ottawa?'' Only rarely do I get the 
right answer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> There is 
none.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> According to my colleague from 
Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, there is none. He is not 
totally wrong, because in Quebec, our Minister of Agriculture is 
Marcel Landry. It is Marcel Landry, and not the Minister of 
Agriculture whose name I will not tell, because the House of 
Commons Standing Orders prevent me from doing so. 
Therefore, I am not contributing to his promotion in Quebec.
<P>
	All kidding aside, the parliamentary secretary should come to 
Quebec, and I would bet my bottom dollar that, out of ten 
farmers, not one would be able to give the name of our Minister 
of Agriculture in Ottawa. Quite often, those who can give it say 
it wrong and only give his last name.
<P>
	Farmers in our province are much more attached to Quebec 
than to Ottawa, and I must say that I am proud of it. I am very 
proud of it. And the day will soon come, I think, when our 
farmers will understand that it would be so simple, instead of 
having three options for borrowing money-two of them being 
federal-, to at least combine them. It would be cost effective. 
This would be a good way to save $25 or $30 million without it 
hurting too much.
<P>
	The other day, I was listening to the Minister of Finance say to 
his colleague, the hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot: 
``Give me some areas where I can make cuts, where I can save 
some money''. I am giving you one, the farming industry. 
Combine these two possible options for borrowing money. You 
will save at least $25 or $30 million. Taxpayers would be 
thrilled. Also, farmers would save time and effort. Instead of 
having to check which one would be best, they would have to see 
only one. The ideal solution for our farmers would be to keep 
only one of the two, the Quebec one: the Société de financement 
agricole du Québec.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	Thank you for your attention and, in concluding, I would like 
to mention that we will vote for Bill C-75, because we cannot do 
otherwise.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I assure the House that in Saskatchewan farmers do 
know the name of the agriculture minister but their faces are not 
glowing or smiling when they think of his name.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13168"> 13168 </A></B>
<P>
	I rise in the House to indicate the Reform Party's support for 
Bill C-75. The program is being used by an increasing number 
of farmers. As we enter into the sunset phase of direct 
subsidies, it is imperative that farmers have access to proper 
financing. Excess cash flow that had been previously freed up 
from government subsidies is all but non-existent, and that is 
not bad. Farmers are now relying heavily on the banks and 
credit unions to provide them with the necessary cash flow to 
expand, diversify or maintain their operations.
<P>
	However, as is the case with small business operators, farmers 
have had and continue to have a number of difficulties securing 
loans with financial institutions, whether for buying land or 
covering operational expenses.
<P>
	Reformers believe farmers and farm marketing co-operatives 
have access to financial assistance not through government 
administered programs like the Farm Credit Corporation and its 
provincial counterparts but through chartered banks and credit 
unions.
<P>
	The intent of the Farm Improvement and Marketing 
Co-operative Loans Act is: ``to increase the availability of 
credit to farming operations and farmer owned marketing 
co-operatives to improve farm assets and strengthen production 
and financial stability''. We are talking for the most part about 
farm improvement loans when we talk about FIMCLA.
<P>
	Increasing the aggregate amount available to farmers and 
farmer owned co-operatives from $1.5 billion to $3 billion will 
continue to fulfil the objectives set out by the Farm 
Improvement and Marketing Co-operative Loans Act. Farmers 
have utilized this program from across Canada. The program has 
been extremely popular, with the number of loans issued in the 
past five years increasing by over 1,000 per cent. Increasing the 
levels of moneys available under the program to $3 billion will 
enable a greater number of farmers to secure loans.
<P>
	There is some concern, however, with the reluctance of 
financial institutions to provide loans to farmers without some 
sort of guarantee from the government. This is not to say these 
financial institutions will not provide loans to farmers; they 
will, but with an arm's length of preconditions and unfavourable 
interest rates.
<P>
	Why are the banks so reluctant to provide loans to farmers and 
farmer owned marketing co-operatives? Possibly it is because 
governments are so willing to get involved in financial 
guarantees, from megaprojects right down to small business 
entrepreneurs.
<P>
	The program over the years has had a default rate of only 1 per 
cent. A 1 per cent default rate is quite impressive when we 
compare it with other sectors of the economy. That speaks very 
well of our farming community and tells us about the quality of 
the people involved in the agricultural industry.
<P>
	The banks over the past couple of years have lost incredible 
amounts of money in defaulted loans to the likes of the Trizec 
Corporation and the Reichmanns. However, with individuals 
like the Reichmanns the banks are willing to bend over 
backward to provide financing for their risky ventures. The 
chartered banks appear to be prejudiced toward small business 
and farms or else do not care so much about the smaller accounts 
even though they likely compose the most reliable sector of 
bank customers. Farming can be risky as well, but looking at 
past performances farmers have been a very credible risk.
<P>
	Farmers see this bill as the lesser of two evils. Ideally we 
would like to see the government get out of the business of 
guaranteeing loans to farmers and to farmer owned marketing 
co-operatives. We do, however, see it as an important step in the 
transition from a subsidy based industry to an entity able to 
compete on its own feet.
<P>
	We have stated in the House a number of times that farmers 
can compete globally. This can be accomplished with 
government's getting out of the business of telling farmers or 
related industries how they should run their businesses.
<P>
	Unfortunately Liberals have a long history of interfering in 
places they do not belong. All I have to do is say three letters and 
members will recognize them immediately, NEP. The blood 
begins to boil in my fellow Reformers and Canadians right 
across the country, particularly in the energy producing areas, 
when they think of the national energy plan. That is an instance 
where government got involved in business. It should not have 
done so. It got involved in industry when it should not have done 
so and messed it up. It is very important the government not get 
involved directly in business but that its members be the 
legislators who allow businesses to carry on in a fair and 
equitable environment.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	It is sad to say the government continues to perpetuate the 
myth that it knows what is best for business. For the remainder 
of my speech I will address some of the areas the government 
must remove itself from. One is the lending business.
<P>
	The Farm Credit Corporation, the FCC, seems to have 
outlived its usefulness in its present form, a dinosaur that should 
be put out of its misery. The FCC provides services duplicate to 
those services already provided by banks and credit unions. As 
pointed out by the member for Moose Jaw-Lake Centre, there 
are private lenders willing to do the job and they see FCC as a 
publicly financed competitor where borrowing money to lend 
money is not right.
<P>
	It is ludicrous that a government in debt as much as this 
government is guaranteeing loans to farmers. The FCC is also in 
the business of loaning money to farm related industry. How 
many ways do we approach this? Certainly we are putting 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13169"> 13169 </A></B>
<P>
ourselves as government in a compromised position when we 
are the legislators of the  lending industry. We are guaranteeing 
loans and we are also providing loans. The waters are indeed 
muddy.
<P>
	What is next for the Farm Credit Corporation? About the only 
thing the FCC does not do is provide long term loans at 
reasonably fixed rates. That was the original concept under 
which the FCC was created.
<P>
	If this is not possible, why do we keep the FCC around? A 
related issue to the FCC fiasco is the amount of money being 
given to the western economic diversification program and the 
prairie farm rehabilitation administration, the PFRA, with 
regard to the farm machinery industry in Saskatchewan.
<P>
	As a Saskatchewanian I see the importance of a home grown 
agricultural manufacturing business. I am in favour of creating 
new agriculture technology in responding to the desire for 
increased efficiency and diversification and creating jobs in a 
stable economy. If the government is involved in financing these 
ventures, it is of concern to us and taxpayers alike; often we are 
the same people.
<P>
	There is no reason the farm machinery industry should be 
propped up either in the short term or the long term. Many of the 
Liberal hair brained short term financing schemes have turned 
into long term drains on the public purse.
<P>
	In the past eight years over $34 million has been approved for 
loans or grants to Saskatchewan farm industry manufacturers. 
The agreements are a combination of grants and interest free, 
non-repayable and conditional loans. Although the $34 million 
is a combination of federal and provincial governments, the 
federal government through western economic diversification 
and the PFRA have provided a substantial amount.
<P>
	It appalls me when the president of the largest agricultural 
machinery manufacturer in Saskatchewan makes the following 
statement: ``A company has no choice but to look at what is 
there and to take what is offered if you are to remain 
competitive''. This is from the <I>Western Producer</I> on June 1, 
1995.
<P>
	Flexi-Coil has received over $19 million in closing grants 
from the federal and provincial governments since 1987. Dale 
Botting, executive director of the Canadian Federation of 
Independent Business, commenting on the grants and loans 
given out states that the days of government giving money to a 
chosen few has to stop.
<P>
	A recent survey conducted by the Canadian Federation of 
Independent Business members shows that most are opposed to 
business subsidies. Members who have received grant money in 
the past would have proceeded with their expansion without the 
grant by a margin of three to one.
<P>
	Another farm machinery manufacturer, Bourgault Industries, 
is competing head to head with Flexi-Coil. Bourgault Industries 
has not received a single government dollar yet it has become a 
successful business, with sales of over $50 million each year.
<P>
	In an article in the <I>Western Producer</I> Gerry Bourgault, 
president of the company, stated: ``Refusing government loans 
and grants shows up in a healthy bottom line. When sales are 
down the company is forced to reassess its equipment and make 
changes that farmers want. Government money clouds the 
financial picture. If you do not run your business properly, 
government grants are not going to make up for that. 
Governments should not be in the business of giving money 
away to businesses. In most cases it is just squandered''.
<P>
	The Liberal government should be in consultation with the 
likes of Gerry Bourgault. There is no doubt the Liberals have 
been and continue to consult the wrong individuals. The 
Liberals must stop interfering in agriculture and business. As 
stated by Mr. Bourgault, refusing government loans and grants 
shows up in a healthy bottom line. Propping up business with 
loans and grants does nothing more than create a greater 
dependency on government. Reformers believe the economy 
should be market driven and not skewed by government 
interference and intervention.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	The small business loans program should probably be merged 
with the farm improvement loan program. They are both 
attempting to do the same thing. They are both supposed to be 
financially sound and we as members of Parliament must insist 
both programs be actuarially sound and that all costs with 
respect to the program should not come out of the taxpayers' 
pockets but should be paid for by the users of the loan guarantee 
program.
<P>
	I understand the farm improvement loans are not subsidized 
by the taxpayers. We as legislators must insist on proper 
accounting and it be maintained. The administrative costs must 
be covered by the users and the default rate must not become so 
high that the moneys are taken out taxpayers' pockets to 
subsidize any industry, whether it be my industry, farming, or 
any other small business or megaproject. We all have to operate 
by the same rules.
<P>
	The Reform Party sees Bill C-75 as a small step in the right 
direction with respect to private sector lending institutions 
making capital available to viable farm operations. The 
government still has a long way to go in removing itself from the 
grants and loans to all areas of the economy.
<P>
	FIMCLA must be made self-sustaining. It must not be a 
burden on the taxpayers and governments. Governments must 
get out of the business of being in business and they must 
provide fairness and equity to the business sector.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="13170"> 13170 </A></B>
<P>
	The government must set some priorities. I cannot enunciate 
this strongly enough. The first priority is to get out of the grants 
business 100 per cent; no more grants, period. Second, there 
should be no public financial lending institutions. They provide 
a conflict for the government with the private sector. 
Governments should be in the business of making sure business 
operates fairly and is honest. It should not be in the business.
<P>
	Third, there should be no loan guarantees to megaprojects and 
there should be no political patronage. Fourth, there should be 
no guarantees to small business and there should be no loan 
guarantees to farms, and we should not treat them differently.
<P>
	To reverse the order-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleague will have the floor when debate 
continues after question period.
<P>
	It being 11 a.m., the House will hear Statements by Members.

	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
by the turn of the century the World Health Organization 
estimates that as many as 30 million people may be exposed to 
the virus which causes AIDS. It is therefore critical for Canada 
to create partnerships with other governments in an effort to 
combat the spread of this deadly disease. For example, the 
Canada-Ukraine partners program is proving it is possible to 
contain HIV infection and prevent the devastation of AIDS.
<P>
	Yesterday by hosting the president of the Ukraine's national 
HIV-AIDS committee, I had the opportunity to learn about 
community health education programs which will have a direct 
impact on both of our countries.

quote: ``Canadians do not have to accept homosexuality as being 
natural and moral. Homosexuality is not natural, it is immoral''.

	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today wraps up national awareness week. This week 
was a time for Canadians to have a special opportunity to focus 
on promoting and creating barrier free learning for people with 
disabilities. It was a time to recognize the thousands of 
volunteers and the partnership of organizations and 
governments that adds strength to the message of access. One 
aspect of the program is the face to face program that matches 
employers with those with disabilities.
<P>
	I am pleased to thank many of my colleagues, as many 
members from the House, including Reformers, are 
participating again this year.
<P>
	As part of awareness week the Standing Committee on Human 
Rights and the Status of Disabled Persons had the opportunity to 
present the Centennial Flame award. As a member of that 
committee, I congratulate this year's winner, Miss Laurie 
Bellefontaine.
<P>
	Opportunity is not created by quotas and coercion. 
Opportunity becomes real through community based initiatives 
such as this that promote understanding of the abilities and 
strengths of the disabled in the workplace.

per cent of single parent families led by women live in poverty. 
Two weeks ago, the courts ruled against Suzanne Thibaudeau, 
who had challenged the law requiring custodial parents to pay 
taxes on child support payments. The law is unfair and simply 
impoverishes women even more. We have waited long enough.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Parliament has already debated this issue in the form of a 
private member's motion. There has been a task force on child 
support payments. The minister has had ample time and 
opportunity to act.

caribou herd in the Alaskan wildlife refuge. This action 
contravenes a 1987 agreement recognizing Canadian and 
American joint responsibility to protect the habitat of the 
Porcupine caribou herd and the Gwich'in people who depend on 
it.
<P>
	I urge the government to ensure both the continuation of the 
U.S. government's commitment and the right of the Gwich'in 
people to their traditional food source and longstanding way of 
life. We owe this action to our aboriginal people.

	<B>Mr. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Vancouver South, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to inform the House that the 
appeal challenging the wearing of turbans by Sikh RCMP 
officers has been summarily dismissed in the unanimous 
decision made by the Federal Court of Appeal in Calgary.
<P>
	The measure of a strong and just society is its ability to weave 
our differences into the fabric of our national identity. The 
dismissal of this challenge has once again proven that Canada is 
a strong and just society.
<P>
	These decisions reaffirm that the wearing of articles of faith 
by a Sikh police officer in no way impedes their ability to 
perform their duties with impartiality and fairness.
<P>
	Let this decision be a wake up call for the Reform Party. Its 
opposition to Sikhs in the RCMP is out of line with the Canadian 
legal tradition and demonstrates an intolerance to cultural 
diversity. When will the Reform Party realize the 1930s are 
over? It is 1995 and the time has come for it to support the 
religious freedom of all Canadians.

	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
each year over 225,000 Canadian children are abused. 
According to the committee on sexual offences against children 
and youth, 53 per cent of females and 31 per cent of males have 
been victims of one or more unwanted sexual acts.
<P>
	Approximately four in five of those incidents happened to 
victims when they were children or youths, and one-third of all 
assaults against children occurred within the family. In addition, 
at least one million  children in Canada have witnessed violence 
by their fathers against their mothers.
<P>
<B>(1105 ) </B>
<P>
	Children who witness violence by one parent against another 
are often considered children at risk by child welfare authorities 
because of the lasting emotional and psychological 
consequences for the child. In many cases the children grow up 
to be abusive themselves, thus perpetuating the cycle of 
violence.
<P>
	I appeal to all levels of government and to all Canadians and 
organizations that we must do a better job related to violence 
against children.

	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
sovereignists have always maintained that a sovereign Quebec 
will negotiate sharing the federal debt with the Government of 
Canada on an equitable basis. A study conducted by the Institut 
national de la recherche scientifique and released yesterday 
shows that a sovereign Quebec's share of the federal debt would 
have to be reduced by $24 billion on account of the fact that, 
over the years, Quebec has paid more than it has received from 
the federal government. The INRS study concludes that a 
sovereign Quebec should therefore be responsible for 17.4 per 
cent of the federal debt.
<P>
	It is important to note that in the present federal system, 
Quebecers currently assume 23 per cent of the federal debt with 
the $30 billion in taxes that they pay each year to the federal 
government. Hence the INRS conclusion that the total debt 
burden of a sovereign Quebec would amount to 103 per cent of 
GDP, as compared to 108 per cent for Canada at the present time.
<P>
	According to the INRS study, a sovereign Quebec would 
therefore have a lower debt level than Canada now has.

	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the time has come to give Canadians freedom of choice 
in health care.
<P>
	Every year Canadian taxpayers put tens of billions of dollars 
into health care premiums to pay for our medicare. Yet many of 
these same Canadians make the conscious decision to drop out 
of the conventional health care system, choosing alternate forms 
of health care.

	One of my constituents, Mrs. Margaret Wiens, recently wrote 
to me: ``A change in the way we deliver health care is long 
overdue. It is discriminatory to only cover and recognize 
conventional drugs. I and hundreds of thousands of others in 
Canada faithfully pay our medical premiums, and therefore we 
should have freedom to choose our preferred type of 
treatment''.
<P>
	I am confident that Canadians are capable of making 
intelligent decisions on how they will care for their bodies. It is 
time for the government to share this confidence. The Canada 
Health Act must be changed to return to Canadians the freedom 
of medical choice they are calling for.

Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the PQ government refused to support 
an opposition motion on health care reform. It read as follows: 
``That this Assembly support the proposal by the Leader of the 
Bloc Quebecois, Lucien Bouchard, to broaden the scope of the 
ongoing consultations on health care reform in Quebec''.
<P>
	This failure of the PQ government to accede to this legitimate 
request by their separatist friend and partner clearly shows that 
the coalition in Quebec City has two faces. They are partners for 
promoting sovereignty but when it comes to health, they are on 
opposite sides of the issue.

	The theme of national transportation week is ``Careers in

be has proven to be among the thorniest aspects of reconciling 
these policy objectives. This year the minister has adopted a 
novel and ingenious approach for dealing with this difficult 
problem. He has allocated a portion of the total allowable catch 
of snow crab to a number of fishermen's associations and has 
challenged them to find a way to fish their allocation safely and 
responsibly and to share the benefits fairly among those who do 
not have regular snow crab licences.
<P>
<B>(1115 ) </B>
<P>
	The fishermen are rising to the challenge. They have formed 
companies and worked out harvesting and processing strategies 
to share the benefits of this temporary allocation.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, B.Q.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, a week after the latest escalation in the conflict in 
Bosnia, when 370 peacekeepers, including 55 Canadians, were 
taken hostage by Serbian forces, there has been a flurry of 
statements and meetings which failed to produce any concrete 
results leading to the release of the hostages. This morning, the 
International Red Cross said that the Bosnian Serbs told them 
they would release the hostages unconditionally, either today or 
tomorrow.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13174"> 13174 </A></B>
<P>
	Could the Deputy Prime Minister confirm the statement by 
the Red Cross that the Bosnian Serbs will release the 370 
peacekeepers who are being kept hostage sometime during the 
next few hours, although Bosnian Serb leader Radovan 
Karadzic said yesterday that no hostages could be released 
without guarantees that all air strikes would be suspended?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, we received 
communications mentioning that a few hostages might be 
released today, but at 11.13 a.m., we were unable to confirm 
whether that was the case.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, B.Q.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister and the Minister of National 
Defence confirmed yesterday that Canada was negotiating with 
the Bosnian Serbs to allow a rotation of the 45 Canadian 
peacekeepers being held hostage at their observation post. 
Meanwhile, in Europe the Minister of Foreign Affairs was 
saying, with Canada's allies, that there would be no negotiations 
with the Serbs regarding the hostages.
<P>
	That being said, who speaks for the Canadian government? Is 
it the Minister of Foreign Affairs or is it the Minister of National 
Defence, who said that conducting negotiations would be 
tantamount to saying the Bosnian Serbs have the right to take 
hostages? Who is telling the truth?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Government of 
Canada does not negotiate with the Bosnian Serb government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, B.Q.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, perhaps the Deputy Prime Minister should say so to the 
Minister of National Defence who said yesterday in the House, 
as did the Prime Minister-just read <I>Hansard</I>-that 
negotiations were being conducted locally to obtain the release 
of hostages.
<P>
	In any case, the Prime Minister was delighted with the 
position taken by the UN Secretary General on redefining the 
mandate of the peacekeepers in Bosnia, and he went on to say 
that this had been Canada's position since last Sunday. However, 
need I remind members that although it has been questioned 
about this all week, the government has steadfastly refused to 
announce its intentions?
<P>
	Since tomorrow there will be a meeting of NATO defence 
ministers in Paris, mainly to discuss the French plan, and since a 
NATO plane was shot down this morning, while flying over 
Bosnia, could the government tell Canadians now, before 
tomorrow's meeting, what Canada's position will be on the 
French proposals?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
underscore that the claim made by the hon. member is simply 
not true. In comments made to date we  have stated quite clearly 
that we are not negotiating with the Bosnian Serbs.
<P>
	If the hon. member's question is reviewed, he speaks about 
the issue of rotation. In the normal activities of the team on the 
ground there is a rotation of troops. That rotation is being 
discussed on an ongoing and soldier to soldier basis in Visoko. 
That is certainly consistent with the position we have taken as a 
government.

	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. Defence and Industry 
officials confirmed yesterday that the government is preparing 
to spend $2.6 billion on the purchase of 47 new helicopters. The 
main supplier of this equipment vying for the contract is no 
other than Agusta, the very company facing accusations of 
bribery in Europe.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister, who is 
responsible for enforcing the government's code of ethics in this 
House. Will the government commit to excluding Agusta from 
all new contracts until we get to the bottom of the circumstances 
surrounding the EH-101 contract, as demanded by her 
colleague, the Minister of Human Resources Development, in 
1993?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, no contract has been 
authorized by the government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is again for the Deputy Prime Minister, who is 
responsible, as I said earlier, for enforcing the government's 
code of ethics in this House when the Prime Minister is away.
<P>
	Given that Agusta just hired the Liberal Party of Canada's 
former communications director, Daniel Despins, to lobby for 
the sale of new helicopters to the Canadian government, and 
given that all cabinet members know him well, how can the 
Deputy Prime Minister not commit to launching an 
investigation into the awarding of the EH-101 contract to 
Agusta before the government does any more business with the 
company, which is, as I already said, currently facing corruption 
charges in Europe?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thought I made it 
quite clear to the member. No contract has been approved either 
by the Minister of National Defence or by the government.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13175"> 13175 </A></B>

	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday the 
defence minister said he was looking forward to finding out how 
the U.S. forces would be deployed in Bosnia. Today the world 
got a clear indication of where the U.S. is headed when one of its 
F-16 fighter planes was shot down over Bosnia earlier this 
morning. Everyone knows this act could escalate the conflict 
even further.
<P>
	For the second day in a row, my question is this. Will the 
government assure the House that it will not let our troops get 
dragged into a war for which they are neither equipped nor 
mandated?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have confirmed 
that an American plane was shot down. Obviously the situation 
is very volatile.
<P>
	A number of Canadian hostages are being held in various 
parts of the territory in question. The prudent thing for the 
Government of Canada to do to protect the safety of the hostages 
is to go to the meeting in Paris tomorrow with a clear mandate. 
Our number one priority will be to protect those Canadian 
soldiers and to ensure that any action taken in a collective way 
will ensure the safety of the hostages and the soldiers who are on 
the ground right now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, civil wars are 
very messy and they get even worse when other countries join in 
the fighting, and the situation is escalating in Bosnia.
<P>
	Given that our troops are not equipped for a high intensity 
conflict, what is the exact position the Canadian government 
will take tomorrow in Paris? Will it be the position of the foreign 
affairs minister or the defence minister, because a definite 
question has to be asked?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not quite clear as 
to the options the hon. member is offering. I have underlined 
how concerned we are about the more than 50 Canadians either 
being detained or being held hostage.
<P>
	At this point our main concern when we go to Paris tomorrow 
is to ensure that any collective action decided on by all of the 
participating parties will first and foremost ensure the safety of 
those soldiers who are on the ground.
<P>
	I am sure all Canadians want the Government of Canada to 
ensure the safety of those troops who are currently being held 
hostage and others who are on the ground.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are all 
concerned about the hostages. We want them released. We want 
all Canadians withdrawn, including the hostages.
<P>
<B>(1125 ) </B>
<P>
	We welcome the news that Bosnian Serbs will be releasing the 
hostages tomorrow without condition. The Reform Party hopes 
that will happen. There would not have been hostages if we had 
acted on this much sooner.
<P>
	Given the escalation of the situation in Bosnia and the 
potential for further hostage taking, will the government make a 
commitment to withdraw our troops once the hostages are 
released?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I did say that at about 
11.13 a.m. we had the opportunity to check the status. At the 
moment we have no confirmation of the release of hostages. We 
hope that news is forthcoming.
<P>
	Our first responsibility should not be to outline our 
negotiating stance for political gain. Rather it should be to 
ensure that when we go to Paris, all the parties that have troops 
on the ground have a chance to make a full exploration of all of 
the possibilities on the table.
<P>
	That is certainly what the Minister of National Defence will 
be doing in Paris tomorrow.

	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	In its decision last Friday in the case of <I>Egan v. Canada</I>, the 
Supreme Court of Canada found that sexual orientation is a 
profoundly personal characteristic, which is either immutable or 
alterable only at unacceptable personal cost and which, 
therefore, comes under the protection of section 15 of the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
<P>
	Since the Supreme Court of Canada considers discrimination 
based on sexual orientation unconstitutional, will the minister 
not acknowledge that he has a duty to table his bill to amend the 
Canadian Human Rights Act by the end of the present session 
and thus make all discrimination on the basis of sexual 
orientation illegal? A little courage, Mr. Speaker.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13176"> 13176 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has 
referred to the recent judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada 
in which the court considered the equality provisions in section 
15 of the charter as they relate to sexual orientation.
<P>
	For the first time the court pointed out that sexual orientation 
is an analogous ground under the charter for the purposes of that 
section. We are considering the judgment. More than one 
judgment was issued by the court in its analysis and the judges 
expressed a variety of views.
<P>
	Quite apart from the judgment, the government has long 
recognized the importance of amending the human rights act to 
provide that sexual orientation cannot be a basis on which 
discrimination occurs. We have long since made the 
commitment to do just that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would remind the Minister of Justice that the Quebec 
Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms has prohibited 
discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation since 1978 and 
that he should use it as an example.
<P>
	Are we to understand that, despite the very clear decision by 
the Supreme Court, the government will not change its policy 
with respect to homosexuals, lesbians and same sex spouses, a 
policy which, by the fact of doing nothing, denies the rights 
accorded by the country's justice system to all these Canadians?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in fairness the member 
will know that the judgment of the court was released a week ago 
yesterday. As I mentioned, there are judgments both ways 
expressing a variety of views with respect to these matters and 
what flows from them.
<P>
	The government should do what it is doing. It has reaffirmed 
its commitment to amend the human rights act. It is also going to 
look at the implications of the judgment. It is going to consult 
with caucus and determine the position that we will take on the 
wide variety of issues that arise on the subject of sexual 
orientation.

	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
dealing with the administration of the justice ministry, the 
minister insisted yesterday that ``when the government goes to 
the legal profession to hire agents to help us with legal cases, the 
fundamental criteria is competence and merit''.
<P>
	That being the case, can the justice minister explain to 
Canadians the appointments recently made in the revenue 
minister's riding in Victoria. How does the appointment of three 
firms with little or no experience in drug prosecution and the 
termination of a firm with 20-years' experience fit his stated 
criteria of competence and merit?
<P>
<B>(1130 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in British Columbia, as 
in the case of all other provinces where legal agents were 
appointed, suggested names for appointment were sent to the 
regional offices of the Department of Justice where they were 
vetted. We asked the regional justice offices whether they were 
satisfied the persons under consideration were competent for the 
work that was intended.
<P>
	In the case of the agents under discussion, as in the case of all 
others who were appointed, the regional offices expressed their 
view that the individuals were competent for the work that was 
intended to be given to those lawyers.
<P>
	If the hon. member will look at the record of agents appointed 
across the country he will find that in many cases agents 
appointed during the last regime are still doing work. Their 
appointments have been continued by the government because 
we thought they were appropriate to carry on the work in those 
cases.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in news 
reports from Victoria an experienced undercover officer 
commenting on the justice department's termination of a firm 
with 20 years of drug prosecution experience has said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is a complete and utter farce. We are losing very experienced and very 
knowledgeable prosecutors who are used to dealing at all levels of drug 
enforcement. This is a definite blow to drug enforcement.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Public safety should never be compromised by political 
patronage. It begs the question: was the justice minister made 
aware of the very close connections between the revenue 
minister's political interests and the appointed firms?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I agree with the hon. 
member that public safety should not be compromised on any 
basis. I insist that in this case it was not.
<P>
	The agents who were appointed are competent for the task for 
which they have been retained. As to the comments of the police 
officers, I know only what I have read in the press and what has 
been quoted by the hon. member.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13177"> 13177 </A></B>
<P>
	I can say that any concerns anyone in the administration of

be considered; but we are satisfied that the agents we have in 
place are competent to carry out work on behalf of the people 
of Canada.

	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, three times 
this year the Minister of Justice was unable to explain why 
individuals and businesses in Quebec receive only 5 per cent of 
the value of professional and special services contracts awarded 
by his department and has even expressed some doubt about this 
percentage. However, his own officials confirm our allegations.
<P>
	After studying this matter for three months, can the Minister

more contracts to residents of his province, Ontario, than it does 
to residents of Quebec?

this week but did not. I will see the written response is in the 
hands of the hon. members who asked the questions next week.

<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would point 
out that the minister has been studying this matter for three 
months but has yet to give us an answer. The Minister of Justice 
has also said in this House that he did not believe that 98 per cent 
of professional and special services contracts are drafted in 
English. But, once again, his officials say the opposite.
<P>
	Is the Minister of Justice still of the opinion that the fact that 
research contracts awarded by his department are drafted in 
English only accurately reflects the reality of bilingualism 
within his department?

	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney

specific questions about the number and percentage of contracts 
that have been awarded and the use of language in specific work

every Canadian knows full well the story of 15-year old Tara 
Manning from Quebec and how she was sexually assaulted and 
stabbed 47 times.
<P>
	Every Canadian's heart goes out to her family and is outraged 
that a killer may go free if a court upholds the claim that the 
killer's rights were infringed by a judged granting a warrant for 
a DNA search.
<P>
	Since the minister knows full well that in order for the 
perpetrator of the crime to be held accountable legislation must 
clear the House before the summer break allowing a judge to 
grant a DNA search, will the minister immediately bring the 
legislation before the House?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very aware of the 
case. I met with Mr. Manning, the father of the victim, and with 
his parents. I was very much affected by the sadness of the 
tragedy, particularly for the family.
<P>
	I am not going to discuss the Manning case because it is 
pending in the courts. However I will respond on the subject of 
DNA testing and I will say that the government has said it would 
introduce changes to the Criminal Code to provide a further 
basis upon which authorities could take samples for DNA 
testing for prosecution purposes.
<P>
	I should point out to the hon. member that there are provisions 
in the code at present which are being used for that purpose. 
Nothing I say is intended to suggest that those are insufficient 
for that purpose at this time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians continually hear the government and the minister 
state that they will change legislation to enhance public safety. 
It has been 19 months and I have not seen it yet.
<P>
	Canadians should have confidence in the justice system. We 
are waiting for the drunkenness defence bill. Now we are 
waiting and waiting for this legislation, which will definitely 
serve a purpose in the country and solve the problems.
<P>
	How could the minister dare speak of justice when he 
completely abandoned the most basic concept of humanity, that 
when a person is murdered society must punish the murderer?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would ask the hon. 
member 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13178"> 13178 </A></B>
<P>
to be fair to the facts. Bill C-72 with respect  to the drunkenness 
defence is before the House. Indeed it is at committee.
<P>
	The hon. member took a very active role in the consideration 
of Bill C-37, which was improved because of his work on 
committee dealing with amendments to the Young Offenders 
Act. That bill is now in the Senate. The hon. member 
participated in committee work with respect to Bill C-41, which 
is intended to strengthen the sentencing provisions of the 
Criminal Code.
<P>
	However, on the point the hon. member raises, I can tell the 
hon. member as I have in the past that we will introduce 
legislation to amend the Criminal Code to broaden the basis 
upon which DNA samples can be obtained.
<P>

it.

used for that purpose. I do not suggest for a moment that they are 
insufficient for that purpose.

	The Minister of Foreign Affairs says that the scandal 
involving Canadian diplomats who trade their airplane tickets 
for money is a thing of the past. The President of the Treasury 
Board claims that the phenomenon is limited to diplomats 
assigned to dangerous and difficult cities. However, for a 
diplomat posted in Tokyo with his family, it can amount to 40 
per cent of his salary, tax free.
<P>
	How can the President of the Treasury Board justify that such 
financial benefits, which were granted in 1993, are still 
available to Canadian diplomats, when other civil servants have 
had their salaries frozen since 1991?

directives there has been a tightening up of those procedures and 
that previous difficulties that arose have been corrected.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, moreover, 
the majority of diplomats who trade their airplane tickets for 
money to pay for their holidays do not go to Canada and are not 
even obliged to submit their receipts. They pocket the money, 
tax free.
<P>
	Will the President of the Treasury Board undertake to review 
these benefits, granted in 1993, before laying off more civil 
servants, who cannot take advantage of the lax approach of 
Treasury Board?

opportunity to be able to come home from time to time. There 
are, particularly in the case of what are called hardship posts, 
increased opportunities to do that.
<P>
	Some very strict rules have been put into place. Lately we 
have been experimenting with a pilot system whereby we have 
actually lowered the amount of money that we will provide to 80 
per cent from 90 per cent of the economy fare for a return trip, in 
that way further controlling the costs and recognizing the need 
of the government to cut government spending.

review which is due this fall. We will be looking at further 
measures to ensure that the taxpayers' money is well protected

	Unemployed youth who participate in Youth Services Canada 
are breaking the cycle of dependency and learning good, solid

	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, yesterday in the House the Solicitor General 
confirmed for the record that the commissioner of the RCMP 
advised that the commercial crime section of the RCMP in 
Winnipeg had reviewed allegations made by the member for 
Lisgar-Marquette and found no evidence to support an 
investigation.
<P>
	The crime section of the Winnipeg RCMP has no record of a 
request from the commissioner of the RCMP on the matter.
<P>
	My question is for the solicitor general. The commercial 
crime division in Winnipeg says once thing; the solicitor general 
says another thing. Who are we to believe?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have conveyed to the House, and earlier to the hon. 
member's colleague, information provided to me by the 
commissioner of the RCMP.
<P>
	The deputy commissioner for operations of the RCMP today 
sent a letter to the hon. member's colleague setting out the 
position of the RCMP on the matter. If the hon. member's 
colleague will agree, I would be delighted to ensure that the 
letter is released to the public. I think it should clear the air and 
help the hon. member to get on to something more constructive.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I hope we are making progress here. We are not 
asking the solicitor general to launch an investigation or become 
involved in the day to day operations of the RCMP. However, we 
are very concerned that we find out exactly where the file went. 
There is supposed to be a file.
<P>
	Could the solicitor general advise the House where the file 
went? If it did not go to Winnipeg, as they say it did not, then 
where did the file go?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would have hoped the hon. member would have 
confirmed, on behalf of his colleague, that the letter the deputy 
commissioner of the RCMP sent to him explaining the 
involvement of the RCMP in the matter be made public. I think 
that would be a better way to clear the air than to keep asking this 
kind of question.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	There must be some other matters the hon. member could deal 
with rather than attempting to create wrong impressions which 
should be the subject of an apology.

	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies,

Environment.
<P>
	In her recent answer to a question on the health hazards from 
24 highly contaminated sites, the Minister of the Environment 
has reaffirmed the polluter pays principle and confirmed that 
Environment Canada denies any responsibility concerning 
so-called orphan sites.
<P>
	Could the minister tell the House when the inventory of 
contaminated orphan sites will be completed by her department, 
and when she expects to be in a position to lay charges against 
owners who refuse to clean up their sites?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, that question could 
have been addressed to my Quebec counterpart. The hon. 
member is aware that the federal government signed an 
agreement with Quebec a few years ago whereby we financed, in 
partnership with the province, provincially identified orphan 
sites. Federal funds have been paid to the provinces, and they 
made the decisions on the use of those funds for clean-up 
operations.
<P>
	When all environment ministers agreed two years ago that we 
should stop paying for orphan sites, we did so at the request of 
the provinces, who have the instruments to initiate prosecutions 
in the private sector, more particularly in Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, how can the Minister of the Environment 
expect us to take seriously her commitment to the polluter pays 
principle, when, in 1994, the Canadian government initiated just 
13 prosecutions under the Canadian Environmental Protection 
Act, which is 30 per cent less than in 1991, and 40 per cent less 
than in 1992. And that does not include contaminated sites in the 
Arctic which are not under the direct responsibility of the 
provinces. How can the minister explain such a drastic drop in 
the number of prosecutions, if not by a total lack of commitment 
to a stringent enforcement of the act?

last week alone as a result of the activities relating to the export 
of illegal hazardous material.
<P>
	I have issued a new directive in my department. We are 
moving away from the issuance of letters of warning. It will be 
one strike and you are out. I intend to pursue aggressively those

Yesterday provincial minister John Cashore called on the

	Mr. Speaker, the hon. member should know that a mediator 
was appointed by the province yesterday and he is in the process 
of mediating. All the parties to the dispute have publicly called 
for a peaceful resolution to this situation. I think the hon.

<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, these standoffs often go on for an extended period of 
time.
<P>
	The federal minister has said that this is not his territory 
because it is off reserve and the band is not part of the B.C. treaty 
process. This is irrelevant. The barricades and this whole 
process are expensive to the taxpayer and to local residents.
<P>
	Will the minister assist in efforts to achieve a voluntary 
removal of the blockades by insisting on removal of the funding 
to the band in order to ensure compliance?

the press information that is contrary to that contained in the 
initial bidding documents?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, in this matter, which 
has already been dragging for some 20 years, I am following the 
advice given by my hon. colleague, the hon. member for 
Frontenac, on March 18, 1994-15 months ago-when he asked 
us to act as soon as possible, and I quote: ``-as an ecologist and 
a recognized environment specialist-this is Jean-Guy Chrétien 
talking-I can only welcome this announcement. As a matter of 
fact, I took an interest in the <I>Irving Whale</I>, a potential ecological 
time-bomb, as soon as I became the opposition's environment 
critic''.
<P>
	Instead of complying with the hon. member's request to 
further delay lifting this barge, we will go ahead. The call for 
tenders has been issued, and the Irving Whale will be raised as 
soon as possible.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My dear colleagues, I would ask you to please 
refer to other members by their ridings and not by their names.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
are not asking the minister to let this matter drag on for years. 
What we are asking her is to raise the <I>Irving Whale</I> as safely as 
possible, even if it is more costly.
<P>
	A spokesperson from her office indicated that two businesses 
had submitted bids to refloat the <I>Irving Whale</I>. Since her 
department has known about the bids since May 11, can the 
minister tell us the prices quoted in these bids and release 
immediately all bidding documents?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the House of 
Commons last year I gave every single document relating to the 
lifting of the <I>Irving Whale</I>. I also said at that time that the 
proposal being pushed by the hon. member is based on a 
recommendation that was done by the company that is interested 
in doing the work.
<P>
	We called for an independent assessment. If the member 
wants, I will refer her to an opinion of Murray Fenton &amp; 
Associates Ltd., Southwark Bridge Road, London, England. 
That firm has no association with the Government of Canada and 
says that the option we have chosen is the best scientific option.
<P>
<B>(1155 ) </B>
<P>
	I would be very happy to table the letter so we could put the 
issue to bed and get the <I>Irving Whale</I> out of the situation it is in, 
which puts the fishermen of the Magdalen Islands at risk. I think 
the hon. member and her eight colleagues on the Magdalen

get this thing up.

	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
MPs' offices are constantly flooded with complaints from 
law-abiding Canadians whose relatives cannot get visitor visas 
to Canada. Why? Because the minister's failure to enforce 
immigration law creates so much abuse that the only way to stop 
it is by denying visas to decent law-abiding visitors.
<P>
	Why is the minister limiting his promise of compassion to 
queue jumpers and foreign criminals and not extending that 
compassion to those who really suffer under Canada's 
immigration laws: law-abiding Canadians, overseas refugees 
and people who want to visit Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B>
<P>
	[<I>Editor's Note: Member spoke in Italian.</I>]
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, the hon. member told me that he knew a few 
words of Italian, so in the spirit of the Parliamentary Secretary 
to the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, I 
thought I would try it out.
<P>
	In response to the hon. member, the reality in fact is the 
opposite. The member should be somewhat respectful of the fact 
that 85 per cent of all visitor visa applications, and there are 
some one million around the world, are accepted by Canada. 
There is a 15 per cent refusal rate. Eighty-five per cent out of 
100 is not bad.
<P>
	In the case where those refusals perhaps legitimately should 
have been accepted, there is a procedure in place for those 
individuals to make new applications. From time to time there 
are also interventions. I caution however that a minister should 
not intervene on a visitor visa program simply because of the 
numbers involved and simply because the fact is it works quite 
well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
whether the minister speaks Italian or English, I still do not 
understand the point.
<P>
	The minister talks a good game. Just yesterday he bragged 
about how well the New Delhi immigration office was working. 
Tell that to Victor Sumbly, a well respected businessman whose 
sister and nephew could not get visitor visas from Delhi. They 
were told there was so much abuse that officials could not risk 
giving visas to a mother and child, even though Victor offered to 
post a $50,000 bond.
<P>
	Would the minister be willing to meet with Mr. Sumbly and 
tell him face to face that the immigration system is working just 
fine?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am equally confused by the 
member's approach today. Usually he gets up in the House and 
asks the government to keep people out, to slam the door shut, to 
keep people from coming in. Today he decides to do some 
constituency work after all  because there have been a lot of

creation of a national registry for Canadians with Alzheimer's. I 
would ask the solicitor general to explain to the House the 
intention of the registry. Could he tell us who is going to manage

impact the registry will have on Canadians with Alzheimer's

<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House

Speaker, the registry is intended to help locate and identify 
missing individuals with Alzheimer's or related conditions. It 
will help to ensure that the risk to them because of their 
condition is mitigated and limited. It will also reassure their 
families and caregivers.
<P>
	I am very pleased that we could work on this project together 
with the Alzheimer's Society of Canada and the department of 
health. The program will be managed by the Alzheimer's 
Society of Canada and its branches across the country. It will use

you, Mr. Speaker. I will let you be the judge and decide whether 
this is a question of privilege or a point of order, but as you 
know, the matter I wish to raise is connected to the fact that 
yesterday, we had the second hour of debate on a motion I 
presented earlier in April in which I urged the government to 
recognize same sex spouses.
<P>
	I must say that yesterday, for the first time since I became a 
member of Parliament, I was not very proud to be a 
parliamentarian. I was not very proud because, as we know, a 
few days ago the Supreme Court asked us to discuss one of the 
most important issues for the future of  our society, and I am 
referring to equal treatment of same sex spouses.
<P>
	I feel I must draw your attention to the fact that yesterday 
evening, some very discriminatory, hateful and offensive 
statements were made concerning the homosexual community, 
and we can hardly say the homosexual community benefited 
from the kind of debate we had yesterday.
<P>
	My main point is, and I will give a very specific example, that 
I always saw the role of the Chair as allowing a maximum of 
freedom of expression, and I must say that you and your team 
have always scrupulously abided by this principle. However, I 
feel I must draw your attention to the fact that in the course of 
the debate yesterday evening, the hon. member for Calgary 
Northeast made some comparisons that were extremely 
dangerous and very difficult to accept for parliamentarians, and 
I think that if we do not put a stop to this and if we do not call to 
order members who take the liberty of making comparisons 
which I find deeply offensive between the homosexual 
community and certain rights to which I am committed on their 
behalf, the reputation of this institution will be tarnished.
<P>
	In concluding, I simply want to bring to your attention a 
comment that will give some indication of the very distressing 
tenor of yesterday's debate, at least in the case of the hon. 
member for Calgary Northeast. Very briefly: ``Homosexuality, 
to anyone who has not been brainwashed by the last decade of 
effective propagandizing by the gay lobby, is unnatural''.
<P>
	I finally want to say that I am not acting on behalf of any lobby 
whatsoever. In presenting a motion I felt was important, I was 
acting as a parliamentarian in order to raise one of those issues 
which, as you know, requires more than one debate.
<P>
	In concluding, I want to say that I do not believe that in this 
Parliament or anywhere else, those who are involved in 
promoting gay rights have been brainwashed.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Dear colleagues, I do not believe that this is a 
matter of privilege. I would ask all of you, regardless of the 
topic being debated, to always make judicious word choices 
because sometimes we are confronted with ideas that are not 
always acceptable to all individuals.
<P>
	As you know, in this House, we use strong words and express 
strong opinions, and sometimes, we use unusually strong words. 
But, in this instance, I have not read the record of the debate. I 
will read those statements in context and will watch the video to 
find out more. If necessary, I will report back to the House with 
my decision on the matter.

Calgary Northeast, I do not want to get into a debate. We had a 
debate on this yesterday.
<P>
	At least at this point, it does not seem to be a question of 
privilege. If the hon. member for Calgary Northeast wishes to 
put something on the record very briefly I invite him to do so. I 
do not want to have this escalate into a debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
stand by the words I issued in my statement. I did not mention 
any particular person by name. That is all I will state in the 
matter.

Speaker, I trust you unconditionally to review this issue and to 
listen to what was said.
<P>
	To better understand the issue and put the debate in context, I 
suggest that we-us parliamentarians and you the 
Speaker-should consider that when we say that a community is 
immoral, for example homosexuals, we are going after each and 
every individual. If we were to do the same for francophones, 
Jews or women in general, it would not be tolerated.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>

	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister

relevant day, given the question that was asked by the member 
from the Bloc Quebecois in the House on what we do to deal with 
contaminated sites.
<P>
	Today I wish to advise Parliament that as a government we are 
introducing a new federal toxic substances management policy. 
What we would like to do is begin with pollution prevention to 
avoid the kinds of messes we saw with things like PCBs in the 
past.
<P>
	We do not often get up in the House to discuss complex 
scientific issues involving complicated chemical compounds. 
However, we also do not often discuss the need to stop poisoning 
ourselves, our children, our environment, our reproductive 
systems, our food chain, and our genetic make-up. We do not 
often discuss how chemicals can affect the health Canadians and 
the health of our environment.
<P>
	Toxic substances in the air, water, soil and sediment upset the 
balance of nature and jeopardize the interdependent existence of 
all living things on earth.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The new toxics policiy I am announcing today will apply 
across the scope of federal activity-not just the Department of 
the Environment. The policy calls for virtual elimination from 
the environment of substances that result from human activity, 
that take a long time to break down, that build up in living 
organisms and that are toxic.
<P>
	For other substances that threaten the health of our 
environment, we will implement full life cycle 
management-from cradle to grave.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
It is cradle to grave management for those substances.
<P>
	If we cannot find the means to keep certain natural substances 
from being released into the environment, we need to take 
measures to prevent generation and their use by humans. Federal 
laws, regulations, policies and programs will be used to turn off 
the tap of release into the environment of bio-accumulative and 
persistent toxic substances produced by Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1210 ) </B>
<P>
	What does that mean? It means saying no to toxins that work 
their way into the food chain. It means saying no to toxins that 
take too much time to break down once they are released.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	All other substances of concern under federal jurisdiction will 
face the world's strictest controls.
<P>
	The new policy is based on the most advanced scientific 
methods and concepts, and expert analysis, including computer 
modelling and internationally accepted criteria.

	In making today's announcement, the government is making 
public complete details of the policy and the document 
describing the scientific basis and technical criteria of the 
policy. The government is also publishing a third document 
summarizing the main issues identified in eight months of 
public consultations and our response to those issues.
<P>
	The policy covers the complete range of toxic substances that 
are used or released into the environment as a result of our 
modern lifestyle. PCBs, dioxins, furans would not have been 
accepted had we known their effect on human health and on the 
food chain. This policy will mean that new industrial chemicals, 
new pesticides, new compounds produced by biotechnology, 
and new chemicals that mimic human hormones will be banned 
unless they can satisfy rigorous scientific criteria. The onus will 
not be on Canadians to prove that these products pose a danger. 
The onus will be on the manufacturer to show that they are safe 
and can be properly managed.
<P>
	The bottom line is that a decision to ban new chemicals and 
new products will be made on science. For existing toxic 
substances that continue to pose a risk the decision to eliminate 
the products from the environment will also be based on science. 
We will establish targets and schedules that will take into 
account social, economic, and technical considerations.
<P>
	During public consultations some have made the point that 
they should have the opportunity to produce additional 
scientific evidence once a preliminary decision to virtually 
eliminate or to stop the production of a product is made. The 
government will provide that opportunity, but we will provide 
the same opportunity to scientific experts, to other 
governments, and to the public. For human made toxic 
substances that are not persistent and do not bioaccumulate, do 
not stay in the environment for a long time, actions to control 
them will take into account risk management and legal, 
economic, and sociological factors.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In simplest terms, the worst offending toxics will be gone, all 
other toxics will be managed throughout their entire life-cycle.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
In English we say cradle to grave management.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	There are those who may complain that this is too tough a 
policy. Tell that to people who live along dead lakes and rivers, 
with deformed fish and birds. Tell that to Canadians who breathe 
our country's air, till our country's soil and swim in our 
country's waters.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I want to be clear that these actions apply to areas under 
federal control. Many toxic substance problems in Canada fall 
under the jurisdiction of the provinces and the territories; hence 
my response earlier in question period on the issue of 
contaminated sites. It is the federal government's intention to 
use the policy we are announcing today in order to pursue a 
national strategy for managing toxic substances through 
discussions with the provinces and the territories.
<P>
	I think here is one example where a PCB in Quebec, a PCB in 
Ontario, and a PCB in British Columbia pose the same problem 
for Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I do not approach this matter with a ``holier than thou'' 
attitude.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	The federal government's hands have not always been clean in 
the past nor has the federal government made a determined 
effort to be a world leader in controlling toxic substances.
<P>
	My belief is, however, that it is in the absolute interest of 
Canadians to work together to eliminate and control toxics, and, 
more importantly, beacause this is what Canadians want.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
We need a united Canadian strategy for dealing with the world 
community. The free flow of air and water means that dangerous 
substances released in one community can end up poisoning the 
environment of another community a thousand kilometres away. 
That is why it is important to have a Canadian policy but it also 
means toxic substances produced in other countries end up 
poisoning Canadians. Toxic substances in eastern Europe are 
currently poisoning breast milk of mothers living in the 
Canadian Arctic.
<P>
	Lake Superior is probably the most virgin of the Great Lakes. 
If we took all the toxins of local creation out of Lake Superior at 
the moment that lake would be 20 per cent damaged as a result of 
toxins that come from places that have never even heard of 
Canada, places very far away where the toxins come out of the 
smokestacks, get into the atmosphere, travel to the Arctic shield 
and diffuse over Canada.
<P>
	That is why we need not only a national strategy but an 
international strategy for birds flying over our Pacific coast, fish 
swimming in our Atlantic waters and people living along the St. 
Lawrence and the Great Lakes.
<P>
	The federal government will use the strategy and the policy 
announced today as a basis for negotiations with the world 
community. Next week Canada will host in Vancouver a meeting 
of the world's leading experts on persistent organic pollutants. 
We will co-chair the meeting with the Philippines so that we can 
have the right marriage of countries of the industrialized world 
as well as countries en voie de développement. International  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13185"> 13185 </A></B>
<P>
co-operation is certainly needed in areas from capacity building 
to technology transfer, to the use of alternative substances.
<P>
	The Government of Canada is announcing this policy for 
Canadians because it is the right thing to do. In doing so I know 
we are following a course directly contrary to the course 
currently being advocated by members of the Congress of the 
United States. Certain American Congress people are calling for 
fewer controls over toxic substances. They want to release more 
toxins into the St. Lawrence, into the Great Lakes, into our 
oceans and other bodies of water and air we share. With the 
greatest respect, that downgrading attitude by some members of 
the United States Congress is dead wrong.
<P>
	By this policy today Canada is sending a message to the world 
and in particular to our American partners that we will do our 
part to deal with toxic substances and we expect them to do 
theirs.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	When you look at the people living along Lake Champlain, 
who are currently facing an ecological disaster partly because of 
construction operations by the Americans, it is obvious that the 
environment knows no boundaries.
<P>
	By moving Canada to the forefront in managing toxics, we 
can move Canada to the forefront of new businesses, new green 
technologies and new green jobs. I am confident that the new 
policy will serve the long term health of our economy and I 
know that it will serve the health of our environment and the 
health of Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	On Monday I will be in Montreal opening the Biosphere 
which is another tribute to the possibility for Canada to begin to 
return to a country where environmental technology is not 
imported but exported.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	At the Biosphere, on Monday, you will see that with the 
Biodome, the Biosphere, the environmental centre-the public 
really supports this endeavour-and modern technology, 
Canadian technology, we are indeed able to go ahead and 
eliminate these toxic substance. But to succeed, policy and 
legislation are required to speed up the process of protecting the 
environment.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We do not want to go down the road of the Americans who are 
now saying this to 50 million people who drank water from the 
Great Lakes. This summer we are getting into a period of 
potential smog. I am sorry to say that in the United States the 
current acceptable levels of smog are about 40 per cent higher 
than in Canada. Who breathes that?
<P>
	The Detroit-Windsor corridor sends all the stuff over to the 
Canadian side and we end up losing work days because of 
pollution problems caused by persistent toxins that come over 
from the United States.
<P>
	We want to make sure with this policy that we have our own 
house in order to ensure that when we go to Vancouver next week 
and when we go to the international community and in particular 
when we go to our American neighbour, we will not allow the 
U.S. Congress to lose the gains we have made. The action we are 
taking today is a further commitment to the strategy of pollution 
prevention which says we should not only focus on cleaning up 
messes but make sure the messes do not occur in the first place.
<P>
	This policy does not offer overnight miracles but it does 
provide a solid foundation for dealing with toxic substances and 
getting those persistent bioaccumulative toxins out of the 
environment permanently. The need to take action is easy to 
understand which is why we are moving today on a policy I think 
will put us at the forefront of dealing with toxins into the 21st 
century.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, every 
year more than 228,000 tons of pollutants of all sorts are 
dumped into Canada's waters, atmosphere, soil and sub-soil. 
The cause of all this alarming dumping is simple: it is 
negligence, whether on the part of careless individuals, 
unscrupulous manufacturers or governments unable to halt the 
flow.
<P>
	I am pleased to rise and speak about the new toxic substance 
management policy the Minister of the Environment is 
proposing, which, I hope, will prove to be a practical response to 
the problems of prolonged toxic dumping that may lead to 
bioaccumulation. As I have not read the documents tabled today, 
I am not in a position to express an opinion on the value of the 
policy. I will therefore simply make four general comments 
expressing the concerns and worries I have about the minister's 
speech.
<P>
	First, I would like to point out that I find it rather surprising 
the minister is tabling her new policy even before the standing 
committee of this House has issued its report, due in a few days, 
on the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. The minister 
would definitely have benefited from the committee's work, 
which took a year's time and which enabled many witnesses to 
express their concerns and suggest solutions with regard to the 
problem of managing toxic substances.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13186"> 13186 </A></B>
<P>
	Second, the minister alluded earlier to the principle of 
reverse onus. According to her, manufacturers will now have 
to prove that their products are safe and may be properly 
managed. This principle, which the Bloc supports without 
hesitation, arises from another, very simple one: caution. The 
idea of caution is relatively new in environmental matters; up 
to now, it has not been a particular concern for governments, 
including this one. I offer as evidence the minister's 
unspeakable attitude in the matter of the barge, the <I>Irving 
Whale</I>, which may well spill its contents of 3,100 tonnes of oil. 
The minister's decision was clearly motivated by a desire to 
limit operating costs, as her officials have said publicly, which 
flies in the face of the most elementary caution.
<P>
	I hope the minister, whose rhetoric is full of fine principles, 
will have the courage and the influence in Cabinet to apply them 
uniformly and not only when it suits her.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	My third comment has to do with the way the minister intends 
to deal with the provinces in the future. Even though she admits 
that her new policy only applies to the federal areas of 
jurisdiction, she states, and I quote: ``It is the federal 
government's intention to use the policy that we are announcing 
today in order to pursue a national strategy for managing toxic 
substances''.
<P>
	I will remind the minister that, whether she likes it or not, the 
environment is a shared area of jurisdiction, in which provinces 
have a determinant role to play. They should and must not be 
treated as second class actors in the federal plans. Before talking 
about national standards, the minister should give tangible 
evidence of the efficiency of her policy. Obviously, an 
aggressive approach by the federal government will only lead to 
counterproductive confrontations.
<P>
	Finally, I notice that the minister is once again boasting that 
she wants to make Canada a world leader in environmental 
matters. The Bloc Quebecois and myself have every right to 
question such a statement and fear that it is just so much hot air. 
Indeed, the last time the minister said that she wanted to make of 
Canada a world leader, she was presenting her plan to reduce 
greenhouse gases which, as we know, was far from 
revolutionary.
<P>
	This very morning, <I>The Ottawa Citizen</I> reported that the 
Sierra Club gave the Prime Minister an admonition to give 
marching orders to his Cabinet on the reduction of carbon 
dioxide emissions.
<P>
	I humbly remind the minister that Quebecers and Canadians 
are not necessarily demanding to become world leaders; all they 
want are realistic environment policies yielding real and 
tangible results.
<P>
	In conclusion, I can understand the minister's desire to 
improve the management of toxic substances in Canada. In fact, 
the World Wide Fund for Nature reports that the port of 
Hamilton is one the most polluted areas in the Great Lakes. The 
sewage treatment plants located there are not equipped to 
properly process the waste from  surrounding industries and 
generate close to 40 per cent of the PCB burden and 10 per cent 
of the zinc burden in the port. According to the World Wide Fund 
for Nature, decades of pollution in Hamilton have completely 
ruined what used to be first class spawning grounds for many 
fish species.
<P>
	I hope that the policy proposed by the Minister of the 
Environment will enable us to find efficient remedies to solve an 
environmental dilemma we can no longer ignore.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to reply to the environment 
minister's policy statement on toxic substances management.
<P>
	I listened very closely to the minister's speech and for the 
most part I agree that toxic substances in air, water, soil and 
sediment will jeopardize the existence of all living things. I 
agree that if toxic substances are not brought under control 
Canada's environment will suffer. Action should be taken 
immediately rather than later.
<P>
	However, I do not agree with the halting path the minister has 
chosen. The minister's policy applies only to areas under federal 
control. While the federal problem is a serious concern, another 
problem does exist, those industries in the private sector, those 
currently under provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	This is the continuing problem with this minister and her 
department. She introduces policy after policy which might be 
described as nothing but fluff. In other words, they sound great 
but the implementation is later evaluated as disappointing.
<P>
	She never seems to get to the core of the problem of some of 
our biggest polluters. Perhaps there is a reason. Perhaps it is 
more political than sensible.
<P>
	In late April of this year Environment Canada released a 
national pollutant release inventory, an extensive list of 
Canada's worst polluters of toxic chemicals. Among the list 
were some very large companies, primarily from the hub of 
Ontario as well as Montreal.
<P>
	The country's biggest polluter was Kronos Canada in 
Montreal, which dumped 66,000 tonnes of sulphuric acid into 
the water. Another large pollutant was benzine. A total of 3,000 
tonnes of benzine was released countrywide by steel and 
chemical manufacturers. Interestingly enough, Dofasco and 
Stelco Steel in Hamilton combined 882 tonnes, 29.4 per cent of 
the total amount of benzine released in 1993; two large 
companies right smack in the middle of the minister's riding. 
Any political handler would say to the minister stay away from 
that issue. Where is the integrity? Where is the will? One of the 
country's worst polluters of a toxic chemical is in the 
environment minister's backyard and the minister does not want 
to touch it with a ten-foot pole.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13187"> 13187 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	How can she claim to be environmentally friendly? If the 
minister were a true friend of the environment she would put 
politics aside and take action in cleaning up the plants that grace 
her riding. What this country does not need are politicians who 
think first about how things appear for the political image and 
second about real benefits to Canadians. We just need to get on 
with it.
<P>
	This polluters list tells us where the polluters are. Well that is 
fine. Canadians know where they are. What they want to know is 
how they are going to be dealt with. Canadians want actions, not 
just another data base.
<P>
	I will read an interesting quote from the minister regarding 
this data base: ``It is intended to encourage industries to 
voluntarily reduce their releases and develop pollution 
prevention plans''. This is coming from a minister who is 
supporting Bill S-7, which will legislate government 
departments into increasing the number of automobiles using 
alternative fuels, even though the Treasury Board already has 
guidelines for them to do so.
<P>
	The minister is not promising miracles with this policy today. 
One does not have to be a genius to figure that out. The clean up 
of federal contaminated sites will be no small task. In the last 
auditor general's report it was estimated that there are 2,000 to 
3,000 potentially contaminated federal sites, of which 500 to 
1,000 would require immediate remediation. The projected cost 
was a minimum of about a billion dollars. The auditor general's 
report also mentioned that a high priority should be to clean up 
all federal PCB sites, at a cost of perhaps $2 billion.
<P>
	This policy paper does not clearly outline how it will clean up 
these sites. It does not determine where the money will come 
from, and it does not state a deadline when all federal sites 
should be toxic free. I think the minister clearly has some 
questions to answer.
<P>
	Further, with this policy we find out that the one who is going 
to be overseeing the policy will be the commissioner of the 
environment and sustainable development, the office of the 
auditor general. The federal government does not seem to listen 
to what the auditor general says now, so what will change with 
the commissioner, who will only report to the auditor general?
<P>
	The minister says that Canada is sending a message to the 
world that we will do our part to deal with toxic substances. How 
can a strong message be sent when we are only dealing with half 
the problem?
<P>
	Whenever the government initiates something new, it never 
changes the whole picture substantively. It never wants to get 
serious with the issues that mainstream Canadians want. Take 
the federal budget, for example. Canadians wanted a zero deficit 
plan and the government gave us a fraction of a dent to the 
deficit and no long term hope.
<P>
	Another example is the Young Offenders Act. Canadians 
wanted a tougher, more accountable law. Yet the justice minister 
gave Canadians a watered down bill. Now we have this policy 
paper, which the environment minister thinks represents a solid 
foundation for dealing with toxic substances.
<P>
	The Canadian Environmental Protection Act sounds good, but 
in practice has not been sufficiently delivered. The Standing 
Committee on the Environment and Sustainable Development 
will soon be tabling its recommendations to improve CEPA. I 
hope the minister will take heed.
<P>
	We have a fisheries minister who advertises his defence of 
Atlantic fish. Who in the government is defending the Fraser 
River basin and the salmon of the Pacific coast?
<P>
	The Reform Party is not against control of toxic substances. 
Quite the contrary. What we are saying is if there is a problem, 
and in this case the minister has admitted there is, deal with the 
problem comprehensively and not just a fraction of it.
<P>
	I do not have some great scheme of how we could get 
industries like Dofasco and Stelco to reduce or eliminate their 
benzene dumping tomorrow. Then again I do not have thousands 
of employees at Environment Canada to work for me on this one 
either.
<P>
	Cleaning up Canada's environment is a priority of the Reform 
Party and it is a priority of the minister. However, do not do it 
with a policy statement that federal departments can continue to 
ignore. Do it with legislation that is binding and that has some 
real bite.

The first petition is signed by almost 1,000 people, the majority 
coming from Yellowhead.
<P>
	The petitioners call on Parliament to support legislation that 
would repeal and modify existing gun control laws, which have 
not improved public safety, have proven not to be cost effective, 
or have proven to be overly complex so as to be ineffective 
and/or unenforceable.

	<B>Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
second petition I am pleased to present on behalf of Mr. Ken Rij 
of Evansburg, which is in the riding of Yellowhead.
<P>
	The petitioners request that Parliament not amend a code, act, 
or charter in any way that would tend to indicate societal 
approval to include in the prohibited grounds of discrimination 
the undefined phrase sexual orientation.

Question No. 139-<B>Mr. Karygiannis:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>With respect to the Interstate Unemployment Insurance Claims agreement 
since 1992 (<I>a</I>) how many non-Canadian citizens living outside of Canada have 
received benefits, (<I>b</I>) how much has been received by these beneficiaries, (<I>c</I>) how 
much was collected in U.I. premiums from these people, (<I>d</I>) in what states do the 
recipients live and (<I>e</I>) how many of the U.I. recipients collected maternity, 
parental, or sickness benefits?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> The available data on interstate claims 
including those made by Canadians residing in USA for 1992, 
1993 and 1994 revealed the following:
<P>

<IMG SRC="tables/nen2104x01_r0.gif"  ><BR>
<BR><BR>
	Revenue Canada requires 25 per cent of the benefit amount be 
retained at source for income tax. The total number of claims 
represents the actual number of claims received but not the 
number of claimants who actually were eligible for benefits. 
This information is not readily available. We have no available 
data to distinguish if the recipients are non-Canadians, or their 
state(s) of residence.
<P>
	Revenue Canada taxation does not require that employers 
report premiums per individual social insurance number. 
Therefore we cannot specify how much was collected from these 
recipients. We do not have statistics on the claim types such as 
maternity, parental or sickness benefits.
<P>
	Historically the volume of such claims has been too minimal 
to warrant the design of computer programming to keep such 
detailed information as requested.

CO-OPERATIVE LOANS ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-75, an act to amend the Farm Improvement and Marketing 
Co-operatives Loans Act, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. House leader of the Reform 
Party has 27 minutes remaining in his available time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I will assure you that I will be very brief and not 
need anywhere near that time, as I was in the process of 
concluding my remarks when I was interrupted.
<P>
	The priority of governments should be to get out of the 
business of being in business, which includes the granting of 
funds, the involvement in megaprojects and things such as 
FIMCLA and guaranteeing loans to small business.
<P>
	What I was saying in conclusion was that the priorities of 
governments should be first to get out of the business of granting 
handouts, whether they be to business or special interest groups. 
Second, governments should not be in the business of being 
involved in megaprojects, even to the point of loan guarantees; 
they should not be involved in loan guarantees for small 
business and agriculture, and their priorities in getting out 
should be in that order.
<P>
	The reason they should be in that order is because small 
business and farmers are supporting the granting of funds 
through their tax dollars. They are supporting loan guarantees 
that go bad to megaprojects such as the Lloydminster upgrader 
and those types of megaprojects. Hibernia is another example 
that comes to mind. It is the farmers and the small businessmen 
who are paying for the folly of government getting involved in 
these projects. Programs like FIMCLA should not be the first 
ones to go; they should be the last ones to be withdrawn. That is 
the direction in which we have to go.
<P>
<B>(1245 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, miracles 
never seem to happen to me in this House. I listened to the 
Reform Party go on and on, its members first stating they 
support the bill. They then spent almost all of their time saying 
why it was not such a good idea. I am a little confused by that 
approach. It seems they are saying government should not assist 
farmers.
<P>
	Almost one in five workers in the Durham area are farmers 
with 3,500 families who either directly or indirectly owe their 
living to agriculture. The people of Durham very much 
appreciate the federal government's commitment to assist them 
in the capitalization of their farming operations.
<P>
	Sometimes there is a lot of confusion in the House about what 
farmers do and the types of operations they run. Many members 
have talked about how other forms of capital are available to 
farmers, that lending institutions could take up the slack. That is 
not true. The Farm Credit Corporation and this program came 
into existence because the government recognized that 
problems within our capital markets prevent access to capital by 
not only small businesses but farmers in particular.
<P>
	Farming is a capital intensive business. I could probably 
equate it with a utilities company. Everything done in farming 
involves substantial capital: equipment, the farm property, 
barns. Utilities are probably the closest example of similar 
operations that require capital over long periods of time.
<P>
	Our lending institutions are often only interested in short term 
loans, which creates a disequilibrium in the capital markets. 
That is why this is an area government should be involved in. I 
know many of my farm constituents are very happy the federal 
government is part of this process.
<P>
	I would like to speak about some of the specific aspects of Bill 
C-75. Some members have expressed concern over questions of 
overlap and duplication with the provinces. Only two provinces 
have similar programs, Quebec and Alberta. These are the two 
provinces where activity under FIMCLA has shown its greatest 
growth. The arguments about duplication being bad come from 
the very provinces that have utilized this system the most.
<P>
	I heard some of my colleagues in the Bloc talking about how it 
was a failure. Interestingly enough, loan applications in Quebec 
went from 142 in 1990-91 to 1,700 in 1994-95. This is a 
success, hardly a failure. That growth has been largely a result of 
caisse populaire Desjardins' movement to become a lender 
under the program. In Alberta, the provincial government's 
treasury branches now offer FIMCLA loans and concentrate its 
resources in other areas. The concept of duplication is not real in 
this case.
<P>
	Within the federal government we have to consider the 
different roles FIMCLA, Farm Credit Corporation and the Small 
Businesses Loans Act play. Of these FIMCLA is the only 
national loan program that can be accessed by farmers and 
farmer-owner marketing co-ops because FIMCLA loans are 
available from the six major banks. There are banks in almost all 
of our communities but there is not an FCC office in all 
communities. Similarly, the Small Businesses Loans Act is 
really oriented toward small business operations as opposed to 
farmers although farmers can also access this program.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13191"> 13191 </A></B>
<P>
	Every rural centre has a bank or credit union but not all have 
FCC offices. In addition, the Farm Credit Corporation does not 
guarantee loans made by competing commercial lenders. Those 
lenders would not likely welcome audits by the FCC as is 
required under FIMCLA. So there is really no way FIMCLA 
could be offered by the FCC.
<P>
<B>(1250 ) </B>
<P>
	It has also been suggested that FIMCLA should be 
amalgamated with the Small Businesses Loans Act. The 
problem with this idea is that the FIMCLA loss ratio is 
significantly less than the SBLA program. Most FIMCLA loans 
are made to establish farm operations because assets taken as 
security for FIMCLA loans generally have a higher disposable 
value.
<P>
	This gets back to what I was originally saying. Farms are 
highly capitalized, therefore they also have capital to put up for 
credit purposes more so than to some smaller type businesses. 
As a consequence there are fewer loan loss provisions. It would 
be unfair to charge farmers higher interest rates and registration 
fees to subsidize small business loan losses.
<P>
	In addition, most commercial lenders have segregated their 
commercial lending and agricultural lending divisions. 
Government loan guarantee programs currently mirror this 
structure.
<P>
	FIMCLA gives farmers a better interest rate than they could 
normally get and allows them borrowing credit with only 20 per 
cent equity. In other words, they have the ability to get up to 80 
per cent financing on their assets.
<P>
	Finally, there has been some confusion about the meaning of 
the loan cap. The legislation provides that the total amount of 
the loans registered over a rolling five-year period will not 
exceed $1.5 billion. This legislation is really quite simple in that 
it doubles the cap, increasing the total cap to $3 billion within 
the program.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary was saying earlier that we were 
quickly approaching that cap. If we do not pass this legislation 
shortly we will have to curtail the program. I can assure 
members that as the spring work continues on the farms that 
some farmers would be unduly penalized if for some reason this 
legislation did not continue.
<P>
	I repeat, this is the total amount of loans registered over the 
five-year period. It is not the total amount of loans outstanding 
because at any one time repayments have already been made on 
the loans registered in the first four years of the period.
<P>
	In other words, it is a total loan application. Loans come and 
go. The total exposure of the government is substantially less 
than even $1.5 billion today or $3 billion in the future as we 
increase the cap.
<P>
	The government's liability on the program is for defaults. 
Historically these have been very low, around 1 to 1.5 per cent. I 
can assure members that this is a very significant loan loss 
provision. It tells members a lot about our farm communities. It 
tells you that these people pay their bills. In spite of the fact that 
they are highly capitalized, and they do have a high debt 
structure, once again it is because of their type of operations.
<P>
	I know this quite well because I actually farmed at one time. I 
can tell members that every time there was an extra dollar on the 
farm, it seemed to go back into some form of equipment. This is 
why farmers are highly exposed when borrowing.
<P>
	I understand that all the parties I have heard of today are still 
in support of this legislation. I encourage members to pass it 
forthwith.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wonder if the 
member for Durham would comment on a couple of matters. I 
ask his views.
<P>
	Earlier this morning, the member for Frontenac from the Bloc 
Quebecois made the statement that he did not feel that the 
minister of agriculture could represent farmers from the 
province of Quebec because he was not as fluent in both official 
languages as some other people might be. Does the member for 
Durham agree we must be totally fluent in both official 
languages to represent each other?
<P>
	The member for Frontenac certainly professes to know about 
agriculture in Canada. I feel that I know a fair bit about 
agriculture. We may or may not be as fluent in languages as we 
would like to be.
<P>
<B>(1255 ) </B>
<P>
	I compliment the member for Durham on his comments when 
he explained to the House, and hopefully the member for 
Frontenac understands the point he was making, that there are a 
number of management tools and different types of loans that 
need to be available to primary producers and co-operatives in 
Canada. One is the Farm Credit Corporation, which is used for 
land purchases and other major purchases along that line. 
Another example is the farm improvement or the FIMCLA loans 
which are usually used for renovations, improving buildings or 
buying pieces of equipment which are important and can be 
major.
<P>
	Does the hon. member agree that we need these types of 
vehicles? I question the sincerity of the member for Frontenac 
when he says this is a duplication. They are different tools 
serving different purposes.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13192"> 13192 </A></B>
<P>
	Could the member for Durham comment on those two issues?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Shepherd:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question.
<P>
	My experience with the farm community is they can use as 
much help as they can get. Farmers often tell us that they are not 
getting enough access to capital and they wish the government 
would do more.
<P>
	It seems incredible to me that the member for Frontenac 
would try to minimize the amount of access that the farm 
community in Quebec has to the financial institutions in that 
province.
<P>
	Farmers can never have enough. The more people who are 
active in the business of financing farms the better. Certainly the 
federal government has shown for as long as I can remember its 
commitment to farming from sea to sea. I do not believe that the 
farmers of Quebec would want to lose that benefit.
<P>
	The second point that the hon. member made was the concept 
that people cannot be represented here because of one language 
or another. I do not apologize but I am unilingual English. I have 
attempted to learn French from time to time but I have not been 
very successful. I guess I am not a good scholar in languages.
<P>
	The Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food represents all the 
farmers of Canada and has done so ever since I have been here. 
He has been to the GATT and NAFTA negotiations. I know he 
negotiates in the best interest of Canada from sea to sea to sea, 
which includes those interests which affect the farmers of 
Quebec.
<P>
	I am very honoured that the minister of agriculture represents 
the agricultural community as well as he does. He has a very 
balanced approach. He very much tries to balance the interests 
of the agricultural sector in Quebec within the country as he 
does with all provinces. I have heard him on numerous times 
talking about a balanced approach, that we do not trade off one 
sector of commodities against another. That is nothing but good 
for Quebec and Canada and the operations of stable agricultural 
markets within our country.
<P>
	I must confess I do not know the name of the agriculture 
minister in Quebec. I do not know the one in Ontario either. The 
one I do know is the federal minister of agriculture who 
represents us so well.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="BUFFALOANDFORTERIEPUBLICBRIDGECOMPANYACT">BUFFALO AND FORT ERIE PUBLIC BRIDGE COMPANY 
ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (for the Minister of Transport)</B> moved 
that Bill C-81, an act to amend an act respecting the Buffalo and 
Fort Erie Public Bridge Company, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there have been 
discussions between the parties. I believe you will find there is 
unanimous consent to deal with the bill this afternoon at second 
reading, at committee of the whole and at third reading.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maloney:</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to 
speak this afternoon on Bill C-81, an act to amend an act 
respecting the Buffalo and Fort Erie Public Bridge Company, 
which is the formal name of what we in southern Ontario and 
western New York State refer to as the Peace bridge authority.
<P>
	I will give a little background on the Peace bridge authority. 
The authority was incorporated in 1923 under a special act of 
Parliament, following which the construction of the 
international bridge commenced in 1925 and was completed in 
1927. An act respecting the Buffalo and Fort Erie Bridge 
Company was enacted in 1934. It empowered the authority to 
acquire, hold and manage the property and assets within Canada.
<P>
	The authority owns and operates the Peace bridge and has 10 
appointed members, five Canadian and five American. The 
authority is profitable and has no outstanding long term debt. It 
is self sufficient with any profits being used to improve and 
maintain the facility.
<P>
	The Peace bridge and this act is very important to Fort Erie, 
the Niagara peninsula, the province of Ontario and Canada as a 
whole. The Peace bridge is located at the Niagara River crossing 
between Buffalo, New York and Fort Erie, Ontario. It is the 
second busiest cross-border highway link between Canada and 
the United States. More than 300 million vehicles have crossed 
the bridge since it opened in 1927.
<P>
	In 1994 the bridge carried nearly eight million vehicles. Over 
one million or 14 per cent of these were trucks. It is estimated 
that $65 million worth of trade crosses the bridge daily.
<P>
	As a result of continued expansion and development of 
international trade and traffic between the province of Ontario 
and the eastern United States, passenger car traffic and freight 
truck and other commercial traffic over the Peace bridge into 
and from Ontario has steadily increased over the years. 
Commercial traffic increased to 975,000 vehicles in 1993, an 
increase of 5.8 per cent when compared to 1992. When 
comparing 1992 to 1991, commercial traffic increased by 11.6 
per cent.
<P>
	In recent years particularly increases in traffic flow have 
accelerated due to regional and economic factors and 
international agreements between the two countries, including 
but not limited to the Canada-U.S. free trade agreement, the 
North American free trade agreement and GATT. This has 
resulted in substantial increases in congestion on the bridge and 
the adjacent Peace bridge plazas.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13193"> 13193 </A></B>
<P>
	Congestion is now at the point where it is not uncommon for 
traffic to back up on and sometimes across the entire bridge to 
and from Canada. This has resulted in substantial traffic tie-ups 
on the Queen Elizabeth highway and on local streets in Fort Erie 
as well as similar problems on the New York State thruway, the 
Peace bridge plazas and on local streets in Buffalo. The 
congestion problems presently being experienced on the bridge 
will only increase in the future.
<P>
	To improve traffic flow, the authority plans to implement a 
10-year $89 million capital improvement project called the 
gateway project. This project will have a positive economic 
impact on both sides of the border.
<P>
	In Fort Erie alone over $58 million will be spent on 
improvements that include: $11.6 million for a new commercial 
facility for Canada bound commercial traffic which will house 
Revenue Canada's commercial customs operations, commercial 
brokers and freight package firms; another $25 million on a 
commercial vehicle processing centre for U.S. bound 
commercial vehicles; and another $4.3 million for a Canadian 
gateway complete with new customs booths that will serve as a 
landmark for residents and tourists entering Canada. It truly will 
be a gateway to Canada, a gateway to the province of Ontario 
and a gateway to my riding of Erie.
<P>
	A further $17.6 million will be spent on bridge painting and 
structural improvements. The bridge is presently painted with a 
lead based paint which must be removed for environmental 
reasons. It will be expensive, but is very necessary.
<P>
	On the U.S. side there will be upgrading of the traffic plaza 
and the Buffalo terminus to the bridge which will include a 
reconfigured plaza providing improved access to major 
highways and into downtown Buffalo.
<P>
	It can be appreciated that these proposals will translate into 
short term construction jobs and long term administrative jobs 
with a tremendous economic spin off impact throughout the 
region.
<P>
	The bill also allows for a borrowing increase for the current 
projects that I have just mentioned. The amendments to the act 
will allow the authority to increase its borrowing authority from 
$50 million to $100 million. The authority's reputable financial 
adviser has reviewed the financial plans of the authority and has 
indicated that it has the capacity to borrow this sum of money.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	I would like to emphasize that there are no costs to the 
Canadian government associated with the amendments. Section 
6 of the current act specifically protects the government from 
liability for the authority's debt in the event of a default. All 
borrowing costs will be borne by the users of this facility.
<P>
	I was concerned with the user pay implications for my 
constituents as we now enjoy very reasonable bridge tolls on the 
Peace bridge. Tolls will have to be increased to fund the 
necessary bridge improvements. I am assured however that they 
will remain competitive with tolls charged at other international 
bridge crossings in the Niagara region and southern Ontario.
<P>
	The Peace bridge authority is very sensitive to this issue. 
Presently the passenger tolls are the cheapest of all bridge 
crossings in the Niagara region. Owners of commercial vehicles 
will continue to pay slightly higher tolls than those charged at 
the adjacent crossings. They will benefit from reduced costs 
resulting from the shorter line ups at the border. The authority is 
fully cognizant that excessively high tolls would divert traffic to 
other crossings and will act accordingly.
<P>
	I was also concerned about the debt servicing of these loans 
and the ability of the authority to meet its financial obligations. I 
have been assured that the authority's debt repayment plan is 
sound. The need for this government to satisfy its concerns on 
this issue and on the environmental impact are the reasons for an 
almost one year indepth study and the necessary delay of this 
bill getting to the floor of the House. This government has acted 
cautiously and prudently.
<P>
	I was very concerned about the environmental impact of the 
proposed capital project as well, but my concerns have been 
satisfied. Pursuant to section 5 of the Canadian Environmental 
Assessment Act, the bridge is not required to be subjected to a 
specific federal environmental assessment.
<P>
	Given the potential impact of a commercial vehicle 
processing centre project on adjacent neighbourhoods in the 
town of Fort Erie and the fact that all transborder functions are a 
clear federal responsibility, Transport Canada completed an 
environmental screening of the commercial vehicle project in 
November 1994. The environmental screening determined that 
the commercial vehicle project may proceed as its 
environmental impact is either insignificant or mitigable with 
known technology. The authority has agreed to comply with the 
recommended mitigation measures. The commercial vehicle 
processing centre also meets all local, regional and provincial 
land use and environmental requirements which I think is very 
important.
<P>
	Consequently, the decision to increase the borrowing power 
and transfer administrative powers will have no adverse 
environmental impact. Other initiatives under the gateway 
project will be assessed if need be in accordance with the 
requirements of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13194"> 13194 </A></B>
<P>
	The legislation before us today also deals with the issue of 
future requests for increases in borrowing. This legislation 
gives the governor in council the power to fix the authority's 
borrowing limit at an amount greater than $100 million if a 
need can be shown. We can avoid the need for future legislative 
amendments which become costly and time consuming and are 
basically administrative in nature.
<P>
	This administrative change will give the Peace bridge 
authority additional flexibility to meet more immediate 
operational needs and future major capital requirements. The 
simplified procedure will be more responsive for the Peace 
bridge authority.
<P>
	The reduced time required to authorize an increase in the 
borrowing limit will also be less costly for taxpayers. Any 
increases of this nature will still be thoroughly reviewed before 
authorization by the Minister of Finance and the Minister of 
Transport. As a matter of note, such review would also be 
undertaken in the state of New York.
<P>
	The act also provides for a transfer of authority. It is 
understood that the Minister of Transport has the prime 
responsibility in co-ordinating the role for federal policy on the 
international crossings. Of all the international bridge 
crossings, the Peace Bridge is the only one that comes under the 
authority of the Minister of Finance. This change therefore is an 
administrative rationalization. The transfer of legislative 
responsibility between ministers will correct what can be 
referred to as an administrative anomaly, as it is understood that 
the Minister of Transport again has the primary responsibility.
<P>
	There are currently 24 international highway crossings 
between Canada and the United States. The Minister of 
Transport is directly involved in three that are federally 
controlled: the seaway, Thousand Islands and Blue Water 
bridges. Furthermore, some of these international crossings 
combine rail functions which are also the responsibility of the 
Minister of Transport.
<P>
	It should be pointed out that Transport Canada assumes 
certain responsibilities associated with all 24 international 
crossings, such as policy directives, system planning, granting 
of construction and operating permits, environmental 
assessments and as previously mentioned, ownership in certain 
cases.
<P>
	These activities are being co-ordinated and more often than 
not are being carried out jointly with our U.S. counterpart, the 
federal Secretary of Transportation, who shares similar 
responsibilities. In fact, in the United States all international 
crossing matters are dealt with through the International Bridge 
Act of 1972. It authorizes the United States president, secretary 
of state and secretary of transportation to negotiate, co-ordinate 
and sign international agreements in order to allow these 
crossings to be built, operated and maintained.
<P>
<B>(1310 ) </B>
<P>
	Therefore, transferring responsibility to the Minister of 
Transport will result in streamlining the relationship between 
the minister and the various bridge operators, whether private or 
public, dedicated public authority or provincial government. It 
will also facilitate the process of dealing with our U.S. 
counterparts. As well it will indicate to Canadians that this 
government is committed to efficiencies in public 
administration.
<P>
	Henceforth, both the New York state and U.S. federal 
governments will be able to deal more effectively through the 
Minister of Transport. The minister and his U.S. counterpart 
meet regularly, particularly as a result of the North American 
free trade agreement, in order to facilitate the transborder 
movement of people and goods. International crossings are 
often a priority topic at these meetings.
<P>
	The transfer of responsibility to the Minister of Transport will 
indicate to the various bridge operators that the current 
Transport Canada policy of promoting and supporting 
decentralized commercialized operations will be maintained 
and enhanced.
<P>
	I will not say that these initiatives have been without their 
opponents who legitimately questioned debt servicing concerns 
and the environmental impact on adjacent neighbourhoods, 
especially as it relates to noise and pollution. In particular, the 
residents whose homes will border on the commercial vehicle 
processing centre had some very real concerns. I am satisfied 
that these concerns have been met.
<P>
	I urge the authority notwithstanding to take its role as a 
community partner very seriously and to be mindful of its 
responsibilities to these community concerns. To date it has met 
these responsibilities and I am confident it will continue to do 
so.
<P>
	There is no doubt in my mind that these upgrades and new 
facilities are urgently required. The planned improvements of 
the gateway project will speed the movement of traffic, 
particularly trucks, across the bridge. Streamlining the flow of 
bona fide cross border traffic is in keeping with the more 
liberalized international trade environment under the NAFTA. 
The importance of cross border trade in our community is 
enormous. The benefits of these improvements will be felt 
throughout the region, throughout the province and throughout 
our country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Bill C-81 is the bill before us.
<P>
	The Buffalo and Fort Erie Bridge Company is a company 
formed by the Government of Canada in co-operation with the 
Government of the United States. The increased traffic on the 
international bridge resulting from the free trade agreement, 
which, it will be remembered, the Liberals opposed vigorously 
at the time, has now necessitated construction work.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13195"> 13195 </A></B>
<P>
	The bill will accordingly allow the company to borrow up 
to $100 million on the private market through bond issues. This 
$100 million will help to pay for part of the Gateway project-a 
ten year $144 million project. Construction is planned on both 
sides of the border. It should be noted that the Government of 
Canada does not guarantee the $100 million loans. 
Theoretically, then, these loans are not binding on the 
Government of Canada.
<P>
	The need to increase the borrowing power of the company will 
also enable the government to correct an anomaly. This bridge is 
the only one to come under the authority of the Minister of 
Finance. All the other international cross-border highways are 
the responsibility of the Minister of Transport, and the bill 
assigns him responsibility for this bridge as well.
<P>
	A third aspect of this bill is that in order to facilitate future 
increases in the borrowing power of the Buffalo and Fort Erie 
Public Bridge Company, the governor in council is authorized 
by this bill to increase the borrowing limit.
<P>
	It should be noted that the bridge authority must cover its 
expenses and that moneys spent to improve the bridge will be 
recovered through an increase in traffic and tolls.
<P>
	For all these reasons, we support this bill, all the more so 
because the Bloc Quebecois has always supported the 
liberalization of trade and the NAFTA. The increased traffic on 
the bridge is a good example of the economic benefit to both 
countries of this liberalization. In opposing the free trade 
agreement, the Liberals showed at that time that they were 
unable to take economic decisions that would benefit Canada.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	By proposing legislation in this House today that would help 
the bridge handle the increase in traffic resulting from this 
agreement that they so vigorously opposed, the Liberals are 
making amends, and in the same spirit I would be prepared to let 
bygones be bygones.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
my pleasure today to inform the House the Reform Party is 
supporting Bill C-81.
<P>
	The bill amends the act for the Buffalo and Fort Erie Public 
Bridge Company, the company responsible for the Peace bridge 
linking Fort Erie and Canada with the city of Buffalo in the 
United States.
<P>
	The Peace bridge is the second busiest border crossing 
highway link between Canada and the United States. This bridge 
carried nearly 8 million vehicles in 1994. One million of these 
were trucks containing over $20 billion of traded goods.
<P>
	With the implementation of our trade agreements and as a 
result of positive economic conditions, the Peace bridge finds 
itself not quite up to the task of facilitating smooth traffic flows.
<P>
	Commercial traffic has accelerated to the point where there is 
a lot of congestion on the bridge and at the adjacent plazas. This 
has caused traffic jams on the access roads and local streets on 
both sides of the border.
<P>
	To ensure the bridge can facilitate all trade and traffic, the 
bridge authority would like to implement bridge improvements 
called the gateways project.
<P>
	To finance the gateways project, the bridge authority intends 
to market two 30-year bond issues in the United States totalling 
$70 million in 1995 and 1997. It will use its toll revenue to 
service this debt.
<P>
	We in the Reform Party recognize that strong north-south 
infrastructure links are crucial to building on trade agreements 
we have implemented with United States.
<P>
	If these infrastructure projects can be financed by the private 
sector, so much the better. It is our understanding that the bridge 
authority is profitable and has no long term outstanding debt. It 
is also our understanding that the government is protected from 
liability should the bridge authority ever default on debts in the 
future.
<P>
	Since the federal government is not financially responsible 
for the Buffalo and Fort Erie Public Bridge Company, it is 
appropriate for the governor in council to approve borrowing 
increases.
<P>
	In the future we will have to look at a different way of 
financing these projects. There will have to be more 
infrastructure financed by the private sector, by municipalities, 
as we cannot sustain these from the federal government. That 
would be looking down the road and I hope that approach could 
be used.
<P>
	The other reservation we have is that the bridge authority 
should be held accountable in its meetings to the public. If 
various parties want to present briefs on the effects of toll 
increases or any environmental concerns, these briefs should be 
available to the public.
<P>
	With this reservation, the Reform Party would support the 
bill.

	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, and as the anniversary of the original 
Official Languages Act approaches (1969-1994), the government should 
thoroughly assess the way the act is applied in Canada by appointing some 
individual to carry out a detailed and balanced review of the work done so far, 
and reaffirm Parliament's commitment to a just and adequate policy on official 
languages.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to rise today to 
begin debate on this private member's motion which calls for a 
review of the Official Languages Act.
<P>
	This motion may seem familiar to members, and so it should. 
It originally appeared on the order of precedence last fall as 
M-107. At that time it was sponsored by Ottawa-Vanier MP 
Jean-Robert Gauthier who, as we know, has since moved on to 
the other place.
<P>
	When Mr. Gauthier answered the call from above his worthy 
motion was dropped from the order of precedence. More than 
likely Mr. Gauthier and I have different motives for bringing 
this motion forward. The fact that I have chosen to do so speaks 
to the credibility of the motion and the widely held view that the 
Official Languages Act is not working as it was intended.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	The Reform Party supports individual bilingualism but we 
oppose enforced bilingualism as dictated by the Official 
Languages Act. We would replace the Official Languages Act 
with legislation reflecting the philosophy of territorial 
bilingualism. We believe the primary responsibility for 
language and culture should rest with the provinces. Parliament 
and other key federal government institutions would continue to 
offer bilingual services.
<P>
	Why do I say the act is not working? A quick look at the 
Commissioner of Official Languages 1994 annual report 
provides us with some insight into this claim. According to the 
commissioner our audits showed that French does not have 
equitable status as a language of work in the national capital 
region. He went on to say the shortcomings are essentially the 
same in Quebec and in Ontario.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This is what our present commissioner had to say about the 
act. A look back reveals that his predecessors shared a similar 
point of view. Former commissioner D'Iberville Fortier said: 
``It seems to me that we are clearly not at the point where we can 
claim to have translated the act into action in a manner that is 
judicious, consistent and unequivocal''.
<P>
	In a similar vein, former commissioner Max Yalden accused 
the government of being inconsistent, unimaginative and 
indiscriminate in its implementation of the act.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The first Commissioner of Official Languages, Keith Spicer, 
was often critical of the government's implementation of the 
act. His 1991 report ``Citizens' Forum on Canada's Future'' 
clearly spelled out Canadians' view on the issue:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The view was often expressed that Canada's official languages policy has 
contributed significantly to the current crisis, including animosity toward 
Quebec and/or toward French. Frequently used terms describe bilingualism as 
divisive and as breaking up the country.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>An independent review of the application of the official languages policy is badly 
needed to clear the air, with a view to ensuring that it is fair and sensible. Otherwise 
there is risk that rising public dissatisfaction and misunderstanding will lead to  </BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13197"> 13197 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>rejection of the policy as a whole with irreparable damage to the principles of 
linguistic equality in federal institutions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>One purpose of the review should be to make clear to Canadians the cost and 
benefits of official languages policy and activities and explain far more clearly its 
goals and methods. Such a review should evaluate public information efforts as 
well as investigate all of the public's expressed concerns.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This recommendation, like all the others contained in the $25 
million document, was ignored by the government of the day, 
just as the Liberals continue to ignore the views of the thousands 
of Canadians who took part in this process. Despite this lack of 
government attention to the concerns expressed by Canadians, 
that recommendation is as valid today as it was in June 1991.
<P>
	The people intimately involved with the act, the 
commissioners, say the act is not working as it should.
<P>
<B>(1330 ) </B>
<P>
	Other noted Canadians share this sentiment. In an interview 
celebrating the 20th anniversary of the founding of the B and B 
commission, nine of the commissioners talked about their 
original work and how it had been implemented by the Official 
Languages Act. Mrs. Gertrude Laing was less than 
complimentary about the way the act had been implemented in 
the public service. In discussing the wholesale creation of 
bilingual positions and the massive second language training 
program, Mrs. Laing said that they ``failed to respect 
individuals' feelings and needs, fears and aspirations''.
<P>
	On those same issues co-chairman Davidson Dutton 
commented that it was ``two steps forward and one step back''. 
Mr. Paul Lacoste, in discussing language of work, lamented the 
decision not to follow the commission recommendation to set up 
unilingual language work units and called the language of work 
policy in the public service a failure.
<P>
	Similarly Mr. J. B. Rudnyckyj regretted that the Official 
Languages Act contained such weak provisions with respect to 
Canada's ethnic minorities. All the commissioners were 
disappointed that bilingual districts had never been proclaimed 
as they were a key feature of the blueprint for equal partnership.
<P>
	Gilles Lalande, deputy commissioner of official languages 
from 1980 to 1985 and co-secretary of the B and B commission 
also called the bilingual districts a cornerstone of language 
reform but said the subject had received little more than lip 
service and empty declarations of intent. He also said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The language reform envisaged by the B and B commissioners never took 
place.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Mr. Lalande was equally pessimistic about the act itself 
saying:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Implementation of the act remains fragmentary and tentative.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He concluded by saying:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We have to admit that collectively we may have been overly ambitious and 
taken the wrong tack. It is high time to get our priorities straight.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Other prominent Canadians have also questioned the validity 
of the current act. Professors Denise Réume and Leslie Green in 
their 1991 article published in ``The Network on the 
Constitution'' wrote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The main goal of any language policy should be to promote linguistic justice. 
Nothing in the conventional analysis even addresses this question.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Noted Concordia University sociologist Hubert Guindon 
stated in a 1978 article: ``No matter how lofty its ideals, the 
legacy of the political disaster created by'' the federal ``official 
language policy is there for everyone to see''. According to 
Professor Guindon, the act hinders rather than facilitates the 
changes needed as a consequence of the social modernization of 
the Quebecois. It contributes to a climate of ambiguity for 
immigrants in Quebec and uncertainty for the large private 
corporate sector in Quebec.
<P>
	We have seen that several language commissioners, 
bureaucrats and academics believe the act has failed. If we 
return to the Spicer forum for a minute we could also see that 
average Canadians hold similar views. I have heard that 
firsthand in the west.
<P>
	Here are a few short quotes from that 1991 report:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Pierre Trudeau's vision of a multicultural and bilingual society for Canada 
was a noble one, but it is apparent now that it simply will not work.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Hogwash.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> ``Bilingualism has failed''. It continues:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Two languages should be an asset, but administration of ``official 
bilingualism'' has taken a potentially wonderful and unifying asset and made it 
hurtful and divisive.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I could go on with many more such quotes expressed by 
average Canadians, but I believe this sampling gives a very good 
picture of the public's attitude toward the act.
<P>
	If I heard ``hogwash'' from across the way, referring to what 
ordinary people are saying, I resent it. Canadians should have 
the right to express their opinion, especially on commissions 
such as the Spicer commission.
<P>
	Now that we have clearly established the shortcomings of the 
act it is time to address the merits of the motion as it pertains to 
reviewing the act.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	In his 1975 annual report on official languages, 
Commissioner Spicer wrote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>But surely there is merit in keeping more meaningful accounts. Without 
them, those dealing with language reform will have to continue waffling on the 
recurring questions of costs-hearing, but being unable to contradict 
convincingly such delicious polemical estimates-as $3 billion per year for 
bilingualism.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13198"> 13198 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It would seem more sensible to pull the whole lot of linguistic items together, specify 
the purpose for each, tote up the terrifying sum, add 10 per cent for integrated cost, then 
publish and defend the thing as the high but necessary price for being Canadian.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Those words were written 20 years ago but have been ignored 
ever since. I am not here to make any wild claims about the cost 
of official languages because the truth is that I do not know the 
cost. The truth is that no one knows the cost.
<P>
	Why do we not know the cost? It is because the accounting 
practices used for these programs have taken more twists and 
turns than contestants in a Chubby Checker dance-a-thon.
<P>
	Mr. Spicer knew this in 1975 and the government knows it 
today but refuses to act. On two separate occasions I put motions 
before the Standing Joint Committee on Official Languages but 
was turned down both times. That is why I am getting rid of 
some of my frustration in proposing the motion originally put 
forward by Jean-Robert Gauthier.
<P>
	The people in this committee say that we have the numbers 
from the commissioner and there is no need for verification. 
However the truth is that the numbers are not verified in any 
meaningful way. The commissioner gets the numbers from the 
Treasury Board which he accepts at face value. Treasury Board 
produces these numbers based on cost reports produced by all 
departments and agencies.
<P>
	The guidelines for producing the reports clearly state that 
certain costs are not to be counted, such as the person years and 
salaries of employees taking language training as well as those 
of staff hired to replace the employees on language training. 
They do not count those costs.
<P>
	Treasury Board says that its books are open to the auditor 
general, but if the books do not contain all the information it is 
difficult to conduct a thorough audit. It must also be stated that 
the auditor general has never turned his attention to the full 
range of language policies and programs.
<P>
	We know that in 1991 the auditor general looked at the 
Translation Bureau, found many problems and concluded:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It became clear the Translation Bureau would have to undergo major changes 
to correct the weaknesses we identified.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In 1993 a follow up audit was conducted and the following 
conclusion was reached:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Despite these efforts, however, we note that significant weaknesses still exist. 
We are particularly concerned about cost reduction.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is but one small area of the official languages program. 
After 26 years has not the time come to fully probe the entire 
menagerie created by the Official Languages Act?
<P>
	The only question that remains is: Who should carry out such 
an important review? I have already stated that the official 
languages committee has no desire to perform such a task. Nor 
would it be the appropriate body as it is out of step with the 
demographic and linguistic realities of Canada. It would also be 
impractical to impose this duty on any parliamentary committee 
as they are dominated by the Liberal government which I believe 
is committed to the status quo.
<P>
	My motion simply calls for the appointment of someone to 
conduct a thorough and balanced review of the work done so far. 
This someone should be the auditor general. The office of the 
auditor general is highly respected by all Canadians. It is at 
arm's length from Parliament and therefore free from political 
interference. The auditor general is already on the payroll, 
meaning there will be no extra cost to the taxpayer to conduct 
this vital review.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As indicated in the Reform Party's blue sheet, we support the 
concept of official bilingualism. However, we do not approve 
the way the act has been implemented during the past 26 years. 
That act was never subjected to a complete review. This is 
totally unacceptable to those who care about the linguistic 
policy's integrity.
<P>
	It should also be mentioned that the B and B commission 
correctly pointed out that each province is the ultimate authority 
on its own territory. Consequently, any future linguistic reform 
should be conducted through the provincial authorities. The 
Reform Party shares these views but, unfortunately, the 
principle is not found in the act as such.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Over the past nearly 20 minutes I have illustrated the 
shortcomings in the act as seen by official languages 
commissioners, bureaucrats, academics and average Canadians. 
I have stated logically why we must revisit the act and who 
should carry out the review: the auditor general.
<P>
	The issue of language has proven to be the subject of very 
emotional and sometimes illogical debate in the House. We have 
seen it directly within the year. It is regrettable as the issue is far 
too important to be reduced to such a level of squabbling and 
name calling. Therefore I call on all members of the House to be 
cognizant of the sensitivity of the issue as they enter into debate 
today and in the coming months.
<P>
	I bring the motion forward in the hope of furthering open and 
honest discussions on Canada's language policy. Partisanship 
and ideology will do nothing to enhance a true exchange of 
ideas.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13199"> 13199 </A></B>
<P>
	I appreciate the opportunity to share my thoughts and look 
forward to hearing some intelligent and thought provoking 
debate on the motion before the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
happy to have the opportunity to speak to the motion presented 
by the hon. member for Nanaimo-Cowichan.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The motion being debated today includes two proposals. The 
first one is that the government should thoroughly assess the 
way the Official Languages Act is applied in Canada, by 
appointing an individual to carry out a detailed and balanced 
review of the work done so far. The second proposal is that the 
government should reaffirm Parliament's commitment to a just 
and adequate policy on official languages. These are good 
intentions, no doubt about that.
<P>
	However, do we not already have all the required processes to 
ensure that the act is properly applied and to see how it is 
implemented? I listened carefully to the hon. member's speech. 
It is true that the implementation of the Official Languages Act 
could be improved. It is that aspect that we, parliamentarians, 
should look at.
<P>
	I heard about a number of flaws, but I did not hear anything 
about the positive aspects, and that makes me feel 
uncomfortable.
<P>
	I also want to say that, from what I understood, the former MP, 
now a senator, had proposed something very similar in terms of 
assessing the way the act is applied across the country, from 
coast to coast. He was interested in reviewing the application of 
the act. So, I will discuss the topic from this perspective.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Let me explain. A number of mechanisms are available today. 
The Official Languages Act confers very clear responsibilities 
and rather precise mandates on three federal departments with 
respect to its application. These are the departments of justice, 
treasury board and Canadian heritage.
<P>
	The Department of Justice has special responsibilities in the 
area of the administration of justice in both official languages 
under the act. The act clearly stipulates that English and French 
are the official languages of the federal courts and that either 
language may be used by any person in any oral or written 
proceedings.
<P>
	The act further stipulates that the federal government is 
required to use the official language chosen by the other parties 
in a civil case to which it is a party before a federal court and that 
any final decision, order or judgment issued by any federal court 
must be made available simultaneously in both official 
languages under the circumstances specified in the legislation.
<P>
	These are fundamental rights which guarantee all Canadians, 
whether they are English speaking or French speaking equal 
access to justice. This access is reinforced by the fact that the 
Official Languages Act requires all federal institutions, 
including the federal courts, to comply with the provisions of 
the act.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The second department with a specific mandate regarding 
official languages is Treasury Board. It is responsible for 
developing and co-ordinating the official language policies and 
programs of our federal institutions.
<P>
	Treasury Board's mandate covers all federal institutions, 
including Crown corporations, and all agencies which have 
obligations regarding official languages under any other federal 
act. By virtue of the scope of its mandate under the Official 
Languages Act, Treasury Board is a key player in the 
management of the official languages program.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is the responsibility of treasury board to ensure that federal 
institutions respect official language obligations regarding 
services to the public and the language of work with regard to 
the language of services. Federal institutions are required to 
provide services to the Canadian public in the official language 
of its choice in those locations and under the circumstances 
prescribed by the legislation.
<P>
	Federal institutions have a further obligation to inform the 
public of the availability of services in the official language of 
its choice.
<P>
	The official languages regulations adopted in 1991 identify 
the circumstances under which federal institutions are required 
to provide their services to and communicate with the public in 
both official languages. These regulations are essential to the 
application of the legislative framework enacted to ensure that 
Canadians receive the services they require from federal 
institutions in the official language of their choice.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In so-called bilingual regions, federal institutions must also 
provide a work environment which promotes the use of both 
official languages in the circumstances covered by the act. In 
particular, the federal institutions in question must provide 
bilingual human resources and central services, among others, 
to their employees, and must provide them with the general and 
common working tools in the language of their choice.
<P>
	They must ensure that supervision is available to employees 
in both official languages, when this will contribute to the 
creation of a work environment promoting the use of both 
official languages. These institutions must also ensure that 
senior managers are functional in both official languages and 
that general and common information technology tools can be 
used in both official language. Lastly, federal institutions must 
be  able to provide a comparable level of service in either 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13200"> 13200 </A></B>
<P>
official language from one predominantly unilingual region to 
another.
<P>
	The third element of the program, the equal representation of 
French speaking and English speaking Canadians, bears witness 
to the commitment of the government and Parliament to official 
languages.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	This commitment means that federal institutions must ensure 
that their workforce reflects the presence of both linguistic 
communities in the Canadian population. Under the terms of 
this commitment, federal institutions must see to it that French 
and English speaking Canadians alike have equal employment 
and promotion opportunities.
<P>
[English] 
<P>
	It is the responsibility of treasury board to see to it that federal 
institutions effectively fulfil their legal obligations under parts 
IV, V and VI of the act and to report to Parliament annually on 
the status of official languages within the federal institutions 
covered by its mandate.
<P>
	To this end, treasury board has been given the authority to 
recommend regulations and to give effect to the provisions of 
the act. It is also empowered to issue directives, to monitor and 
to audit the general compliance of federal institutions with 
official languages policies, directives and regulations. Treasury 
board may also evaluate the effectiveness of policies and 
programs of federal institutions and provide the public and 
federal employees with information on these policies and 
programs.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	These are powers that the Treasury Board exercises every day 
in one way or another. These powers enable the Treasury Board 
to ensure not only that federal institutions fulfil their 
obligations but also that Canadians receive the services they 
need in the official language of their choice where prescribed by 
law and that they have equal employment and promotion 
opportunities in federal institutions.
<P>
	The third federal department given specific responsibilities in 
terms of official languages, which I mentioned earlier, is the 
Department of Canadian Heritage. This department is 
responsible for encouraging and promoting a co-ordinated 
approach to the implementation by federal institutions of the 
government's commitment to enhance the vitality of official 
language minorities and to promote both French and English in 
Canadian society.
<P>
	I had so many things to say, but I am coming to the end of my 
10 minutes. I would simply want to add that I have not yet 
mentioned the fourth major player, the Commissioner of 
Official Languages, who also plays a key role in this matter. The 
Commissioner of Official Languages has the duty to ensure 
recognition of the  status of each of the official languages and 
compliance with the spirit and intent of the act, in particular as 
regards the advancement of French and English in Canadian 
society.
<P>
	Unfortunately, I must conclude my presentation. I had so 
many things to say, but if some of my colleagues are interested 
in my speech, I am ready to share it with them.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, let me start by restating the motion before us today, 
for the benefit of those who are watching us: As the Official 
Languages Act is 26 years old, it deem it important that the 
government thoroughly assess the way the act is applied in the 
country by appointing someone to carry out a detailed and 
balanced review of the work done so far and reaffirm 
Parliament's commitment to a just and adequate policy on 
official languages.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois will have no difficulty voting for this 
motion. In fact, I requested almost exactly the same thing in a 
speech I made in this House on October 3. Let us look at where 
the need for this assessment comes from.
<P>
	The Official Languages Act stems from the Royal 
Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism set up by Prime 
Minister Lester B. Pearson in 1963. The act was ultimately 
passed in 1969 by the Trudeau government in response to the 
sense of urgency felt at the time.
<P>
	We will recall that the early 1960s were marked by the first 
manifestations of the FLQ, which were symptoms of profound 
discontent within Canada.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	In fact, in a preliminary report issued in February 1965, the B 
and B Commission, as it was nicknamed in those days, stated 
that measures were urgently required as Canada was undergoing 
a major crisis.
<P>
	According to a booklet published by the federal government 
and entitled <I>Official Languages Act in Brief</I>, the objectives of 
the act are as follows: first, to ensure respect for English and 
French as the official languages of Canada, and equal status, 
rights and privileges for these languages in federal institutions. 
Second, to support the development of English and French 
language minority communities and to encourage the 
acceptance and use of both English and French in Canadian 
society.	Third, to set out the powers and duties of federal institutions in the area of official languages.
<P>
	The document also points out that the provisions of the 
Official Languages Act stem from the linguistic rights 
guaranteed by the Constitution. So, the Official Languages Act 
provides that Parliament and the federal courts must work in 
both official languages; that the federal government must 
provide its 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13201"> 13201 </A></B>
<P>
services in both official languages, based on certain conditions, 
and that it is committed to achieving full and equal participation 
of the two official linguistic groups. Since it was reviewed in 
1988, the act also provides that the Minister of Heritage  is 
committed to enhancing the vitality of linguistic minority 
communities, while also being responsible for co-ordinating the 
efforts of the various departments toward the fulfilment of that 
objective.
<P>
	It is also important to take a look at the preamble of the 
Official Languages Act. It says that the Constitution provides 
that English and French are the official languages of Canada and 
have equality of status and equal rights and privileges as to their 
use in all institutions of the Parliament. It also provides that the 
public can communicate with these federal institutions in either 
official language; that public servants should have equal 
opportunities to use the official language of their choice while 
working; that English-speaking and French-speaking 
Canadians should, without regard to their ethnic origin or first 
language learned, have equal opportunities to obtain 
employment in the institutions of the Parliament and 
government of Canada; and, finally, that the federal government 
is committed to enhancing the vitality of linguistic minority 
communities.
<P>
	Given all these good intentions, what is the situation, after 
more than 25 years under the Official Languages Act? There are 
a number of criteria that can help us determine the positive or 
negative impact of this legislation, including assimilation rate, 
education, income, availability of federal services in the 
minority language and, finally, language of work of federal 
employees.
<P>
	The situation in Canada's francophone and Acadian 
communities is certainly not as rosy as the official line would 
have us believe. In fact, there is every indication that the 
francophone community outside Quebec is being assimilated, is 
losing ground where education is concerned, is getting poorer 
and generally does not have access to the federal services to 
which it is entitled in its own language. Furthermore, most 
francophones in the federal public service have to work in 
English. Warnings come regularly from spokespersons for these 
communities and the Commissioner of Official Languages. 
Apparently, to no avail.
<P>
	Let us take a closer look at some of those criteria. First, the 
assimilation rate. To calculate the assimilation rate, we take the 
total number of persons who say their mother tongue is French 
and subtract the number of persons who tell the census taker that 
French is still the language spoken in the home.
<P>
	According to information provided by Statistics Canada, 
between 1971, the year of the first census that included 
questions on language, and 1991, the year of the latest census, 
the assimilation rate of francophones outside Quebec rose from 
27 per cent to 34.8 per cent.
<P>
	French is losing ground across the country, including in New 
Brunswick, the only bilingual province, where the assimilation 
rate is still 8.4 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1400) </B>
<P>
	Of course, the trend is more dramatic in communities in 
western Canada. In British Columbia, for instance, it was 71.8 
per cent in the 1991 census; in Alberta, 64.4 per cent; in Ontario, 
although the province has the largest francophone minority, the 
assimilation rate was 36.7 per cent, an increase of ten points 
over 1971.
<P>
	In other words, English is spoken in the home by 71 per cent 
of francophones living in British Columbia; 64 per cent in 
Alberta; and 36.7 per cent of francophones in Ontario. It should 
therefore come as no surprise that Bob Rae, the present Premier 
of Ontario, said on CBC radio that, unfortunately, there were not 
enough francophones in Ontario for the province to become 
officially bilingual. Naturally, every effort was made to 
assimilate them-we can see the results 26 years later.
<P>
	Statistics on the level of education in francophone 
communities are also alarming. Thirty per cent of the 
francophone minority outside Quebec is considered illiterate. In 
Ontario, the group for development stated recently that the level 
of illiteracy among the province's francophones was 31 per cent, 
compared with the figure of 17 per cent for its anglophones. We 
should, however, perhaps not be surprised by these figures, 
when all Canadian provinces officially prohibited teaching in 
French for decades and when, despite the present constitution, 
the many decisions by the Supreme Court and the many battles 
waged by the country's francophones, the right to education in 
French-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I remind you that you have about two 
minutes left.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, that is impossible. I was told I 
had 20 minutes, like Mr. Ringma.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> No, no. I am sorry. Speeches during 
private members' business are 10 minutes in length.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, no, I am supposed to have 20 
minutes.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member for Joliette has the floor 
on a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 20 minutes' speaking time, is it 
not?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> For the first speaker, and 10 minutes 
for all other members.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Yes. For the first speaker of each party.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> No, no. For the first speaker.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13202"> 13202 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> For the first speaker who introduced the bill, 
and then the others have 10 minutes?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Exactly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> So, there is a mistake.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> Then, I will have to conclude, and that is 
really unfortunate.
<P>
	In fact, Mr. Speaker, it is most unfortunate that I have not had 
the time to read all my speech and that I was misinformed. I 
guess that is part of the procedure in this House and that, by now, 
I should have known better.
<P>
	Anyway, the important thing is to say that we will support the 
motion of the hon. member for Nanaimo, because it is extremely 
significant, since we have to recognize that bilingualism in 
Canada is a failure. Now that multiculturalism has replaced 
biculturalism and bilingualism, it is no wonder that there are no 
longer any Canadians in Canada, but only Greeks, Japanese, 
Chinese, Germans, Ukrainians and Quebecers, who will make 
the right decision when the time comes.
<P>
	So, I want to move the following amendment, seconded by the 
hon. member for Joliette.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Motion M-381 be amended by adding after the word ``languages'', the 
following: ``and that the Act be strengthened and applied in full from coast to 
coast to coast''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The proposed amendment is in order.
<P>
<B>(1405) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise this afternoon and support the 
motion put forward by my hon. colleague from 
Nanaimo-Cowichan.
<P>
	Twenty-five years ago the first Official Languages Act was 
passed, as has been noted. Since that time we have never fully 
reviewed its operation to see if this multibillion dollar ship is 
taking us where we want to go.
<P>
	In 1988 the act was revised incorporating three main 
objectives: first, to ensure the equal status of the two official 
languages; second, to support the development of official 
language minority communities; and third, to set out the powers, 
duties and functions of federal institutions in this area.
<P>
	To ensure compliance with the spirit and intent of the act, a 
commissioner of official languages has been appointed. His job 
is to protect language rights of individuals and groups, evaluate 
linguistic performance of federal institutions and monitor the 
advancement of French and English. In other words, the 
commissioner's mandate is to promote the act, not to evaluate 
its effectiveness.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the auditor general has not undertaken a 
comprehensive review of the act during its entire 25 year 
evolution. This is a serious flaw.
<P>
	What we do have is a series of reports, studies and audits of 
particular aspects of the act. Nobody has looked at the whole 
thing. Even if problems are identified, no one has the mandate to 
change aspects of it that are not working.
<P>
	For example, in past annual reports the commissioner has 
repeatedly criticized the failure of the government to 
communicate the basic purpose of the act to the Canadian 
people. In the words of the commissioner, this has resulted in 
negative hearsay and durable falsehoods. Despite being over 
two decades old, Canadians still do not even understand why the 
act exists. Something is definitely wrong, but the commissioner 
is not empowered to fix it.
<P>
	The commissioner's 1993 annual report notes that the 
Canadian solution to the co-existence of two dominant 
languages is focused on individual rights rather than the 
establishment of a territorial linguistic regime. This means the 
intention of the act is to ensure Canadians can receive services 
from federal institutions in the official language of their choice 
regardless of where they happen to live.
<P>
	During 1993 the office of the commissioner completed its 
own study of individual choice versus territoriality in the 
implementation of language rights. Again I quote: ``The study 
concluded that Canada has struck its own balance between 
individual rights and territoriality, and has done so as a function 
of its own history and specific human needs''.
<P>
	Despite the fact that the act is not supposed to be territorial in 
nature, government services in both languages are not 
universally available, only where there is significant demand 
and where it is reasonable, logical and fair to do so. This makes 
some sense but it does not meet the demands of individual 
complainants who believe their rights to full services under the 
act have been violated.
<P>
	Each province implements the act differently. This means the 
results are also measurably different in each province. Is this a 
failure of the act or was this the original intention? If we do not 
review the act nationwide, how do we know whether the overall 
objectives are feasible or even desirable?
<P>
	The 1993 report began with a quote from Montesquieu: 
``Nothing is just merely because it forms part of the law; rather, 
it should be law because it is just''. The Official Languages Act 
is the law but if we do not examine it impartially and thoroughly 
how can we know that it is just?
<P>
	One example of a perceived failure illustrates this point. 
Many minority official languages communities are upset 
because they do not receive services of comparable quality to 
those afforded to the majority. Perhaps this is neither realistic 
nor affordable. Perhaps we should be  looking at providing 
services of adequate quality rather than comparable quality. No 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13203"> 13203 </A></B>
<P>
one is looking at alternative solutions to these problems. The 
commissioner's role is to pursue the goal of comparable 
services, not to question whether that goal is attainable.
<P>
<B>(1410) </B>
<P>
	The Spicer commission studied Canadians' perceptions of the 
Official Languages Act. One participant: ``Being able to speak 
both English and French should be a worthwhile personal goal 
for all citizens of Canada. It is also an achievable goal, if only 
the politicians had the courage to admit that the language 
policies they have been advocating for the past two decades 
failed miserably and left the country deeply divided. It is time to 
scrap the enforced bilingualism policy and heal the wounds''.
<P>
	As my hon. colleague mentioned earlier, another participant 
in the citizens' forum on Canada's future stated: ``Pierre 
Trudeau's vision of a multicultural and bilingual society for 
Canada was a noble one, but it is apparent now that it will simply 
not work''.
<P>
	We are certainly a more bilingual country than we were in 
1969, but we are far from achieving the goals of the act and it has 
been in operation for more than a generation. Surely if the act 
was workable we would have met most, if not all, of the goals by 
now.
<P>
	The list of failures is long. We have failed to achieve equity in 
the language of work in federal institutions. We have failed to 
communicate the basic purpose of the act to Canadians. As a 
result, the act does not enjoy universal support. As I already 
stated, it has failed to provide comparable quality services to 
minority official languages communities. It has failed to 
establish universal access to services in the language of choice 
resulting in territoriality playing a significant role.
<P>
	After 25 years why has the official languages policy failed to 
meet virtually all of its objectives? Without an independent 
review of the fundamental principles, structure and 
implementation regimes we will never know. We will merely 
continue to add to the list of failures because questioning the 
goals or the means of achieving them is beyond the mandate of 
the commissioner.
<P>
	Let us compare the Official Languages Act to a sailing ship 
under Christopher Columbus. The office of the commissioner 
has certain tasks to perform, such as investigating complaints, 
auditing specific federal departments of compliance and 
ensuring implementation of minority language education 
programs. These are like the specific tasks of sailors to mend the 
sails, scrub the decks or feed the crew.
<P>
	Every once in a while the auditor general comes along and 
performs an audit on a discreet part of the ship such as his 1991 
audit of the translation bureau. This is like lowering a sailor over 
the side of the ship to chip off a few barnacles rather than 
checking the integrity of the hull. We fix one or two problems 
with the sails, replace some lines and bail out the bilge, but no 
one has looked  at the whole ship. We are so concerned with the 
day to day operations and studying the individual components 
that no one has looked to see where the ship is going.
<P>
	Columbus knew his mission was to get to the far east and he 
fixed the little leaks along the way, but after two months under 
sail he ended up in America instead. If we do not completely 
review the act, how can we be sure we will achieve the stated 
objectives? More important, how do we know our national 
objectives have not changed?
<P>
	Right now we do not even know if we are still going in the 
right direction because we have not done one comprehensive 
audit in 25 years. Remember, his sails were repaired regularly 
but Christopher Columbus was not even in the right ocean, let 
alone on course.
<P>
	I urge all members to support this motion to conduct a 
thorough review of the act. We may not all agree on where we 
think the official languages ship should be headed, but an 
independent auditor could make sure we are at least sailing in 
the direction supported by the majority of the crew, in this case 
the Canadian taxpayers who continue to foot the bill.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Ringuette-Maltais (Madawaska-Victoria, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to enter this debate on the 
motion tabled in the House by the hon. member for 
Nanaimo-Cowichan and, what is really surprising, supported 
by a Bloc member, which indicates that the Bloc Quebecois will 
vote for this motion.
<P>
	Over the week-end, in New Brunswick, the Société nationale 
des Acadiens et Acadiennes du Nouveau-Brunswick is holding 
its annual assembly; as one of its members, I would have liked to 
be there, but as the member of Parliament for 
Madawaska-Victoria and co-chair of the joint committee on 
official languages, I think it is even more important for me to 
speak to this motion.
<P>
	I will begin by recalling the history and the purposes of this 
act. The original Official Languages Act was passed by the 
Parliament of Canada in 1969, following the recommendations 
made by the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and 
Biculturalism. The purpose of that act was to give French and 
English equal status, non only in Parliament and before federal 
courts, as was already guaranteed in section 133 of the 
Constitution Act, 1867, but in the whole federal administration.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="13204"> 13204 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In 1988 the Official Languages Act was thoroughly reviewed 
and amended. The new act defers from the old one in that it not 
only sets out the official languages right of the public but also 
clearly spells out the duty of the federal institutions in respect to 
these rights. It contains as well a solemn commitment by the 
government to enhance the vitality of the English speaking and 
the French speaking minority communities and to advance the 
recognition and the use of English and French in Canadian 
society at large.
<P>
	We strongly believe that the Official Languages Act in its 
present form contains a complete legislative framework which 
is sufficient to ensure and to monitor the implementation of the 
act in a manner that is efficient, fair and transparent.
<P>
	The House will know that all federal government institutions, 
departments, agencies and crown corporations are subject to the 
act. The key departments entrusted with specific 
responsibilities for the implementation of the act are treasury 
board, Canadian heritage and justice.
<P>
	However, the administration of the act does not stop with 
federal government institutions. It is important to stress that the 
commissioner of official languages, the federal court and the 
standing joint parliamentary committee on official languages 
also fulfil important functions.
<P>
	Allow me to review briefly the roles of the key federal 
institutions responsible for overseeing and reviewing the 
implementation of the act.
<P>
	The Official Languages Act entrusts the treasury board with 
the responsibility for the co-ordination of the policies and 
programs of the government in the area of communication with 
and service to the public, the language of work within federal 
institutions as well as the equitable participation of English 
speaking Canadians and French speaking Canadians within 
those institutions.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The President of the Treasury Board informs the House when 
tabling his annual report.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It should be noted that the government on the 
recommendation of the treasury board has put into place 
regulations respecting service to the public in both languages. 
The final provisions of these regulations came into force last 
year.
<P>
	Another key department under the act is that of the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, who is responsible for co-ordinating the 
federal government's commitment with respect to the 
enhancement of the vitality of official language minority 
communities and the advancement of English and French.
<P>
	Last summer in New Brunswick the Prime Minister and the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage announced new initiatives, 
including an accountability framework for the co-ordination of 
government commitment to the enhancement of the vitality of 
official language minority communities and the advancement of 
English and French.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice is the legal custodian of the act since 
he retains general legislative responsibility for it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Minister of Justice has particular responsibilities in the 
areas of drafting legislation and administering justice, in both 
official languages, in federal courts as well as in criminal 
prosecutions under the authority of the Solicitor general of 
Canada.
<P>
<B>(1420 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We have already mentioned that the administration of the act 
does not stop with federal government institutions. The act 
provides for a linguistic ombudsman, independent of 
government and reporting to Parliament, who is charged with 
the duty of taking action to ensure that federal institutions 
comply with the spirit and the intent of the act.
<P>
	The commissioner of official languages is not a court. He 
attempts to resolve issues relating to the application of the act 
through a process of administrative mediation. Through his 
annual and special reports to Parliament as well as his complaint 
reports the commissioner ensures that Parliament, the 
government and the public are kept well informed as to the 
administration of the act.
<P>
	The act also provides Canadians with the right to seek court 
remedy. Pursuant to part X of the act the federal court may, if it 
finds that a federal institution has failed to comply with the act, 
grant an appropriate and just remedy.
<P>
	Finally, I come to the role of the standing parliamentary 
committee on official languages which is charged, in the words 
of the act, with the duty to review on a permanent basis the 
administration of the Official Languages Act, any regulation 
and directive made under this act, and the reports of the 
commissioner, President of the Treasury Board and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	The committee has been very active in listening to the views 
and concerns of Canadians on official language matters. Both 
the commissioner of official languages and the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage have recently appeared before the committee 
as have a number of other ministers.
<P>
	In my opinion the parliamentary committee is proving to be 
an effective, open forum for Canadians concerns with the 
implementation of the act.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="13205"> 13205 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to add something to the speech. The hon. member 
who introduced the motion is a member of the Joint Committee 
on Official Languages. At the beginning of his speech, a short 
while ago, the hon. member said that his party, the Reform Party, 
supports the principles of individual bilingualism. At the end of 
his speech, he said that the Reform Party also supports the 
principles of official bilingualism.
<P>
	In the Committee on Official Languages the hon. member did 
the same kind of flip-flop regarding the Official Languages Act, 
as I will demonstrate. At the beginning of our proceedings, the 
member made the following motion to the Committee: ``Be it 
resolved that this committee endorse the recommendations 
contained in the commissioner's report on service to the public 
and further, that this committee encourage Treasury Board to 
draw up an action plan to implement these recommendations in 
as cost-effective and expedient a manner as possible, and that 
Treasury Board officials be invited to appear before our 
committee for the purpose of tabling their action plan at an early 
date'', asking the committee to support unanimously the intent, 
the report and the Official Languages Act.
<P>
	One month ago, the same member presented another motion 
where he proposed to abolish entirely the budgetary votes and 
the operating budget of the Commissioner of Official 
Languages.
<P>
	This quite a turnaround. During the last Parliament, the 
Committee on Official Languages held only ten meetings over a 
two-year period. Since the beginning of our mandate, we have 
had 30 meetings in one year. Why? Because our government is 
keen on seeing justice done to both linguistic communities in 
Canada. And the main supporter of this justice and the primary 
promoter of the Official Languages Act is the Right Hon. Prime 
Minister.
<P>
	If the Reform Party and the Bloc have doubts about that and 
are not sure that Canadians throughout the country support the 
Official Languages Act, they only have to look at the recent 
Gallup poll. It says it all.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The next time we debate this issue, it 
will be the Bloc Quebecois's turn to speak. The hour reserved for 
the consideration of Private Members' Business has now 
expired.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Pursuant to Standing Order 93, the order is dropped to the 
bottom of the order of precedence on the Order Paper.
<P>
	It being 2.25 p.m., the House stands adjourned until 11 a.m. 
on Monday.
