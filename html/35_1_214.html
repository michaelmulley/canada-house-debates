	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr.

to rise in the House to present a petition, duly certified by the 
clerk of petitions, on behalf of 30 individuals from the riding of 
Saanich-Gulf Islands and surrounding areas.
<P>
	The petitioners pray and call on the House to enact legislation 
to reform the justice system for a more just and safe society, 
increasing recognition and protection for the rights of victims.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my 
honour to present a petition on behalf of a number of residents of 
Barrière, British Columbia. This brings the total to almost 
80,000 signatures.
<P>
	The petitioners call on the Government of Canada, and 
particularly the Minister of Justice, to take whatever steps are 
necessary to amend the Criminal Code and parole system to 
ensure safety and peace in Canadian neighbourhoods.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SMALLANDMEDIUMSIZEBUSINESSES">SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZE BUSINESSES</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
concerning small and medium size businesses, these petitioners 
point out the following:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	They point out that while there has been more access to capital 
for small and medium sized businesses and while there has been 
a reduction in red tape in dealing with government that still a 
great deal more needs to be done.
<P>
	They also emphasize that the GST is still a problem in terms 
of overhead. They want the government to address these 
problems because they point out that they contribute to 85 per 
cent of the new jobs to the Canadian economy.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="THEFAMILY">THE FAMILY</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 36, I wish to present a petition that 
has been circulating across Canada. This petition comes from 
my riding of Mississauga South.
<P>
	The petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the 
House that managing the family home and caring for preschool 
children is an honourable profession which has not been 
recognized for its value to our society.
<P>
<B>(1010 ) </B>
<P>
	They also state that the Income Tax Act discriminates against 
families who make the choice to provide care in the home to 
preschool children, the disabled, the chronically ill and the 
aged.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to 
pursue initiatives to eliminate tax discrimination against 
families that decide to provide care in the home preschool 
children, the disabled, the chronically ill or the aged.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="LANDCLAIMS">LAND CLAIMS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to present two separate petitions.
<P>
	The first petition is signed by 675 individuals who call on 
Parliament to halt native land claim negotiations in British 
Columbia and turn Indian reserves over to the bands, fee simple, 
and that the land and the natives fall under the same laws as the 
rest of Canada.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="REFORMPARTY">REFORM PARTY</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the second petition is signed by 46 individuals who call 
on Parliament to recognize the Reform Party of Canada as the 
official opposition.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SOCIALPROGRAMS">SOCIAL PROGRAMS</A></H4>
	<B>Ms. Judy Bethel (Edmonton East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 36, I am pleased to present several 
petitions signed by residents of my riding of Edmonton East.
<P>
	The first petition calls on Parliament to maintain and enhance 
social programs for every Canadian.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="HUMANRIGHTS">HUMAN RIGHTS</A></H4>
	<B>Ms. Judy Bethel (Edmonton East, lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
present a second petition from a group of Canadians who believe 
that Parliament should protect all individuals from 
discrimination based on sexual orientation by including the 
term, sexual orientation, in the Canadian Human Rights Act.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="ASSISTEDSUICIDE">ASSISTED SUICIDE</A></H4>
	<B>Ms. Judy Bethel (Edmonton East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
third petition deals with euthanasia. The petitioners ask 
Parliament to reject euthanasia and physician assisted suicide in 
Canada and to expand palliative care that would be accessible to 
all dying Canadians.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="GUNCONTROL">GUN CONTROL</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have a petition from the Langham area in the 
Kindersley-Lloydminister constituency.
<P>
	The petition, duly certified by the clerk of petitions, states 
that the existing controls on law-abiding, responsible firearms' 
owners are more than enough to ensure public safety.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13445"> 13445 </A></B>
<P>
	It goes on to say that the target of all gun control laws in the 
Criminal Code of Canada must be criminals who are either a 
danger to the safety of the public or those who have criminal 
intent, not law-abiding citizens.
<P>
	No amount of gun control has ever succeeded in preventing 
criminals from acquiring guns. Therefore, the petitioners 
request three things of Parliament. First, that we support laws 
which would severely punish all violent criminals who use 
weapons in the commission of crimes. Second, that we support 
new Criminal Code firearms control provisions which recognize 
and protect the right of law-abiding citizens to own and use 
recreational firearms. Third, the petitioners support legislation 
which will repeal and modify existing gun control laws which 
have not improved public safety or have proven not to be cost 
effective.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="PARLIAMENTARYPRAYER">PARLIAMENTARY PRAYER</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
a petition from residents of the city and county of Peterborough.
<P>
	Whereas the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ, in the Lord's 
Prayer has been included in the historic parliamentary prayer of 
the House of Commons since 1867, and whereas Canada was 
founded and built on the principles of Christianity and the large 
majority of Canadians profess the Christian faith, therefore the 
petitioners call on the House of Commons to close the 
parliamentary prayer with the words: ``Through Jesus Christ our 
Lord, Amen'', and reinstate the Lord's Prayer at the conclusion 
of the opening prayer.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="THEFAMILY">THE FAMILY</A></H4>
	<B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 36, I wish to present a 
petition.
<P>
	The petitioners call on Parliament to pursue initiatives to 
eliminate tax discrimination against families who decide to 
provide care in the home for preschool children as well as for the 
disabled, the chronically ill and the aged.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADIANBROADCASTINGCORPORATION">CANADIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. John O'Reilly (Victoria-Haliburton, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to present a petition signed by constituents 
of Victoria-Haliburton from such places as Bobcaygeon, 
Lindsay, Woodville, Dunsford and Downeyville.
<P>
	The petitioners call on Parliament to request the CBC to 
withdraw its coverage of the Paul Bernardo trail.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="ROYALCANADIANMOUNTEDPOLICE">ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE</A></H4>
	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have two petitions.
<P>
	The first is from petitioners in the Yukon territory who find it 
unacceptable that individuals die while in the custody of the 
Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Each incident of death while in 
custody undermines public confidence.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore call on Parliament to review RCMP 
procedures for dealing with individuals in custody who are 
known to have medical conditions.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="GUNCONTROL">GUN CONTROL</A></H4>
	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
second petition is from residents of the Yukon territory, from 
Dawson City, Yukon, who draw to the attention of the House that 
the use of firearms by criminals cannot be affected by a 
computerized firearms control system.
<P>
<B>(1015 ) </B>
<P>
	The petitioners request that Parliament support only that 
legislation which severely punishes any violent criminal who 
uses a weapon and protects the rights and freedoms of the 
law-abiding recreational firearms community.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="AGRICULTURE">AGRICULTURE</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Jim Jordan (Leeds-Grenville, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have two petitions from people in my riding objecting to the 
generic manipulation of dairy cows through the injection of 
BST. Their argument seems to be that if Canada is not short of 
milk why would we unnecessarily risk health hazards that may 
go with this drug and if we need more milk, why not get more 
cows.

	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of

Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise again today to ask the government House leader 
when I can expect to receive an answer to Question No. 137, 
which has been on the Order Paper since February 6, 1995.
<P>
	I requested an answer from the government within 45 days 
and as of today 122 days have passed.
<P>
	Yesterday the parliamentary secretary to the government 
House leader said I could expect to have an answer to my 
question soon. I find it hard to believe the Department of Justice 
does not have this information already. The minister said it is 
currently renegotiating financial agreements with the provinces 
to reimburse them for these costs.
<P>
	It is vital that we have this information on the current costs of 
implementing the federal gun control laws before the final vote 
on Bill C-68.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="13446"> 13446 </A></B>
<P>
	Can the parliamentary secretary tell us what he means by 
soon? Will we have the answer before third reading of Bill 
C-68?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, I cannot give any further 
undertaking to the hon. member than what I already have. I told 
him yesterday the answer will be provided soon. My answer is 
the same today.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Shall all questions stand?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I want to bring a procedural matter to your 
attention.
<P>
	Bill C-68 was tabled on February 14 with a royal 
recommendation. The Standing Committee on Justice did not 
rule a government amendment calling for the appropriation of 
funds from consolidated revenues out of order. However, on 
June 5, 1995, the chairman, the hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, ruled a series of  amendments moved 
by the member for Hamilton Mountain on behalf of the member 
for Fredericton-York-Sunbury out of order as an expenditure 
of funds that would be necessary to affect the provisions.
<P>
	On June 1, 1995, the vice-chairperson, the member for 
London West, with what appears to be without advice from the 
clerk of the committee, permitted clauses 98, 99, 100, 101, and 
101.1 to be amended to replace certain duties of police officers 
in making the duties of firearms inspectors.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary stated that while police officers 
will also in some cases carry out the function of inspectors, in 
some areas the police are fully employed at present. These 
officers do not have the luxury to assume additional demands on 
their time. In those circumstances, inspectors will be hired and 
trained to enforce the Firearms Act.
<P>
	I quote from the transcript of the committee proceedings:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Inspectors wouldn't be police officers. They may be in some smaller 
communities where the police officer could do this role, but in most communities 
the police officers' time is so taken up right now that to give the police officers 
these additional tasks would not be reasonable. In most cases they would be 
separate. New inspectors would be hired and trained to fulfil the role.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1105 ) </B>
<P>
	Obviously this new provision in the bill will result in an 
expenditure of funds. The Governor General has not provided 
the House with the required recommendation in this regard. I 
would quote from citation 598 of Beauchesne's:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>No cases can be found of any private member receiving the authority of the 
Crown to propose a bill or motion involving either the expenditure of public 
money or an increase in taxation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The royal recommendation included in Bill C-68 did not 
contemplate the appropriation of public revenue for the 
expenditure outlined in the government amendments G-41, 
G-42, G-43, G-44, and G-46.
<P>
	Furthermore, the Constitution Act of 1867, section 54, states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It shall not be lawful for the House of Commons to adopt or pass any Vote, 
Resolution, Address, or Bill for the Appropriation of any Part of the Public 
Revenue, or of any Tax or Impost, to any Purpose that has not been first 
recommended to that House by Message of the Governor General in Session in 
which such Vote, Resolution, Address, or Bill is proposed.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I will not take the time of the House, but I could also quote 
from citations 595 and 596 of Beauchesne's, which also verify 
this requirement.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13448"> 13448 </A></B>
<P>
	The first government amendment was not ruled out of order 
by the vice-chair of the committee. Whether that was due to lack 
of experience or the lack of procedural advice from the clerk is 
no longer at issue here. With respect, what is at issue is Bill 
C-68, as reported to this House on Wednesday, June 7, 1995, is 
not lawful.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I ask you to review the minutes of the committee 
to verify that what I have presented to you is absolutely correct 
and accurate.
<P>
	I have one short additional comment. This bill was reported 
yesterday. The government has not even seen all of the 
amendments. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I bring two points to your 
attention. Drafters have not had time to draft amendments, so 
they have not all been tabled. In spite of this, the government has 
moved time allocation and closure on this bill. If this is not 
illegal, it is certainly immoral.
<P>
	Second, I believe that it is not only imperative but it is your 
duty, Mr. Speaker, to not permit debate on Bill C-68 until you 
have ruled on this matter.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as the Chair will recognize, this bill is not called 
today. Therefore, any royal recommendation that would be 
required, if such were required, would not be required today in 
any instance.
<P>
	You can be sure, Mr. Speaker, because of the government's 
tremendous respect for the rules of the House, that the royal 
recommendation that is required will be provided when it is 
required.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> There has been a request that I make a review 
of what has gone on. I will make that review and come back to 
the House today with my decision on this particular matter.

	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and

Canadian Wheat Board Act, be read the second time and referred 
to a committee.

	He said: Mr. Speaker, before I get into the substance of my 
remarks today I should advise the House that in a few minutes I 
have to attend a meeting of the cabinet and I regret that I will not 
be able to remain for the entire debate this morning. I extend my 
apologies particularly to the official spokespersons for the 
opposition parties. They may rest assured I will from the record 
in <I>Hansard</I> read very carefully what they have to say about this 
important legislation.
<P>
	As I open debate on Bill C-92, certain amendments to the 
Canadian Wheat Board Act, I begin with a sincere  request to all 
hon. members to help facilitate in the House the timely passage 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13451"> 13451 </A></B>
<P>
of various pieces of agricultural legislation now before 
Parliament.
<P>
	In addition to Bill C-92 I think of the amendments to the Farm 
Improvement and Marketing Co-operatives Loans Act, 
FIMCLA, which will double to $3 billion the volume of 
agricultural loans from the private sector financial institutions 
which can qualify for government guarantees, thus enhancing 
the availability of loan capital for farmers across the country.

	By the end of July we will have bumped up against the 
existing $1.5 billion ceiling for FIMCLA loans across the 
country. To avoid a hiatus in this very useful program 
Parliament needs to enact the proposed amendments to raise the 
ceiling before we adjourn for the summer and I certainly trust 
that can be done.
<P>
	I think of the amendments to our dairy legislation which will 
provide the legal framework to allow the Canadian dairy 
industry to implement certain price pooling techniques 
beginning this fall.
<P>
<B>(1135 ) </B>
<P>
	This initiative is essential to enable our dairy industry to 
position itself to comply with new international trade rules 
coming into effect this year under the new GATT. Again, time is 
very much of the essence. Parliamentary approval before the 
summer recess is vitally important.
<P>
	With respect to both the FIMCLA amendments and the dairy 
amendments there is virtually unanimous support among all the 
various stakeholders in our agriculture and agri-food sector and 
there is obviously clear urgency.
<P>
	I ask all hon. members and also our colleagues in the other 
place to ensure these amendments are fully completed before we 
rise for the summer break.
<P>
	The same arguments apply to Bill C-92. These amendments 
to the Canadian Wheat Board Act are urgent. They need to be in 
place before August 1, 1995, the beginning of the new crop year 
in western Canada. They enjoy broad support among the 
majority of farm organizations.
<P>
	In effect we are moving ahead with these amendments at this 
time in direct response to the requests of those western farm 
organizations. I trust my parliamentary colleagues will 
co-operate in facilitating timely passage.
<P>
	Bill C-92 deals with the long standing system by which 
freight costs are pooled among prairie farmers under the 
Canadian Wheat Board marking system. Under this system 
western Canadian grain producers share common costs of 
shipping their wheat and barley from Canadian export ports to 
market destinations around the world.
<P>
	The ports traditionally used as the points of departure for our 
overseas sales have been Vancouver and Thunder Bay because 
the world market value of grain in store at each of these two 
locations, one going east and the other going west, have been 
effectively the same.
<P>
	Over the past decade or so changes in international marketing 
patterns have altered that historic equilibrium between 
Vancouver and Thunder Bay. In relative terms the effective 
world market value of grain in store at Thunder Bay has declined 
while the comparable value at Vancouver has increased.
<P>
	To restore the balance in export values between grain moving 
west and grain moving east the eastern point of departure needs 
to be located in the lower St. Lawrence region, not at Thunder 
Bay. This change carries several different implications for 
prairie farmers in the returns they will receive on their wheat 
board sales.
<P>
	Overall it will increase the amount all wheat and barley 
producers receive because the wheat board's total freight costs 
will be reduced. This will happen because the board's pooled 
costs will no longer include the seaway charges. The board's 
costs will be calculated from the lower St. Lawrence instead of 
Thunder Bay. The net result will be a general price improvement 
across the prairies of between $5 and $7 a tonne.
<P>
	At the same time it needs to be noted that for producers in 
Manitoba and eastern Saskatchewan who ship their grain east, 
their domestic shipping costs to get their grain into final export 
position will increase because they will absorb their own costs 
to the lower St. Lawrence and not just to Thunder Bay.
<P>
	Going in the other direction producers in Alberta and western 
Saskatchewan who ship their grain west will no longer cross 
subsidize a portion of the domestic freight bill for more easterly 
located producers. They will pay only their own costs going to 
the west coast.
<P>
	For many years farmers in the western part of the prairies 
have complained that the use of Thunder Bay as the wheat 
board's eastern point of departure for export sales was both 
unrealistic and unfair in that it added costs to those western 
producers and they were bearing those costs unfairly.
<P>
	Farmers in the eastern part of the prairies have acknowledge 
this anomaly in the freight pooling system but they have 
worried, understandably so, about the higher domestic costs 
they would face if the eastern point of departure were shifted 
from Thunder Bay to the lower St. Lawrence.
<P>
	Many discussions on how to fix the problem fairly have been 
held over the years dating back at least to 1985.
<P>
<B>(1140 ) </B>
<P>
	In our February 1995 federal budget we served notice that the 
time had come to implement a solution. We proposed to provide 
a final period of time for final consultations with all of the 
stakeholders with the necessary changes to be made as ofAugust 1, 1996.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13452"> 13452 </A></B>
<P>
	Since the budget over the past three months intensive 
discussions with prairie farm organizations, the grain 
companies and co-operatives, the wheat board and provincial 
governments have led to a strong consensus that this issue can 
and should be resolved more quickly.
<P>
	The industry has told me we should begin implementing the 
change in the freight pooling system on August 1 of this year, 
not next year, with the full impact to be phased in over three 
years.
<P>
	As we said at the time of our February budget, a portion of the 
federal government's multiyear, $300 million transportation 
adjustment fund will be utilized to ease the impact of the freight 
cost pooling change on those most affected, namely farmers in 
Manitoba and in the eastern part of Saskatchewan.
<P>
	For the 1995-96 crop year, since this change is being 
announced at a relatively late date and farmers have already 
made their production decisions for 1995, the available federal 
assistance will be designed as compensation to offset a very 
significant portion of the affected farmers' increased costs in 
the eastern prairies. For two additional years the federal 
assistance may be more flexible and more in the nature of 
adaptation encouragement in the affected area. This was the 
consensus of the western grains industry.
<P>
	I have undertaken to try before the end of June to be very 
precise about the portion of the $300 million fund which will be 
available over the next three years to help address the impact of 
the pooling change.
<P>
	While we are still working on all of the necessary 
calculations, I have informed the western grains industry I 
would estimate the available funding for this purpose to be in the 
order of some $100 million in total spread over a three year 
period. Depending on how we are able to apportion that very 
substantial sum year by year this level of transitional funding 
has a high level of industry support.
<P>
	While the proposed freight pooling changes are now 
scheduled subject to parliamentary approval to begin to come 
into effect on August 1, 1995, the same date on which railway 
subsidies under the Western Grain Transportation Act will come 
to an end, it should be clear the cost changes which result from 
the pooling issue are separate and apart from the WGTA 
changes; the two should not be confused.
<P>
	The WGTA subsidy is being eliminated for four very strong 
reasons: to comply with new world trading rules, to increase 
grain transportation efficiencies, to end freight rate 
discrimination against greater diversification and value added 
economic growth, and because the WGTA subsidy in excess of 
$560 million each year is no longer sustainable in the face of a 
$500 billion government debt.
<P>
	By contrast, the freight pooling system has never involved a 
government subsidy. It has constituted instead a hidden form of 
cross subsidization among different groups of farmers, with 
those in Alberta and western Saskatchewan absorbing some 
freight costs on behalf of those in Manitoba and in the eastern 
part of Saskatchewan. Bill C-92 will end this anomaly. The 
cross subsidization will be phased out and significant 
transitional funding will ease the impact on those most affected.
<P>
	Like the other agricultural bills I mentioned at the beginning 
of my remarks, Bill C-92 enjoys good support among the 
stakeholders in our agricultural sector. It is very time sensitive 
and must be enacted before Parliament adjourns later this 
month.
<P>
	I invite all hon. members to ensure its passage in a prompt and 
timely manner.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
you will agree it is quite an honour for the official opposition 
critic for agriculture and agri-food to speak to a bill introduced 
by the Minister of Agriculture himself.
<P>
	The purpose of Bill C-92 is to amend the Canadian Wheat 
Board-often referred to as the CWB-Act. It proposes to 
change the way transportation costs are shared by Prairie wheat 
and barley producers. As a result, prices paid by the CWB to 
farmers will more closely reflect actual transportation costs.
<P>
	Currently, the calculation is based on the distance between the 
farm and so-called pooling points. In other words, from the 
farm to the port of delivery. The two pooling points are now 
Vancouver and Thunder Bay. The cost of shipping grain through 
the St. Lawrence Seaway from Thunder Bay is paid by the Wheat 
Board. This means the cost is shared by all Prairie producers, 
irrespective of the port they happen to use or their geographical 
location.
<P>
	Of course the port of Thunder Bay does not have the facilities 
to handle large ocean-going vessels. Wheat and barley will be 
loaded onto ships that can negotiate the locks and the Great 
Lakes, and the wheat will be transhipped in one of the ports on 
the St. Lawrence. The bill does not say which ports. It just says 
``in the lower St. Lawrence region''. The lower St. Lawrence is 
pretty big. The hon. member for Beauséjour will appreciate that 
these ports could include Sept-Îles, Baie-Comeau, 
Trois-Rivières, Quebec City, and Montreal. And there are other 
ports along the St. Lawrence.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13453"> 13453 </A></B>
<P>
	For instance, it could be Baie-Comeau. The grain will then be 
transferred to huge ships with up to three times the capacity of 
those coming from Thunder Bay.
<P>
	The cost of shipping grain through the St. Lawrence Seaway 
from Thunder Bay is paid, as I said earlier, by the Canadian 
Wheat Board. This means the costs are shared by all Prairie 
producers. Producers from the western Prairies who send their 
grain west to the port of Vancouver are paying part of the cost for 
farmers from the eastern Prairies whose grain is shipped through 
the St. Lawrence Seaway. In other words, western Prairie 
farmers are subsidizing eastern Prairie farmers.
<P>
	Bill C-92 will shift the pooling point from Thunder Bay to the 
St. Lawrence Seaway. You will remember, Madam Speaker, if 
you were listening carefully, but I will repeat, nevertheless, that 
it is not spelled out which ports along the St. Lawrence Seaway 
will be part of this new pooling point, but I am told it might be 
Sept-Îles, Baie-Comeau, Trois-Rivières, or Quebec City, and 
possibly other ports along the St. Lawrence.
<P>
	In this way, eastern Prairie farmers who send their grain 
through the St. Lawrence Seaway will pay the real cost instead 
of being subsidized by western Prairie producers. This change 
will have an impact on the price Prairie farmers will get for their 
grain.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	The amount the CWB pays all wheat and barley producers in 
general will increase. It will increase because the CWB will no 
longer pay the cost of transportation from Thunder Bay to the St. 
Lawrence Seaway, since transportation costs are combined and 
deducted proportionately from market revenues distributed 
among all producers. This will affect prices.
<P>
	In the future, they will be calculated from St. Lawrence ports, 
rather than from Thunder Bay. Producers in Manitoba and 
eastern Saskatchewan shipping their grain east will pay 
increased domestic shipping costs, because they will now have 
to assume the real costs of shipping via ports on the lower St. 
Lawrence and not just via the port of Thunder Bay.
<P>
	However, producers in western Saskatchewan and Alberta 
will no longer have to subsidize a part of the domestic 
transportation costs of producers living further east. Farmers in 
the western prairies have been saying for years that the Canadian 
Wheat Board's choice of Thunder Bay as the point of departure 
for exports to the east was unrealistic and meant additional and 
unfair costs for them. I agree with them. Farmers in the eastern 
prairies have always been aware of this anomaly, but are, 
understandably, somewhat anxious about the way it is being 
changed, because it will certainly lower their returns.
<P>
	This change could take effect this August 1-in two months 
and three weeks, approximately-if Bill C-92, which we are 
discussing this morning, is adopted. The bill would indeed 
affect the returns of producers in various regions. A producer in 
the eastern prairies living in  Brandon, Manitoba, for example, 
will have a $5.81 a tonne decrease in returns. He was previously 
dealing with the port of Thunder Bay, but will now have to use a 
port on the Lower St. Lawrence, which will decrease his returns 
by $5.81 a tonne.
<P>
	When there is talk of a decrease of $5.81 per tonne, you must 
admit, Madam Speaker, that things are getting lean. 
Producers'net returns are being pared to the bone. The initial 
freight deduction would increase from $20.34 per tonne to 
$31.14 per tonne. However, due to a $4.99-almost $5-per 
tonne higher return from the CWB because of the elimination of 
the pooled shipping costs, the net effect would be a $5.81 per 
tonne decrease in returns. If you subtract $20.34 from $31.14, 
you get $10 and some loose change, minus the $4.99 per tonne 
producers will not have to pay, hence a decrease in returns of 
$5.81 per tonne, as I said before.
<P>
	Obviously, when you look at it on a per tonne basis, it does not 
amount to much, but for a big grain producer, it adds up to a very 
substantial amount. The first example was located in the eastern 
portion of western Canada, in Manitoba. However, if we go 
further west, and take the example of a producer located near 
Calgary, Alberta, his return would not decrease but increase by 
$4.99, let us say $5 per tonne.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	And yet, in Calgary, the initial freight deduction would 
remain the same at $22.19, because freight is still deducted to 
Vancouver only. However, with the increase in the CWB pool 
return because of the elimination of the pooled shipping costs 
from Thunder Bay, since all producers were contributing an 
additional amount, the net effect for producers in the Calgary 
area would be a $4.99 per tonne increase in returns.
<P>
	I realize that all this talk about increasing and decreasing 
returns might be very technical for my colleagues in the House. 
But the many western grain producers who are listening to us 
this afternoon understand perfectly well what I am talking 
about. They know what it means to gain or lose $5 a ton; it is not 
an inconsequential amount. If they sell a ton of wheat for $135, a 
difference of $5 represents an additional income, or a loss, of 3.5 
to 4 per cent, and a difference of 3.5 or 4 per cent is very 
important. Unions are fighting these days for new collective 
agreements with a 2 or 3 per cent wage increase, and they often 
have to go through several months of strike to get that.
<P>
	Since we of the Bloc Quebecois came to Ottawa, 18 months 
ago already, our position on the transport subsidies has always 
been very clear. We strongly support deregulating. A system 
which conceals true prices with subsidies given left and right 
only brings the type of results we see today, that is a major 
distortion of markets. And that is exactly what we experienced.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13454"> 13454 </A></B>
<P>
	The rail system, as it now operates, is proof enough of that. 
The criteria used to determine if a railway line should stay open 
are not the same in the west and in the east. In Western Canada, 
surprisingly enough, and I want to point this out to my Quebec 
colleagues in particular, a railway line is supposed to operate in 
the best interests of the public; in the east however, and 
especially in Quebec, it must be cost effective.
<P>
	Let me mention the case of the Quebec Central Railway line 
which goes from Sherbrooke, through Lévis, to Vallée-Jonction 
and then from Vallée-Jonction to Lac-Frontière and St-Georges 
de Beauce, a total distance of 382 kilometres. Quebec Central 
always neglected its clients and gave poor service on that line; 
so it lost its clients one after the other. In my opinion, this was 
planned, to prove to the National Transportation Agency that the 
Chaudière-Vallée line was not viable. Finally, last year at about 
this time, Quebec Central, through its parent company Canadian 
Pacific, requested and obtained permission from the National 
Transportation Agency to abandon this line.
<P>
	Of course, politicians, economic stakeholders and the 
regional county municipalities protested against this 
abandonment because, once more, we in this great and beautiful 
country of ours were up against distortions and double 
standards.
<P>
	A secondary line similar to the one I mentioned which goes 
through Thetford and East Broughton, in my riding, would not 
have been abandoned in the west even if it had not been viable, 
because it would have been in the public interest. There is a 
double standard.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	The result is that some railway lines, in Quebec especially, 
which served small and medium size municipalities were 
abandoned to offset the financial losses of other secondary lines 
in the west. Needless to say, we will be supporting Bill C-92, 
because we are in favour of people paying the real cost of 
transportation, and because we want to put an end to the market 
distortions that we presently have.
<P>
	This morning I was at a sitting of the Standing Committee on 
Agriculture where we heard witnesses representing dairy 
farmers. I knew that a litre of milk cost about $1.06 but this 
morning I learned that there was a threshold price of 98 cents, 
below which the retailer cannot sell his milk, and a ceiling of 
$1.09, above which the same retailer cannot sell. Most 
consumers believe that the dairy producers get about 70 cents or 
75 cents on this amount of $1.09.
<P>
	Could you tell me, madam Speaker, what portion of the $1.05 
or $1.09 that you probably paid for your litre of milk yesterday 
goes directly to the producer? This is not a trick question, 
Madam Speaker. You do not have the slightest idea, and this is 
not surprising. If I were to ask the same question to the vast 
majority of my hon. colleagues in the House, most of them 
would not be able  to tell me what portion goes directly to the 
dairy producers.
<P>
	Personally, I thought that the producer was getting 50 cents, 
but it is not even that much. This morning, we were told that the 
producer was getting 56 cents. You might say that it is more than 
50 cents, but on that amount, the producer must pay the 
transportation costs from his farm to the dairy, or 18 cents. So, if 
you deduct 18 cents from the 56 cents, you end up with 38 cents.
<P>
	So the producer gets 38 cents for each litre of milk he 
produces. Did you know that big dairies have to pay some fees to 
the retailer to be able to place their product on the display racks? 
You did not know that. It is very costly.
<P>
	So a producer gets 38 cents per litre and the dairy will pay up 
to 20.5 cents to the store owner. The farm producer must feed, 
milk, and tend the cows, and keep them in a clean environment, 
which is costly and brings him only 38 cents per litre, whereas 
the retailer gets 20.5 cents per litre. This is totally unfair. 
Unfortunately, the vast majority of consumers are not aware of 
these facts.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	I see my colleague from Charlesbourg, who is a veterinarian, 
and who treated several dairy herds in his practice. He was 
probably not aware of the fact that dairies have to give 20.5 
cents to be able to sell their milk.
<P>
	I would also like to point out that, in Canada, almost 80 per 
cent of the markets are shared between four main distributors, 
four main grocery chains. So they can decide, for example, 
whether they want to have the products of a particular dairy in 
their store or not.
<P>
	In the end, who foots the bill? The consumers. Every year, I 
see dairy producers asking for an increase. I suppose that in 
August, the Canadian Dairy Commission will be hearing from 
the dairy producers that they want to get an increase. They will 
explain, in great detail, the effects of the 30 per cent cut in 
subsidies, which will come into effect in a few weeks or a few 
months, as well as the increase in production costs. I can assure 
you that the increase will be much more than only a few cents 
and a small fraction. The increase will have to be justified, when 
in fact there is no need to justify it to anyone.
<P>
	I want to get back to Bill C-92. Furthermore, the amendment 
made to the bill does not involve taxpayers' pockets in any way. 
In fact, what it involves is a change in the system that affects 
only the grain growers. So, it is only a matter of setting 
transportation costs more fairly to reflect reality.
<P>
	Though we can easily see that this amendment is more suited 
to the wishes of producers in the western part of the prairies than 
of those further to the east, we would be severely judged if we 
interfered in the internal business of grain producers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13455"> 13455 </A></B>
<P>
	However I have doubts about some clauses. By lowering 
returns of eastern prairie producers, Bill C-92 could well cause 
a reduction in quantities of grain shipped through the St. 
Lawrence Seaway. It would be very useful to know the extent of 
this possible reduction in order to be able to prevent the loss of 
too many jobs in the ports of the St. Lawrence Seaway.
<P>
	I would appreciate very much if somebody on the other side, 
and I am thinking in particular of my colleague and friend for 
Beauséjour, could respond to this legitimate concern of 
stakeholders.
<P>
	The other curious aspect of this bill is that it allows for the use 
of the grain transportation adjustment fund which, worth $300 
million. Around $100 million could be allocated to ensure a 
smooth transition. At the outset, a $300 million fund over a 
five-year period was put aside for western grain producers. But 
in the next three years $100 million will be spread between 
Thunder Bay and the ports of the St. Lawrence Seaway and there 
is talk of spending some $40 million for the 1995-96 crop year 
starting at the end of summer.
<P>
	This fund was meant to help producers adjust to the new 
situation, not to maintain the illusion, I repeat, the illusion that 
freight subsidies are still in place. Fortunately the agriculture 
minister said a few words about that earlier.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	You know, in Quebec, we thought that this government was 
much more generous towards western grain producers than 
towards farmers in the east.
<P>
	Western farm owners or tenants will receive $1.6 billion in 
direct subsidies. Considering that, in the west, 35 per cent of 
farms are leased, will this money be given to the owner or the 
tenant? No decision has been made yet. This $1.6 billion equals 
$18 an acre, and it is tax-free. Quite a gift.
<P>
	If you find a $100 bill in the street, you put it in your pocket 
and do not declare it on your tax return. This is about the same 
thing. It is a gift, a present from the Liberal government.
<P>
	Personally, I think it is too much, but grain producers think it 
is not enough. Liberals saw that in the Manitoba elections. They 
were almost sure to win, but only managed to get a few of their 
candidates elected. A real slap in the face. I have more fingers 
than I need on this hand to count the Manitoba Liberal members. 
My colleague for Chicoutimi reminds me that there are three of 
them.
<P>
	According to opinion polls, the Liberal Party of Canada seems 
to be very healthy. We could try to find reasons for that. But once 
in the booth, it seems that Canadians often change their mind. 
We will see tonight, at 8 o'clock, if the policies and openness of 
this government really reflect reality when we know the results 
of the Ontario election.
<P>
	A few weeks ago, in Ontario, Ms. Lyn McLeod was on cloud 
nine survey after survey; some of them gave more than 55 per 
cent of the votes to her Liberal Party. I remember that many of 
my colleagues in this House were bragging during statements by 
members. They were saying that Ontarians are intelligent, nice, 
that they know what they are doing, so they will vote for Lyn 
McLeod and the Liberal Party in Ontario.
<P>
	Today, Ontario Liberals have changed their tune. Now, they 
say that Ontarians are being exploited, that they are naive and do 
not get the message. That is funny, they are not nice Ontarians 
any more. Six weeks ago, they were beautiful, nice, smart and 
today, they are not as much.
<P>
	There are 99 federal ridings in Ontario. Only one is 
represented by one of my Reform colleagues, 98 out of 99 are 
Liberal. Does that really reflect reality? I do not think so. I had 
the opportunity on several occasions to go to Toronto in the last 
months. I was able to see that the Liberal Party was not enjoying 
the fine reputation that some here seemed to be bragging about.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	I am inviting the hon. member for Beauséjour to my 
apartment tonight to watch the election results on the French 
information network in a friendly atmosphere.
<P>
	To complete my remarks on Bill C-92, the $100 million to be 
allocated for adjustment purposes should be available only over 
the next three years. Farmers should not become dependent on 
this fund-it should not become a kind of antibiotic-since we 
might as well go back to the WGTA we have lived with for 98 
years, which everyone wanted to revoke but did not dare do so 
for fear of creating uncertainty.
<P>
	In three years, this $100 million will be gone, but it would be a 
shame if producers were left high and dry. This approach may 
simply delay the problem for three years. Why is this fund not 
used to really help people adapt or take early retirement?
<P>
	We in the Bloc Quebecois will support Bill C-92, to 
compensate a little for market distortion, but this does not mean 
in any way that Bill C-92 does not have flaws that could perhaps 
be corrected.
<P>
	Since I still have a few minutes left, allow me to get back to 
the problem facing most farmers in Quebec, Ontario and the 
maritimes. I referred earlier to the amounts the federal 
government is going to give western grain producers. There is a 
tax-free $1.6 billion, the $300 million adjustment fund to be 
spent over five years, and another $1 billion to promote 
agricultural exports.
<P>
	The Minister of Agriculture is being very honest. He said 
earlier that the main purpose of reducing, of revoking the WGTA 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13456"> 13456 </A></B>
<P>
is to diversify western agriculture and create value-added 
industries. Nothing could be better than creating value-added 
industries for our agricultural products. This is not a Canadian 
invention. All the countries in the world want added value, not 
for Canada but for themselves.
<P>
	The proof is that Japan does not buy canola oil; it buys canola 
and makes its own oil, fats and margarine. That is quite normal. 
The Japanese are not crazy. I understand perfectly what they are 
doing. They come here and buy our wheat, but do their own 
milling and make their own flour. They do not buy wheat flour in 
bags. They do the value adding in their own country. They do not 
come here and buy loaves of bread just to please us. They buy 
wheat from us and bake their own bread at home.
<P>
	We will have to play our cards right and, more importantly, be 
innovative in creating new products and carefully protecting the 
manufacturing processes, so that no one can come and copy 
them. So, every one is in favour of value adding, but the concern 
Quebecers and Ontarians in particular have is that federal 
subsidies could be used to diversify western agriculture, which 
would then compete with us on our own markets. I discussed this 
matter with two colleagues from the Reform Party; one is from 
Western Canada and the other from Ontario.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	Of course, that is more or less what they are up to, but as long 
as I sit in this house, rest assured, Madam Speaker, that I will 
look after the interests of the people of Quebec, particularly 
those of the riding of Frontenac whom I represent. At the risk of 
ruffling the feathers of our western colleagues, I will say out 
loud what we, Quebecers, know how to use our brains.
<P>
	I should point out that there is a new phenomenon at work in 
this House, and I hope that the people of Quebec will not repeat 
the mistake they made in 1970, 1972, 1976 and 1978, when they 
elected to this place 74 Liberal members-you are right, Madam 
Speaker, to whisper the figure to me-out of a maximum of 75, 
the exception being my pal Roch LaSalle, who had to run a 
one-man opposition from Quebec in this place.
<P>
	We have seen what good it did Quebec to be represented by so 
many good Liberals, who were supposed to stand up for us. Just 
think of the War Measures Act. My hon. colleague will no doubt 
remember that, while there were only a handful of FLQ 
members, 498 people were arrested without any warrant, and 
detained for weeks. Tactics used in Russia and others 
totalitarian states were applied in Canada in the days of the good 
old Liberal Prime Minister, Pierre Elliott Trudeau.
<P>
	Léopold Corriveau, the member who represented my riding at 
the time, voted for the War Measures Act, a bludgeon law only 
fit for totalitarian states. Yet, any time a totalitarian state 
implements such measures, the Canadian government, the world 
leader of democratic governments, is the first to protest and 
make representations against them.
<P>
	Last week, in the region where I live, young people from my 
village were collecting money to buy postage stamps to send 
letters to Latin-American countries, on behalf of Amnesty 
International, asking that prisoners of conscience, not to say 
political prisoners, be released.
<P>
	I still admire Pauline Julien, but I admired her even more 
when I was a teenager, for her wonderful songs. Her husband, 
the late lamented Gérald Godin, was jailed under the War 
Measures Act. That very feeling man told himself: ``In the next 
election, I will run against the man who contributed to having 
me unfairly imprisoned, and I will win''. That man was one of 
your friends, Robert Bourassa, in 1976. He was soundly 
defeated in a French-speaking riding of Montreal's east end by 
Gérald Godin, who had been illegally jailed under the War 
Measures Act. That legislation had been supported by 74 Liberal 
members, with only one opposing it. This is a real shame.
<P>
	Quebecers' motto is ``Je me souviens'', I remember. We do 
remember, but we are very ashamed.
<P>
	I am pleased to participate in the debate on this bill, but it 
makes me relive all these episodes, and all the injustices done to 
Quebec in the past.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	I do hope that the day is soon coming when Quebecers will 
have a country of their own, collect their own taxes, draft their 
own legislation, and manage their own affairs as they see fit, and 
I also hope that there will be nothing untoward that we would 
live to regret for the rest of our lives. Liberal members opposite 
will have to live with the War Measures Act of 1970 for the rest 
of theirs.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
here today to debate Bill C-92, which is a bill to amend the 
Canadian Wheat Board Act. I find I have today less energy and 
less enthusiasm for debate and participation in the House than I 
should have and would normally have.
<P>
	We witnessed in the House less than an hour ago an action that 
makes me sad and angry at the same time. What we have seen is 
the Liberal government, a government that campaigned on a 
more open and honest type of government, a government that 
campaigned on improving the democratic system in the House, 
invoke closure on three bills that are very important to 
Canadians and that Canadians want to be debated fully in the 
House.
<P>
	One of these bills is Bill C-41, the bill that will allow the 
courts to impose greater sentences on those convicted of crimes 
motivated by hate. Hate can be based on many-
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13457"> 13457 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. McKinnon:</B> Madam Speaker, on a point of order, I would 
like to question the relevancy of what the member is speaking on 
in connection with Bill C-92.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I request the member for 
Vegreville relate his remarks to the bill before the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Madam Speaker, as members will see as I go 
along, one of the aspects I deal with in regard to this legislation 
is the lack of democracy in the Canadian Wheat Board. That is 
related to this bill. I make these comments and they will be tied 
in to my presentation later.
<P>
	I can understand the member's not wanting me to bring up the 
issue of closure. He should be ashamed. It is important that I do, 
and it will strengthen my argument later when I talk about the 
lack of democracy in the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	Three bills now have had closure invoked by the Liberal 
government. They are bills that are very important to Canadians 
and they should have full debate in the House.
<P>
	This follows on the heels of the corruption we have seen in the 
government on the part of the heritage minister, which has not 
been dealt with by the Prime Minister, who would have called 
for the resignation of the heritage minister had he been willing 
to deal with this issue the way he should. It really makes it 
difficult for me to gather any kind of enthusiasm to debate any 
bill, including this bill, Bill C-92, having to follow that kind of 
performance on the part of this government.
<P>
	I will discuss Bill C-92 today under three basic categories. 
First I will talk about what the bill is, what is in the bill and what 
should be in the bill. Second, I will talk about the impact on 
grain farmers and on the grain industry of this legislation if it is 
passed as it has been presented. Third, I will talk about how this 
bill fails to deal with the broader changes that are needed in the 
Canadian Wheat Board, including the democratic changes I 
alluded to.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	The bill is another attempt to tinker with a system that needs 
major change. I am talking about the Canadian Wheat Board, an 
organization which I think Reformers support. I believe there is 
widespread support in the Reform Party for the Canadian Wheat 
Board and our policy demonstrates this. There is also 
widespread support for reform of the Canadian Wheat Board 
particularly to make it more responsive to farmers who after all 
pay for the full cost of operating the board and whom the board 
exists to serve.
<P>
	The bill is a move in the right direction and will providea move toward a more market driven and more transparent 
system, at least in this one very narrow area of freightpooling. However, this bill is tinkering with the system when we 
should have broad legislation which would completely change 
the Canadian Wheat Board as it exists today.
<P>
	The tinkering is because of other changes that have been 
implemented in the transportation system with the trade 
agreements in the grain handling system. I believe even these 
changes are not wanted by the minister and certainly not by the 
Canadian Wheat Board, but they are needed to keep up with the 
times.
<P>
	Bill C-92 if passed will make changes to the Canadian Wheat 
Board Act which will allow changes to the Canadian Wheat 
Board's freight pooling system. Farmers from eastern 
Saskatchewan and all of Manitoba will pay higher freight costs, 
while farmers from western Saskatchewan and Alberta and the 
Peace River block of British Columbia which is in the Canadian 
Wheat Board area will pay lower freight costs. This change in 
freight costs will reflect more accurately the actual cost of 
moving the grain from these locations. In this regard the bill 
does provide a move in the right direction.
<P>
	I have many concerns about the bill. It includes very little in 
terms of detail. The bill will allow for the changes which will 
make the freight costs that farmers are paying much closer to 
what the market would indicate they should be but there is very 
little in the bill that will ensure these changes will take place. 
There is nothing in the bill that says it must happen. There are 
only changes that will allow it to happen. This is of great 
concern to me. Any changes that are made will be made by order 
in council, by the minister and cabinet.
<P>
	While there is some background information on the numbers 
and the specifics of the changes, there is very little detail of this 
in the legislation. We will push for amendments that will add 
some certainty to the legislation as to just what kinds of dollar 
changes will be made in the freight costs for farmers across 
western Canada with regard to wheat board grain.
<P>
	The bill only applies to board grains which are wheat and 
barley for export. It does not apply to all the other grains and 
special crops that farmers produce.
<P>
<B>(1235 ) </B>
<P>
	I will go over in a bit more detail what is included in Bill 
C-92. The stated purpose of the bill is to amend the Canadian 
Wheat Board Act to change pooling points on which initial 
payments are based from Thunder Bay and Vancouver to points 
in Canada designated by the governor in council and to establish 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13458"> 13458 </A></B>
<P>
a deduction from the initial payments that reflect the relative 
transportation cost advantage of each producer.
<P>
	Through the bill, which will be effective August 1 if it is 
passed by the House before the session ends, the federal 
government will change how eastward grain transportation costs 
are paid. That means eastern prairie farmers who ship through 
the St. Lawrence seaway will have to pay the full cost of 
movement, or at least close to the full cost, within three years.
<P>
	In the past, all prairie farmers have shared the costs of 
shipping Canadian Wheat Board grain through pooling. The 
extra cost of shipping Canadian Wheat Board grain through the 
seaway system, which is on average $22 a tonne, has been 
pooled. Not only are the farmers who are shipping their grain 
through Thunder Bay and on down the St. Lawrence paying the 
extra costs, but all farmers within the wheat board designated 
area who ship grain to the board are sharing the costs through the 
pool.
<P>
	That means all farmers, in particular the farmers from western 
Saskatchewan and Alberta, have been receiving less for their 
wheat and barley than they should have been. Farmers from 
eastern Saskatchewan and Manitoba have been receiving more 
than they should have been. This has been done by pooling the 
freight costs so that all farmers take an equal deduction from 
their price for the cost of freight. I have many concerns about 
this being done and I will discuss some of them later.
<P>
	Originally the government planned to change the eastern 
pooling points next year. However, at least according to the 
minister, several Manitoba farm groups have called on him to 
make the change effective at the start of this crop year which 
begins on August 1.
<P>
	The minister claimed that the farm groups which have been 
encouraging him to make the change have said they need the 
change in order to bring more certainty to the system. In other 
words, they say they want to know what will happen and they 
want to know now. They want to know how much more it is 
going to cost them. That is coming from the farmers in Manitoba 
who are going to pay more. That is the way the minister of 
agriculture explained the need for making the change this crop 
year on August 1 rather than next year.
<P>
	It is commendable that the minister would want to allow this 
kind of certainty to at least creep into the Canadian Wheat Board 
freight pooling system. It is unfortunate that the same kind of 
certainty will not be in place when the changes are made to the 
WGTA, in terms of moving grain by the rail system. That 
uncertainty will be there until 1999, the year before the 
maximum freight rates may be lifted. The decision will not be 
made until the year before the rates can be lifted and that leaves 
a lot of uncertainty in place. I encourage the minister to be as 
concerned about the uncertainty caused by that change which 
was implemented by the budget as he is about the change to the 
pooling of freight through the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	Consistency is needed. We need the minister to make some 
decisions which will add certainty to the agriculture industry. I 
commend him for doing it in this one narrow area.
<P>
<B>(1240 ) </B>
<P>
	In terms of transitional assistance, a fund which came about 
as a result of this budget, $300 million was put in place for a 
transition fund. It is meant to be used to help different sectors of 
agriculture deal with the change in the freight rate.
<P>
	Nothing in the bill states this but through discussions the 
department has said that about $100 million of this $300 million 
in transition funds will be paid to farmers in Manitoba and 
eastern Saskatchewan over a three year period to help them deal 
with the added freight costs they will find themselves covering 
out of their own pockets. This is reasonable because it is an 
additional burden put on the Manitoba farmers even above the 
burden of paying full costs which, as a result of this budget, have 
been put in place for all western farmers.
<P>
	All western farmers will be paying the full freight costs as of 
August 1. With this change, Manitoba farmers will be paying an 
additional cost of approximately $6 a tonne. It would be 
extremely difficult for the farmers to deal with this starting on 
August 1 of this year. The transition money being paid to these 
farmers is reasonable. I know some of my colleagues will talk 
about a concern they have about there being enough money left 
in this fund to help alfalfa and timothy shippers deal with the 
radical changes they face in their industry.
<P>
	I have talked about what is in this legislation. Now I will talk 
about what is not in this legislation as it applies to the 
government achieving the goals it has laid out through this 
legislation.
<P>
	As long as there is a Canadian Wheat Board where there is a 
price pooling system in place, it will be necessary to have a 
pooling schedule for freight. It is necessary for that system to 
work.
<P>
	There are very few specifics in this bill regarding the exact 
nature of the new freight pooling system. For instance, there us 
very little information about the decision on the actual 
catchment areas, which will be smaller areas of pooling within 
these catchment areas, and what they might look like. There 
have been some proposals put forth but there is no certainty in 
these. We do not know for sure what the catchment areas will 
look like.
<P>
	If the government decides to put in place the national grains 
bureau recommendation for catchment areas, then there will be 
four catchment areas for wheat: the west coast, the east coast, 
Churchill and the U.S. There will still be freight pooling within 
these areas. Why are we not moving toward a system that fully 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13459"> 13459 </A></B>
<P>
reflects the marketplace and the cost to farmers? Why are we 
just tinkering and going part way? However, it is definitely a 
move in the right direction.
<P>
	If the government goes with the national grains bureau 
proposal on malting barley there would be two catchment areas, 
the west coast and the United States. Again, it is a move in the 
right direction even though it does not go far enough.
<P>
	It is appropriate at this time to explain clearly what this 
freight pooling does and how it relates to the price pooling 
which operates under the Canadian Wheat Board. The freight 
pooling as I explained before causes all farmers who sell grain 
through the Canadian Wheat Board to pay an equal amount of 
the freight bill, even if after looking at the market signals they 
should be paying less, or perhaps more.
<P>
	This has lowered the price in the price pool which gives all 
farmers an equal price for their wheat. It has lowered the price 
by the same amount no matter what the freight costs are. Clearly 
to have this price pooling system work there must be some kind 
of a freight pooling system in place. Otherwise it would be 
extremely difficult though not impossible for the wheat board to 
calculate the payments which go to all farmers.
<P>
<B>(1245 ) </B>
<P>
	To explain a bit more about the pooling system I will give a 
brief summary from a background document which, while not 
part of the legislation, is said by the department to be what the 
legislation is based on. It is a summary of two proposals put 
forward by the National Grains Bureau and the Canadian Wheat 
Board.
<P>
	The first proposal comes from the National Grains Bureau. 
Under its proposal all producers would be deducted a decreasing 
freight amount moving east or west of the west coast catchment 
area.
<P>
	The proposal was widely discussed in the payment producer 
panel report. The payment producer panel was established by 
the Conservative government and was continued by the Liberal 
government. Unfortunately its proposals really were not 
considered when the changes were made to the Western Grain 
Transportation Act which is what this panel was discussing.
<P>
	The National Grains Bureau proposal was later modified to 
include shipments through Churchill and directly to the U.S. 
market. The relative proximity of a producer to these markets 
would determine the basis for the deduction. That is the National 
Grains Bureau proposal.
<P>
	The second is the CWB '85 proposal, as it is called. This 
proposal recognizes the general equivalence of west coast and 
St. Lawrence ports in terms of sales returns. It recommended 
that the eastern pooling point be changed from Thunder Bay to 
the St. Lawrence. That is what will happen if the legislation is 
passed as the department says it will.
<P>
	However this proposal will not work under the current 
circumstances because of the higher demand for grain from 
customers in the Japan and Saudi Arabian markets. The proposal 
will not work until a balance can once again be achieved 
between the east coast and the west coast shipments.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board proposes to devise a system of 
pooling based primarily on the National Grains Bureau model. 
The Canadian Wheat Board is hoping that because of the 
increased transportation costs inherent in the National Grains 
Bureau proposal, producers will compare returns from pool 
accounts for wheat, durum, feed barley, malt barley and 
non-Canadian Wheat Board crops and eventually diversify, 
based on anticipated future rates of return.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board wants to move toward the 
CWB'85 proposal as constraints on the west coast catchment 
area are reduced. It believes in the long term this will be a viable 
option.
<P>
	In a nutshell those are the two proposals which were outlined 
in the background paper given to the committee and to MPs who 
were interested in Bill C-92.
<P>
	I will now comment on how the Liberals are trying to rig the 
entire system in order to keep the Canadian Wheat Board as a 
monopoly seller even though it is really no longer practical or 
viable.
<P>
	The bill seeks to make a new pooling system with the same 
type of structure, except using smaller catchment areas, so there 
is an advantage, but using the same type of system. Instead of 
making major changes to the whole wheat board system and to 
the freight costs to farmers, the government has chosen to try to 
modify the old system. Too often this is the type of thinking that 
creeps into a bureaucracy. It is certainly here in this bill. It is 
unfortunate because it really does fulfil all of the changes that 
are needed.
<P>
	One of my concerns about this legislation is that we really do 
not know the details. The background paper is there, but it is not 
part of the legislation.
<P>
	That summarizes what is in the bill and what is missing at 
least as it relates to what the stated purpose of this bill is. I 
would now like to discuss the impact of this legislation on 
farmers and on the grain industry if it goes forward as it is 
proposed.
<P>
<B>(1250 ) </B>
<P>
	This change reflects at least partially the actual cost to 
farmers of shipping from different points on the prairies, again 
limited because they are still pooling within each of the four 
catchment areas.
<P>
	At least it moves in the right direction. I will demonstrate 
using some numbers from the background paper for wheat and 
for barley. First for wheat. Wheat being shipped from Winnipeg, 
Portage la Prairie, Brandon under this new proposal will cost 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13460"> 13460 </A></B>
<P>
farmers about $5.80 more per tonne than it does under the 
present system.
<P>
	On the other hand, farmers from Medicine Hat, Lethbridge, 
Calgary would pay about $5 a tonne less than they do under the 
present system. Therefore it will cost about $6 more for farmers 
in western Saskatchewan and Manitoba, depending on which 
catchment area they are in, and farmers in southern Alberta will 
receive $5 more for their grain. The amount in other areas 
depends on which catchment area farmers are in.
<P>
	The change for feed barley is even more dramatic. Feed barley 
is a lower priced commodity. Under this proposal, farmers in the 
Winnipeg, Portage la Prairie, Brandon area will pay anywhere 
from $16 to $18.50 a tonne more to ship their grain than they 
have in the past, whereas farmers from Medicine Hat, 
Lethbridge and Calgary will pay $7 to $8 per tonne less than they 
do under the present system.
<P>
	The change will cause the freight cost paid by farmers to 
reflect more closely the actual cost of moving the grain. 
Therefore this is a move in the right direction.
<P>
	The third area I will discuss is what this bill fails to do in 
reforming the Canadian Wheat Board. I certainly cannot talk 
about everything it fails to do but I want to talk about the points 
that are most relevant to this bill.
<P>
	I begin by reading an open letter to grain farmers that I sent to 
papers across western Canada. This letter was picked up by most 
of the weekly papers across western Canada and some of the 
larger papers.
<P>
	I want to read the letter. It certainly ties in with the importance 
of making the wheat board more democratic:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Over the past year, the Canadian Wheat Board has been greatly debated by 
both farmers and national media. The publicity and discussion surrounding this 
issue has resulted in a polarization of public opinion. Farmers who support 
changing the Canadian Wheat Board are immediately branded as board 
destroyers. Farmers who do not support changes to the Canadian Wheat Board 
also find themselves under attack by those who strongly favour change.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>During meetings with farmers and farm groups, I have been promoting a 
mechanism for building a bridge across the gap that separates those who favour 
changes to the board and those who are opposed. It is a mechanism which all 
farmers could support. I believe the first real step toward meaningful change to 
the Canadian Wheat Board is through a farmer elected board of directors which 
would replace the current system of government appointed commissioners and 
an advisory board that has no real power.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Farmers should be given the authority, which is rightfully theirs because they 
pay the bills, to decide what type of wheat board they want. An elected board of 
directors would replace the current system of government appointed 
commissioners and shift control away from the federal government to farmers.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Within 6 to 18 months of electing a board of directors, farmers should be 
given a chance to democratically examine their organizational and 
jurisdictional options. This will allow grain farmers to carefully consider and 
vote on a variety of market opportunities.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>These options could include introducing greater domestic and international 
market competition, allowing the purchase of wheat and barley on either a cash 
basis or a pool basis and allowing the board to operate as a seller from export 
terminal positions only, which would take the board completely out of the car 
allocation and grain handling process. These and other issues would be decided 
directly by farmers through referendum.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>An elected board of directors would submit their proposals for initial crop 
payments to Parliament as the commissioners do now. Elected representatives 
would then vote to determine if these payments were reasonable. The purpose 
behind the measure is to provide a government check on the otherwise 
independent board by having Parliament approve initial payments and loan 
guarantees because taxpayers' dollars are involved.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Farmers themselves will have their own ideas regarding the Canadian Wheat 
Board and how to make it work better for farmers. All of these proposals must be 
considered.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Several people have asked what my personal position is regarding possible 
changes to the board. I support the concept of opening the board up to 
competition. However, it is not up to me or the federal government to decide on 
the future of the Canadian Wheat Board. This decision must be made solely by 
western Canadian grain farmers.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Canadian Wheat Board will be a subject of continued discussion until the 
democratic rights of Canadian grain farmers are restored and they are given a 
real choice in how their organization will run in the future.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>An elected board of directors is the only real option for the federal 
government. After all, who can argue with democracy?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	It has become apparent from what we have seen in the House 
today that the government can argue with democracy. We do not 
have a functioning democracy in Parliament and we must get a 
functioning democracy in the House. The Liberals must uphold 
their promise in that regard.
<P>
	They must also make the changes necessary to allow farmers 
to democratically control the future of the Canadian Wheat 
Board and to decide what the wheat board should be. Why 
should government make these decisions? Why should the 
farmers marketing board be answerable to the minister and be 
directed by the minister rather than by farmers? It makes no 
sense.
<P>
	This issue has been a very emotional one for several reasons. 
Farmers who remember when the Canadian Wheat Board came 
into place know that it served a very useful function.
<P>
	At the time the Canadian Wheat Board was established there 
was a lack of competition in the grain buying business in 
Canada. Farmers never had a properly functioning marketplace. 
There was no competition at a lot of delivery points. Farmers 
were at the mercy of the grain buyers because the information 
system in place today was not there. Today's transportation 
system was  not in place and farmers were largely hauling grain 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13461"> 13461 </A></B>
<P>
by wagon. It would be too difficult to take a load of grain home 
again after they had delivered it to the elevator. Therefore, they 
really were at the mercy of the grain buyers.
<P>
	When the wheat board came into being it served a very useful 
purpose. It still does but it is a different purpose now.
<P>
	The people who remember what the wheat board gave them 
when it came into place in 1935 tend to forget the changes that 
have been made since. They also forget the reality of the 
marketplace we live in now, with good information sources and 
relatively good transportation to get the grain from the farm to 
the elevators.
<P>
	People also forget that when the wheat board was developed 
in 1935 it was a voluntary board. Farmers had a choice. They 
could choose to deliver to the Canadian Wheat Board and share 
in the pool price or they could choose to ship to a buyer to any 
market and completely bypass the board. That is the way it was 
when the Canadian Wheat Board was established.
<P>
<B>(1300 ) </B>
<P>
	In 1943 under the War Measures Act the wheat board was 
given a monopoly. Why was it given a monopoly? I found it very 
interesting to read the newspaper articles and to read the 
discussion in the House that surrounded this change in 1943 that 
gave the wheat board its monopoly. This change was made by 
order in council; it never passed through Parliament.
<P>
	The change was made to the Canadian Wheat Board to make it 
a monopoly so that the war effort in Canada and in Europe would 
be helped. Grain prices at the time were increasing rapidly and 
the government was finding it too expensive to ship grain to 
Europe to help with the war effort and to feed the troops in 
Canada. The choices it had were to borrow more money to pay 
more for the grain or to make the wheat board a monopoly buyer 
in the Canadian market. Through order in council it chose to 
make the wheat board a monopoly buyer in the Canadian market, 
which it has remained until today, even though the 
circumstances are much different today.
<P>
	When people discuss the Canadian Wheat Board there is a lot 
of talk about the monopoly selling aspect of the board. The 
wheat board does not have a monopoly on sales. It sells into a 
market with a lot of competition. Grain companies from around 
the world compete on the sell side. There is no selling 
monopoly. The only monopoly the Canadian Wheat Board has is 
on the buy side. Farmers have been forced to sell grain through 
the board since that order in council passed in 1943 for any 
grain, any wheat or barley being sold for export and for wheat 
being used for domestic purposes in Canada.
<P>
	This has been an emotional issue for some time. A second 
reason this has been an emotional issue is that people are 
generally afraid of change. I will give a few quotes from a paper 
given by Dr. Larry Martin to the B.C. egg producers in March. I 
sincerely hope the quotes  I use allow the content of his paper to 
be brought forward. It is a commendable paper. He is talking 
about change in agriculture generally, not just this change that is 
being proposed to the Canadian Wheat Board. Dr. Martin says 
the biggest obstacle to Canadian agriculture competing over the 
next decade is farmers themselves. The change in thinking that 
is needed is that the agriculture industry in place today nowhere 
nearly reflects the agriculture industry that will be in place 10 
years down the road.
<P>
	Here are some of the quotes I thought were particularly good: 
``Look forward 20 years'', Martin challenged, ``and you won't 
recognize the Canadian agri-food industry. We are lucky to be 
living during the most exciting period for the industry. This is 
why we have to think seriously about how that change can be 
managed, because we have only that one chance to get it right''. 
This is from the Canada <I>Poultry Man</I> magazine.
<P>
	The other quote compares the American system in the supply 
managed industries, with very large operators, to the Canadian 
system, which has smaller operators. He says the smaller 
operators can still compete very well: ``Small operations allow 
for industry flexibility, whereas larger U.S. companies may be 
low cost but can't switch quickly and have to market using the 
`here it is, buy it cheap and eat it' philosophy''. This philosophy 
applies as well to the grains industry. Farmers need the ability, 
even though they are small operations, either directly or through 
the grain companies to sell to whomever they want, without the 
regulations and the unnecessary interference from government.
<P>

<P>
	At second reading Reform will be supporting Bill C-92. 
However, we will be looking for amendments. We will be 
looking for changes and we will be proposing amendments in 
committee or in the House at the appropriate time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Glen McKinnon (Brandon-Souris, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to rise to speak in support of Bill 
C-92, which is a bill to amend the Canadian Wheat Board Act. 
The bill will result in a fairer method of allocating freight costs 
among prairie producers of wheat and barley sold through the 
Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	The change in freight cost pooling has been requested by the 
western grains industry and by those farmers who make their 
living doing what they do best, growing wheat and barley on the 
Canadian prairies. This change, once approved, will allow the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13462"> 13462 </A></B>
<P>
returns received by farmers from the Canadian Wheat Board to 
more accurately reflect actual market conditions and costs.
<P>
	My hon. friends may be asking themselves just what wheat 
board pooling is, how it works and why it is being changed. At 
this juncture some background explanation may be instructive.
<P>
	Currently producers within the Canadian Wheat Board who 
deliver grains to the board have deducted from their initial 
payment the freight costs incurred in moving their product to 
export position. That has traditionally been either Thunder Bay 
or Vancouver, whichever happens to result in the lower freight 
rate. For example, under the current pooling system producers 
in my home area, which is Brandon, who live closer to Thunder 
Bay, would have an estimated $20.34 a tonne in freight charges 
deducted from their initial payments as of August 1, 1995. A 
similar grain producer in the Calgary area would naturally be 
closer to the port of Vancouver and would have a freight 
deduction estimated at about $22.19. Grain being shipped to 
Thunder Bay faces an additional cost of about $20 a tonne to 
move from Thunder Bay east through the St. Lawrence seaway 
to final export position.
<P>
	The additional costs are currently shared equally by all 
producers through the Canadian Wheat Board's pool accounts. 
For wheat, around $7 per tonne is paid by all producers out of the 
pool account to cover the additional expense.
<P>
	The current pooling system means that income from the 
western part of the prairies is being transferred to the eastern 
part of the prairies. Even if the grain producer ships all their 
wheat to Vancouver, they are paying through the pool accounts 
to have eastern prairie grain transported from Thunder Bay 
farther down the St. Lawrence to ports that handle more export 
business.
<P>
	Farmers in the western prairies are subsidizing part of those 
shipping costs for farmers in the eastern prairies. Clearly, the 
situation calls for change. A need for change has long been 
recognized by many throughout the industry. As some of the 
previous commentators on the bill have indicated, many 
producers have been afraid of embarking on a route that would 
enable such changes to occur. The driving force behind the 
change has come from industry and farm groups themselves. 
Parliament is merely carrying out the strongly conveyed wishes 
of those who work in and earn their living from the western 
grains industry. In addition, the four western provincial 
governments also support the necessary changes.
<P>
	At this juncture some may be asking themselves why the 
government is carrying out its comprehensive reform to 
Canada's grain transportation system. More specifically, why is 
the grain freight cost pooling system being changed now?
<P>
	There are at least four reasons why it makes sense to take 
action to reform the grain transport system. First, the new GATT 
agreement contains a number of rules against trade distorting 
export subsidies, including the WGTA, which all parties have 
recognized has been a distorting mechanism. If we do not make 
fundamental  changes to our grain transport system, Canada 
could see itself being shut out of vital export markets.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	Second, it is in our interest to develop a grain transport system 
that is more efficient, faster, and less expensive to operate. The 
savings that will come from such a system must be shared fairly 
and equally among all the participants, most especially by the 
farmers.
<P>
	Third, Canada's prairie economy has been stifled for decades 
by a freight rate structure that promotes exporting of primary 
products and actively discourages diversification and value 
added processing. Until we end that discrimination, the west 
will be prevented from achieving its full potential.
<P>
	Finally, this government and the people of Canada can no 
longer afford the luxury of annual rail subsidies of more than 
half a billion dollars, not when the government is facing a debt 
load of more than $500 billion and interest charges amounting to 
$120 million each and every day of the year.
<P>
	For years now farmers in the western regions of the prairies 
have complained that maintaining Thunder Bay as the eastern 
pooling point was just not realistic and that it unfairly added to 
the cost borne by the producers in the western part of the 
prairies. For their part, the farmers in the eastern parts of the 
prairies have acknowledged this anomaly but have voiced 
concern about higher freight costs they would face if the eastern 
pooling point were changed from Thunder Bay to the lower St. 
Lawrence.
<P>
	It is my belief that this bill strikes a careful balance between 
the interests of western and eastern prairie producers. It is a 
product of a long debate, going back as far as 1985, and more 
recent intensive analysis and close consultation involving the 
prairie farm organizations, industry, the provinces, and the grain 
cooperatives. This consultation has resulted in the proposed 
changes we are debating here today.
<P>
	The grain farmers of western Canada have spoken. They have 
told us with a strong and united voice that there is a problem 
with the current grain pooling system, that the problem needs to 
be addressed, and that it must be addressed now.
<P>
	We must act now. The freight pooling system has never 
involved a subsidy. It has involved a form of 
cross-subsidization of one group of farmers subsidizing those in 
another. These same producers are now telling us that they want 
this current arrangement brought to an end. The people have 
spoken. Change will be happening.
<P>

<HR>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I ask 
the hon. member, who I think is from rural Manitoba, if grain 
farmers in his constituency support this change, which will add a 
cost to their shipping of grain of between $5 and $17 a tonne, 
depending on the grain and which catchment area they fall 
within.
<P>
	Although I did not hear it in the member's speech, I would like 
to comment on his support for invoking closure on C-68 as well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McKinnon:</B> Madam Speaker, I have no comment to make 
on any closure at any time on any bill. However, I was most 
pleasantly surprised by his first question asking my opinion, 
because he is the recognized economist in the grains business in 
Alberta. I appreciate the point he is raising.
<P>
	There has been a strong recognition that Brandon, Manitoba, 
is one of the highest cost shipping points throughout the grain 
transportation industry. In order to allow the current farmers to 
maintain their position as farmers, they are recognizing that 
some transitions are going to have to be made over a period of 
time. There will be some shifts, some changes, some 
partnerships that will have to be struck.
<P>
<B>(1315 ) </B>
<P>
	My region probably leads western Canada already in 
diversification thrusts in terms of crop production. If members 
look into some of the data they will find Brandon-Souris is a 
strong agricultural area. I am hopeful it will continue to be so in 
the future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
sure the hon. member is concerned about the welfare of farmers 
in his constituency. He said they will have to make some 
adjustments. They will be paying substantially more freight 
costs than they are now. That means a lower net price for grain 
relative to other grain farmers in western Canada, which really 
puts into place some of the market mechanisms, the natural 
comparative advantage that should be there.
<P>
	One of the possible ways farmers in his area could deal with 
this extra cost is by shipping south into the United States. 
Unfortunately right now the Canadian Wheat Board restricts 
movement into the United States. Farmers in his area even more 
than now will be pushing this minister to allow competition with 
the wheat board into the United States or to allow farmers to sell 
directly to markets in the United States.
<P>
	Does the member believe farmers in his area will be lobbying 
in every way they can to get these changes made to the wheat 
board so they can make up for some of the losses they have 
incurred, from the loss of the WGTA and the extra costs through 
Bill C-92?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McKinnon:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
the question.
<P>
	My comment is a little historical and futuristic in perspective. 
The closer one lives to the U.S. border the greater the desire to 
access that market by producers. As one moves further north 
from the border there is less and less thrust by the producers to 
access the market because of the geographical distance produce 
has to be hauled and depending on what product they are trying 
to ship.
<P>
	I concur that new processes and regulations need to be 
examined. Realistically there is a market. American industries 
using Canadian grain still want our product for let us say the 
protein content in our product and not available in their own.
<P>
	I agree with my colleague that it needs to be examined. It also 
needs to be accessed by Canadian producers in the long term.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
was rather anxious to speak on this subject today when my 
colleague from Vegreville asked me if I would be willing to 
address a bill on the Wheat Board. I certainly am willing. It 
gives me an opportunity to express the views of what I hear 
when I am in my riding talking to the farmers on which these 
bills have such a direct effect.
<P>
	It must be funny to some people in the gallery who come to 
listen to what we call a debate and they see all the empty chairs. 
They sometimes must wonder if we are debating with the 
security guards.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Bakopanos):</B> I do not think the 
hon. member should make mention of the absence of members 
in the House.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I guess I am not used to hearing myself so 
much in here; there is an echo.
<P>
	It is neat to come into a debate on this subject. I hope some 
day we truly can get into some good honest hard debates about 
issues rather than some of the examples of what I am seeing this 
morning where we are bringing in closure on certain things. I 
like to have debates like we are attempting to do with this bill.
<P>
	The ideas the agricultural minister is bringing forward in this 
bill certainly have merit. They are things we have been looking 
for in the Reform Party. They are things some farmers have been 
looking for but they are only little tinkerings, a start.
<P>
	I am sure we will not have any difficulty in supporting this but 
I draw to the attention of members of the House that we need to 
really get into a serious debate about these issues regarding the 
Wheat Board, especially when we go across the country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13464"> 13464 </A></B>
<P>
	I am talking about not just my riding, but Vegreville and other 
ridings in other provinces. When we hear people saying scrap 
the wheat board, farmers are saying this and others are on the 
other extreme, that is why it deserves such a good debate. It is 
time viewpoints were brought forward and discussed so that we 
can come up with some ideas which will genuinely answer the 
causes of all the farmers across the country.
<P>
	I echo once again what I had hoped to see in a bill when it 
came down regarding the wheat board. It would be more than 
just the pooling points and the minor change regarding the 
shipping calculations.
<P>
	I would like to see some changes indicating the House was 
interested in having an elected, democratic board in the wheat 
board. It would be elected by farmers who then would have more 
input into what happens at the wheat board level. The board 
should be more relevant to the problems facing producers, 
changes the producers so much need that they would be able to 
seek help in getting those changes. The wheat board should be a 
producer oriented operation rather than another patronage 
appointment haven for the friends of the Liberal Party.
<P>
	Upsetting farmers is that their input is so small. Then we see 
bills brought before the House, not too long ago something to do 
with access of information, which would require the wheat 
board and other organizations of that nature to open the books 
for examination, to see how they are operating and what they are 
doing. We would get a little more information that people who 
are paying the bill are entitled to.
<P>
	Unfortunately it seems we are getting further away from that 
instead of being more accountable to the people who pay the 
bills, in this case the farmers who support all the funding for our 
wheat board.
<P>
	It is only sensible that we should pick up a bill and hopefully 
see some positive changes that would give farmers more input, 
more say and certainly some knowledge about where their 
money is spent. No, when we suggested that, when we put it in 
the form of a motion, it was soundly defeated by our colleagues 
across the way.
<P>
	It makes me sometimes wonder what is so secretive that they 
cannot open the books of a government body to the people 
paying the bills. I have a hard time understanding that.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Ask the auditor general.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I hear members across the way hollering 
about the auditor general. I am surprised they even know who he 
is. They never pay attention to what he says. We can name lots of 
things there, but I will not get on that topic.
<P>
<B>(1325 ) </B>
<P>
	I get a little concerned when I hear my colleague talking about 
things that have happened in the wheat board regarding changes 
from orders in council. Once again there are a selected few, 
usually the ones on the  front row here, who decide for all of 
Canadian farmers what is best for them.
<P>
	It does not matter if it is best for them but if they think it is 
best for them, that is what counts. We have a history of 30 or 40 
years of this happening; we know what is best for the people, we 
will make the decisions and you just never mind. That is the 
attitude people are beginning to think we have.
<P>
	The ability to have an open debate and throw things out on the 
floor the farmers would like us to do regarding the wheat board 
only makes sense. The trouble is we spend a lot of time and 
many of these things could be resolved. I hope a lot of these 
things are talked about in the agriculture standing committee. I 
know from serving on the justice committee there are hours 
talking with witnesses.
<P>
	I assume the same thing happens in the agriculture committee 
where its members get the feelings of people, giving them an 
opportunity to reflect those feelings in the form of a bill and 
bring it before the House for a good debate; unless they decide 
there is no reason to debate and they should put closure on it, 
shut it down to six hours or in the case of pensions four hours and 
forget the whole thing. They may feel the information fed to 
them by 60 or 70 witnesses is not important enough to bring in 
here, after all they are only the taxpayers.
<P>
	It is the attitude that bothers me and I think it needs to change. 
We have been asking, hoping and watching for that possibility 
but instead we get more of the same, an example of which we 
saw this morning.
<P>
	Regarding changing the shipping point calculations, when 
Wild Rose business tells us it cannot ship its product, there are 
some things we need to talk about with regard to bills. 
Compressed timothy producers tell me they cannot get 
containers to ship their product. Why is the government not 
addressing shipping problems to help Canada's balance of 
trade? Why is it not assisting a cash crop market instead of 
maintaining a narrow view of one issue?
<P>
	It is willing to help grain producers adjust to the new reality of 
shipping costs when the Crow is repealed. Farmers who have 
practised sound crop rotation principles and at the same time 
have developed a new cash crop market for Canadian produce 
are being abandoned. Compressed timothy and forage crop 
producers are far more sensitive to shipping costs than grain 
producers but the government has punished them for growing a 
crop that is not marketed through the wheat board. Then it 
wonders why some farmers get upset at the way the board 
operates.
<P>
	Not too long ago this body of people declared an open barley 
market, the continental barley market. Suddenly there were 
many farmers doing a good job of moving their produce, getting 
good prices. They were quite pleased they had an opportunity as 
producers to market their goods without having to go through a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13465"> 13465 </A></B>
<P>
monopoly. That was quickly shut down. We sometimes wonder 
why.
<P>
	Maybe it was because they were so successful, maybe they 
were proving they had the ability to do these things without the 
assistance of some great government appointed body. Maybe it 
was not the bureaucrats who had the ability to so these things; 
maybe the farmers could do this. At least they proved it for a 
while but the Liberal government cannot let that go on. So it was 
shut down. It simply tells people out there that if they grow 
certain crops they will go through this body by way of the arm's 
length setup of the wheat board to sell produce. That is the way it 
has to be done.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	Some farmers agree with it and I give them credit for it. 
However a pile of them say that the wheat board should be 
scrapped. We need to talk to all of them and start asking exactly 
what we can do to make the situation a lot better than it is.
<P>
	The bill is another example of half measures by government 
trying to convince Canadian farm producers that it is doing 
something when I am not so sure it might be making things 
worse. The Liberal government seems intent on abandoning 
farmers who have already adjusted to the global marketplace. I 
am talking particularly about forage and timothy hay growers 
who are doing very well.
<P>
	It is certainly strange when we meet with farmers in our 
communities. We tell cattlemen in a joking way what is coming 
down the tube, that we are setting up a cattle marketing board. 
Talk about shock and fear, the whole idea another system of that 
nature would interfere with their ability to access free markets 
such as they have now really frightens them.
<P>
	Why did the government arbitrarily decide that 1994 would be 
the cutoff year for support when producers were adjusting to the 
new global trading reality and when they went into forage and 
timothy to enhance their individual viability in the world trading 
market? Does the government have a problem with farmer 
initiative? Is it because the government wants to keep the 
Canadian Wheat Board as a closed shop, a patronage haven? It 
also wants to dictate to western producers what crops will be 
acceptable for them to grow. Exactly what is behind that?
<P>
	Why cannot the government assist western producers? 
Showing this initiative would not only help them to maintain 
their farms. It would also help Canada's balance of trade and 
make Canada a stronger trading nation.
<P>
	The European community and the United States realize that 
their treasuries cannot continue their farm subsidies and they 
will be cutting back. In the meantime, Canadian timothy and 
forage producers will face the full rate expenditure while 
European and American producers will have support.
<P>
	We do not have any problem with this half hearted attempt at 
modifying the Canadian Wheat Board. The shipping cost 
adjustment is a step that recognizes the reality of modern times 
and the global marketplace. However, merely readjusting who 
pays for the cost of shipping through the St. Lawrence seaway 
does nothing to tackle the real and dangerous problems facing 
Canadian producers and the inadequacies of the wheat board. It 
is a minor thing when there are so many major things we need to 
look at.
<P>
	Changing cost pooling so that western Saskatchewan and 
Alberta producers will no longer share the cost of shipping 
eastern Saskatchewan and Manitoba grain from Thunder Bay 
through the St. Lawrence seaway is acceptable. Why not 
continue and address the real issue of the needed fundamental 
changes to the wheat board?
<P>
	Members will say all the farmers want it. They must have a 
short memory. It was not too long ago that there were two rallies 
going on in Regina at the same time: one pro and one con, the 
one the agriculture minister would not attend.
<P>
	Why is the government so afraid to face the reality of the 
nineties and beyond? Why is its policies still stuck in the 
sixties? Why did the government not use the bill to give 
producers an opportunity to elect the board of directors? What is 
wrong with an elected board of directors? Is that too 
democratic? Is that the problem?
<P>
	It could be. I base that on things I have seen, such as what 
happened this morning. Why was the government so fearful of 
allowing those who know the business to run it? Why does it not 
allow producers who know the business the best to be in charge? 
Why does the government always feel it has to get involved in 
everything? Why does it feel that it will not be done right if it is 
not done from this place?
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	The whole thing will change. People will insist that it change 
rather quickly. If the government believes that will not be the 
case then it has a very short memory.
<P>
	I wonder if it would stop to think for a moment, when it looks 
at operations such as the wheat board and others, why the 
Reform Party is here. It should stop to analyse why the Reform 
Party needs to exist if for the last 30 years so-called Liberals and 
so-called Conservatives had done their jobs. We would not need 
to be here. Why did all western provinces, particularly rural 
farmers, decide enough was enough and to send Reformers who 
had presented to them an idea that made a lot more sense than the 
status quo?
<P>
	Once again we have a government bill that pretends to address 
issues of concern for western producers but in reality is an 
attempt to hide the failures. This half measure deals with an 
important issue but it is only a half measure.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13466"> 13466 </A></B>
<P>
	When will the government finally face reality and deal with 
the real problems that exist with the wheat board and the board's 
inability to accept that producers know what is best, not 
appointed bureaucrats? The producers, believe it or not, know 
what is best. Why do we not give them an opportunity to express 
what they know?
<P>
	I doubt very seriously whether the bureaucrats making the 
decisions have half the real experience or knowledge facing 
most western producers, particularly those in the riding of Wild 
Rose.
<P>
	I support Bill C-92. It is a little step in the right direction to 
which we are getting accustomed. With all their bills we are 
getting a little tinker here and a little tinker there. The Liberals 
think they will be the next government, which I doubt seriously. 
However we will support the bill.
<P>
	I ask the government and the agriculture minister to go 
beyond Tinker Bell stuff. There are serious problems out there. 
For a change the government should try listening to the people 
instead of dictating to them what will take place.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Saskatoon-Dundurn, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the hon. member has been talking about matters such as 
the federal government abandoning farmers. In his second 
breath he talked about the federal involvement being too great in 
the farm community, that we should get out of wheat boards and 
let farmers decide everything on their own in those matters 
instead of the representatives of farmers who have been sent to 
the House.
<P>
	The Reform talks about abandonment and how the Liberals 
and Conservatives have not done their jobs and that is why the 
Reform are here now.
<P>
	I have a question for the hon. member. Last year we had a rail 
strike and farmers were suffering greatly because they could not 
get their products to market. The whole Canadian economy was 
losing $200 million per day.
<P>
	Could the hon. member indicate to us why only six 
representatives of his party showed up in the House to vote?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Madam Speaker, we had a private member's 
bill that would have prevented all that. It was soundly defeated 
by our Liberal friends across the way. My hon. colleague from 
Lethbridge brought forward a bill that would have taken care of 
the problem, and Liberals know that very well.
<P>
	In terms of the strike they have a short memory. I do not think 
he was here to see that the first person to rise in the House 
seeking an emergency debate regarding the strike was the 
member standing right now. I stood in the Chamber and 
demanded an emergency debate on the strike and the Liberals 
did not want it. To them it was a big joke that a Reformer rose to 
his feet and dared to ask for an emergency debate on the strike in 
Vancouver.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	The next morning our wonderful new labour minister came up 
with the good idea to have an emergency debate on the strike in 
Vancouver. Wham, overnight a miracle happened. The Liberals 
discovered they had an answer for a problem. They had a chance 
to do it 48 hours before that but they do not want to listen to 
anybody but themselves. One day they will pay for that.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I remind hon. members 
that we do not refer to the absence or the presence of any 
member of the Chamber.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
find it interesting that a Liberal member would have the nerve to 
suggest Reformers never did their part in ending the strike. Our 
legislation would have prevented it from ever happening and 
should have been passed. It was legislation that would allow the 
collective bargaining process to go ahead. It is good legislation 
that has to be put in place somewhere along the way.
<P>
	Does the member believe farmers in his constituency would 
support an elected board of directors replacing the present 
commissioners appointed by the minister to the wheat board?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the member for the 
question. Recently I included a questionnaire in a householder 
that asked farmers to respond to what they wanted to do with the 
wheat board. Fifty-four per cent came back saying that the 
wheat board should be scrapped. Another high percentage said 
to change it drastically to a democratic process. A few others 
wanted to keep the status quo.
<P>
	We need to take a look at the whole situation. If only we did 
not have a government that says it can do it behind closed doors, 
that it does not need good, open, solid debate about what should 
be done with some of these bodies, and that it knows best. We 
remember good old Trudeauism when the metric system was 
brought in. The government gave us the metric system and said 
we did not know what was good for us. There were a few more 
items like it. The Conservatives said gave us the GST and said 
we did not know what was good for us.
<P>
	Canadians know what is best for them and will start 
expressing it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Moose Jaw-Lake Centre, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, obviously a discussion has arisen in debate in 
the House about some problems we have seen with regard to 
labour tie-ups, strikes and backups that have occurred in Canada 
over the past many years.
<P>
	I can speak quite simply and quite plainly as a farmer. I have 
been involved in the farm business for some 15 to 18 years in 
Saskatchewan. I know firsthand the problems when there is a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13467"> 13467 </A></B>
<P>
labour disruption. The innocent third party always gets hurt. In 
this case it is the farmers, the shippers or the dehy plant people.
<P>
	My colleague from Wild Rose hit the nail on the head when he 
said that we had a plan to prevent labour disruptions. The 
government across the way saw fit in its wisdom, if I may call it 
that, not to support the legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> You use the term loosely.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kerpan:</B> I use the term loosely. That is absolutely right.
<P>
	My colleague from Saskatoon-Dundurn has indicated on 
numerous occasions that Reformers were not in the House on 
that particular Sunday to vote. Whether or not that is the truth is 
irrelevant. Less than a week before that, we had put before this 
House private members' legislation that would have prevented 
this. There would have been no need for anyone to be here on 
that Sunday. It is ludicrous. It is a ridiculous argument and I am 
ashamed that someone would bring that up before this House.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	I want to get to the business before the House today, Bill 
C-92, an act to amend the Canadian Wheat Board Act. It aims to 
change the pooling system of the Canadian Wheat Board in 
order to respond to new market conditions.
<P>
	Rapidly changing market conditions is the greatest factor 
affecting the agricultural sector today. There is no question 
about that. The reality is we live in a modern knowledge based, 
technologically equipped and economically linked world. This 
presents many new opportunities for farmers and 
agri-businesses. It presents opportunities for policy makers and 
legislators. It presents opportunities for grain companies, farm 
groups and transportation companies as well. Coupled with the 
rapidly changing new world of markets, there are two other 
factors.
<P>
	The agriculture industry is unique in that we produce a basic 
and unchanging product for which there will always be a 
demand, that is food. With a growing world population that is 
expected to reach 10 billion people by the year 2050, the demand 
for our products will expand tremendously. This commodity of 
food that we produce is essential to the life and health of all of 
us. Our daily bread is the most basic need we have. We have a 
product for which there will always be a market.
<P>
	The agriculture industry therefore is a primary resource 
industry in full transition attempting to keep up with an 
expanding market and hoping to take full advantage of the 
opportunities that it presents. We have a good product and we 
have a market. We must adjust to and take full advantage of 
these new opportunities. We must be prepared to do this quickly. 
We must learn to anticipate what the future holds for us and seek 
to prepare ourselves for it.
<P>
	All of the stakeholders, the farmers, the processors, the 
transporters, the marketers, the policy makers, must work in a 
co-operative way to ensure that we make the transition from the 
old realities to the new realities in as an effective and efficient 
way as is humanly possible.
<P>
	I am pleased this bill is before us today. It is essentially tabled 
as a response to an expanding and changing market. We will no 
doubt get into the details of this bill but basically the bill is in 
response to the fact that our grain products are moving to new 
markets. When this happens, we need to change our system and 
our policies in order to respond to those new markets.
<P>
	More specifically, this bill responds to the fact that in recent 
times our grain has become more in demand in the Pacific rim 
countries; more is therefore having to be transported across the 
Pacific instead of the Atlantic. This change in international 
market patterns has a direct effect upon our internal shipping 
ports and our internal transportation system.
<P>
	Historically western Canadian grain producers have shared 
some of the costs of shipping grain to our ports. We call this a 
pooling system. It was established as a simple attempt to 
distribute the benefits and the costs of our grain industry as 
equally as possible among all the producers. I want to comment 
on this principle of benefit and cost sharing in a moment but 
first, let me speak briefly about the changes in our current 
pooling system that the new world of markets is causing.
<P>
	The ports western grain farmers have traditionally used for 
overseas shipments are Vancouver and Thunder Bay. This is 
because the world market value of grain in store at these two 
locations, one going east and the other going west, was 
effectively the very same. The market demand on the other side 
of both oceans was about equal, but with larger markets 
emerging on the other side of the Pacific Ocean, the world 
market value of grain in Vancouver has increased beyond that 
which is in Thunder Bay.
<P>
	To adjust to this new market reality and to keep our grain 
pooling system intact and fair, it is necessary to move the 
eastern point of departure from Thunder Bay to ports further 
east, those along the lower St. Lawrence River. In practical 
terms, this means that the farmers in Manitoba and eastern 
Saskatchewan who ship their grain east to an export position at 
Thunder Bay will now have to absorb the cost of getting their 
grain to the further eastern ports along the lower St. Lawrence.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	For years now farmers in the western prairies have seen the 
use of Thunder Bay as the Canadian Wheat Board's eastern point 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13468"> 13468 </A></B>
<P>
of departure for export sales as adding unfairly to their share of 
the cost of pooling. Farmers in the eastern part of the prairies 
have recognized this. In other words, it has been apparent that 
there was some anomaly and some unfairness in the pooling 
system.
<P>
	Eastern prairie farmers under Bill C-92 will now have to pay 
the higher costs of the movement of their grain to the further 
eastern ports. They have asked for transition assistance to offset 
these higher costs. The government announced that partial 
compensation will be provided to these farmers from the $300 
million WGTA adjustment fund. It is meant to facilitate the 
transition to a deregulated system after August 1, 1995.
<P>
	There are many specifics to be worked out regarding the 
changes in the pooling points proposed by the bill. My 
colleagues and I will be commenting on the specifics of those 
throughout committee debate, report stage and third reading 
debate.
<P>
	How do we as farmers best respond to the changing 
marketplace? This has to be the basic question. Our markets are 
changing. Our systems that we set up to deal with old markets 
must be examined to see if they are adequate to take full 
advantage of the new markets. Are they helping or are they 
hindering farmers?
<P>
	My colleagues and I maintain that when there are such 
dramatic and far reaching changes at the middle and end points 
of the industry process, we must go right back to the beginning 
of the process and examine the principles upon which we are 
building. This is the area of discussion that presents the most 
difficulty for large and old organizations such as government 
and government agencies. The Canadian Wheat Board definitely 
falls into that category.
<P>
	Old governments, old parties, old agencies and institutions 
have difficulty with change. Large and old enterprises can 
become very inflexible. They take a long time to change, if they 
can ever change at all. Sometimes it is easier for an old 
institution to die rather than to change and to be reformed.
<P>
	In the process of governing a country or managing a grain 
marketing process, that is why new parties and new institutions 
arise. If the older parties and institutions cannot change or are 
unwilling to change, if they are unwilling to re-examine 
themselves to see if they are doing things the best way, then they 
will be replaced by new enterprises and new ways of doing 
things. This has happened throughout the history of government 
in this country and in other institutions, as surely as day follows 
night and a new century follows an old one.
<P>
	Reformers are saying that in order to meet the market 
challenges of a new world and a 21st century, we must talk about 
the underlying principles. There are two principles we believe 
should be the foundation for any changes that we make in our 
marketing and transportation systems.
<P>
	Reformers believe that producer organizations, including 
marketing boards, commissions and co-operatives, should 
receive their direction from producers who should structure 
their organizations in any manner which they believe will best 
serve their interests. In consultation with producers, Reformers 
will seek to provide for a viable, self-reliant and market driven 
industry to create an environment in which producers make their 
own decisions as to how products are marketed.
<P>
	Specifically this principle means there needs to be some 
changes to the Canadian Wheat Board. If we are to take full 
advantage of the new markets, if we are to adjust quickly to 
them, then we need to, we have to, it is imperative to allow for 
the democratization of the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	The present government appointment of Canadian Wheat 
Board commissioners must be changed to an elected board of 
directors chosen by producers in a fair and open election 
process. It is simply the only way we will move from these old 
dying institutions I talked about a few minutes ago to a new 
reformed system that is responsive to farmers, to transportation, 
to the markets and to the new way of doing things. At that point 
in time, grain producers will be asked to examine their 
organizational and jurisdictional options, including but not 
limited to introducing domestic market competition, permitting 
the Canadian Wheat Board to trade in grains and oilseeds 
currently excluded from its jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	I can think of examples in my own riding. There is a small 
private flour mill. I was in to see the gentleman at Viscount 
about three months ago and asked him how his business was. He 
said it was terrible. He said he had to pay a buy back fee to the 
Canadian Wheat Board to buy wheat so he can make flour and 
sell it locally. He is not allowed to go to a neighbour or a friend 
to contract wheat on an individual basis. It is simply not 
allowed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Penson:</B> It is the same with organic grain.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kerpan:</B> It is the very same with organic grain.
<P>
	I think about these examples and wonder where the common 
sense is in this organization. I see none. Those are the things that 
have to change if we are going to move into the next century.
<P>
	Farmers must be allowed to decide on the purchase of wheat 
and other grains on either a cash basis or a pooled initial final 
price basis, implementing special opting out provisions for 
entrepreneurs interested in developing niche export markets. 
Again, I relate to what I said before about the small town flour 
mills and also extending fixed price and guaranteed delivery 
producer contracts.
<P>
	The second principle on which we must build our new 
marketing system is transportation reform. Canadian 
agricultural products should move to market by any expeditious 
mode, on any route and in any form or state of processing based 
exclusive-
<P>

<B><A NAME="13469"> 13469 </A></B>
<P>
ly on the principle of cost  effectiveness and with the best 
interests of the customer in mind.
<P>
	As I mentioned at the outset of my remarks, there has been 
some debate in this Chamber today about labour problems, 
labour tie-ups and transportation problems of all types for 
agricultural products certainly from my province of 
Saskatchewan. I think back to alternate methods of 
transportation and routes. If there are the types of labour 
disputes and tie-ups we have seen over the past number of years 
and if it is feasible in a cost effective way, what is wrong with 
hauling our products somewhere else, perhaps through the 
United States?
<P>
	We believe major reforms are still needed in the Canadian 
Wheat Board system of marketing our very most valuable 
product, food. Bill C-92 does not go anywhere near far enough. 
Comparative advantage must be the primary principle behind 
decisions about what farmers produce, how they market and how 
they transport.
<P>
	I assure members we on this side of the House will keep 
working toward this end.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It being 2 p.m., we will now proceed to 
Statements by Members.

	<B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the theme for 
Environment Week this year is the automobile's impact on air 
quality. Car emissions are a major cause of smog and climate 
change. Smog and air pollution not only threaten a healthy 
environment but also the health of all Canadians.
<P>
	Maintaining vehicles in good working order will reduce the 
impact of emissions. Therefore, Environment Canada is holding 
emission clinics across the country. The national capital region 
clinic is on June 7, 8 and 9 at Carlingwood mall.

<P>
	This week gives Canadians an opportunity to find better ways

public transportation.

consensus on future policy directions. Indeed, representatives 
showed an exemplary sense of responsibility.
<P>
	They agreed on the way funds to be contributed by the Quebec 
government and other stakeholders would be distributed under 
Quebec's private forest development plan.
<P>
	The parties also agreed that the federal government must 
compensate the Quebec workers who are hard hit by its 
withdrawal from the sector. Here again, through their dynamism

	Herculean efforts by the organizers failed to produce any

Transport Canada is now in the process of watering down the

<P>
regulations governing the number of flight attendants required 
on commercial flights. The plan is to go from the current 
Canadian ratio of one for  every 40 passengers to the American 
ratio of one for every 50.
<P>
	Even before bringing forward new regulations in the House, 
the government has acted unilaterally by using ministerial 
exemptions to reduce the number of attendants required on 
certain aircraft.
<P>
	I ask the Minister of Transport to listen to the advice of 
Canadian flight attendants, who have been telling him that the 
weakening of regulations will have a serious impact on the 
safety of the travelling public. The American standards are 
based on tests that are highly artificial and underestimate the 
need to have safety personnel on board in real life accidents.
<P>
	The only benefits of harmonizing our standards downward to 
the American standards will appear on the bottom line of the 
airline industry, whose costs will be cut at the expense of safety.

advice penetrate his remarkable fetish for American stylederegulation and reconsider the direction of this policy.

of marine transportation in my riding.
<P>
	The Strait of Canso is one of the largest deep water ports in 
eastern North America. It is ice free and allows year round 
access to Canadian and international markets. It is an important 
gateway for the shipping of many products. This natural asset 
has already proven its economic importance. Several successful 
businesses operate on its shores, serving the petroleum, forestry, 
gypsum, and energy sectors, to name only a few.
<P>

<P>
	There is no direct link between the ocean and the people in a

necessary for our survival, for they produce more oxygen than 
rain forests and are the planet's biggest water supply. They 
provide us with an incredible quantity of protein and remedies

Bill C-41, flaunting the wishes of thousands and thousands of 
grassroots Canadians.
<P>
	Yesterday I and some of my colleagues tried in vain to present 
to the justice minister over 10,000 letters in opposition to the 
sentencing bill collected from our own offices in recent weeks. 
These letters are from mainstream and small town Canadians 
from across Canada. Their concern centres on the contents of 
section 718.2. Over 600 petitions have been tabled in the House, 
represented by over 70,000 signatures. In addition, reports from 
within the justice department indicate that the justice minister 
himself has received over 70,000 letters in opposition to this 
bill.
<P>
	The minister is fond of trotting out polls and statistics, but in

	Yes, Canada's Prime Minister has a nice little theme park 
going up in his riding, with $3.5 million coming right from 
FORD-Q. The only problem is, experts say this little pork barrel 
gem will cost taxpayers millions annually. I could almost swear 
the members across the way are a bunch of Tory hacks in Liberal 
clothing.
<P>
	To top it all off, Liberal and Bloc members join hands and 
invoke closure to ensure their gold plated pension plans. Shame, 
shame.

	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in the House today to mark safe boating week in 
Canada, which runs June 4 to 10.
<P>
	The week marks the kick off to a summer long public 
awareness campaign designed to encourage responsible boating. 
Boating safety is an issue of particular concern to the 
constituents of my riding, especially now with the summer 
tourist season upon us. There have been far too many boating 
accidents and fatalities in our waterways in the past. These 
tragedies affect us all and we must do all we can to prevent them.
<P>
<B>(1415 ) </B>
<P>
	Last year the Minister of Justice assured my constituents that 
boating regulations would be enforced on our waterways this 
summer. Last week in the House the minister re-emphasized his 
commitment to the implementation of a system to improve the 
safety of boaters on our waters in Ontario.
<P>

this summer and to make safe boating practices standard with 
their families.

want to address a concern being expressed by many Canadians 
regarding the Prime Minister's national priorities.
<P>
	Until he invoked closure three times today the Prime Minister 
thought he enjoyed considerable popularity. Soon that will only 
be among canoe makers. After all, there has never been a Prime 
Minister in Canadian history who ever reached deep enough into 
the pork barrel to fund a canoe museum. This action occurs at 
the same time the Prime Minister cuts spending grants to the 
museum assistance program, the main support for the country's 
public museums and galleries.
<P>
	We have a Prime Minister who yanks money from museums 
and galleries across the country and dumps that money into 
Shawinigan to build a canoe factory virtually guaranteed to 
draw nothing but dust and flies and perhaps the odd Liberal 
seeking employment as a canoe museum curator.
<P>
	We wonder after today's election if it is the Prime Minister's 
intention to fund a museum for extinct Liberals in Ontario.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="MINISTEROFCANADIANHERITAGE">MINISTER OF CANADIAN HERITAGE</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday, the Prime Minister continued to defend his Minister 
of Canadian Heritage and insisted the opposition provide new 
facts on the minister's $2,000 supper. The official opposition 
has learned that Richard Gervais is not only the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage's political organizer and fundraiser and the 
recipient of untendered contracts from him, but Mr. Gervais also 
lobbies for various associations and businesses.
<P>
	It seems to me that my preamble speaks for itself. I therefore 
ask my question. Would the Minister of Canadian Heritage tell 
us whether he informed the Prime Minister that Mr. Gervais was 
not only his fundraiser and friend and the recipient of his 
contracts, but that he also lobbied the minister on behalf of a 
number of associations including the Canadian Tennis 
Association and Planetary Sports Television?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, as I have already had occasion to say in this 
House, if there is one well-known firm in Quebec, it is 
Gervais-Gagnon, which has worked for many governments. Its 
activities are very well known. It does not keep its clientele a 
secret. There is therefore absolutely nothing mysterious or 
secretive in this situation. Everybody knows the facts.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
understand the minister's familiarity with Gervais-Gagnon, 
because this is the firm that does his fundraising, does him 
favours and lobbies him.
<P>
	Would the Minister of Canadian Heritage tell us whether he 
took the precaution-the question is a simple one-of informing 
the Prime Minister that this gentleman was not only his friend 
and his fundraiser, but that he was also a lobbyist representing 
associations such as the Canadian Tennis Association, which 
last year received $500,000 in funding from the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, when a fundraising event is organized in 
compliance with the rules, the first to be involved are the party 
financial officials.
<P>
	I have said in this House that we followed the rules and 
procedures. I certainly have done nothing that the party was not 
aware of.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in light 
of the fact that one of the functions of Mr. Gervais's firm is to 
organize meetings between the minister or senior officials of his 
department and the people it lobbies for, does the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage realize the situation he puts his senior 
officials in when they are questioned by a lobbyist who is a 
friend of the minister, his fundraiser and the recipient of 
untendered contracts from him? Does he realize that he thus 
makes it impossible for his officials to say no to anything?
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, never, to my knowledge, have any of the 
sports or cultural associations wishing to speak to me or to my 
officials used the services of Gervais-Gagnon. I can therefore 
say that the allegation by the hon. member has fallen flat-as a 
pancake.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is also for the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage.
<P>
	Clearly, the Minister of Canadian Heritage has put himself in 
a totally unacceptable situation by becoming indebted to a 
lobbyist whose firm represents a number of groups dealing with 
his department.
<P>
	In light of the new developments, can the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage tell us whether he discussed his case with the 
government's ethics counsellor?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, let us not forget that the Prime Minister 
himself rose in this House to say that he had raised the issue with 
his ethics counsellor. That is all I know. But, if there are other 
statements to be made, they will be made by those responsible.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> I 
have a supplementary question, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	Given the incredible situation in which the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage has unfortunately put himself and the 
delicate situation in which his carelessness has put his officials, 
does the Minister of Canadian Heritage not think that the best 
way to rehabilitate his department is, unfortunately for him, to 
resign immediately?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when one obeys the rules, does what 
everyone in this House does, that is, attend fundraisers, and 
observes the rules established by Elections Canada, one does not 
harm one's department.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first of all I thank the leaders of the Liberal-Bloc 
coalition for excluding question period from their deal to 
muzzle Parliament today. This is truly appreciated by members 
on this side of the House.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13474"> 13474 </A></B>
<P>
	Yesterday the Prime Minister told the House that all the facts 
are known about the names and money contributed by guests at 
the heritage minister's last supper. Now we learn the amount of 
money raised will not be made public by Elections Canada until 
July. We learned the official tally could well exceed the $12,000 
disclosed thus far and we learned that the identity of many of the 
guests and the exact number in attendance at the dinner remain a 
mystery.
<P>
	How does the Deputy Prime Minister explain the 
contradiction between these facts and what the House was told 
yesterday?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member would be 
very happy to provide the complete list of the people who 
participated in the dinner. Last year the Reform Party, which 
took a public position before the royal commission on electoral 
financing that it did not support public donations and tax credits 
for political parties, saw no problem in accepting donations of 
$10,000 from Rogers Communication, $15,000 from John 
Labatt, $6,000 from Pulp and Timber LTD., $10,000 from 
Imperial Oil, and $4,000 from PanCanadian Petroleum.
<P>
<B>(1425 ) </B>
<P>
	I could go on but obviously the Reform Party sees absolutely 
no problem in fundraising when for itself. Obviously it should 
not see a problem for any political party that has an open and 
transparent process of fundraising, which is what we have done 
in this case.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, not only are there contradictions between what the 
Prime Minister told the House and the facts, but the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage cannot keep his story straight on this subject 
either.
<P>
	The minister said most of the department contracts were doled 
out before his dinner for dollars. The fact is only two came 
before the dinner; the rest were awarded after the contractors 
coughed up $2,000 each. The minister also said his private 
dinner was a fundraiser for the Liberal Party of Canada when in 
fact the money went to pay off his campaign debts.
<P>
	How does the heritage minister explain the contradiction 
between these facts and the things he has told the House?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can appreciate the interest of our 
colleagues in knowing what is happening when I give a 
fundraising event or when I participate. Next time I will invite 
them so they will be there if they want to have more knowledge 
of it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister neglected to say what contract I might get 
if I attended the dinner.
<P>
	We have here a real double standard. The chair of the justice 
committee sticks to his principles and his reward is to be 
removed from his position. Three Liberal MPs stick to the 
principle of representing their constituents' interests and their 
reward is to be removed from their positions.
<P>
	The heritage minister on the other hand repeatedly violates 
the principles of ethical behaviour and he not only keeps his seat 
at the cabinet table, he is staunchly supported and defended by 
the Prime Minister. It appears the only principle the Prime 
Minister is prepared to defend in the House is loyalty to party.
<P>
	Will the Deputy Prime Minister abandon this double standard, 
place ethics before loyalty and urge the Prime Minister to 
demand the resignation of the heritage minister?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member raised the 
issue of double standards. I ask the member how he can stand 
there attacking the government for having-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am sure all hon. members want to hear the 
answer.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> Mr. Speaker, the Reform Party accepted $75,000 
in donations from Sabre Energy Limited, $25,000 from Burns 
Fry Limited, $25,000 from Canadian Pacific Limited, and 
$15,000 from Company 135482.
<P>
	When the Reform Party asked the Parliament of Canada to 
revise the standing orders to remove the justice critic of the 
Reform Party, I did not hear a lot of talk about double standard 
then.

social programs, education reform, occupational training,

<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister

invite them. In fact, provincial environment ministers were 
invited to participate in a meeting last month in the Yukon.

	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources

of the provincial governments of the Atlantic region to talk 
about a wide variety of issues relating to unemployment 
insurance and modernization.

	We talked about how we could combine efforts to deal with 
youth employment issues and how we could begin to work 
together to provide some joint initiatives to deal with problems 
of poverty.

	Some 48 hours ago we were meeting with provincial ministers 
as we have been doing over the past year. I tried to tell the hon.

	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the previous response of the Deputy Prime Minister illustrates 
exactly what the government's problem is. It is the inability to 
discern between legitimate political fundraising and influence 
peddling or at least the appearance of it.
<P>
	Every contributor to this event who has been made known to 
us has received a contribution from the minister, these being 
taxpayers' dollars through grants and contracts. That is a fact.
<P>
	The minister and the Prime Minister have stated that all 
information is public, yet the minister's office refuses to make 
public the names of those who attended.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Canadian Heritage table in the House 
today a list of who was invited to the dinner, who actually 
attended the dinner, who contributed to the dinner and all the 
contracts they received from the minister and the department? 
Yes or no?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the allegations and the questions our 
colleague has been putting for several days raises an important 
issue.
<P>
	The Canadian political system calls for each party and each 
parliamentarian to take part in fundraising. That is how our 
democracy works. It is done to avoid an undue burden to the 
taxpayers.
<P>
	I would like to know whether the Reform Party is suggesting 
that there should be no fundraisers and whether the whole bill 
should be borne by the taxpayers.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, let 
us be clear about what the issue is. It is not about contributions 
made to political parties. It is about the misuse of a cabinet 
minister's position to reward those who contribute to his 
election debts and to the Liberal Party.
<P>
	It has been reported that this is not the only dinner that Mr. 
Gervais has organized involving client interest of the 
department.
<P>
	Will the minister confirm that other dinners were organized 
for similar purposes, one prior to September 18, 1994 and one 
recently this year?

a procedure for the election process.

that procedure during Saturday's election?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister

that all Canadians, including those who live in Kanesatake, must 
comply with the laws that govern them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, the 
Indian Act includes a process which specifically applies to 
elections held by aboriginal people. These rules are not 
necessarily the same as the ones which apply to all Canadians.
<P>
	Considering that she is responsible for aboriginal rights, how 
can the Deputy Prime Minister claim to protect those rights

	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
failure of the government lawyer in a high profile drug case in 
Nanaimo, B. C. is a classic example of the government putting 
the appointment of friends before competence.
<P>
	Yesterday the parliamentary secretary unbelievably said that 
we should allow a representative of the attorney general to

case experience under that particular section of the Criminal

<P>
	Will the justice minister stop supporting these patronage 
appointments or is he to continue his policy of amateur hour?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first, I ask the hon. 
member to bear in mind that he is dealing with the professional 
reputation of a lawyer who took a case into court in good faith on 
behalf of the Government of Canada. We ought to be careful, in 
my respectful submission, how we deal with that professional 
reputation.
<P>
	The case to which the hon. member refers is one that may be 
appealed and I will not speak to that case. In this instance, as in 
every other, we send lawyers into courtrooms because we are 
satisfied with their competence to do the job.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
justice minister's comment certainly is reflective of his 
comment also on June 5 at which time he said that these agents 
were appointed because they are competent to do the work they 
are asked to do.
<P>
	The failure of the appointed agent in Nanaimo and the 
comments by law enforcement officials clearly indicate that 
simply is not the case.
<P>
	This patronage issue relates specifically to public safety. Will 
the minister undertake a complete review of all appointments of 
justice legal agents?

already have. I have already agreed to provide my hon. friend 
with a list of the agents we appointed as a result of that review 
which took place since we came to office.
<P>
	That review also resulted in the imposition of new terms and 
conditions for all agents: the imposition of a conflict code for 
the very first time, express terms saying that if they do not 
practise to the high standards we expect they can be relieved of 
their responsibility, new training and supervision requirements, 
and a reduction in the overall number of agents throughout 
Canada so we can get better value for the dollar for taxpayers.

Tuesday, the Minister of Labour claimed that her actions in the 
labour conflict at Ogilvie were consistent with all of the 
workers' demands. But, at the same time, the workers were 
demonstrating in Montreal to have the government pass a law 
against strikebreakers. Remember, this conflict has dragged on 
for one year and that calling in strikebreakers interferes with 
negotiations.
<P>
	How can the minister continue to claim that what is happening 
with the negotiations is normal, as she claimed Tuesday, while 
the unionized workers at the Ogilvie mill blame the length of the 
conflict on the absence of a law against strikebreakers in 
Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr.

like: ``Why did the chicken cross highway 104?'' The answer is: 
``To avoid the toll booth''.
<P>
	Now I find the Liberal member for Cumberland-Colchester 
is publicly proposing that a toll booth be put on the New 
Brunswick border of highway 104, a move that will surely start a 
toll booth war on the Trans-Canada highway between two 
provinces. This is very strange behaviour from a government, in 
fact a Prime Minister, who said this week it was a provincial 
jurisdictional matter.
<P>
	Will the Deputy Prime Minister make an attempt to restore 
faith in the ethics of the Liberal cabinet by asking the Minister 
of Public Works and Government Services to at least step down 
until we hear from the auditor general about the minister's 
inappropriate activities regarding highway 104?
<P>
<B>(1445 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Fontana (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member should 
know, tolls and highways are in the provincial jurisdiction. 
While the member has been going across Atlantic Canada 
suggesting the Reform Party is against tolls, perhaps he should 
check with his boss, who in New York City on May 25 indicated 
he is in favour of tolls and user fees for public infrastructure.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
at least we have somebody answering for that fellow over there.
<P>
	What we have across the room today is a government that has 
a lack of ethics, a lack of honesty and a lack of accountability, 
but there is no shortage of arrogance across there at all.
<P>
	I have an anniversary present for the minister of public works. 
I will share a significant quote from our current illustrious 
minister of public works from <I>Hansard</I> exactly six years ago 
today, which proves just how adaptable these Liberals are. The 
quote reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I am opposed to pork barreling schemes which only benefit friends of Tories. 
That is what I am against.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said that when he was in opposition.
<P>
	I ask the Deputy Prime Minister if the minister of public 
works opposes pork barreling in principle, or just for Tories.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Fontana (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, let me also give the hon. 
member a quote: ``Instead of tax based financing, he suggested 
privatizing current public infrastructure tolls, public and private 
joint ventures''. That was said by Preston Manning on May 26, 
1995.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I will permit the parliamentary secretary to 
finish his answer, but we refer to each other by our 
constituencies rather than our names.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Fontana:</B> Mr. Speaker, I apologize for using the name of 
the leader of the Reform Party, but it was the leader of the 
Reform Party who said that. It was on the CP news wire that he 
was in favour of tolls.
<P>
	Highways are in the provincial jurisdiction and tolls are in the 
provincial jurisdiction. The Government of Nova Scotia decided 
that was where it wanted to spend the money to ensure safety and 
good transportation in Nova Scotia. That is where the decision 
lies, in Nova Scotia, not in the House.

	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is directed to the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration.
<P>
	Immigration officers at the Canadian embassy in Paris have 
once again refused to issue a visitor's visa to Algerians, in this 
case two grandmothers, Mrs. Ouartzi and Mrs. Sebbar. The 
House will recall the case of Mrs. Koudil, a filmmaker, and three 
Algerian actors who were denied visas at the embassy in Paris, 
although they had tickets for their return flight.
<P>
	Would the minister agree that his officials at the embassy in 
Paris behaved deplorably, considering the way they handled 
legitimate requests for visas from people of Algerian origin, and 
why is nothing being done to correct procedures that obviously 
led to this unfair treatment?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am unaware of the two cases 
involving the two grandmothers' applications for visitor visas. I 
hope the hon. member understands that I cannot be on top of 
every one of the one million applications that are made 
worldwide to visit Canada. I will certainly look into the cases.
<P>
	However, I think the hon. member should check his language 
when he attributes motives to our visa officers. He comes from 
the province of Quebec, which essentially controls independent 
migration. The province of Quebec also has visa officers around 
the world. Is he suggesting for one moment that those officers 
are approving every single applicant, and if they do not, for 
legitimate reasons, that somehow those Quebec officers are 
doing the right thing?
<P>
	What I believe we should be doing with respect to Algeria is 
not solving some of the problems those people are facing 
through our visitor visa program. That is precisely why my 
officials have been discussing with the officials of the Quebec 
ministry of immigration with respect to independent migration 
to see if we can help some of those Algerians legitimately, rather 
than trying to utilize the visitor visa program for things it was 
not intended for.
<P>
<B>(1450) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the visa 
officers I referred to work for your department.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I may remind the hon. member that he should 
always speak to the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunez:</B> Excuse me, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	Since these two Algerian grandmothers, both over 65, have 
already been to Canada several times, when does the minister 
intend to admit his officials made a mistake and when are they 
going to issue visas to these women who want to come here to 
visit their children and their grandchildren?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I informed the member I 
would look into the two cases.
<P>
	I know that officers who are looking at the visitor visa 
program are federal. What I was trying to draw to the attention 
of the member is that I do not hear him very often criticizing 
officials of the Quebec government when they refuse 
individuals.
<P>
	I hope the member is not turning this into a political issue. He 
could also have stood in the House today and thanked the federal 
government for allowing the Garda family to go to New York 
City to make an application and not deport it to Romania, which 
allowed it to be accepted as independents, with the co-operation 
of the Government of Quebec.
<P>
	I do not need any grandstanding from this member.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
whether it is the heritage minister's cash for contracts dinner in 
Montreal, the pork for pavement highway deal in Cape Breton, 
or the revenue minister's legal cases for cronies on the west 
coast, the ethics counsellor always seems to be the last one to 
know. Mr. Wilson is becoming more a political scapegoat than 
an ethics watchdog.
<P>
	My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister. When was the 
ethics counsellor contacted about any of these violations of 
ethics, and why was he not consulted beforehand rather than 
after?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member is 
assuming that there was a violation of ethics.
<P>
	We have made it quite clear that the Liberal Party and the 
Prime Minister support public participation in the fundraising 
process. We have no problem with the fact that MacMillan 
Bloedel gave the Reform Party $10,000 last year. We would 
never suggest that a donation from MacMillan Bloedel or 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13479"> 13479 </A></B>
<P>
Canadian Pacific or Imperial Oil had an influence on their 
policies.
<P>
	It is a very open and transparent process. We support it. We 
think the public across the country believes that there should be 
public participation in fundraising. We do not accept that as a 
violation of any ethical standard.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
ironic then that the Prime Minister said yesterday on page 13370 
of <I>Hansard</I>, ``I discussed this with the ethics counsellor 
yesterday morning''. Why would that be necessary then?
<P>
	It clearly states on page 95 of the Liberal red book that the 
government will appoint an independent ethics counsellor who 
will report directly to Parliament. Instead what we have is an 
ethics counsellor who rules on ethical issues after the fact and 
who reports only to the Prime Minister. It is yet another red book 
broken promise.
<P>
	Given the ethics watchdog's obvious lack of teeth, will the 
Prime Minister honour the red book commitment and make the 
ethics counsellor responsible directly to Parliament, not to 
himself?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister

<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, science and 
technology remains a very important priority for this 
government. It is the reason why very quickly after we were 
elected we did implement a number of our obligations: the 
technology partnerships program, the Canadian technology 
network.
<P>
	This is why we look forward to receiving from the secretary of 
state and the Minister of Industry the science and technology 
review, which I understand we will be receiving within a matter 
of weeks.
<P>
	There were in the budget a number of cuts. If we were to deal 
with our fiscal problem we had to deal with it frugally. 
Nonetheless, if we take a look at fisheries, agriculture, NRCan 
and industry, we will see that to the greatest extent possible we 
did preserve the research and development capacity of the 
government. There is a question-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Speech.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (LaSalle-Émard):</B> Wait a minute. If the 
Reform Party is interested in the future of the country instead of 
in gutter tactics, it may well want to ask this kind of question.
<P>
	There are some very important questions we should be asking. 
Should the government be funding those things that the private 
sector should do? Should the government in its R and D policy 
be operating fundamentally or at the margins? Should the 
private sector be counting constantly on the government? These 
are the future questions this country has to answer. Why is it that

my question is for the Minister of Natural Resources.
<P>
	Next year, the federal government will make more than $20 
million in cuts affecting private forestry in Quebec, thus 
penalizing thousands of forestry workers in the Lower St. 
Lawrence, Gaspé and North Shore regions. Participants in the 
private forestry summit held in Quebec last month demand that 
the federal government compensate producers.
<P>
	I would like the Minister of Natural Resources to tell us what 
kind of compensation this government intends to give forestry 
workers?

<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources,

provincial jurisdiction in the area of forestry, should now 
suggest that the federal government pick up the tab for forestry.
<P>
	Having said that, let me reassure the hon. member that my 
department and this government continue to wish to work 
co-operatively with my colleague, the minister of natural 
resources in the province of Quebec. I have written to the

my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	I listened with interest to her comments about ethics when she 
related to the House all these contributions the Reform Party 
received. I have some figures for the Deputy Prime Minister. 
The Liberals received substantial contributions from major oil 
companies: $14,000 from Husky Oil; $27,000 from Amoco; and 
$47,000 from Imperial Oil.
<P>
	After repeated unjustified gas price increases, the Liberal 
government refuses to act to conduct a gas price inquiry. 
Canadians want to know: Is the government's refusal to conduct 
an inquiry based on these huge contributions by the oil 
companies, or is it because it wants more from the oil 
companies?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the member is 
asking whether or not we have the courage to move on issues 
based on what is best for the country, he should ask why as 
Minister of the Environment I am moving to ban MMT, 
something that governments for 15 years have not had the guts 
to do.

people in the petrochemical industry. If the member thinks a

	<B>The Speaker:</B> Earlier today the hon. member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster rose on a point of order concerning 
the report of the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal 
Affairs on Bill C-68, an act respecting firearms and other 
weapons.
<P>
	The hon. member for Kindersley-Lloydminster contended 
that amendments made in committee to clauses 98, 99, 100, 101 
and 101.1 require a royal recommendation and that they should 
have been ruled out of order in committee.
<P>
	The argument made by the hon. member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster was based on a comment made in 
committee by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Justice that new inspectors would have to be hired and trained to 
fulfil the role instead of adding additional tasks to the duties of 
police officers.
<P>
	I have now had an opportunity to review the committee report 
and Bill C-68 as read a first time and as reprinted by the 
committee. I am now ready to rule on this matter.
<P>
	Bill C-68 received first reading on February 14, 1995 with the 
proper royal recommendation attached thereto.
<P>
	Clause 98 is the key clause as it relates to this point of order. It 
was amended by the committee and now reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In section 99 to 101.1 ``inspector'' means a firearm officer and includes in 
respect of a province a member of a class of individuals designated by the 
provincial minister.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1505) </B>
<P>
	In the opinion of the Chair, while clause 98 was amended in 
committee, the amendment brought to it does not fundamentally 
alter the financial responsibility of either the federal or the 
provincial ministers involved.
<P>
	Clause 98 as introduced in the House had the concept of 
``police officer'' for which the concept of ``inspector'' has been 
substituted by the committee. It still remains a provincial 
ministerial responsibility as to which class of individuals shall 
<P>

<B><A NAME="13481"> 13481 </A></B>
<P>
be so designated. It may well be that a provincial minister 
decides to recruit an entirely new class of individuals for the 
purpose of clause 98, but it clearly remains the decision of the 
provincial authority to do so. Whether the class of individuals 
are  called inspectors or police officers has no direct impact on 
the royal recommendation attached to the bill.
<P>
	The other amendments brought to clauses 99, 100, 101 and 
101.1 deal with the powers and duties of the inspectors. The 
Chair has come to the same conclusion in respect to those 
amendments.
<P>
	Therefore I rule that the amendments do not alter the objects, 
purposes, conditions and qualifications of the royal 
recommendation and that the report of the Standing Committee 
on Justice and Legal Affairs tabled in the House on June 7, 1995 
is in order. Bill C-68 can consequently proceed to report stage.

	He said: Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the MP pension 
bill of the government. I cannot believe how fast government 
members want to get it through. No wonder people in the 
country are calling them pot lickers and accusing them of being 
at the trough and pork barrelling. All these phrases arise from 
the fact that they will not come clean with citizens and tell them 
exactly what they are receiving in terms of the gold plated 
pension plan.
<P>
<B>(1520 ) </B>
<P>
	We have made a number of motions in amendment to try to 
improve it. Our overall objective-and it is the reason we object 
to it-is to bring the pension plan for MPs and senators into line 
with those in the private sector. We would like to see MPs in this 
Parliament and all future parliaments fully opt out. We would 
also like to see a Canadian citizenship requirement for all 
members of the plan and to see members pensions subjected to 
the same clawback conditions as the old age security.
<P>
	I will address Motions Nos. 1 to 7, the first grouping. The 
effect of Motions Nos. 1 and 6 is to change the opting out 
provisions so that members of future parliaments can make a 
one-time decision to opt in or opt out of the plan during the first 
60 days the House sits after they are elected.
<P>
	Clearly the Liberals are trying to prevent it from being an 
election issue in the next election by only allowing members of 
this Parliament to opt out of the trough light plan. However, as 
we can see from the Ontario election, it is and will be an issue in 
the next election. I predict members of Parliament who do not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13483"> 13483 </A></B>
<P>
opt out in this  session will be voted out in the next, should they 
choose to run again.
<P>
	We would have liked to participate in a fair pension plan but in 
good conscience could not and cannot participate in a plan such 
as the one offered in Bill C-85. All 52 members of the Reform 
Party, along with a few Liberals, have already indicated they 
will not accept the pension because it is too generous. How 
many members have to opt out before the government gets the 
message that its trough light plan needs some work?
<P>
	By opting out Reform Party members save $38 million to the 
taxpayers. It would not take long to figure how much the Liberal 
government could save. Over 450 members of Parliament 
belong to the plan already. If current members opted out, the 
minister of immigration alone could save taxpayers $3 million 
and the Deputy Prime Minister could save the country a lot of 
money as well.
<P>
	Motions Nos. 2 and 3 would have the effect of changing the 
bill so that a member who dies before the expiry of the 60-day 
decision period is assumed to have done the right thing and not 
opted in. The bill does exactly the opposite. It automatically 
opts these people in. How dare the government try to taint the 
reputation of a deceased member this way. It is ridiculous.
<P>
	Motions Nos. 5 and 7 would change the bill to allow all 
members to opt out completely. Under Bill C-85 MPs who as of 
October 1993 already had six years of service could only opt out 
of benefits earned from October 1993 onward, thus creating the 
trough regular and the trough light scenario.
<P>
	All members, even Liberal cabinet ministers and the Prime 
Minister, should be given the opportunity to do the right thing. 
The inability for longer serving MPs to completely opt out under 
Bill C-85 creates a two tier system among MPs. The biggest 
issue is that the bill through its generosity creates a two-tier 
system for MPs and the public.
<P>
	Mr. Brian Corbishley, a CA and former assistant to the 
Auditor General of Canada, is head of KPMG management 
consulting and author of reports on legislature compensation for 
the Alberta government. He testified before the committee as 
one of the few witnesses allowed to appear in one day so the 
Liberals could fast track the bill. He said that the proposed 
pension under Bill C-85 was seven times more generous than 
the typical public sector plan and was four times more generous 
than the typical private sector plan.
<P>
	Paraphrasing Mr. Corbishley again, to compare pension plans 
we combine all the elements into a single measure: the value of 
the pension earned in one year of service from the employer's 
contributions; in other words the amount that would have to be 
set aside to invest each year to pay for the pension. The value of 
the pension earned from the employer's contribution in one year 
of service for this member is about $43,000 under the current 
plan. Under the proposed plan it falls to about  $34,000. In the 
private sector for a person of the same age and same income it 
would only be $9,000.
<P>
	The maximum pension for MPs under this plan is 75 per cent 
of earnings in the best years. For others it is 70 per cent but it 
takes 35 years to earn it compared to this plan which allows MPs 
to earn their full pension, 5 per cent higher than the private 
sector, in only 19 years.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	Another witness, actuary and former MP Paul McCrossan, 
said that the bill entrenched the benefits at a level higher than 
those available to general taxpayers. I believe the compensation 
for MPs should be brought into line with modern private sector 
practice.
<P>
	Motion No. 4 imposes a Canadian citizenship requirement on 
all members of the plan so that if a province separated, MPs 
from the province would not draw a pension from the Canadian 
government. I have heard comments from members of the 
separatist party in the House that they do not care what is going 
on in the House because they will not be here next fall anyway. I 
think they are wrong. They will still be here and Quebec will 
still be part of Canada.
<P>
	If any Bloc members opt into the plan it will be a clear sign 
that they realize they will still be in the House and in the country 
long past the fall.
<P>
	I ask all members of Parliament whether it makes more sense 
to give us a readily definable salary rather than keep a 
convoluted pay scheme and a pension plan that is no better than 
those in the private sector, a transparent and taxable 
remuneration package. Under the current format Canadians do 
not even know or have a precise picture of an MP's total 
compensation package. The scale has tipped so far toward big 
pensions at the end of the rainbow that for many politicians 
re-election becomes a top priority because to qualify they have 
to get elected for a second term.
<P>
	Are members running a second term to qualify for a million 
dollar pension, or are they running a second term to serve the 
country for the salary they will be receiving? It generates more 
survival mode thinking and less commitment to tackle the tough 
issues facing Canada and Canadians. Canadians should be able 
to have a say through an arm's length agency what politicians 
should be paid.
<P>
	Let us make compensation upfront. Let us make pension plans 
upfront, straightforward and out in the open. How difficult is 
that? Why is it that MPs are setting their own standards? Why is 
it that MPs set their own pensions? Why can they not hire an 
arm's length independent body to set a pension plan equal to and 
no better than the private sector? I will tell the House why. It is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13484"> 13484 </A></B>
<P>
self-serving. They feel they deserve it and cannot justify it 
outside the House, and the paying public is now aware of it.
<P>
	As the witness from KPMG management consulting told the 
committee reviewing the legislation, if the objective is to 
achieve fair and equitable compensation for MPs, the pension 
component should be considered in conjunction with other 
components.
<P>
	After eliminating the gold plated pension plan, which the bill 
clearly does not do, the House could agree to a proper balanced 
package that would be more palatable and compatible with 
Canadian taxpayers. The proposed Liberal pension plan should 
be no better than that in the private sector but it is. Politicians 
must realize that they are no better than those who voted for 
them. For some reason they think they are.
<P>
	When I was a businessman two years ago in the private sector 
I had benefits given to me by my company. They were taxable 
benefits. What I received in terms of pension was nowhere near 
what it is here. The double standard in the House is pathetic and I 
am here to say that it is pathetic. I am now a politician. I am paid 
as one and I am paid to be one. We have a double standard. We 
have tax free benefits the public does not even know about. It 
should not be that way but the government will not do anything 
about it and I think the Canadian public wants something done.
<P>
	Politicians should never forget who pays their salaries. 
Unfortunately it appears that by supporting Bill C-85 the 
Liberals, the Bloc, the Tories and the NDP have forgotten. In the 
name of justice and fairness we urge the government with our 
amendments to go further than it has with Bill C-85.
<P>
	A lot of MPs have served in the House. A lot of MPs have had 
the opportunity to fix the situation. In the House today there are 
205 rookies and I cannot believe they have allowed the veterans 
to scoop them. These veterans are finished. Some of them will 
not even run again but they will retire with the old pension plan 
that gave six to one in contributions, not this one that gives 3.5 
to one.
<P>
	If the government ran on a platform in its red book based on 
integrity and restoring integrity to politicians, it would not be 
forcing time allocation on a pension bill. The Liberals would not 
be bringing in closure on the gun control bill. The things they are 
doing to speed things through so the Canadian public is unaware 
of what is being thrust on it will come back to haunt them at 
election time two years from now. It will be the Reform Party 
that the Canadian public will have to vote for in order to correct 
the wrongs and put right what the government is failing to do.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I remind 
those in the House and Canadians who are listening that the 
government promised to ensure there was an age of eligibility, 
which has been done. Before this legislation came forward 
members could collect a pension at any age after six years of 
service. Now there is  an age of eligibility. The government also 
promised to eliminate double dipping. This has been done.
<P>
	The government honoured its promises and went further. It 
ensured the contributions of taxpayers to the MP pension plan 
would be reduced by over 33 per cent. It ensured the accrual rate, 
the rate by which credits are accumulated for pensions, would be 
reduced by 5 per cent to 4 per cent, a reduction of 20 per cent. At 
the request of the Reform Party it granted this legislation which 
will permit members to opt out of the MP pension plan. The 
government has honoured its first two promises and has gone 
beyond with three other initiatives.
<P>
	I am amazed at the boldness of my Reform colleague who has 
just spoken. He used the terms trough regular and trough light, 
which his leader so effectively used to try to denigrate what was 
happening. He ought to be referred to as the MP who introduced 
trough heavy duty. On May 4 he suggested MPs should be paid 
$150,000 a year and get regular pensions. If that were to happen 
it would cost the Canadian taxpayer a lot more. Trough heavy 
duty has been suggested by the member who had the gall to stand 
up in the House and try to pretend he would fix things. I am 
really amazed.
<P>
	The hon. member quoted testimony. I am surprised he did not 
quote testimony from C.E.S. Franks, a witness when we 
examined the bill:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If MPs pensions are looked at solely in comparison with the pensions and 
pension schemes of other professionals, then the pensions of parliamentarians 
seem excessive. And that is the comparison normally made.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When these proposals for reform of the pensions of members of Parliament 
were first made public the media was filled with reports comparing the pension 
an MP would make after fifteen or twenty years of service with what a school 
teacher or civil servant would receive after the same period.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Not surprisingly, by comparison the MPs' pensions looked very 
advantageous. What these reports and experts failed to note is that less than ten 
per cent of MPs serve in the House for fifteen years or more, and that, after most 
elections (1993 was an exception) the majority of ex-MPs have served too short 
a time, less than the required six years, to receive any parliamentary pension 
whatsoever. In fact, a great many ex-members not only do not have a pension 
but have a difficult time in finding employment and in re-establishing 
themselves after serving as a member.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	If my colleague is to be selective, I assure the House I will 
bring some balance into the debate.
<P>
	I agree the MP pension plan is generous. I will not deny that. 
However, we must look at it in the total context. If we look at the 
international scene, France, England, Germany and any number 
of others, and if we look at the major components such as 
eligibility, the amount contributed by government, the age a 
person can collect a pension, number of years of service, et 
cetera, some countries have provisions equal to or better than    
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13485"> 13485 </A></B>
<P>
the provisions we have in this plan as it stood and even more so 
today because of the changes the government has brought about.
<P>
<B>(1535 ) </B>
<P>
	If we look at provincial and territorial standards we find the 
same thing. In other words, in certain provinces one works less 
than six years. In certain provinces one can collect a pension 
before age 55. I could go on but I will not. The point is we have 
to look at it within the total context, which my colleague and his 
colleagues will obviously refuse to do.
<P>
	These motions are unacceptable to us for any number of 
reasons, some which I have mentioned, some which I find 
extremely misleading, some which do not deal with the topic 
whatsoever. I am shocked and disappointed it was done so early 
in the debate.
<P>
	There is a commitment to allow optional participation for this 
Parliament only. That was at the request of the Reform Party. 
The bill extends optional coverage to persons not vested six 
years so that small amounts of money from the previous 
Parliament would not remain in the account until a member 
retires.
<P>
	Members with more than six years on October 25, 1993 are 
able to opt out for this Parliament and return their pension as a 
gift for the crown if they do not want to receive it when they 
leave office. The deeming provision protects survivor benefits if 
necessary for members who die before opting in. The 
requirement to be a Canadian citizen ignores the fact that a 
pension is deferred compensation for which members have 
contributed.
<P>
	For all of the above reasons obviously we cannot be 
supportive.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I also 
wish to participate in this debate, and especially in the debate on 
the amendments put forward by the Reform Party in Motions 
Nos. 1 through 7. I must say that we agree with Motion No. 1, 
which provides that members of the next Parliament should be 
free to opt out of the plan.
<P>
	We disagree with Motion No. 2, according to which a member 
who has not chosen one of the two plans is deemed to have opted 
out. We feel that all workers hope to receive a pension some day 
and want to deserve it.
<P>
	Motion No. 4 is a big trap. We are a little taken aback to see 
that a democratically elected political party can dismiss the 
relevance of another existing political party and seek to punish 
the democratically elected members of a recognized political 
party for defending ideas.
<P>
	Motion No. 4 would deny pensions to members who renounce 
their Canadian citizenship. This is obviously a direct attack 
against the Bloc Quebecois. The Reform Party must have 
reasoned that if Quebec ever achieves sovereignty, Bloc 
members will no longer be Canadian citizens and will therefore 
no longer qualify for the MPs' pension plan.
<P>
	I strongly denounce this kind of amendment to a bill. The 
Reform Party must be seriously misinformed to issue such a 
statement. May I remind you that, in Canadian history, we are 
what is called a sovereignist party, a party that hopes to make 
Quebec a distinct country enjoying a very friendly relation with 
the rest of Canada as well as economic ties that are as close as 
they are today.
<P>
	Let us keep in mind that Quebec is Canada's second trading 
partner after the U.S. As for Ontario, trade between the two 
provinces exceeds $68 billion, and more than 100,000 Ontario 
jobs depend on trade with Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	We are very pleased with the services and economic 
agreements that we have with the rest of Canada. These 
arrangements reflect our concept of sovereignty, which is the 
recognition of the two founding nations, based on the existence 
of two strong governments which have economic ties.
<P>
	I want to remind the Reform Party that, when it tables an 
amendment challenging the legitimacy of the Bloc's presence in 
this House, it is completely out of line with the history of this 
country, the Charter of rights and freedoms, and the 
Constitution. Let us not forget that, when the first Canadian 
government was elected, out of the 17 members representing 
Nova Scotia, 16 or 17-I believe it was 17-were sovereignists 
who wanted their province out of Confederation.
<P>
	After four or eight years in Parliament, were these members 
subjected to punitive measures, on the grounds that they had a 
vision of Nova Scotia's future which differed from that of the 
rest of the country? Of course not. If the Western Party-I 
believe it is the correct name-, which was in favour of pulling 
the west out to annex it to the U.S. or create a new country, had 
managed to get 30 or so democratically elected members here, 
would we have tabled motions saying that these people, even 
though they were democratically elected, have no right to sit 
here and should be punished by not getting any pension once 
they leave? That would be totally absurd.
<P>
	Some communist members also sat in this House. Were they 
told that, because they were communists, they would not be 
eligible for a pension later on? Would an extreme right wing 
government, which could be a Reform government, tell NDP 
members that, since they represent the extreme left, they will be 
punished by not getting their pensions? Are we here to discuss 
ideas or make arbitrary and dictatorial judgments?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13486"> 13486 </A></B>
<P>
	In that sense, clause 4 is in total contradiction with the 
democratic process which Quebec and Canada are proud to 
share. That process provides that the people can choose its 
representatives among the various political parties and decide to 
elect Bloc members if it wishes to do so. However, will these 
Bloc members later be punished by being deprived of their 
rights because of the ideas that they defend? This is 
unacceptable. The left would not do that to the right, nor would 
the right do it to the left.
<P>
	I also want to make it clear to Reform members that the fact 
that we are sovereignists does not mean that we want to break up 
Canada. That was never our intention. Sovereignists want to 
build a new relationship with Canada based on the two founding 
peoples. This would entail a very strong, central government in 
Quebec, a very strong, central government in Ottawa, and 
economic links between the two. However, Quebecers would 
pay their taxes to Quebec only and Quebec and Canada would 
only jointly buy the services that are deemed necessary to have 
in common.
<P>
	For example, you may want to have a Senate, but we 
Quebecers may not, so you can have it and pay for it yourselves. 
If we both decide we want to maintain the St. Lawrence Seaway, 
we can do so together. If we decided to share an army, we could 
work out arrangements. The expression ``based on the two 
founding peoples'' simply means that. Currently, approximately 
50 per cent of all people in Quebec-we had 49 per cent of the 
vote-share the Bloc's vision and the other 50 per cent have a 
different vision. Some people are still undecided, but a good 40 
per cent of all people still share the vision that Quebecers can 
have everything they ever wanted within the federal system.
<P>
	Therefore, we have two options. There is nothing wrong with 
being a sovereignist, it is not a punishable offence, it is not a 
terrorist movement or a movement bent on ruining things; it is a 
movement, a political party with a philosophy and a vision for 
the future of Quebec and if its vision prevails, even better. 
However, there is still another vision in Quebec, the vision of 
federalism. It is therefore a debate on the issues based on mutual 
respect which people must choose. It must be up to the people to 
decide.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	And if the people choose sovereignty in the referendum, Bloc 
members, who worked here in Ottawa to bring sovereignty to 
pass, should under no circumstances be denied certain services 
or compensation for the years in which they democratically held 
seats and defended their vision against others. And if their 
vision prevails, they should not be penalized for having served 
Quebec, and indirectly Canada because I think that Canada 
would be in much better shape if we were two separate 
countries. They should in no way be penalized regarding their 
pension plans or other plans for having had this vision.
<P>
	It is quite regrettable that a recently elected party which calls 
itself democratic, the Reform Party, would dare to table a 
motion of the kind. It is unworthy of a democratic party. It is an 
attack on the very act of democracy and the faith in it that all 
Canadians and Quebecers have. It is an insult to our Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms. It is an insult to our Constitution.
<P>
	It is also an insult to western democracy to have to say in a 
motion that people are judged by their ideas and that their rights 
will be adjusted accordingly. No democracy can tolerate this. 
That is the kind of thing we would expect from dictatorships 
from the extreme right or extreme left and it has no place, it 
seems to me, in this noble assembly, the House of Commons, 
which has always been preoccupied with respecting democracy 
and above all respecting the hon. members who were mandated 
by their own electorate to sit in the House.
<P>
	I think that clause 4 should be voted down or even dropped 
before the vote.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is with pleasure that I engage in debate on Bill C-85 
and the motions to amend certain clauses of that bill.
<P>
	The time has come for everyone to recognize that the current 
pension plan, which is the privilege of MPs of the House, is 
obscenely generous. Even if the changes proposed in Bill C-85 
were implemented, they would still be obscenely generous.
<P>
	I want to make reference to the Prime Minister's statement 
suggesting that perhaps MPs do not think they should be paid 
that much. An MP does not take a vow of poverty. Canadian 
citizens want their MPs to earn decent incomes. They want them 
to have decent pensions. They want to reward them for the work 
that they do. However, it should not be disproportionate to the 
benefits and salaries they receive.
<P>
	Therefore, some fairness and equity has to be placed into this 
whole business. As MPs we recognize our worth. Canadians 
recognize our worth, but we do not believe that we should 
become some kind of elite component of society that receives 
benefits that are over and above those given to other members of 
society.
<P>
	The right balance must be struck between a reasonable, 
personal income and a public rip off. The current plan is a public 
rip off as is the way it is conceived to be in Bill C-85.
<P>
	This spring a number of changes were proposed. However, 
one change that I want to draw particular attention to is the 
chance to opt out of the pension plan.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I would like you and all the rest of the members 
of the House to know that I have chosen to opt out of the plan. I 
take very strong exception to the statement that the President of 
the Treasury Board made when he said: ``Reform members are 
all being forced to opt out''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Nonsense.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Nonsense in spades.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13487"> 13487 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Schmidt:</B> That is absolutely a misstatement of the truth. 
Mr. Speaker, I want you and everybody else to know it was a 
very conscious and deliberate decision on my part. If any 
forcing took place it was the minister who would not change the 
present pension plan so that we could opt into it with reasonable 
assurance that it was fair and equitable with regard to the 
taxpayers of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	If any forcing took place it was the lack of decision making on 
the part of government members. It did not introduce the kind of 
amendments that ought to have been introduced into the pension 
plan so it would be fair and so it would be generous in the same 
way that other pension plans are generous for all other citizens.
<P>
	If any forcing is taking place that is where it is taking place. 
With respect to my decision I do not feel any compulsion 
whatsoever from my party or anyone else, but simply my 
allegiance to my constituents. My constituents have told me 
loudly and clearly that I do not deserve a pension any larger than 
the one that is normal and acceptable for all Canadians, and they 
are prepared to pay for that.
<P>
	The other aspect is that the proposed changes are not 
retroactive.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Excuse me, I have to make a phone call.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Schmidt:</B> Good, make the call. I hope you do. The other 
point we need to recognize is-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I might have 
missed something. Try to keep that to a bare minimum. I would 
ask the co-operation of all colleagues to make their 
interventions through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Schmidt:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker, phone calls should be 
done that way as well.
<P>
	The present proposal introduced a two tiered pension system, 
those who were elected before 1993 and those who were elected 
in the 1993 election. Two kinds of pension plans are operating. 
That is an unfairness in itself. Why should one group of MPs be 
treated differently from those who are coming up?
<P>
	I want to illustrate exactly how obscene the benefits of this 
plan are. Here is a list of the top 10 takers under the new plan as 
proposed by Bill C-85 so everyone recognizes what we are 
talking about here. The figures are estimated on nine years as 
ministers and living to age 75. These are the people who qualify 
under those categories, assuming also a 5 per cent inflation rate 
per year.
<P>
	The hon. member for Sherbrooke will collect $4.5 million. It 
so happens that this individual is also the leader of the 
Progressive Conservative Party. The member for Humber-St. 
Barbe-Baie Verte will get $3.9 million. He happens also to be 
the minister of fisheries. The member for Cape Breton-East 
Richmond will get $3.6 million. The member for  
Burnaby-Kingsway will get $3.5 million. The member for 
Winnipeg Transcona will get $3.3 million. The member for York 
West, who happens to be the minister of immigration, will get 
$3.1 million. The member for York South-Weston will get $2.7 
million. The member for Hamilton East, the Deputy Prime 
Minister, will get $2.5 million. The member for 
Papineau-Saint Michel will get $2.6 million and the member 
for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell will get $2.1 million.
<P>
	Where is any other Canadian with a normal income and the 
usual kinds of productivity going to get that kind of pension? I 
submit to the House that the witnesses who appeared before the 
committee stated that it is not going to happen.
<P>
	The President of the Treasury Board said that this is a 
significant change and reduction, which is a lot of bafflegab and 
clever but very misleading words. It is hypocrisy under the guise 
of an election promise.
<P>
	I could not help, as I was preparing some of my notes, to think 
about a nursery rhyme that I learned. It goes something like this. 
It fits this hypocrisy beautifully. It says: ``Little Jack Horner sat 
in the corner, eating his pudding and pie, he stuck in his thumb, 
pulled out a plum and said what a good boy am I''. I could not 
help but think about the Liberals sitting in their places, looking 
and revising their pension plan. They stick in their hand and they 
pull out a gold plum and say what a good Liberal am I.
<P>
	That is not all. In the final analysis it is the victory of greed 
and self-interest over common sense and responsible 
leadership. That is the saddest part of it all. Where is the 
leadership? Where is the example for our young people? Where 
is the example of responsible expenditure of public funds?
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	We are supposed to be the guardians and to treat taxpayers' 
money as funds kept in trust on their behalf and to expend them 
in their best interest. However, what do some MPs do? They say: 
``Please cut back and be responsible, but not us as MPs. We are 
just fine and should be given a little more. Our pensions should 
be cut a little but not too much. We have to make a lot of money 
after all we gave up''.
<P>
	I do not think there is a single MP in the House who did not 
calculate very carefully what the cost to come here would be. 
Some looked at the pension plan and said: ``Wait a minute. That 
is a freebie. That would be great for me to have''. That has 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13488"> 13488 </A></B>
<P>
become the issue and is not a measure of productivity. It happens 
after years of productivity here.
<P>
	There is a serious lack of leadership. We need to get our 
leadership back into focus. We must become examples to young 
people and to other citizens.
<P>
	Let us examine some of the great and wonderful benefits. I 
return to the point I made earlier about the President of the 
Treasury Board saying that we have been forced into it. He said 
that we should look after the interests of our families for the 
future.
<P>
	If anybody in the House is looking after family members, it is 
some of our people. I look at one of my colleagues who has a 
young family at home. If there is anyone here whom I know 
personally who cares about his family, it is this man. He is 
saying: ``I am opting out of the pension plan''. The issue is that 
we have calculated the cost. We know the cost and have said that 
we want to pay the cost as all other Canadian citizens have to pay 
a cost to retire.
<P>
	I commend my colleagues who have decided to opt out of this 
overly generous plan and who are prepared to put their 
reputations, their leadership and their imagination on the line. 
There is another vision for Canada, a vision of responsibility, a 
vision of leading the country into a moral position that says we 
will treat taxpayers' money as a public trust with the same 
jealously and with the same concern as we have for our own.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
very carefully to what the hon. member for Richelieu had to say. 
He expressed his surprise at the wording of Motion No. 4 which 
says that members who want to make an election concerning 
their pension will be able to receive the pension or make that 
election only if they are Canadian citizens.
<P>
	I am astonished, surprised and disappointed to see this kind of 
proposal because, like the hon. member for Richelieu, I see this 
as an attack on the members Quebec sent to Ottawa, an attack on 
Bloc members. The message is that Bloc members are 
sovereignists who are trying to get Quebec to separate and 
should be punished by being deprived of their pensions.
<P>
	When they were elected in October 1993, the Bloc members 
were well aware that their term in Ottawa would not be long 
enough to entitle them to a pension. However, I would like to 
point out two things about Motion No. 4. First, I think it is unfair 
to sovereignist members who work in Ottawa and represent their 
constituents. Sovereignist members from Quebec received a 
mandate from the people. They are proud to sit in the House of 
Commons and do the job they promised to do, which is to defend 
the interests of Quebec and promote Quebec's sovereignty.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	Incidentally, this motion attacks not just Quebec 
sovereignists but any Quebecer sitting in the House of 
Commons who, after Quebec becomes sovereign, decides to 
give up his Canadian citizenship, because the motion says: ``As 
long as that person is a Canadian citizen''.
<P>
	So are the Prime Minister, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the 
Minister of Finance, the Minister of Labour, the President of the 
Privy Council and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, the 
members for Sherbrooke, Pierrefonds-Dollard, 
Verdun-Saint-Paul, Outremont, Gatineau-Labelle, and the 
member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce who has been in this House 
for 30 years, are they all going to be forced to choose between 
their pension and their citizenship after Quebec becomes 
sovereign?
<P>
	Are you going to tell the Prime Minister who, if I am not 
mistaken, has been a member of the House of Commons for 30 
or 33 years and who has represented the people of Quebec to the 
best of his ability: ``Mr. Prime Minister, if you do not give up 
your Canadian citizenship, you will be entitled to your pension, 
but otherwise, if you take out Quebec citizenship, you will give 
up the pension entitlements you had under Canadian law''?
<P>
	I consider this motion unfair for the membership of the Bloc 
Quebecois because it smells like punishment. It is also unfair for 
federalist members of Parliament from Quebec, who will be 
asked to choose between their pension and their citizenship.
<P>
	It also makes a mockery of the whole Quebec sovereignty 
debate in which it has been made clear that Quebec would 
assume its responsibilities in the event of sovereignty. Quebec 
will not ask people living there to give up their citizenship or 
anything else in order to obtain Quebec citizenship. Quebec will 
not, for example, ask federal public servants entitled to a 
pension to give up their Canadian citizenship in order to receive 
a pension paid by Quebec, because Quebec has announced it will 
assume the responsibilities it inherits from the Government of 
Canada in the area of federal public service pensions.
<P>
	I think that a motion like this one complicates matters ahead 
of time for the Quebec and Canadian negotiators who will be 
trying to reach an amicable agreement after Quebec achieves 
sovereignty.
<P>
	I think it is a very bad thing and does not augur well for the 
future to have Parliament adopt this sort of motion. It is a 
disgraceful way to behave and it will hinder future negotiations.
<P>
	I think we will need all our democratic and justice wits about 
us to ensure that the negotiations following sovereignty are 
conducted in the best possible manner. It is not acceptable for 
the Government of Canada to adopt a motion like this one, which 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13489"> 13489 </A></B>
<P>
will prejudice discussions and make it harder for Canada and 
Quebec to reach an agreement before they even start.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to think it is a pleasure to speak to this motion today 
and if I begin to speak rather quickly during my presentation it is 
because the government has invoked closure; I must hurry as 
usual to get through before something else happens on the other 
side.
<P>
	This is not the first time I have spoken on the bill. It is a very 
important bill. The three most substantial bills for my office as 
far as public interest especially in this spring sitting of 
Parliament are the MP pension plan, Bill C-41, the sentencing 
bill, and Bill C-68, the gun control bill. Those three have 
invoked more interest in Canadian papers and in my riding than 
any other legislation the government has talked about or has 
brought in.
<P>
<B>(1605 ) </B>
<P>
	The Canadian public should know that today closure was 
invoked on those three bills to stifle debate in the House. Those 
three bills the Canadian people think are most important have 
now been allocated only a few hours of debate before they have 
been passed and rammed through Parliament.
<P>
	Before I get to the substance of the bill, people may think 
these bills could be dealt with in committee. Maybe that would 
be a good place to air them and put forward amendments.
<P>
	On first reading of Bill C-64, the employment equity bill, I 
was not allowed to bring amendments because they were in 
English only and could not be accepted. Then only five minutes 
of debate was allowed per amendment, which meant often I was 
not allowed to speak. When it was brought to the House, closure 
was invoked like it was done with the three bills. When the 
committee has a bill as controversial as the pension bill, it does 
not have to invoke closure, it just will not let any witnesses 
appear. That will take care of the debate.
<P>
	Perhaps a private members' bill would be a good way to get 
democracy to the forefront and on to the front burner. People 
should have been in committee the other day to see the look on 
the face of the member for Hamilton-Wentworth when Bill 
C-224 was deep sixed by the Liberal majority on the committee, 
never again to see the light of day because it did not want to see 
it there.
<P>
	It is very difficult to get a point of view across and it is 
disappointing to see the government, which campaigned on 
open government, more access for the Canadian people, 
invoking different types of closure in different ways to stifle 
meaningful debate. It is very discouraging.
<P>
	In speaking to this block of motions before us on the bill, I 
want to reiterate concerns of my constituents. I could read from 
endless supplies of letters I have received from people 
concerned about the bill, about the previous pension plan and so 
on. They are very angry.
<P>
	Of the three bills I mentioned earlier this bill is the one that 
really peaks their interest. Because we cannot have meaningful 
debate in here the government will not allow it to go on as it 
should.
<P>
	The last time I was on my feet speaking to this bill on previous 
reading I offered to debate any member of the House anywhere 
in Canada at any time in a public forum on pension plans. We 
cannot seem to get Liberal members to debate it here. They are 
not very proud of it. There are not many speakers from the 
government side. No one accepted the challenge because they 
realize the amount of gas to keep their cars running out behind 
the theatre to make their quick getaway would cause some kind 
of global warming.
<P>
	No one will debate. No one wants to debate in a public forum. 
No one on the Liberal side is proud of this legislation. They will 
hang their heads and pass it later on. It is really too bad. I believe 
the government is running scared on Bill C-41, Bill C-68, the 
pension bill, Bill C-64, the employment equity bill. It does not 
want to debate any of those. It does not want to debate anything 
like that because it realizes those are the things Canadians will 
get upset about. It hopes to slide these through and somehow 
keep people from knowing the truth about this pension plan.
<P>
	I want to make perfectly clear for my constituents that I will 
have to opt out of the pension plan. It is a shame really. I sent out 
40,000 questionnaires earlier this year and 85 per cent of the 
people who responded on this issue said they think members of 
Parliament should have a pension plan. There is nothing wrong 
with a pension plan, only make it the same as the pension plan in 
the private sector. They supported me. A pension plan for MPs is 
not a bad deal, but they said I should not dare support the 
pension plan proposed by the government.
<P>
	That is too bad. Most members on both sides of the House 
have families. I have a wife and four kids. I like to support them 
and do my part in family finances. However, when the Liberals 
deliberately put together a package they know no fair minded 
person can support, it is a shame. They will force people out of 
the pension plan to make sure there is nothing available. This 
shows their motive, especially when speaking to Motions Nos. 1 
and 6, the idea of opting in or opting out of this plan for future 
parliamentarians.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	In a sense the Liberals are hoping to invoke closure on this 
issue even into the next election. They do not want to talk about 
this. It is a fait accompli. One must be part of this pension plan to 
run for Parliament next time. They are even trying to stifle the 
debate on the next round of parliamentarians, which is really 
disgusting.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13490"> 13490 </A></B>
<P>
	The next time around Canadians do not need to worry because 
if they vote for a Reform government this pension plan, 
regardless of what the bill says, will be gone, deep sixed as it 
should be. We will have a fair pension plan in which we match 
funds one for one, not this ridiculous four to one, gold plated 
plan we see have today.
<P>
	Let me read one or two letters. It is almost sad to have to read a 
letter like this, but I will read a little to show what constituents 
think about MP pension plans. This letter came to my 
Chilliwack office:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In 1950 as a young nineteen year old man I was working as an apprentice 
making one dollar an hour. When Canada asked for volunteers to go to Korea I 
volunteered. I spent two years in the trenches and many times did not know if I 
would see the sunrise the next morning. Many of my comrades did not.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I continued to serve my country for another 15 years until I became a diabetic 
and was forced to retire from the armed forces. For all my dedicated service I 
received $142 a month.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Three years ago I lost my leg and could not work any more. Now my pension is 
indexed and I receive $580 a month.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A member of Parliament serves six years in office, receiving a good salary 
and many fringe benefits. If he is not re-elected after this time he receives a 
pension-</BLOCKQUOTE>
-this is under the old plan which many people on the front 
benches will qualify for-
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-of $40,000 a year which is already indexed. How can they justify this? My 
wife and I have worked hard all of our lives to raise six children and help build a 
way of life for ourselves and our fellow Canadians.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Why are my 16 years of service worth only $142 a month and an MP's six 
years of service worth over $3,000 a month?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	If I were to be challenged on this idea of debating in public 
and I brought forward this letter what would be the response 
from the Liberal members? That is why they will not debate it 
outside of this place. It is a sad thing. How can one look in the 
eye of a veteran like this, a guy who has now lost his leg and is 
unable to work, and tell him: ``Survive on $500 a month and then 
pay my pension with your taxes?'' I have said enough.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am deeply 
troubled as I rise today to speak to the issue of MP pensions. My 
opposition to the pension plan and that of my colleagues is well 
known and our refusal to accept it is well known.
<P>
	What especially troubles me today is the way the government 
is using time allocation to ram this and other bills through the 
House without proper debate. This is an abuse of our 
parliamentary system.
<P>
	In speaking to the pension scheme, as I often do when I am 
speaking on bills in the House, I always refer back to the auditor 
general's observations about what government spending should 
be about. There should always be accountability. There should 
always be a designated goal and a measurement for whether 
those goals are being achieved by the expenditure. What is the 
purpose of this pension plan? What is it meant to do? Is it 
achieving that?
<P>
	When the American government was instituted some two 
centuries ago there was actually a spirited public debate as to 
whether legislators should be paid at all. Some said they had to 
be because otherwise only the wealthy could engage in politics. 
Others said they should not because politics should not attract 
people who thought they could make a comfortable living if they 
were good at it.
<P>
<B>(1615 ) </B>
<P>
	The decision that they should be paid seems obvious, but back 
then politics was not a full time occupation. Legislatures sat less 
often for less time and they did a whole lot less legislating. 
Maybe that is something we could enjoy as Canadians. By the 
way, back in 1867 Canadian MPs were paid $6 a day. Things are 
a little different today. Now we have professional politicians. 
That is the consequence of the decision to pay them well.
<P>
	That has both good and bad aspects. On the bad side, too many 
people in the House have never had real jobs. I do not say that 
political expertise is always bad. We do need people who 
understand how to get things done and how to work within the 
parliamentary system. I suppose it is good that some people can 
do politics full time as a career, but we can have too much of a 
good thing.
<P>
	In any case, the decision was made to pay politicians so that 
financial barriers to holding public office would not exist. That 
is defensible, and it produced predictable results. MPs are also 
paid fairly well today. We are not paid as well as some people 
may think, although as my colleague from Calgary Centre 
recently pointed out, we are paid more than is apparent. We are 
paid reasonably so that we can afford to devote ourselves full 
time to the job and, to be quite honest, so we will be harder to 
corrupt. Frankly, that is money well spent. MPs who are 
struggling to survive and to keep the wolf away from the door 
are obviously more susceptible to improper approaches. So we 
have good reason for paying politicians and for paying them 
reasonably well.
<P>
	What about the pension scheme? What is the reason for 
having this pension plan in the first place, and why is it so 
generous? It is obvious that the purpose of the pension is to 
enable people to stay with a career, knowing that when it is over 
they will be provided for. Private sector companies have 
pensions for that reason, and it is quite reasonable.
<P>
	No one doubts the desirability of having pensions for MPs, as 
my colleague just pointed out. The real question before us today 
is do we have a good reason for having an outrageously generous 
pension system for MPs compared to their salaries and 
compared to the private sector and compared to other 
Canadians? Put another way, is there a good reason for 
structuring the rewards for politics so that MPs get less now and 
more later, that is, if they survive six years or longer? Is there a 
good reason for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13491"> 13491 </A></B>
<P>
creating a system where the reward for being an MP depends 
very heavily on getting re-elected again and again? Do we have 
a system that rewards MPs for  making the right choice here and 
now, or one that encourages them to promise and promise to 
deficit spend, to go along with their leadership even when they 
know it is wrong, all in the desperate hope of being re-elected 
and becoming a 20-year man or woman and walking off with a 
huge pension? That is what the pension plan is doing right now.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, the other day you found it necessary to remind 
my colleagues on the opposite bench that this is a debating 
chamber and not a barnyard. The problem that time was chicken 
sounds from the other side, but it is also inappropriate to hear 
snorts and grunts.
<P>
	I do not expect my colleagues opposite to agree that we are, all 
things considered, overpaid. Perhaps they will agree that the 
current system is dishonest because it conceals the real 
compensation MPs receive. Perhaps they will also agree that it 
is poorly designed, in that instead of rewarding courage and 
sound decisions in the present it rewards survival at any cost.
<P>
	I think my colleagues opposite would be wise to go home and 
speak to their constituents before they make decisions on how 
they will vote on the pension bill, decisions that may haunt them 
in the next election. I also think they would be wise to take some 
time during the recess, if we wait to pass the bill, and before the 
recess if we do not, to consider the following questions.
<P>
	If we are going to reward MPs at a certain level, does it make 
sense to put the money primarily into salaries or primarily into 
pensions? If we are going to reward MPs at a certain level, does 
it make sense to pay all of them more or less equally or to give 
far greater rewards to those who have been here the longest?
<P>
	I want to repeat that I thoroughly understand the importance 
of having expertise available. I am no career politician, and I 
understand that this is not, in proper numbers, a bad thing. 
However, I also believe that a system that rewards survival in 
politics above all else will attract to politics precisely those 
people most adept at surviving election after election. Too often 
these are also people skilled at sacrificing the future to the 
present in their public policy decisions. Our national debt has 
essentially accumulated in the last 20 years.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	Last night the member for Durham said: ``I have often 
wondered coming to the House how it is possible that Canada 
created the debt it has today. I have often wondered who was 
controlling the cheque books.''. Perhaps he should ask the Prime 
Minister, a consummate political survivor, a former finance 
minister, and a master of promise now and pay later. Such 
politicians have proven very skilful at convincing Canadians 
they can have their cake and eat it too, which has been ruinous 
for the country. It has been very lucrative for them, however.
<P>
	Our national debt has accumulated under politicians who 
made promises and presented bills later and were re-elected for 
doing so. Our national debt has accumulated under politicians 
with very generous pensions. I am afraid our national debt is so 
huge that the only people who can shoulder the burden in the 
future will be MPs on their pensions. Frankly, I do not believe 
the hon. member for York Centre will wind up in a cardboard 
box collecting pogey if we reform MP pensions. I do believe the 
current system rewards wrong behaviour, which is very bad and 
ill considered.
<P>
	Let us by all means adopt an honest system of paying MPs. 
And whatever we decide to pay them, let us put most of it into 
salaries, with a pension system no more generous than the 
private sector. Let us not reward the political survivor above the 
one who does what is right, who tells the truth, and who 
sometimes must pay the price for doing so.
<P>
	Proposed changes to the MP pension plan are totally 
inappropriate. The members opposite imposed closure. They 
have heard countless complaints about the generosity of the 
plan. They have excluded witnesses critical of the pension plan 
from committee hearings, but they cannot exclude the Canadian 
public.
<P>
	I look forward to going to all of their ridings in the next 
election to remind their constituents of how they behaved today. 
Because of their votes today, they are going to need their 
pensions after the next election, because I am convinced they are 
not going to be here.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
had not intended to speak on the bill, but I think members have 
raised a number of issues that bear commenting on and require 
me to remind the members of what is being proposed in the bill.
<P>
	I would like to address the general feeling of many of the 
speakers that the pensions of members of Parliament should 
have the same provisions as those applicable to the private 
sector.
<P>
	One of the aspects of private sector pension plans the 
members have not given any consideration to whatsoever is the 
vesting differential. Vesting is the point at which the 
contributions of the employer become the property of the 
employee. Consider a corporation with a pension plan that 
contributes <I>x</I> dollars to a plan, which is matched by the 
employee. Let us say they contributed $1,000 each. There would 
be $2,000 in that plan. That accumulated amount starts to 
accumulate to the benefit of the employee following a two-year 
tenure of employment. After two years of employment an 
employee who is a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13492"> 13492 </A></B>
<P>
member of a normal private sector pension plan automatically 
starts to accrue and accumulate benefits.
<P>
	If the members really wanted to provide all of the details they 
would have to take into account the differential in the vesting 
being imposed upon members of Parliament and the vesting 
benefit that is available in the private sector.
<P>
<B>(1625 ) </B>
<P>
	If we were to go to a system where vesting in the private sector 
was applicable to members of Parliament, that means each and 
every member of Parliament would automatically at the end of 
two years of service start to accrue and be entitled to a pension. 
That means that the vast majority of members of Parliament who 
never did reach six years of service would automatically be 
included. In fact the cost of the pension plan would more than 
double. In a quick calculation I did here on my laptop computer, 
I find that it would almost triple the cost of pensions to the 
House of Commons simply by changing the vesting benefits.
<P>
	I honestly believe that the government has come forward with 
certain provisions that are absolutely necessary. The 
government, in its election platform, said that members' 
pensions should be reformed. There were two specific 
commitments, as the hon. parliamentary secretary outlined to 
the House. First, there was the eligibility. Under the current 
plan, members of Parliament would be eligible to be entitled to a 
pension if they served six years in aggregate in this House.
<P>
	Under our Constitution a House must turn over at least every 
five years, so the six years is actually a very critical period. It 
means that a member of Parliament has to be elected at least 
twice, and in some cases in our history it has been more than 
twice. It could be three and sometimes four times that members 
have had to run simply to accumulate six years simply because 
of Houses collapsing before their five-year mandate might be 
available.
<P>
	The six years really is a critical period, and it does, as all 
members know, eliminate a vast majority of members of 
Parliament from ever qualifying for pension benefits. Those are 
the differences that I think would have to be rationalized if the 
hon. members of the Reform Party would like to somehow move 
this to a system compatible with the private sector.
<P>
	The second item the government committed to in its red book 
was to end double dipping. I am very proud to say that the Prime 
Minister did not wait until this legislation came forward to bring 
in effectively the end of double dipping. The first example was 
with regard to the newly appointed governor general, who was a 
member of the Senate and entitled to receive a pension. The 
governor general was asked and accepted to reduce his salary 
otherwise payable as the governor general by the amount of 
pension. The double dipping is eliminate.
<P>
	There are other examples in which the double dipping has 
effectively been eliminated even before this legislation has 
come forward. Those are the kinds of things the government has 
committed to and is doing, even in the absence of the legislation. 
That is important to point out.
<P>
	Finally, as was pointed out earlier, in response to the need to 
demonstrate to the public that there was a goodwill effort to deal 
with this issue, the Prime Minister went further than his 
commitment in the election. He went further by proposing that 
the rate of accumulation of pension was going to be reduced. It is 
called the accrual rate and it has been reduced from 5 per cent to 
4 per cent.
<P>
	With the changes that have been made in addition to the 
commitments in the red book, the cost of the pension plan is 
going to be reduced by some one-third. Changes that have been 
made have been very significant changes.
<P>
	For some hon. members and I know for many of my own 
constituents and Canadians across the land, there is a 
compensation question here they would like to have resolved.
<P>
	The Reform Party whip has suggested we eliminate perks, 
pensions, and everything and simply pay members $150,000 a 
year. The member has determined, based on the work and 
research his party has done, that $150,000 a year is the salary we 
should be paid to compensate us for the contribution we make in 
this place.
<P>
<B>(1630 ) </B>
<P>
	I do not want to debate with any hon. members what the value 
of my work is to the House. Certainly under any criteria I would 
never suggest that $150,000 a year would be appropriate for this 
job. It is an absolute ludicrous suggestion. I do not think that the 
Canadian people, if they really knew what the Reform Party had 
in mind, would consider any of this rhetoric as being in any way 
credible.
<P>
	Very often in debate members have raised certain examples 
where a person is going to get a pension which by the time he or 
she reaches age 75 will have accumulated in value to $3 million, 
$4 million, $6 million and so on. Let us get the facts right. They 
are working with numbers and people have to be cautious about 
numbers. Let me give an example of what this pension plan 
would mean to me, the member for Mississauga South.
<P>
	If I should serve six years I will be entitled to a pension which 
will accrue at 4 per cent a year or 24 per cent of my salary. My 
salary is $64,400 a year. That means I will get approximately 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13493"> 13493 </A></B>
<P>
$15,000 a year in pension but it will not be payable to me until I 
reach age 55, some seven or eight years from now.
<P>
	I think members have been using age 75 as a period to which 
we would be getting the pension on average. Therefore, between 
the ages of 55 and 75 getting paid that $15,000, the net present 
value of those payments is $460,000. That is also a big number 
but it is a number which is made up of a $15,000 annual payment 
over 20 years with an assumed rate of interest of some 4 per cent 
which is the rate we get if we should not make our six years and 
we get our funds back.
<P>
	The most important point I wanted to raise is the point I raised 
initially with regard to the vesting. Members really must 
consider the differential in the vesting provisions available to 
private sector pension plans and those that are imposed on the 
members of Parliament. It does have a significant impact on the 
calculations and it also has a significant impact on the rationale 
as to eligibility.
<P>
	If those members believe that every member of Parliament, 
and I stress every member of Parliament who serves two years, 
should get a pension when they reach age 55, my figures show 
that the cost to the House of Commons would triple.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, I listened with 
interest to the member for Mississauga South. Was he 
challenging me to a debate in his own riding? Is that what he was 
doing?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> That might be a matter of 
debate the members may want to further look into at some other 
time and some other place. Respectfully, the member does not 
have a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, most 
of the time when I get an opportunity to rise and speak regarding 
a bill, I usually say it is a privilege and an honour to speak to it. 
However today I am going to have to get up and say I cannot 
believe I would have to rise in this place to speak on such a bill 
and that such a bill even exists.
<P>
	Surely there are enough people here who realize that such a 
lucrative plan is not acceptable to Canadians. They should take 
the time to find out, Even the Liberal whip might just check with 
his constituents and see what they have to say. I would be 
interested in the results.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	I quote a former parliamentarian and an actuary. This is what 
he said about why this pension plan is wrong:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I believe that compensation for MPs should be brought into line with modern 
private sector practice. My conclusion is that this bill is bad for you as members, 
bad for Parliament as an institution and bad for Canada. It entrenches your 
benefits at a level higher than those available to general taxpayers. It is my 
opinion that as long as your pension benefits exceed the levels available to 
taxpayers, there will be a strong public opinion to the effect that MPs are 
overpaid. More and more, the public's attitude to politicians is that they are all 
crooks. Some of this has to do with actual scandals, but in my view, the 
underlying cause is a view that politicians set one set of rules for themselves and 
set another for the general public.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I put it to you that if one of the last acts of Parliament before the summer 
recess is to pass legislation entrenching pension benefits for MPs at levels well 
beyond those possible to the citizenry-I believe that Parliament will have lost 
the moral authority to proceed as the country needs.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>You may be faced with immense public outrage for protecting your privileged 
position just before you skewer Canadians. In that case, you deserve the public's 
contempt.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He did not even know about closure at the time he made that 
statement. I could not agree with him more.
<P>
	I picked up some other quotes that were mentioned at various 
times around the Hill. I am not even sure when they were said, 
but apparently a member from Mississauga said: ``We have no 
option because the salaries are not generous enough to enrich 
our pensions ourselves. Therefore, the government has to 
provide for us''. What a bunch of hogwash.
<P>
	I know full well and if they do not they should stay close to 
their phones once in a while. I doubt very seriously that we could 
find a member who has not received a phone call from some 
senior citizen or some other individual who is having a really 
tough time making it.
<P>
	I received one from a pensioner this week who said: ``Mr. 
Thompson, I make $714 a month. My husband is not well. We 
are having an extremely difficult time even paying rent. We had 
to give up our home not too long ago and we are asked to make it 
on that kind of money. What can you do for us?'' I work at trying 
to do something for those people but then I think how can I with 
any conscience at all tell her I will do all I can for her, that I will 
work so hard for her but I will accept a pension that will pay four 
to one.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brushett:</B> Give her some of your pension.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I would be more than pleased to. In fact, I 
probably have. I do not know how anybody with any conscience 
at all could listen to situations like that and then accept 
something like this pension.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I understand there are 
some very strongly held views on this subject matter, but I 
certainly would like to have the benefit of hearing each and 
every intervention.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Mr. Speaker, there is one thing about it. 
When I go to my grave I will never say I ever took anything that 
was not deserving from anyone. I will not accept the pension. I 
will opt out or I will not opt in, whichever it is.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13494"> 13494 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1640 ) </B>
<P>
	I could not go to my grave with a good conscience knowing I 
had done that, especially when we have people in this House 
who have brought the government practically to its knees. If 
they have not done that yet, they soon will with a $600 billion 
deficit. People are crying because they cannot get 
unemployment insurance. Seniors cannot make it because of 
their pensions. I cannot believe what I am hearing. They would 
not give an inch. Not an inch.
<P>
	During the 1993 campaign, boy were things going to be 
different. Were they ever going to be different. I stood on the 
same platform with people who agreed with me that things had 
to change with the pension. If the Liberals could agree with the 
Reformers on one thing, it was to fix the pension plan. This is 
not even a band-aid.
<P>
	We ought to be ashamed of ourselves for even considering 
such a thing when we are asking everybody in the country to 
tighten their belts. There will be no more UI money. There will 
not be any more old age security money. No more CPP. We have 
to cut our health care. We have to cut education. But boy, we are 
going to keep those fat pensions coming. What a bunch of 
hypocritical nonsense.
<P>
	I hope in the next election, on this issue alone, if they do not 
pay the price for what they have done today that they will wish 
they had.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> What is your pension?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> My pension, just in case hon. members want 
to know, is about $914 a month as a school teacher. I paid into it 
for nearly 40 years and it was not matched dollar for dollar until 
about the last five years of my work. It took a long, long time. 
That is called a private sector pension.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brushett:</B> Double dipping.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Mr. Speaker, they can call it anything they 
want but it is not double dipping.
<P>
	I also issue the challenge to my friend from Fraser Valley in 
British Columbia. If any one of you suckers wants to take me to 
your ridings, let us go.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order, please. I want to 
take a moment to remind all members that interventions must be 
directed through the Chair. I think it becomes apparent on a day 
like today with subject matter on which there are strongly held 
views, that if the debate is not maintained in the traditional 
parliamentary fashion with interventions being made through 
the Chair that some rather unexpected and possibly 
unparliamentary statements might be made. I urge members on 
both sides of the House to be judicious and respectful in the 
normal practice of the Chamber.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Mr. Speaker, no doubt a person is going to 
get a little riled up over this kind of an issue. I apologize for not 
speaking through the Chair. I lost it, but I will repeat what I said.
<P>
	Any one of my hon. colleagues across the way who would like 
to take me into their ridings to debate the pension and my 
personal pension which I earned after many hard years of work 
at less than a dollar for a dollar, then I would be more than 
pleased to accept the invitation.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I thank you because I am sure you are the only 
one who really listened at heart.
<P>
<B>(1645 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I do want to take a 
moment to express my gratitude to the hon. member for Wild 
Rose for the manner in which he completed his remarks and 
particularly in reference to an earlier statement made which I 
think bordered on the questionable side of debate. I certainly 
compliment and thank him for the manner in which he handled 
that issue.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is very interesting to follow my hon. colleague. 
Much of what he said and much of what he feels is what I feel.
<P>
	I do want to speak today at report stage on Bill C-85, an act to 
amend the Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act. I 
spoke on this bill last month at which time I expressed my 
concerns and reasons for vehemently opposing this piece of 
government legislation.
<P>
	My opposition to this bill is based on certain principles that I 
as a member of Parliament for the Reform Party hold and 
advocate. I would like to state these two principles from our blue 
book:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We believe in public service-that governments, civil servants, politicians 
and political parties exist to serve the people, and that they should demonstrate 
this service commitment at all times.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We believe that public money should be regarded by governments as ``funds 
held in trust'', and that governments should practise fiscal responsibility to 
balance expenditures and revenues.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I mention those principles to the House today because they 
show us a government that has distorted this process and has 
flaunted the trust of the Canadian people. Reformers want a fair 
hearing on this issue.
<P>
	Today, as we come to this place in which the government has 
invoked closure on this bill we come with the same outrage that 
Canadians must feel.
<P>
	I put to the House as did a witness in the committee the other 
day the intervention that this bill is bad for the members who sit 
in this House, it is bad for Parliament and it is bad for the 
Canadian people.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13495"> 13495 </A></B>
<P>
	I will say why I think it is bad for the members who sit in the 
House. As with many of my colleagues I see around me, we 
came to the House to help set a new course in government. We 
came here with the best interests of our fellow Canadians in 
mind. We came here to bring integrity to the House.
<P>
	I know many of us work very hard and diligently in this place, 
but I must say that today that I am ashamed of the pretence of my 
colleagues on the other side. I see arrogant initiatives that 
presumably are done in the name of change yet they change very 
little.
<P>
	For instance, we see a program with three levels. We have a 
level of participation in this pension program which is virtually 
unchanged for those who sat in the House before the last 
election. I want to remind people particularly in my riding of 
some of the numbers that would be applied to these members of 
Parliament. The figures I have are based on nine year terms as 
ministers, assuming that these people live to age 75.
<P>
	The hon. member for Sherbrooke, the leader of the 
Progressive Conservative Party may gain from this legislation a 
pension of $4.5 million. The neighbour to my constituency, the 
member for Burnaby-Kingsway, would gain from this 
legislation a pension of $3.5 million. The Deputy Prime 
Minister, the member for Hamilton East, would have a pension 
at age 75 of $2.5 million. This is done by this government in the 
name of change. Shame on the government.
<P>
	Then there are the newer members. If they become retreads in 
the next election, there is still a very wide gulf between them and 
the Canadians they purport to represent.
<P>
	According to one of the witnesses in the committee, even as 
this plan now stands, it is seven times greater than what would 
be expected in a public sector plan and four times greater than 
what would be expected in a private sector plan. The 
government calls this change.
<P>
	This is bad for members as well who came here with the real 
belief in change, who wanted to make a difference and to raise 
the public attitude for this place. Those who decided to reject 
what has been given to us here are treated purposely with 
contempt in the sense that we are given the option that all 
pension benefits are lost to those who choose to reject this 
proposal.
<P>
<B>(1650 ) </B>
<P>
	Once again I am amazed at the arrogance of the members 
sitting on the other side of the House. I am amazed even in this 
discussion at their self-righteous indignation when we point out 
the duplicity of what they are saying.
<P>
	This bill is also bad for Parliament. As we look at this bill and 
other bills that have come to this place, we see procedural 
nightmares and shoddy treatment of the democratic process. It is 
true that when the original bill which brought in parliamentary 
allowances came in years ago, all stages of that bill were 
brought through the  House in one day, including committee of 
the whole. At that time there was no written bill for 
consideration by the members. It simply was brought in and 
shoved through. We have not changed much. Is this a place of 
change? Is this the change promised by the red book?
<P>
	What do we have with Bill C-85? Last week in committee, a 
committee that was dominated by government members, we had 
witnesses who represented real Canadians. We had witnesses 
who represented professionals in this field who were refused 
entrance to that committee. The Canadian Taxpayers Federation 
gained entry to the committee only by presenting itself to the 
committee and insisting on a hearing.
<P>
	In that committee there was a lack of notice of the 
government's intent to proceed to clause by clause after a full 
day of witnesses. Even after the witnesses said there were many 
flaws in the bill, it took the government 12 minutes to complete 
its consideration of that piece of legislation. Over 28 detailed 
and complex clauses were covered in 12 minutes by the 
government.
<P>
	It reminds me of what we experienced in the human rights and 
status of the disabled persons committee when we were 
considering Bill C-64 recently. In that circumstance, 
government once again invoked closure on the clause by clause 
portion with a five minute limit on each clause. Only four out of 
the 50 witnesses brought before that committee were from the 
Reform list of recommendations.
<P>
	Then the government comes to the House and says there was 
an overwhelming support for employment equity of all things. 
Employment equity is the bane of the Canadian people. They do 
not accept it but this government tries to claim otherwise 
because the witnesses brought before the committee supported 
it. I call that a flouting disrespect for this place as Parliament.
<P>
	Then when this bill came to the House earlier today, what do 
we get? Government invoked closure along with other bills so 
that we have a four hour maximum to discuss each of the two 
stages, report stage and third reading. In that time, we have 40 
motions to be considered. Is that not bad for Parliament?
<P>
	Finally, this bill is bad for Canadians. Underlying this whole 
debate is a moral imperative. All members, including the 
members on the other side have received phone calls and letters 
about this. I have received many. I am sure I have heard from the 
cousin of the constituent the member for Wild Rose mentioned. 
Pensioners in distress look at this legislation and say it is 
morally wrong for government to do this.
<P>
	How can MP pensions continue to be gold plated under this 
bill when it is far above and beyond what ordinary Canadians 
can expect from their private or public sector pension plans? 
How can this government justify tinkering with the MP pension 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13496"> 13496 </A></B>
<P>
plan when the future of the CPP and old age security are at very 
real risk?
<P>
	The Canada pension plan is actuarially unsound. The pay as 
you go system now in place is completely unsustainable. The 
security of Canadian pensioners is threatened at this moment, 
yet the politicians in the House have endowed upon themselves 
security and golden retirement years.
<P>
<B>(1655 ) </B>
<P>
	The approach of government security programs for ordinary 
Canadians has not worked. They are no longer consistent with 
demographics, expectations, fiscal realities. Canadians know 
this. They seek to secure their own security.
<P>
	Reformers have confidence and faith in Canadians. We want 
to empower them with the resources and tools to plan for their 
retirement. We reject government bureaucracy, waste and 
arrogance, especially as we see it in this kind of legislation 
today.
<P>
	Government insists that it knows best. Yet it continues to 
pretend that the debt and deficit have to be shouldered by 
ordinary Canadians but not the leadership of this country. It 
continues to let the debt grow by $100 billion in its mandate 
which will indeed put greater stress on social programs, pension 
plans, every part of Canadians' lives.
<P>
	It is true the interest on our debt is probably the biggest threat 
to the security of Canadians. This government in the meantime 
continues to outdo the Mulroney legacy with its patronage, with 
its arrogant closure and with its arrogant pension plan. The 
arrogance of the government is the biggest threat to Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I recently learned that 
the Liberal Party, having decided that Parliament is irrelevant 
and that parliamentary debate is of no particular value to our 
society, is also working on a project to redesign the Canadian 
coat of arms. It will remove the lion and the unicorn and replace 
them with two fat pigs which will illustrate the triumph of greed 
over rationality in this country.
<P>
	This country did not have an aristocracy. People came to 
Canada to get away from the aristocracies in the old world. 
However, we have willy-nilly created our own right here in 
Canada, the political elite, the professional politicians. This is 
the aristocracy we have voluntarily burdened ourselves with. It 
is a shame and a scandal.
<P>
	The hon. Marie Antoinette, the president of the treasury 
board, tells us that this is the normal thing. This is Canada. This 
is the future for Canada. There will be this little group of very 
special people, many of whom have never had a real job in their 
lives, who somehow or other got elected to Parliament. When 
they leave this place, through their own machinations they will 
be allowed to carry away a suitcase full of money. This is wrong. 
Several hon. members opposite have engaged in the most 
convoluted rationalizations I have ever heard to justify this 
massive dip into the public trough.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> And it is not a skinny dip.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Mr. Speaker, do I have to provide my own 
hecklers? I know there are not many people on the other side.
<P>
	The rules of the House do not permit me to name the 
individuals who will be the top troughers in the new scheme as it 
is being developed. However, I can read the names of their 
ridings and the total sums to which each of them will be entitled, 
and I use the word entitled very loosely.
<P>
	If the hon. member for Sherbrooke lives to the age of 75, he 
will receive $4.25 million courtesy of the taxpayer. The hon. 
member for Humber-St. Barbe-Baie Verte will receive $3.86 
million. The hon. member for Hamilton East will receive $2.8 
million. The hon. member for York South-Weston will receive 
$2.75 million. The list goes on and on.
<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
	No other class of Canadians has a deal like that; no corporate 
employee, no self-employed person, no farmer. Who on earth 
aside from our new aristocracy could ever hope to take home a 
paycheque like that?
<P>
	One of the major sources of my case work is disabled 
veterans, pensioners in this, the 50th anniversary of the end of 
the war. I am dealing with one constituent now who participated 
in poison gas experiments at the Suffield, Alberta base. He is 
now paying the price of that in ruined health. He has a lot of 
problems. His doctor says there is no question that can be traced 
to the poison gas experiments. He and his wife draw the 
magnificent sum of $102 a month for his partial 
disability-shame, shame, shame.
<P>
	Hon. members opposite say that for their little bits of service 
here they are entitled to millions of dollars at the expense of the 
Canadian taxpayer. I am disgusted to the point of regurgitation.
<P>
	Surely people who pretend they are competent to run a 
country should be competent to arrange for their own 
retirement. They make a reasonable salary, as do we. Some of 
that could be invested to their own benefit. They do not have to 
take $4 from the public purse for every $1 they put in.
<P>
	Reformers have put our money where our mouth is, so to 
speak. We are opting out of this plan. It will cost the hon. 
member for Beaver River, a school teacher and by no means a 
wealthy woman, $1.8 million which she would have received if 
she had agreed to stay in the trough with the hogs.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13497"> 13497 </A></B>
<P>
                       	I opted out of the pension plan the day I signed up with pay and services. I gave a written statement to the effect that I did not want and would not accept it because I felt the old plan was unconscionable. The new plan, the new i
<P>
	Why are we here? Did we come here to benefit ourselves? I 
used to live in the Philippines. I remember a famous remark by 
one of the senators there when he was tweaked for having his 
hand a little too deep in the cookie jar. He said what are we in 
power for if not to enrich ourselves. He must have been a 
Liberal.
<P>
	Old line politicians maintain perks are necessary to attract 
good members. What it has attracted is a bunch of professional 
politicians, people who have systematically over the last 30 
years bankrupt the country and now are expecting a massive 
payout for their services-some reward.
<P>
	I hope when the bill goes to the other place there will be some 
sober second thought, although I do not expect it. Some sober 
second thought could even have helped here; it could have been 
killed in committee. Committee was not even allowed to handle 
it properly. It was whisked through committee with indecent 
haste. No one had a chance to make serious amendments or to 
work on it at the time. We will make some amendments in the 
House, to what purpose I do not know. We know what will 
happen here, the cabinet has decided. The whip will be lashed 
and everything will happen according to plan and all the 
Liberals will go home happy and fat with their suitcases full of 
money.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am truly sad to have to speak to legislation as 
deplorable as Bill C-85, the pension bill.
<P>
	It could be described with many words. I could use the words 
ignorant, arrogant, indefensible. I think those words probably 
describe the authors of this legislation as well but they do not 
even adequately describe how terrible it is. The words it takes to 
describe the legislation are unparliamentary; I cannot use them. 
What really troubles me is the government is embarrassed about 
the legislation and will not even allow a proper debate.
<P>
	I sat across the table from the Solicitor General of Canada, the 
government House leader, and he looked me in the eye and said 
the government will very rarely use closure. He gave me his 
word we would see the government use time allocation and 
closure far less than its predecessor, the arrogant Mulroney 
regime.
<P>
	Being a new and maybe idealistic member of Parliament, I 
took the solicitor general's statement to heart that perhaps we 
were to see a new era in Canadian politics. Perhaps we were to 
see some progress in this place where we could work together 
and build a country worthy of the people we are supposed to 
represent. I was wrong, terribly disappointed.
<P>
	The government has introduced time allocation and closure 
far more than the Mulroney government which it vigorously 
criticized for that undemocratic procedure. The government has 
introduced in only 19 months a far greater percentage of closure 
motions regarding bills than the Mulroney administration. That 
is deplorable and disappointing.
<P>
	It is particularly disappointing that the government would use 
such a draconian measure on a bill that gives us personal gain. It 
is unconscionable, it is wrong. I cannot think of words I can use 
in the House to adequately describe how troubled I am by the 
measures the government is taking and the lengths it will go to 
impose its will on me as a member of Parliament vigorously 
opposed to the legislation and on Canadians who in no uncertain 
terms told every member of the House, Liberals as well as Block 
and Reform members, the pension plan needed to be reformed to 
that of the private sector on a one to one basis or a self-funded 
pension plan.
<P>
	The government has introduced a bill in which it will not 
allow future MPs to opt out and which is illegal under the 
income tax act. It will have to put special legislation in place to 
allow the plan to be legal. The draconian measures it is 
implementing to get the bill through are truly disappointing. I 
feel bad for Canadians who will receive such bad representation 
and bad legislation from the Liberal government.
<P>
	I am not sure if NDP members will accept this plan. I 
challenge them to go back to their roots. They came of an 
agrarian movement, the CCF movement in Saskatchewan. I 
challenge them to go back to those roots of simple, hard working 
people who believed a dollar gained was a dollar that should 
have been earned, and they would not stoop to the levels this bill 
would impose on them if they agreed to opt into the pension 
plan.
<P>
	To the hon. members for Mackenzie and 
Regina-Qu'Appelle, Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing, 
Regina-Lumsden and The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, I 
challenge them to opt out of the pension plan as the Reform MPs 
from Saskatchewan are to do.
<P>
	I will focus my few remaining minutes on the Liberal 
members from Saskatchewan. At the top of the list is the cabinet 
representative from Saskatchewan, the hon. member for 
Regina-Wascana. He was here years ago and has come back. 
He was put into cabinet. He is a lawyer. I do not think he 
understands agriculture very well but he certainly knows how to 
make money on a pension plan because by the age of 75 he will 
qualify for $1.64 million. He does not even apologize for that 
outrageous amount.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13498"> 13498 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1710 ) </B>
<P>
	Then there is the hon. member for Saskatoon-Humboldt. It 
is rather embarrassing this member was even nominated in her 
constituency. She had to be anointed by the leader of the Liberal 
Party. She did not even have support in her own constituency. 
They had to cancel the nomination meeting and bypass the 
democratic process so she would be the candidate who would 
run in Saskatoon-Humboldt. She will receive almost $1 
million from the pension plan should she live to the age of 75. 
That is assuming, and I think it is a fairly safe assumption, she 
will never become a Cabinet minister. It would certainly be 
higher if she did.
<P>
	Then there is the hon. member for Souris-Moose 
Mountain-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I am quite 
disturbed that the member would make a personal attack on a 
member who is not here and impugn somehow that she has done 
something wrong.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> With the greatest of 
respect, that is not a point of order. I certainly listened to the 
remarks of the hon. member for Kindersley-Lloydminster and 
there was no reference to the presence or absence of any 
member. He was referring to the riding, which is the appropriate 
way to refer to members in the Chamber.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, this is certainly a very 
personal matter because the pension affects us. I am trying to 
abide by the rules of the House and I appreciate your 
consideration of that.
<P>
	Should Bill C-85 be passed by the House, the hon. member 
for Souris-Moose Mountain, a somewhat older member, would 
receive about a quarter of a million dollars.
<P>
	Then there is the hon. member for Prince Albert-Churchill 
River who is a much younger member. Should he live to be age 
75 he will receive $.83 million should he remain a backbencher 
for the rest of his career.
<P>
	The NDP and the Liberal MPs from Saskatchewan, there are 
about ten, would have benefits approximating $1 million each. 
They would siphon out of the taxpayers' pockets approximately 
$10 million.
<P>
	In Saskatchewan we are hard working, industrious and honest 
people. We work hard for our money and we are quite proud of 
what we have received as a result of our labours. I know beyond 
a shadow of a doubt that the people of Saskatchewan do not 
approve of the pension plan. I heard it wherever I went. I had 
calls and letters from people in my province thanking me for 
agreeing to opt out of the plan. They said I am doing the right 
thing. They have been very encouraging. It encourages me to 
plan the next election campaign not only for Saskatchewan but 
for the entire country, whenever the government has the nerve to 
call an election. We will go out there and bring more Reformers 
into the House who  will reject these types of unreasonable 
personal gains at the taxpayers' expense.
<P>
	I challenge Liberals from Saskatchewan to do the right thing 
and get out of the plan. They can, they have the option, they do 
not have to stay in the plan, not one of them. If they want to 
really please their constituents I know beyond a shadow of a 
doubt they have no choice but to get out of the pension plan. I 
commit to the House today to do everything in my power to keep 
them from being re-elected if they do not do the right thing and 
opt out of the plan.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Ringuette-Maltais (Madawaska-Victoria, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have been listening for a few hours to the 
remarks and sometimes even the flights of fancy of Reform 
members, and I would like to remind this House that the Reform 
Party is against employment equity, against the fact that this 
Parliament includes women and treats its members equitably.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I would 
like to make a comment about the hon. member's remarks that 
we are against women and looking after retirement-
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Again respectfully I say 
to the member for Beaver River that it is not a point of order. 
Certainly it could be a point of clarification or it could be a 
matter of debate but it is not a point of order.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The 
members of this House who have been here for more than a year 
should be quite familiar with parliamentary procedure. If the 
hon. member wishes to respond to my comments, she is 
welcome to do so, but not by rising on a question of privilege, as 
she just did.
<P>
	In the old days, members of Parliament belonged to the 
financial elite of Canadian society. The Canadian people 
eventually rebelled and decided that those showing leadership in 
each of their communities-regardless of social and financial 
status, age and gender-were entitled to adequate compensation 
for their work so that they could represent the people properly.
<P>
	In 1987, I was elected to the New Brunswick legislature for 
the first time at the age of 31. As in all the other legislatures, 
there is a pension plan for the people's representatives in the 
legislative assembly. In 1993, one year before having 
accumulated all the accrued credits for the Government of New 
Brunswick pension plan, I chose to run in the election to 
represent the people of Madawaska-Victoria in this 
Parliament.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13499"> 13499 </A></B>
<P>
	Unlike some Reform members, I do not have an already 
established provincial pension fund and cheques coming in 
every month. Neither do I have millions of dollars in the bank or 
an armed forces pension like certain Reform members. Judging 
by the hubbub coming from that direction, it sounds as if I hit a 
very raw nerve in some of my hon. colleagues.
<P>
	I would also like to remind this House that a Reform member 
who is a millionaire is rumoured to have said that members of 
Parliament, in Canada, are not paid what they are worth, and that 
they should be paid at least $150,000 per year. Again, whatever 
the topic of discussion, be it members's pensions, official 
languages or what not, there is this great flip flop. Name the 
topic, listen to the speeches, and you will notice this flip flop.
<P>
	I would like to come back to a very sensitive issue that I am 
committed to, and that is to ensure that, in any election, the 
people of Canada, from coast to coast, can vote freely, without 
social, financial or fiscal status considerations coming into play, 
for the person who can best represent them proudly and honestly 
in this place. It is the least we can do, as Canadian 
parliamentarians, for the people of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	I must say in all honesty that, as the member for 
Madawaska-Victoria, when I look at the work I am doing for 
the people I represent, I have no qualms of conscience 
whatsoever about the salary, pension or what not I get from the 
Parliament of Canada to serve the people of 
Madawaska-Victoria.
<P>
	I hope that, even though they are against employment equity, 
my hon. colleagues from the Reform Party, will be honest and 
recognize that. I would call upon the hon. member for 
Lethbridge in particular to rise in this House today and say: 
``Now that I am no longer a provincial member of Parliament, I 
relinquish the pension I earned as a MPP. I relinquish this money 
I am putting in my pocket every month right now''. I also call 
upon him to be true to what he believes in and honest with the 
people he represents.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
do not have much time left. I am not sure how much time it will 
take to try to talk some sense into this false debate.
<P>
	We have looked at the pension program that has gone on for 
years in this place. People stand and say: ``I have no problem 
with the pay that I get or with the pension that I am going to 
get''. May they realize that when they say they are worth it that 
is fine in their estimation; maybe they think they are worth it. 
We will see what the voters think they are worth at the polls the 
next time around.
<P>
	When we look at a pension plan which is simply seven times 
more generous than any public sector plan and four times more 
generous than any private sector plan, how in the world can 
anyone stand in their place and not be ashamed of it? Why are we 
any more special?
<P>
	Are we in favour of special status for some? No. That is why 
the Reform Party came to this place. We do not think groups of 
people should have special status. Yet we hear people inside this 
hall saying: ``We deserve it. We are worth it because we work 
hard''. It just does not add up.
<P>
	I see my friend from Edmonton East here. I want to make a 
comment about that. Is this person going to opt out? The 
government has allowed members of Parliament elected in 1988 
and forward to opt out. Why only some of us get the option to opt 
out I do not know, unless it is politically motivated. I am 
challenging her to opt out of the pension plan because she cannot 
sell it in downtown Edmonton. Our ridings abut. I challenge her 
to a debate in my riding or in hers. We will take on toe to toe. We 
will talk about this pension plan. I will bet my pension plan that 
she will not be able to sell it there.
<P>
	Not only that. I challenge my friend from Edmonton North as 
well who thinks that he is able to collect a plan. I am challenging 
him today, and I have some respect for him, to opt out of the plan 
because he will never sell it in Edmonton North.
<P>
	I am challenging my friend from Edmonton Northwest to opt 
out of the plan too because she has the option to opt out. She 
does not exactly have a huge healthy majority with which she 
slipped into this place. I think the last count officially was that it 
was by 11 votes that she came into this place. I challenge my 
friend from Edmonton Northwest to a debate, as I do my friends 
from Edmonton North and Edmonton East, in my riding or 
theirs. I will be happy to do it. I land in Edmonton every week at 
the Edmonton airport before I drive three hours home. I 
challenge her to a debate. I also challenge her to opt out of the 
plan willy-nilly, just do it. If ever she has a hope of getting 
re-elected, even with her cabinet money that she is able to throw 
into it, just do it. She should not just think about it but just do it. I 
ask her to come to Beaver River and have a debate, or I will go 
there and have a debate. I guarantee I will get off at the 
municipal airport. It is right handy there. Let us have a debate 
toe to toe.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	The longest serving MP in the House from Alberta is my 
friend from Edmonton Southeast for whom I have an incredible 
amount of respect. I am challenging him as well to opt out of the 
plan. There is no technical way he can do it because of the way 
the legislation is written. Only members elected in 1988 or 
beyond are able to do it. Edmonton Southeast, I will be there for 
a debate on the pension plan, or he can come to my riding, any 
<P>

<B><A NAME="13500"> 13500 </A></B>
<P>
place any time. I will get off the aeroplane in Edmonton. Let us 
have a debate and see how it goes.
<P>
	The member who just spoke before me tried somehow to drag 
in employment equity or the fact that as a woman I am hard done 
by in this place. There are many women in this place and there is 
no way they are able to justify the pension plan regardless of 
gender, race or ethnic background. Absolutely not.
<P>
	I am being heckled by two rookie female MPs. The third one is 
not making any comments at this point. However, as I stand here 
as a women I tell not only these members but every Canadian 
woman that I will make it on my own and that as a woman I do 
not need special treatment-
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. I would like to say first that I am not a rookie. Second, I 
have been challenged to-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> With the greatest of 
respect to all my colleagues, again this is not a point of order. All 
these matters might be taken up at another time and another 
place.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Mr. Speaker, try as they might through points of 
order, through heckling or whatever, let me rephrase my last 
statement. I am a woman in Canada and I am proud of that fact, 
but I do not need to claim any extra treatment or special status 
for the fact that I deserve somehow an MP pension. I do not.
<P>
	If we talk about employment equity, let me be equal with 
every other woman in the country who will receive a pension 
plan that is fair, just the way every other Canadian does it. I do 
not need that special treatment because I am a woman. Neither 
do they. It is as simple as that.
<P>
	Let me just finish by saying that I was disappointed in what I 
have seen in this debate. When I was listening to the debate as it 
was going on and when I heard time allocation being invoked 
today it made me sad. I sat and had coffee in the last Parliament. 
It was not with these rookies or first term members. You were 
there too, Mr. Speaker. We visited and said that if the Liberals 
got into power or if they became government next time we 
would not see the same arrogance we saw in the Mulroney years.
<P>
	I see someone standing to get my attention. I appreciate that 
so much but she is not being recognized. She should sit down 
and relax. I know this hurts.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I did not hear anyone 
asking to rise on a point of order. Unless the member for Beaver 
River has completed her remarks, I would not recognize anyone 
else on debate. 5:30 is coming up.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Mr. Speaker, 5:30 is coming up and so is the next 
election. I challenge all these people. I have watched the debate 
today and saw people trying to defend something which is 
simply indefensible. The Canadian public is watching today and 
I bet it is scandalized. Who pays for these pensions anyway? It is 
the people who are sending in tax money.
<P>
	They talk about: ``the government looking after me because 
don't you know I have given service, years, time and energy to 
this place''. Nobody forced me to do it. I chose to be here as did 
all of us, which was the best thing we could do. When we think 
about the people who are sending in every dollar of their tax 
money and financing this thing it is unbelievable.
<P>
	After question period this afternoon some farmer from the 
area-I do not even know who he was-brought a little 
truckload of piglets up here and there they were, Liberal MPs 
right in at the trough. It is terrible to have to denigrate a little 
piglet that way but that is the way it is.
<P>
	As I saw those little piglets I said to the interviewer: ``How do 
you feel about this?'' When I see Liberal members, because that 
is who is bringing this bill in and ramming it through, forcing 
this through, saying they deserve better, they think they are 
wonderful and it is unanimous; it is a pity to see them squealing 
and trying to justify this. With that the little piglet let out a 
squeal. It made me think I was sitting in the House of Commons. 
It is shameful and a price will be paid in the next election, 
believe me.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 5.30 p.m., the 
House will now proceed to the consideration of Private 
Members' Business, as listed on today's Order Paper.

	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.)</B> moved 
that Bill C-301, an act to amend the Criminal Code (violent 
crimes), be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, Bill C-301 is the culmination of a 
commitment I made to my constituents in Esquimalt-Juan de 
Fuca in 1993. I made a commitment to bring the bill forward in 
the interest of public safety for them and for all Canadians from 
coast to coast.
<P>
	I am disappointed the bill was not made votable considering 
the fact it has a precedent in the United States where it has been 
passed and enacted in over 26 states. It is commonly called the 
three strikes, you are out bill to deal with violent offenders, 
repeat violent offenders.
<P>
	The hallmarks of justice are the protection of society, 
restitution to the victim, rehabilitation and protection of the 
individual. The bill comes as the culmination of the public 
outrage I hear not only in my riding but from police officers 
across the land from coast to coast. It is an area where they feel 
the justice department does not protect them. It does not protect 
them from individuals who continually fly in the face of the 
norms of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13501"> 13501 </A></B>
<P>
human behaviour, instead exhibiting extreme human behaviours 
that show a total disregard for innocent people.
<P>
	Bill C-301 deals with those individuals who on three separate 
occasions commit a violent offence that will put them in jail for 
25 years without parole. Again, the purpose is to protect 
innocent civilians. Too often innocent civilians are not protected 
in society today.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, we seem to have two debate going on here which 
is very intriguing.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I wonder if I might 
seek the co-operation of members to take other business behind 
the curtains or outside the Chamber.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to read some statistics from the United States. 
According to the FBI index, this is very interesting-

	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Ringuette-Maltais (Madawaska-Victoria,

certain member who just came over here, tried to bully me 
around and actually physically pushed me. That is not the kind 
of respect we should receive in the House.
<P>
<B>(1735 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I am aware a conversation 
was going on. I say with the greatest respect to the hon. member 
for Madawaska-Victoria, who raised the point of order, I do not 
see it as a point of order. I am trying to think of another way that 
we may be able to deal with this point.
<P>
	I wonder if the Chair could be given some time to give some 
thought to the matter. I would encourage the member also to 
seek the guidance of the Speaker's office. We can return to this 
matter some other time. At this time, to the best of my 
knowledge and ability, I say respectfully, that I do not see a point 
of privilege.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think that-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Let us just take this very 
slowly. While I am standing you can speak all you want, but it is 
not being recorded. If there is something new to be added to the 
point of order I will listen but I hope we can be somewhat 
succinct and concise and the matter can be dealt with at the 
appropriate time in the appropriate fashion. I firmly believe at 
this time there is not a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member in 
question was the member for Beaver River and it was an assault 
on me.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Again, I do not rule that 
there is a point of privilege at this time. I will give an 
undertaking to the House that I will seek the guidance of the 
Speaker's office concerning the matter being raised. I encourage 
the parties involved to do likewise because I do not feel at this 
point, as far as I can judge, there is a point of order.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-301, an act to amend the Criminal Code (violent crimes), be 
read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I hope I will have the full 20 minutes due to me.
<P>
	The purpose of my bill is to protect innocent civilians. Too 
often in our justice system, as we have seen over the last few 
years, the rights of innocent civilians have often been 
subjugated to the rights of the criminal. The bill will give firmer 
sentencing guidelines to the courts because they are not being 
acted on as they should be.
<P>
	The definitions of the crimes involved in the bill are such that 
rape, attempted murder, sexual assault, manslaughter are all to 
be considered as serious offences committed if they are 
committed on three separate occasions in order to get a 
conviction and to have the three strikes and your are out bill 
applied.
<P>
	I will state a few facts from the United States and why I 
thought the bill should be votable and show how effective it has 
been down there.
<P>
	According to the FBI index high rate offenders commit almost 
18 times as many crimes per year, including two violent 
offences per year. The typical low rate offender commits one 
serious crime very two and a half years as compared to seven per 
year for high rate offenders. Thus, it is easy to see how an 
enhanced repeat offender law would actually work to the benefit 
of all citizens in our country. I hope this will be enacted in the 
future. I will give the House the opportunity to do that.
<P>
	Again, the benefits are for the protection of society, to deter 
repeat offenders and yes, to save money. The argument can be 
put forward in Canada that this is going to cost us more. I will 
show the House the bill will save the Canadian public a lot of 
money.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13502"> 13502 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	In the United States this bill was passed in over 26 states in 
various forms. The people have overwhelmingly voted for it, as 
they requested in my riding. They have shown an extreme cost 
benefit ratio in the order of $5 to $1. In other words, the cost of 
the bill and the management of it, has a cost saving of $5 to 
every $1 of implementation.
<P>
	The benefits come from decreasing repeat offences, the lack 
of victims, the decrease in costs of prosecutions, the decrease in 
costs of appeals, not to mention the overwhelming humanitarian 
aspects of saving innocent people from being subjected to 
violent offences.
<P>
	To this effect the preliminary reports from California and 
other states show that there has been a dramatic decrease in 
violent cases so far. I will give some examples.
<P>
	Governor Pete Wilson in California signed its bill in early 
1994. California has roughly the same number of people as we 
do in Canada. In the first nine months of its bill, California has 
shown a dramatic decrease in the number of violent offences.
<P>
	The argument that it will cost us a lot of money I do not think 
fares well. These statistics come from the states. It would be a 
benefit to the justice committee to actually look at this, do an 
analysis in Canada and determine once and for all whether we 
are going to derive a cost benefit from enacting this bill.
<P>
	The three strikes and you are out bill is not the only thing we 
can do because crime prevent is a multi-factorial endeavour. I 
will put forward some hard points, one after another. I hope the 
justice committee and the minister at least take heed of them.
<P>
	Integral to crime is crime prevention. In my experience 
working in jails both as a correctional officer and as a physician 
and those who have worked in jails and who have been in them 
say that crime prevention does not work.
<P>
	We have poured a lot of money into crime prevention but it 
has been ineffective. We have had a few cases when we have 
been effective in doing this but by and large, we do not get the 
best bang for our buck through this.
<P>
	In order for us to build a healthy society in wich individuals 
will not commit crime, our best prevention is building the pillars 
of a normal psyche to ensure people will not commit crimes in 
the future. It is not a guarantee, I admit, but it certainly is an 
insurance.
<P>
	We have to go back to early childhood education to ensure that 
children are being informed of what we consider to be normal 
understanding, what is normal conflict resolution. These things 
are very important.
<P>
	They must also learn what drug abuse, sexual abuse and all 
these things are. It is very important to train these children early 
because once they get into the teenage years, it is virtually 
impossible to teach them self-respect, respect for other people 
and appropriate conflict resolution techniques. These must 
occur early. We take this for granted but I would submit that 
many children are not learning this. They are not getting it in the 
home because many times the parents themselves do not know 
it.
<P>
	I hark back to an earlier speech that I made on an experiment 
performed at Columbia University where the parents were 
brought in with the children to teach them the building blocks of 
a normal psyche.
<P>
	Second, it is work for incarceration. There is no reason why 
individuals who are incarcerated cannot work for their upkeep. 
Use this in conjunction with skills training and it would also 
help decrease the recidivism rate, which is extremely high in our 
penal institutions.
<P>
	Third, we have worked in our party for putting capital 
punishment to a binding national referendum. Give people the 
choice whether they want capital punishment as a part of our 
society.
<P>
	Fourth, I ask every member in the House to support the private 
members' bill of the member for Surrey-White Rock-South 
Langley. That bill would enable lawmakers to actually keep 
individuals incarcerated who are deemed a danger to society on 
release.
<P>
<B>(1745 ) </B>
<P>
	Right now I can tell the House from personal experience that 
there are individuals who are dangerous to society and they are 
let go because the current laws do not enable the jails to keep 
them incarcerated if they are mentally competent. They can be 
deemed a dangerous offender at the time of sentencing, but not 
subsequent to that. That is what the private member's bill of the 
hon. member for Surrey-White Rock-South Langley will 
correct. In the interest of public safety, every member of the 
House should vote for it.
<P>
	I will mention some of the frustrations the police forces in the 
country have. I was speaking to a police officer not long ago and 
he said they should be telling every police officer who enters the 
force they have handcuffs and those handcuffs are the charter of 
rights and freedoms. The charter of rights and freedoms 
handcuffs our police officers from doing their job. I would ask 
that the House look at revoking the charter of rights and 
freedoms. We have a code of human rights, which protects the 
human rights of every individual, and that is adequate. It worked 
before the charter, it works now, and it will work in the future.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13503"> 13503 </A></B>
<P>
	The charter of rights and freedoms merely lets criminals and 
lawyers look for loopholes so that criminals can be released. 
Justice is somehow lost in the equation. Right and wrong are 
lost. They are lost and subjugated to legal points of order.
<P>
	For example, let us look at the Paul Bernardo case, which is 
now being heard. It never ceases to amaze me that in this case, 
where we have an individual who on videotape has been shown 
committing the most heinous of acts, we have to go through a 
four-month to six-month court case. Why are we doing it? 
Because the defence is looking for procedural irregularities that 
will let this individual off. Is that right? If it happens in this case 
it will happen in other cases.
<P>
	This murder case is very interesting, because it brings a 
number of other issues to the fore. I again ask the minister to 
look at the aspects of the videotapes that have been presented in 
this case. Was it fair to the families? Was it fair for them to have 
to fight with their own money to prevent those videotapes from 
being shown publicly? It is not a right of the public or of the 
media to have access to those videotapes. They can only be used 
to hurt and harm the families, who have already been 
victimized. There is no law to protect them right now.
<P>
	I ask the minister to look at this case and to enact legislation 
that would protect the victimized families in the future. We do 
not want a repeat of the situation being faced by the families of 
Kristen French and Leslie Mahaffy.
<P>
	I would look at revising procedures in the courtroom. 
Currently justice in our courtrooms grinds to a halt. Part of that 
has to do with adjournments. Defence and prosecution alike 
continually put forth adjournments that make court cases so 
long they are eventually dropped and the accused persons go 
free because too much time has passed. I ask the minister to look 
at this and determine how many adjournments are allowed for a 
person to have a fair case. We could look at limiting 
adjournments.
<P>
	Another aspect is disclosure. We need fair and honest 
disclosure by both the defence and prosecution.
<P>
	Another aspect is the use of preliminary hearings. They are 
much abused. Preliminary hearings in cases such as murder 
trials are not required. All that happens is that the same evidence 
is repeated. There would be a significant cost saving if 
preliminary hearings were eliminated in certain cases.
<P>
	With respect to the Young Offenders Act, we should publish 
the names of young offenders. I know from working in a young 
offender penal institution that many of them think it is a joke. 
There is little or no deterrence to prevent young offenders from 
continuing to commit acts against innocent victims. There is 
very little punishment and there is very little deterrence. One 
simple thing that can be done is to publish the names of those 
young offenders who are committing these acts.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	Another aspect I would like to bring out is that in my 
experience in working with young offenders the recidivism rate 
is extremely high. It costs us almost $100,000 per young 
offender per year to keep them incarcerated. Yet the recidivism 
rate is over one-third. That patently speaks for itself. It does not 
work. We need to look at a different model.
<P>
	We need to pull young offenders out of these closed custody 
cases of putting them in for three months or six months. After 
that they go back to the same environment they were in before. 
We cannot undo 12, 14, 15 years of being in a situation that is 
patently self-destructive where they have witnessed sexual 
abuse or have been a victim of sexual abuse, violence, drugs, 
alcohol abuse, and expect them to be changed in three months or 
six months of closed custody. No matter how much counselling 
you put forth, it simply is not going to work.
<P>
	Why do we not look at putting them in closed custody camps 
away from cities? There are some examples in northern British 
Columbia. We should put them away not for a few months but 
for a year or two years and focus on them working for their 
incarceration, focus on education, focus on skills, focus on 
discipline, focus on them learning the skills necessary for them 
to work as productive members of society. They are certainly 
not learning it now in the youth areas we have.
<P>
	Legal aid is the fastest growing aspect of our justice system 
now. There are many abuses in it. I ask the justice committee to 
look at the legal aid situation we have now, look at the abuse that 
is taking place, and look of ways of changing that. If we are 
pouring money into this we are taking money away from the 
other functional aspects of justice.
<P>
	Gun registration does not work. It has never worked 
anywhere. It is not going to work in the future. It will take 
money away from the functional aspects of justice and put it into 
an area that simply is proven not to work. This will be counter to 
what the minister intends; it will make our streets less safe than 
they are. That was not the intent. I plead with the hon. minister 
to not enact this legislation and please listen to what we have 
been saying in the Reform Party. Enact the good laws that are to 
be in that bill against those who are committing criminal acts 
with firearms, but please do not make our streets less safe by 
enacting gun registration. It will not work.
<P>
	In summary, the three strikes and you are out bill is but one 
arm of what we can do to make our streets safer. The purpose of 
the bill is to get violent offenders, those individuals who have 
proven to show a flagrant disregard for innocent civilians, off 
the streets and protect society.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13504"> 13504 </A></B>
<P>
	We in Parliament have to stand up for the innocent civilians. 
We have to stand up for their rights. We have to ensure their 
rights will not be subjugated to the rights of the criminal. That 
has been going on for too long. It cannot continue to go on. We 
must ensure innocent people will be protected. That is the 
purpose of justice now. It is the purpose of justice in the future.
<P>
	With permission, Mr. Speaker, I ask for unanimous consent of 
the House to make my bill, Bill C-301, votable.
<P>
<B>(1755 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, I do not want to 
take up much of the House's time. Earlier I was named by the 
member for Madawaska-Victoria.
<P>
	After the pension debate I did go over. I had challenged 
members to a debate, so I went over and we did have a rather 
heated discussion, I must confess to that. The member told me 
that I was not worth what I thought I was worth and that we could 
have a debate any time. That was fine. Then when we got rather 
heated she turned around to go back to her seat after she had 
called me a name and I just grabbed her and said ``Come on, be 
real''. I thought she was tripping off the step.
<P>
	As I was named, I thought I should get up and say that this is 
ridiculous. Let us move on with the country's business.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I say respectfully to both 
parties I ruled at the time and continue to rule it is not a point of 
order.
<P>
	Let us go back to the matter of the private members' hour and 
the motion from the member for Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, who 
at the end of his intervention was asking the House for 
unanimous consent to make his motion votable.
<P>
	Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Resuming debate, the 
hon. member for Halifax West.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Geoff Regan (Halifax West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I agree 
with some but certainly not all of the comments of the hon. 
member for Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca.
<P>
	We should look at what Bill C-301 does. First, it would apply 
when an accused has two previous convictions for any of the 15 
offences listed in the bill. Bill C-301 eliminates discretion of 
the court in sentencing the offender for the commission of a 
serious indictable offence.
<P>
	I understand that violence in our society is an important 
problem, and I do not disagree with the intent here, but let us 
look at this for a moment. This response has some 
attractiveness; it is certainly simple and seems to be a very clear 
response. Is it the right answer to this problem?
<P>
	It is true that all human institutions have human failings, so 
our courts are not perfect. However, by and large, if I read 
through decisions and look into the depth of the cases, I and 
most people also would find the same things, that we agree with 
the sentences if we actually have all the facts before us. One 
problem is that very often we only have a few very simple and 
limited facts about the case and the decision. Sometimes it 
seems the simplest answer is sometimes also the wrong answer.
<P>
	It is noteworthy that all the offences listed in this bill already 
carry the maximum sentence of life imprisonment. In other 
words, the judge already has the power to impose life sentences 
for any one of these offences, let alone for three. Although he 
does not have to, he has the authority to do so, and to take into 
account various factors in deciding on the appropriate sentence. 
This reflects the basic principle of let the punishment fit the 
crime. And it should. It means the key decision maker in 
matching the penalty to the crime is the individual who was 
there to see the case and all the facts of the case, the judge.
<P>
	I know we will hear the argument that a pattern of three 
serious offences is enough to prove that an automatic life 
sentence does fit the crime, or at least the pattern of crime. To 
make a life sentence mandatory for offences other than murder 
or treason is a significant and I think ill-advised departure from 
our criminal law.
<P>
	The Criminal Code currently provides for a mandatory life 
sentence for first or second degree murder or for high treason. 
There are other mandatory minimum sentences, but they are the 
exception in our criminal law. Mandatory life sentences are 
extremely rare.
<P>
	I refer my colleagues to the report of the Canadian Sentencing 
Commission, ``Sentencing Reform in Canada: The Canadian 
Approach'', chapter eight, in which the commission opposed 
mandatory minimum sentences on the grounds that they 
diminish the role of the judge and can therefore result in 
arbitrary punishment and other inequities.
<P>
	As an alternative to mandatory minimum sentences, the 
commission set out a number of sentencing principles, including 
this statement at page 154 of its report:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The paramount principle governing the determination of a sentence is that 
the sentence be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of 
responsibility of the offender for the offence.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1800 ) </B>
<P>
	It seems to me that is as it should be. From Bill C-41, the 
sentencing bill now before the House, I refer to section 718(1): 
``A sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence 
and the degree of responsibility of the offender''. The 
government is already adding that provision to the law with Bill 
C-41.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13505"> 13505 </A></B>
<P>
	The reason for not removing the court's discretion to 
determine the sentence length is both sound and 
straightforward. The court should have the ability to consider 
both aggravating and mitigating factors that will help the 
criminal justice process impose the punishment that fits the 
crime.
<P>
	The sentencing commission report sets out a long list of such 
aggravating factors at page 320, including the use of violence in 
the crime, existence of previous convictions, a manifestation of 
excessive cruelty toward the victim and other factors. Bill C-41 
similarly acknowledges the importance of aggravating and 
mitigating factors in sentencing.
<P>
	It is apparent with respect to the offences listed in the bill the 
court already has the authority to consider past offences as 
aggravating factors and to impose a life sentence for any of the 
offences listed in this bill.
<P>
	The hon. member has tried to confine his three strikes model 
to a limited number of indictable offences and thereby avoid 
some of the excesses of the American statutes. He has succeeded 
only in narrowing the focus of Criminal Code offences that 
already carry a maximum life sentence.
<P>
	Supporters of the bill will argue it is the pattern of offending 
that makes the difference, that requires this drastic change in our 
approach to sentencing. Let us examine the objectives of 
sentencing. One of the purposes of criminal law is denunciation 
through punishment. Nothing is achieved from the point of view 
of punishment by making a life sentence mandatory for three 
offences as opposed to allowing the court to consider all 
relevant factors in imposing sentence which can be life for any 
of the 15 listed offences. It seems likely such a pattern of repeat 
offending would lead the court to consider a very long sentence 
for any of these serious crimes.
<P>
	The other purposes of sentencing include deterrence and the 
long term protection of society against criminals likely to 
reoffend. From this perspective, Bill C-301 casts too wide a net 
in its indiscriminate approach to patterns of offending. Would it 
not be better to tailor a law to the actual conduct that shows a 
likelihood of reoffending violently? Can we not focus on the 
circumstances of the offence, on the offender's mental state, on 
the brutality of his actions, all factors that evidence a continuing 
threat to the community?
<P>
	We have such a law found in part 24 of the Criminal Code, 
dangers offender sections. This part specifically allows the 
court to impose an indeterminate sentence for a pattern of 
serious personal injury offences as defined in section 752 as 
follows:
<P>
An indictable offence, other than high treason, treason, first degree murder or 
second degree murder, involving, (i) the use or attempted use of violence against 
another person, or
<P>
(ii) conduct endangering or likely to endanger the life or safety of another person 
or inflicting or likely to inflict psychological damage upon another person, and 
for which the offender may be sentenced to imprisonment for ten years or more.
<P>
	A number of particular sexual offences are also included in 
the definition. This approach to patterns of offending allows the 
court to link past offences and violent conduct to a prediction 
that the offender constitutes a threat to the life, safety or 
physical or mental well-being of other persons.
<P>
	The court is also required to hear psychiatric evidence and 
dangerous offender hearings allow both the prosecution and the 
defence to introduce evidence about the potential threat posed 
by the offender to the community. Those are good opportunities 
to hear what threat there is and the reasons for a long sentence. 
This structured approach contrasts with the automatic life 
sentence this bill would impose.
<P>
	I recommend we let the courts do their job. The Criminal 
Code already provides for life sentences for these 15 crimes and 
additionally sets out a dangerous offender procedure which 
targets patterns of violence and links such patterns to 
predictions of violent reoffending.
<P>

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
are back in the jurassic era. The Reform Party, particularly the 
hon. member for Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, has outdone itself. 
Did his riding's proximity to California have such a major 
impact on the hon. member? Bill C-301 is nothing but a 
substitute for California's ``three strikes and you are out'' law.
<P>
	I understand that the professional baseball strike lasted a long 
time and that fans missed the action. But to introduce 
professional sports rules into criminal law is something else. 
This is the figment of a wild, even dangerous imagination.
<P>
	I asked myself what could possibly have inspired the hon. 
member for Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca. Certainly not inmate 
rehabilitation, crime prevention or community integration 
programs. What then? The answer is simple. There was no need 
for me to rack my brains. It is repression. One of the inquisition 
party's favourite phrases is, ``Let us lock up criminals and throw 
away the key''.
<P>
	If they are to be believed, we have been in a full-blown crisis 
for a long time. The true crisis is the disinformation crisis which 
has been in effect since the Reform Party was elected. Its 
members make questionable comments on crime in this country, 
manipulate statistics, and engage in scaremongering. Their 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13506"> 13506 </A></B>
<P>
anecdotes are isolated cases that do not reflect the  reality 
around us. They try to make cheap political capital out of tragic 
situations.
<P>
	I remember that, just recently, the hon. member for Crowfoot 
exploited the tragedy that took place here in Ottawa, in which 
two young children were shot and killed by their father, who 
used a hunting rifle, as their seven-year old brother looked on 
helplessly. Imagine that, while talking about gun control, the 
hon. member from the Reform Party had the gall to say that gun 
registration could not have prevented that tragedy.
<P>
	It could certainly be said that the Reform member is a whiz at 
recycling news, but has no regard for the pain and suffering of 
survivors. This is how the Reform Party deals with the events 
affecting us.
<P>
	The same analogy can be applied to the hon. member for 
Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca's explanations regarding Bill C-301. 
The recipe is simple. Take some nice fat jailbirds. Add some 
spicy tabloid news and a few drops of exaggeration. Brush with 
empty rhetoric, taking care of never letting any rehabilitation 
into the mixture. Mix all ingredients together, hoping that your 
audience is so confused that it might agree with you.
<P>
	If I am being cynical on such a serious subject, it is because I 
want to show how distorted the examples used by Reform 
members are. According to the inquisition member, parole 
standards should be abolished, and we should treat offenders 
like cattle by cramming them into correctional institutions that 
are already overcrowded.
<P>
	Let us now look at the Reform member's source of 
inspiration. California's ``three strikes'' law went into effect 
last year. This law provides for very harsh sentences against any 
repeat offender already convicted twice of relatively serious 
offences.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	Like Bill C-301, California law requires the judge who 
convicts a person for the third time to sentence this person to life 
imprisonment without possibility of parole for 25 years. Think 
for a moment how outrageous such a legislation would be. The 
judges will no longer have any latitude, since the act is taking 
away any discretion they used to have. Sooner or later, this is 
bound to lead to absurd decisions.
<P>
	Let me illustrate this with an example. In March, a 27-year 
old man was prosecuted for stealing a slice of pizza from a group 
of teenagers and sentenced to life imprisonment. The facts are 
quite simple: he stole a slice of pizza from a group of young 
people between the ages of 4 and 14 in a restaurant in Redondo 
Beach, California.
<P>
	Because he had a record and was therefore a repeat offender, 
the offender came under the three strikes act and the judge had 
no other choice but to sentence him to life imprisonment without 
any chance of parole for 25 years.
<P>
	That is the logic behind the proposal made by the hon. 
member for Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca. Repression and 
punishment are the only two ways the Reform Party has found to 
control crime. With legislation like the bill introduced by my 
Reform colleague, what happened at Redondo Beach could well 
happen here; the situation may not be as absurd, but it could be 
just as dangerous. It is more than likely that a 19-year old 
offender would be sentenced to life for robbing a convenience 
store. In fact, robbery is included in the list of offences 
mentioned in the schedule proposed in Bill C-301.
<P>
	Let us look at the type of offences for which three convictions 
would buy a one-way ticket to the pen for a very long time. 
There is piracy, hijacking, endangering safety of aircraft in 
flight, using explosives. Whatever my hon. colleague's views on 
the matter, these offences are already liable to life 
imprisonment.
<P>
	I find it hard to imagine that someone would be able to 
commit this type of offence three times in his or her miserable 
life, as he or she could have been sentenced to life twice already 
before committing a third offence.
<P>
	I have nothing to say about the other offences listed, except 
maybe to mention that they are generally considered disgusting 
and reprehensible. I cannot overlook however the case of 
robbery. This offence is on the fateful schedule. Its inclusion 
will cause such prison overcrowding that it is hard to predict the 
implications. Again, this is an offence already liable to life 
imprisonment. But very few individuals serve full sentences 
because, objectively, the seriousness of such an offence does not 
justify life imprisonment.
<P>
	If the circumstances surrounding the offence did warrant such 
severe punishment, Bill C-301 would indeed be superfluous, 
since the offender would already have been sentenced for life. 
How many life sentences can one serve consecutively? As far as 
I know, unlike cats, we only have one life.
<P>
	The schedule of offences provided for under this bill lists 15 
or so major offenses. Naturally, I would have no sympathy for 
any individual sentenced three times for any of them. Quite the 
contrary, I am of the opinion that repeat offenders do not deserve 
preferential treatment, but it is a different matter altogether to 
put them away in penitentiaries under the pretext that this makes 
our streets safer. Society will always be better served in the end 
through rehabilitation programs suited to the various offenses. 
Close supervision is the key.
<P>
	Too many offenders were paroled before they were ready to 
reintegrate society and went on to commit a subsequent offence.
<P>

<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	Increasing the prison population will necessarily increase the 
related costs. Will the hon. member have the honesty to tell 
taxpayers how much his bill will cost us? We know that the 
average cost of keeping an inmate in a maximum security 
institution in 1992-1993 was as much as $56,000.
<P>
	It is my opinion that the three strikes, you are out rule should 
apply to hon. members in the House: after tabling three bills like 
the one before us today, an hon. member should automatically 
be sent home for life.

like to inform you that if the Chair determines that this is a <I>bona

motion to refer the issue to the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to refer to Erskine May's <I>Treatise on The Law, 
Privileges, Proceedings and Usage of Parliament</I>, 21st edition, 
p. 126: molestation, reflections and intimidation.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is a contempt to molest a member of either House while attending the 
House, or coming to or going from it. The Commons on 12 April 1733 and the 
Lords on 17 May 1765, resolved `That the assaulting, insulting or menacing any 
member of this House, in his coming to or going from the House, or upon the 
account of his behaviour in Parliament, is a high infringement of the privilege of 
this House, a most outrageous and dangerous violation of the rights of 
Parliament and a high crime and misdemeanour', and on 6 June 1780 the 
Commons resolved `That it is a gross breach of the privilege of this House for 
any person to obstruct and insult the members of this House in the coming to, or 
the going from the House, and to endeavour to compel members by force to 
declare themselves in favour of, or against any proposition then depending or 
expected to be brought before the House'.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It goes on to say in the second paragraph:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>To molest members on account of their conduct in Parliament is also a 
contempt. Correspondence with members of an insulting character in reference 
to their conduct in Parliament or reflecting on their conduct as members, 
threatening a member with the possibility of a trial-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Earlier this afternoon after the speech by the member for 
Beaver River, I went to talk with my colleague from Mississauga 
South. At that time the member for Beaver River came over and 
challenged me to a debate in my riding. She wanted to know 
when I was available. I said I  was probably available all 
summer, that I would be in my riding. She said she would be 
contacting my office.
<P>
	Afterward in the discussions, I reinforced what I had said 
earlier in my speech that as the federal representative for the 
population of Madawaska-Victoria in regard to the 
remuneration, the pension and whatever other compensation 
Parliament allocates to me, I truly believe that I am worth it. It is 
her problem if she does not believe that she is worth it. The 
discussion escalated to a point where, Mr. Speaker, I think you 
rose.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	At the same time, the whip from the Reform Party came 
behind the curtains and told us to bring the level of discussion 
down. I told the whip to take the member for Beaver River away 
from where I was standing. I turned to go back to my seat. It was 
not a question of my falling; I was turning to go back to my seat 
in order to end that discussion. At that time the member grabbed 
me by the arm.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I have been a parliamentarian since 1987. I have 
never, either in the House where I was sitting, outside the House 
or in my riding, ever received any such physical threat.
<P>
	I do wish, Mr. Speaker, that you will be ruling on this as soon 
as possible because I find that absolutely no member in this 
House, whether a man or a woman, should be assaulted 
physically. I was sent here to speak my views and the views of 
my constituents. That is what Parliaments are all about, to speak 
and to discuss. This is not a boxing match. I do wish that you will 
rule very soon on this point of privilege.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do 
hope we can address this now and clear it up just as quickly as 
possible.
<P>
	The member is right. I did go over and we did have a rather 
heated exchange about whether I would come to her riding. 
When she told me to get out of here and my whip said to call it 
off, she told me to get real and to get out of here. She said that 
she turned around to go back to her seat and she did. However, as 
it was a heated exchange, she did turn around. I was on one step 
higher than she was and she whirled around and I grabbed her 
elbow and said: ``Come on, let's be reasonable here''.
<P>
	I do apologize for that. I certainly did not mean any harm or 
assault. I am twice her size. It is just foolishness to think that. I 
do apologize if she thought there was any intention of an assault. 
However, this is now on the floor of the House of Commons. I 
might just mention that in my short discussion of this afterward, 
and it seems unfortunate that we have to take up House time with 
this, the member for Huron-Bruce said: ``I was here and this is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13508"> 13508 </A></B>
<P>
crazy. I cannot support her in this. This is hardly what we would 
call an assault''.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, again I publicly say that is what happened. I 
absolutely meant no harm or any threat as the member has said. 
We need to get on with this. Again, I do accept the challenge she 
has issued to me. I certainly would be willing to go down to her 
riding and will be in contact with her staff to see if we can get a 
good political debate going. Or she is certainly welcome to 
come to Beaver River and we will talk about that.
<P>
	The issue here is the fact that I did take her arm but it was 
certainly not a threat. It was something that just happened. 
When she whirled around in a great hurry I did grab her right 
elbow and I certainly acknowledge that. I appreciate the fact that 
we can move forward from this. Certainly when we get into the 
heat of political debate, it is unfortunate it is the MP pension 
plan which escalated to this height. However, I trust that we can 
certainly put this behind us now and move forward.
<P>
<B>(1825 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on the 
same point of privilege, I willl make some comments as I was a 
witness to what occurred in this incident.
<P>
	I did go over and I noticed you were standing. I asked the two 
members to lower their voices because it was getting a little bit 
loud and it was hard for other members to listen to the debate 
that was going on.
<P>
	The member for Madawaska-Victoria is going to great 
lengths to build a case. I believe with all due respect, and I do not 
want to any way diminish her concerns that she was not treated 
with respect, but the exchange I heard was on an equal basis. 
Whatever level it was at, it was on an equal basis.
<P>
	There was no molestation with respect to her reference from 
1780. Also there was no assault. There was no physical threat. 
The comment I did hear, and I saw what was happening, was to 
get her out of here and whatever. The member for Beaver River I 
thought just grabbed her arm and said: ``Come on''. Let us 
smarten up kind of thing is the impression I got from that 
comment.
<P>
	The debate did heat up to a high exchange. I think both 
members have an extremely different point of view on the 
pension plan. I recommend both members recognize they have a 
severe difference of opinion and that with respect they basically 
agree to disagree.
<P>
	For you, Mr. Speaker, to have to rule on this, I think you 
should hear from anyone else who wishes to contribute. I do 
know the member for Huron-Bruce was present as a witness. 
He can speak for himself as to what he saw.
<P>
	In my humble opinion, with it being my responsibility to 
make sure that members do respect each other, I know they 
disagreed, but in my opinion there was no assault, no physical 
threat. There was no intent to injure. There was no intent for 
bodily harm. I really believe it was a war of words and that was 
it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
not a matter of what was being debated. One hon. member as a 
result of the debate in the House was not satisfied. She had made 
her points wanted to carry on and did come to this spot. I was 
sitting here beside where the event took place between the two 
members.
<P>
	There is a very important point to clarify. I agree fully with 
the facts as laid out by the hon. member. Her comment was to the 
Reform Party whip, not to the member as the member said. The 
member is incorrect. The member for Madawaska-Victoria 
had indicated to the Reform Party whip to get her out of here 
because I had got your attention, Mr. Speaker, to rise because of 
the sound level of the conversation. The member was clearly 
aware that it was not going anywhere and tried to leave the 
conversation. She very calmly tried to leave the conversation, at 
which point the member for Beaver River in all fairness and with 
due respect for the member, was not going to allow the matter to 
finish and wanted to impose her position even further on the 
member.
<P>
	I was quite disturbed with the whole incident. Although I am 
not a lawyer my impression of what went on here was that the 
member for Beaver River had come to harass and impose herself 
upon the member who has made this complaint and was not 
prepared to let it go until she had won and imposed her view. I 
think that is the issue before us. There was a physical contact. 
There was an attempt to carry on something the member clearly 
wanted to just get out of.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, if I may, hopefully in order to establish good 
harmony between members, I would ask if the House could not 
see the clock for ten minutes or so in order that we can end the 
conversation. I think it would be helpful for the House as a 
whole to sit an extra ten minutes to conclude the matter.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Colleagues, given the 
seriousness of the matter it certainly would be my intention to 
hear whatever additional information might ultimately assist the 
Chair in this matter, and I will not see the clock.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to bring a few points 
to the attention of the Chair.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="13509"> 13509 </A></B>
<P>
	First, I was in the House some years ago when an incident of 
molestation was raised. It was a dispute between the member of 
Parliament for York South-Weston and the then member of 
Parliament from Winnipeg, the late Mr. Dan McKenzie. The 
Speaker will perhaps recall that incident, or the records of the 
House will remind him of it. Essentially, it was a debate that 
eventually ended in one member physically attempting to do 
something to another member, which is certainly not in 
conformity with our usual practices in the House.
<P>
	There are, not only in Beauchesne but as well in Erskine May, 
a number of cases of what are referred to as the molestation of 
members while in the execution of their duties. Not only is there 
the case of 1780, which has been mentioned, but perhaps more 
importantly for the Speaker is the following. There is reference 
in Erskine May's 19th edition at page 149 to cases of 
punishment of members and others for molestation of members. 
In other words, these are cases of members against members 
within the precincts of the House. I could name a series of these 
cases, but I will name the Franklyn case, the Mompesson case, 
Holt, Gourlay, and so on, which refer to disputes between hon. 
members inside the Chamber itself.
<P>
	The point I am making, without judging this case, is that the 
Speaker has in the past determined that this kind of an incident, 
depending on the severity of it, was deemed to be punishable by 
an action of the House. Therefore, it is, at least prima facie, 
something for the Speaker to consider as being important, and it 
falls under the general rubric, in Erskine May's 19th edition, not 
only of breaches of privileges but also under the rubric of 
contempt of Parliament. I bring this to your attention because of 
these two important points.
<P>
	Finally, there is the whole issue of privilege generally, which 
is what enables us to function, not only as parliamentarians 
individually, but collectively. This definition of privilege is 
found on page 67 of Erskine May's 19th edition. In other words, 
all of us as parliamentarians have a fundamental right and a 
fundamental expectation that we will all be able to stand in the 
House and say whatever we feel we must say on behalf of those 
who sent us here, without fear, worry or concern that anything 
will stop us, threaten us, or otherwise make it such that we 
would be hampered in that capacity. That is a fundamental 
principle, which is necessary for all of us to be able to represent 
our fellow constituents in this highest court in the land, the 
Parliament of our country.
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	So, if we are to all enjoy this privilege and represent not only 
properly but without fear of reprisal all that may be said in this 
House, it goes without saying that the threat cannot be tolerated.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The best case to be made for that is surely the fact that no 
member of Parliament could ever be brought before a court of 
law for saying anything in the House. The reason that is there is 
to ensure that there is no libel chill, to ensure that no one can 
threaten to sue an MP for something said in the House. The 
reason that is there is to give any member of Parliament the total 
freedom from fear of any kind in order to represent constituents.
<P>
	For the same reason, it is important, and I would argue 
essential, that we be able to speak not only in the House in a way 
that does not have in it libel chill, but free of any kind of 
molestation or retribution on the part of anyone within 
Parliament as well as coming to and leaving the Parliament. 
That has been established, as I indicated previously, for 
centuries.
<P>
	I do not want to belabour that point. I thought it was an 
important consideration for the Chair to take into account. I 
hope it will assist the Speaker in deliberating on this important 
issue.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Colleagues, certainly the 
matter raised before the House is a serious matter.
<P>
	I begin by acknowledging and thanking all those members 
who participated in the sharing of information and precedents. 
That will assist the Chair in arriving at a decision.
<P>
	I will take this matter under advisement. Again, I thank the 
members for their information and their participation. We will 
deal with the matter in the most respectful and the most just 
fashion possible.
<P>
	I would like now to return to the business of the House during 
private members' hour. I believe the hon. member for Edmonton 
Southwest was seeking the floor.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">*  *  * </H4>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CRIMINALCODE">CRIMINAL CODE</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-301, an act to amend the Criminal Code (violent crimes), be 
read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, for the benefit of those viewers tuning in who thought 
they had somehow switched into the O.J. trial, we are talking 
about a private member's bill that would have the effect of 
saying that for serious violent crimes perpetrators would have 
three strikes and they are out.
<P>
	Again for the benefit of those just viewing, it is interesting to 
see how confrontations brew and exist and happen in life. They 
can happen right here. They can happen everywhere in life, 
some more violent than others.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="13510"> 13510 </A></B>
<P>
	Here we have a situation of three strikes and you are out. In 
my view this started in California where people said one day: 
``We have to do something about this crime situation we have. 
Perpetrators do not seem to get punished for it. We have to 
somehow set the stage so that people know there is an ultimate 
sanction for doing wrong''.
<P>
	People who have spoken against the notion of three strikes say 
wait a minute, what is wrong with one strike and you are out? 
Why should we allow three strikes? Why should it not be one 
strike and you are out?
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
	There is a good deal of validity to this because when I agreed 
to speak to this bill, I refreshed my memory on some of the 
articles I read about, three strikes and you are out.
<P>
	One of the things I read was with the three strikes and you are 
out law in place, very often a perpetrator would have absolutely 
nothing to lose when making that third offence because the third 
strike was life.
<P>
	While I am speaking in support of the bill and in support of my 
colleague, I do so in the full understanding there is a good deal 
of reservation among those who support the bill and who do not 
support the bill but for very different reasons.
<P>
	The one thing people have in common when they are talking 
about this is the motivation to get us into a three strikes and you 
are out bill in the first place. There seems to be a sense of 
frustration with the criminal justice system in that there does not 
seem to be the kind of sanctions against wrongdoing which 
would prevent more wrongdoing.
<P>
	It is almost as though society has become inured to the fact 
that there are people who are not good citizens, that we are 
prepared to accept antisocial behaviour and violent behaviour 
and say this is a fact of life and we have to accept it.
<P>
	If we society take that view then the member is right, we will 
have to accept it because we will get a lot more of it. This bill 
speaks to that motivation in society at large saying do something 
about it.
<P>
	An earlier speaker suggested perhaps incarceration was not 
the answer but then, what is? If incarceration does not make the 
perpetrator better, at least it protects citizens.
<P>
	Our responsibility as legislators is to put the rights of the 
victims ahead of the rights of the criminals. The balance of 
doubt has to lie in favour of the innocent victim. The balance of 
doubt should no longer lie in favour of the perpetrator.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before the member for 
Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca can seek the floor again, recognizing 
he has already spoken to his motion, and before I can consider 
right of reply I must first seek if anyone else in the House wishes 
to participate.
<P>
	Under right of reply the member for Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca 
will be the last person to speak. No one else will be entitled to 
speak after his intervention. Is that agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank everybody who made an intervention on the bill, wittingly 
or unwittingly, particularly my friend from Edmonton 
Southwest who was kind enough to second the bill and speak 
eloquently on it.
<P>
	I will address some of the concerns. We hate to admit it but 
there are people who have a total and utter disrespect for life and 
other people. They offend and reoffend again and again. The 
purpose of this three strikes and you are out bill, Bill C-301, was 
to protect innocent civilians from those individuals who by their 
actions have shown a complete disregard for society.
<P>
	These individuals are not rehabilitatable because they have 
had their chance. The hon. member from the government made 
some very good points. He said we have in our courts right now 
sentences for offences in this bill. However, these sentences are 
not being applied by our courts. That is one of the primary 
purposes of the bill.
<P>
	If the courts were enacting these sentences, if they were 
applying the available sentences to the individuals who were 
committing these violent acts against innocent civilians, we 
would not need this bill. We would not have needed in the United 
States and we would not need it here. The reality of life is we do 
need it because the courts are failing to enact those laws already 
there.
<P>
	Whether we are speaking about these violent offences or the 
use of firearms in committing offences, they are not being 
applied. People commit firearms offences and they have those 
offences plea bargained away to get an expeditious conviction 
on another offence. That is not law, that is not justice, that is not 
protecting innocent civilians, which is why I proposed this.
<P>
	I also put forth reasons the bill is good for Canada why it 
would be cost effective. I hope the justice minister, members on 
the committee and members of the House take it upon 
themselves to look at enacting a three strikes and you are out bill 
or a modification thereof for the safety of all Canadians.
<P>
	The member from the Bloc Quebecois mentioned throwing 
the key away. I ask her and anybody else who disagrees with it to 
go into jails to speak with individuals who have committed 
many offences and to speak to the victims of violent offences. 
They will have a different opinion.
<P>
	I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this bill be referred to the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal 
Affairs and that accordingly the bill be withdrawn.</BLOCKQUOTE>
