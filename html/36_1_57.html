</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Eglinton—Lawrence, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to inform the House and all Canadians that February 
is Heart Awareness Month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cardiovascular disease remains Canada's leading cause of death 
and one of the major causes of disability.  More than 79,000 
Canadians die every year from heart disease and stroke.  Besides 
the human toll of the disease, the cost to the economy is 
considerable: about $20 billion per year and more than 6.5 
million days of hospitalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cardiovascular disease is an area where we are making major 
health gains.  The roots of heart disease and stroke are in the 
way we live.  By eradicating smoking, promoting a healthy diet 
and physical activity we can help Canadians in preventing and<I>or 
postponing the onset of this disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada is proud to be collaborating with the Heart and 
Stroke Foundation of Canada and with all provincial health 
departments in the Canadian heart health initiative. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By investing in cardiovascular health, we can considerably

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the fisheries minister claims he cannot release vital 
observer reports that show foreign fishing activities, legitimate 
or otherwise, off our east coast.  He claims he would be breaking 
the law to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister also claims there are no foreign trawlers fishing 
off the coast of Labrador.  He claims there is no salmon crisis 
on Canada's west coast.  He claims he has every right to continue 
the aboriginal fishing strategy when the court has declared it 
illegal.  He claims bureaucracy does not interfere with DFO 
science. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is consistent in at least two respects.  First, he 
is dead wrong.  Second, his claims do not reflect the facts as 
known by the Canadian people, Canadian fishermen, Canadian courts 
or even his own employees.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron—Bruce, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to extend my appreciation to the staff of the Library 
of Parliament for continued support to my office.  The library's 
annual report indicated that in 1996-97 division personnel 
handled a total of 153,000 requests for information and provided 
96,000 direct answers to authorized clients. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the same time period the information service responded to an 
additional 57,000 information requests from parliamentarians and 
the general public alike.  Those numbers are above and beyond the 
nearly 500,000 visitors that were welcomed to centre block by 
parliamentary guides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although some days I am certain that it seemed like my office 
was responsible for the aforementioned calls, members of the 
library staff were always prepared to cheerfully and competently 
tackle any projects we threw their way.  Without the service 
provided by the various sections of the library, the 
effectiveness of my office would be greatly reduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask that my colleagues join with me in thanking the 
Library of Parliament for its excellent work.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia—Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Quebec 
and parts of Ontario and the Maritimes were hit by an ice storm 
which left heavy damage in its wake.  More than a million people 
were left without electricity, and consequently heat as well, for 
various lengths of time, in mid-January. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Matapédia—Matane have a reputation for being 
very generous, and once again they have shown this to be true. 
People everywhere in my riding were quick to offer help to the 
victims.  My thanks to the people of Matapédia—Matane for their 
great generosity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a great feeling of solidarity among us, as there was 
among all the people of Quebec.  My hope is that this feeling, 
which reached its peak during the recent emergency, will continue 
to flourish.

Canadians cherish: the dignity of the individual, the rights of 
children, fairness, equal treatment and democratic participation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale—High Park, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, on Friday, January 30, 1998, Canada's theatre community 
suffered a tragic loss.  Dean Ott, a member of my riding 
association, a former colleague and my friend, passed away 
suddenly at the age of 34. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dean began his career at Sunshine Theatre in Kelowna, B.C., at 
the age of 14.  His career advanced rapidly from shop supervisor 
at JV Theatre Productions to stage carpenter at Theatre Calgary, 
technical director at Alberta Theatre Projects, and project 
manager at F&D Scene Changes in Calgary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dean came to Toronto in 1990 as the production manager at the 
Canadian Stage Company and later the associate producer and 
director of production.  During his tenure at Canadian Stage he 
was responsible for initiating and implementing with the city of 
Toronto the renovations to the Dream in High Park site.  The 
Dream in High Park is the free outdoor Shakespearian production 
that takes place every summer in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dean will be missed by everyone in the theatre community and by 
everyone he touched.

people showed courage, generosity and determination.  Faced with 
the opportunity to assist fellow Canadians, residents of 
Guelph—Wellington joined together to make a difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Local industries, schools, media, social clubs, individuals and 
families came together to do their part.  Two 45 foot trailers 
were provided by a Guelph company, MacKinnon Transport and 
Southwestern Express, to transport urgently needed items.

in their radio announcements informing the community of the

were so packed they took hours to unload.

tumbling out of the closet unexpectedly.  It certainly looks like 
one of those skeletons just appeared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A recent patronage appointment of the prime minister made a 
public speech on November 13, 1982, a speech which so impressed 
one of my constituents that he kept the transcript for 16 years. 
One paragraph of that speech reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I too had some difficult years as a politician; I'm still having 
them, in fact, because everything we undertake and everything we 
are doing to make Canada a French state is a part of a venture I 
have shared for many years— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know if this same agenda is shared by the prime 
minister because those oh so patriotic words were in a speech by 
none other than his recent Senate appointee, Serge Joyal, 
unelected, unaccountable and completely unacceptable.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, for most 
Canadians lighthouses are simply a symbol of our maritime 
heritage, but for some people in my riding the lighthouse might 
just save their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it is true that most vessels have on board navigational 
aids such as GPS, a number of lighthouses are still indeed 
necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently my constituents of West Nova, including fishers and 
recreational sailors, were very concerned about the possible 
closure of the Yarmouth light at Cape Forchu.  Their fears were 
legitimized in Halifax </I>Chronicle Herald<I> interview when 
coast guard officials confirmed that the federal government was 
exploring the possibility of further lighthouse closures as a 
cost cutting measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our fishers already affected by the downturn in the industry 
must put their lives on the line each and every time they venture 
out into unpredictable seas.  Many men and women still depend on 
the Yarmouth light to guide them home to safety, in particular 
during very adverse weather conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further reductions of national aids will put fishers at risk of 
serious injury or even death.

the occasion of Black History Month, the Bloc Quebecois wishes to 
pay tribute to a community which has made an invaluable 
contribution to the development of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the creation of Black History Month by American 
historian Carter G. Woodson in 1925, a variety of events throughout 
America have marked the contribution of the black community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of names spring immediately to mind when one thinks 
of the black community in Quebec: Dr. Yvette Benny, the first 
Quebec physician to perform a pediatric bone marrow transplant; 
Oliver Jones, the world-famous pianist; businessman Christopher A. 
Ross; musician Charles Biddle; last but not least, the Olympic 
medallist Bruny Surin.  These, and many others, are a source of 
tremendous pride to the black community, and to all Quebeckers, for 
their excellent accomplishments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my hope that we may all work together to enhance the 
quality of life of a community to which all in Quebec owe a

at risk because too many businesses have failed to start the

putting this off.  Too many are ignoring the inevitable.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the finance department publishes a monthly newsletter 
called the </I>Fiscal Monitor<I>.  It is full of statistics, 
including updates on the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the January 28 edition of this newsletter the 
government has a public accounts surplus of $1.4 billion and a 
financial surplus of $11.3 billion.  Yet in today's newspapers 
finance department spin doctors are estimating a year end deficit 
of $2 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the finance minister's explanation of the disappearing 
surplus? 
<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, at budget time I will be delighted to report on the 
state of the government's accounts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The </I>Fiscal Monitor<I> to which the hon. member refers shows a 
strengthening in the Canadian financial balance sheet.  This is 
certainly due to the efforts of Canadians and I must say to the 
efforts of my colleagues in government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, what Canadians understand from this publication and 
elsewhere is that the minister has a lot of their money and they 
want it back in the form of tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the </I>Fiscal Monitor<I> the government has a 
surplus mainly because it is taxing the hide out of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who is the finance minister trying to hide the surplus from: 
from his spendaholic friends in cabinet or from hard-pressed 
Canadian taxpayers? 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is hard to understand how the Leader of the 
Opposition could refer to somebody trying to hide a surplus when 
what he is doing is quoting from a Department of Finance 
document, the source of his numbers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am delighted to confirm to the Leader of the Opposition that 
the numbers he is quoting out of our document are correct. 
<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this surplus is not the finance minister's money. On 
behalf of Canadians I want to tell him who this money belongs to. 
It belongs to the hard-pressed Canadian taxpayers.  It belongs 
to Canadian families.  It belongs to Canadian businesses and 
entrepreneurs that create wealth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has the finance minister not heard that his budget will be 
judged this year not by the hot air that surrounds it but by how 
many dollars it leaves in the pockets of hard-pressed Canadian 
taxpayers? 
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, when we took office the deficit was $42 billion.  The 
surplus the hon. member is referring to is due to the efforts of 
Canadians.   He then goes on to ask whose money it is.  Yes, it 
is the taxpayers'. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell him something else.  Our social programs that his 
party wants to gut, health care, education and old age pension, 
also belong to Canadians and we will protect them for Canadians.

Uruguay to sign an investment agreement that represents one-tenth 
of one per cent of Canada's investment, he has not got time to 
talk to Canadians and tell them what it is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are people in Canada saying this agreement would be the 
end of Canada, the end of Canadian sovereignty.   Why is the 
minister not responding to those concerns?  Why is he not 
travelling to places like B.C. and meeting this opposition head 
on? 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade,

chest.  It is probably his first question in over three months.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This government needs no lectures on trade and investment from

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
under the provisions of the federal disaster relief program, Ottawa

is evaluated at $37 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, however, the President of the Treasury Board told 
us that Ottawa was agreeing to fund only 50% of assistance to small 
and medium sized businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the minister tell us why he will not apply the same 
criteria as those used in 1987 after the tornado in Alberta, when

<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and

are two programs:  the usual disaster relief fund, which is the one 
we apply to all provinces, including Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of the Saguenay, we decided to introduce an 
additional program for expenses not covered under financial 
assistance agreements.  In that case, at the request of Minister 
Brassard himself, the costs were shared 50-50. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was the same cost-sharing formula used in Manitoba, and 
it is the one we are now offering to the governments of Quebec and 
Ontario. 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the minister might recall that he offered the same level of 
compensation as for Alberta in a letter he himself sent to Minister 
Brassard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Copps:</B>  It was Lucien Bouchard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> It was a letter from the present minister,

not listening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the President of the Treasury Board whether he 
admits that, in 1996, he offered the Government of Quebec the same 
type of program as Alberta had, five months after the disaster 
however—a bit late therefore—and why he is not making the same 
offer this time, when we are within the deadline?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and

Brassard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have here a letter from Mr. Brassard replying to my offer to 
share costs on a 90-10 basis in which the minister tells me that 
such a percentage, using the criteria of the Alberta programs, 
would not be equitable under the circumstances.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that the federal government is not acting in good faith

</I></B></P><P align=left>My question concerns compensation for the power grid. Given the 
fact that this network clearly constitutes an essential service and that 
funding could easily be provided under the provisions of his assistance

refusing to help Quebec? 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and Minister

been turned down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This rule has been followed consistently since 1988, and Quebec

<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, under a similar 
provision, Newfoundland requested assistance to repair its power grid in 
1984 and Ottawa said yes. When Manitoba requested assistance in 1984 for 
its power grid, Ottawa said yes as it did again in 1996 for that 
province's dikes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is Ottawa now changing its tune for Quebec's power grid and

1988. It was changed by a Conservative government in which the current 
premier of Quebec was a minister, so he is aware of the rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, as I said, since 1988, we have denied Newfoundland, Manitoba

Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Richard Butler, head of the UN 
special commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe efforts should continue toward a diplomatic solution. 
But it must be recognized that unless there has been the threat

Canadians even within Liberal ranks.  The former chief of staff 
of the UN peacekeeping force in Iraq described Canada's yes sir, 
yes sir, three bags full, sir as nauseating and nonsensical.

Speaker, the Prime Minister has made it very clear what our 
objectives are, to have Saddam Hussein comply completely with the 
UN resolutions, that he give up his efforts to manufacture and 
store instruments of mass destruction and allow full UN 
inspection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is our objective and that of other countries of the world 
under the auspices of existing UN resolutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as commenting on rules of engagement, it is premature 
unless it is determined that there has to be a military solution. 
We are working very hard to avoid that.  The burden of avoiding 
that is on Saddam Hussein who must recognize that he has to obey 
the UN resolutions which he signed on to do nine years ago.

resolutions were adopted in 1991. We do not need the government to tell 
us what resolutions were adopted by the United Nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the government which, following a cabinet 
decision and a debate in the House, embarked on a great adventure that 
could lead to war, to military intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the objectives 
pursued by the government if there is a military intervention? What are 
the rules of engagement for Canadians whose lives will be put on the 
line, and what are the conditions for the withdrawal of our troops, once 
the objective is attained? 
<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
already mentioned our objective, which is to convince Saddam Hussein to 
give up manufacturing and storing weapons of mass destruction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until Saddam Hussein is prepared to comply with this requirement, 
why should we talk about withdrawing the forces of the United Nations, 
Canada or Great Britain? In my opinion, Saddam Hussein's cause will be 
helped if we start talking about the withdrawal of our troops before he 
makes it clear that a diplomatic solution is not in the cards.

<P><A NAME="LINK84"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the fact 
is that all related research, discussions and decisions have always been

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would ask the Deputy Prime Minister to take a look at the bill. It says 
in the bottom right hand corner that it is introduced by “the Minister 
of Finance”. The minister is the sponsor of the bill. He is the one who 
referred us to the senior official, who said the opposite of what the 
minister thought he would say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Was the Prime Minister a little to quick to come to the defence of 
his finance minister, considering that even tax officials say the 
opposite of what he said, thus clearly putting the finance minister in 
an apparent conflict of interest?

I urge the hon. member to retract himself, because his allegations have

Scarborough—Rouge River for their interventions in this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As your Speaker and as a member of this House of Commons I 
consider this to be a very serious matter.  To say that respect 
for our institutions is rapidly eroding is an understatement. 
When it is being eroded by some who should set an example for all 
Canadians it is even more damaging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a necessary constitutional divide between our 
legislative and judicial branches.  That divide should be bridged 
only when one institution seeks to vigorously support the role of 
the other. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Citation 493 in the sixth edition of Beauchesne exists

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>493.(1) All references to judges and courts of justice of the 
nature of personal attack and censure have always been 
considered unparliamentary, and the speaker has always treated 
them as breaches of order.

the courts.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is for that reason that I have taken some time to reflect on 
this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his presentation on February 3, 1998, the hon. member for 
Scarborough—Rouge River made what I think is a very useful and 
insightful suggestion.  He proposed that I direct the Clerk of 
the House to refer this matter to the Canadian Judicial Council, 
the body responsible to review the conduct of our judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it turns out, the executive director of the judicial council 
has written to the clerk to acquaint him with the fact that Chief 
Justice Allan MacEachern, chairman of the judicial conduct 
committee, has initiated formal proceedings under the bylaws of 
the council concerning the statements attributed to Judge Marcel 
Joyal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While this turn of events in no way precludes a finding on my 
part of a prima facie case of contempt, I have decided that it 
would be wise to follow the advice of the hon. member for 
Scarborough—Rouge River and allow the judicial council to 
proceed with its initiative before I comment further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am tabling copies of the said correspondence so that all hon.

Canada Evidence Act and the Criminal Code in respect of persons

the House on Bill S-5, an act to amend the Canada Evidence Act, 
the Criminal Code and the Canadian Human Rights Act in respect of 
persons with disabilities and other matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is essentially the same bill as Bill C-98 which died on the 
order paper with the prorogation of parliament last year.  This 
legislative package was brought back and introduced on a priority 
basis in the Senate on October 9, 1997 as Bill S-5.  The bill was 
passed by the Senate on December 11, 1997. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill deals primarily with a number of problems related to 
disabilities.  Since over four million people in Canada are 
disabled, many Canadians will benefit from the improvements to 
accessibility contained in this bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has an important role to play in ensuring 
that Canadians with disabilities are full and equal participants 
in the mainstream of society.  It has recognized this role for 
many years, including back in 1991 with the announcement of a 
national strategy for the integration of persons with 
disabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This five year strategy involved many federal government 
departments and agencies working toward a common goal:  the 
integration of persons with disabilities in Canadian society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An omnibus bill, Bill C-78, was one of the major achievements of 
the national strategy.  It amended six different federal laws, 
the Criminal Code, the National Transportation Act, the Canada 
Elections Act, the Citizenship Act, the Access to Information Act 
and the Privacy Act, all with a view to improving the situation 
of Canadians with disabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Justice has continued to review legislation in 
the area of the criminal law to find ways to deal with systemic 
barriers to access that may affect persons with disabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been extensive consultations involving all interested

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its fourth report tabled in the House in 1995, the Standing

who is with me today in the House, released a report in October 
1996 in which it was recommended that the federal government 
proceed as soon as possible with relevant amendments to the 
criminal law and to human rights legislation.  The bill clearly 
responds to these recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is of utmost importance to every Canadian and deserves 
no less than the utmost support of every member of the House.  I 
am pleased to say that I understand all members of the House are 
supportive of legislation and therefore will facilitate its 
speedy passage through the House. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank you, as well as my 
colleagues, for giving me the opportunity to introduce this 
important bill in the House. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK182"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the bill we are discussing is entitled an 
act to amend the Canada Evidence Act and the Criminal Code in 
respect of persons with disabilities, to amend the Canadian Human 
Rights Act in respect of persons with disabilities and other 
matters and to make consequential amendments to other acts. 
Interestingly the bill was tabled by the government in the 
Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill was originally tabled in the House by the former 
minister of justice in April 1997 as Bill C-98 and died with the 
dissolution of parliament in 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-5 contains a number of provisions to remove barriers and 
to ensure the equality rights of persons with disabilities.  It 
also includes some substantive changes to the federal human 
rights act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will highlight some of the contents of the bill as the 
substance is most worthy.  It generally fits with the people 
agenda of average Canadians that Reformers promote.  Reformers 
always look to expand the bounds of democracy, to help those who 
need a hand up and may not be able to fully help themselves. The 
bill largely says how the federal government will behave.  It is 
a statement that extends goodwill and mainstream consideration to 
a larger group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three pieces of legislation will be amended by the bill.  On 
disability issues there is some background worth mentioning. 
Today more than four million people in Canada, about 16% of the 
population, have some disability.  Canadians with disabilities 
continue to experience some obstacles to daily living in areas 
such as employment, transportation and housing where most of us 
take full participation for granted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Legislative reform has been advocated by the disability rights 
movement for almost two decades.  At the parliamentary level the 
issue was raised when the former House of Commons Standing 
Committee on Human and the Status of Persons with Disabilities 
actively promoted the equality rights of persons with 
disabilities.  The committee made specific recommendations for 
legislative reform requiring all federal departments, crown 
corporations and agencies to review and reform legislation to 
ensure the inclusion of persons with disabilities in federal 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to the report the government agreed to undertake a 
comprehensive review to identify the action required to eliminate 
these barriers to the social and economic integration of persons 
with disabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea of an omnibus bill that would make simultaneous 
amendments to a number of pieces of federal legislation to 
address the concerns of Canadians with disabilities was promoted 
by the disability community as far back as the late eighties and 
early nineties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we have that omnibus bill in Bill S-5.  The goal was to 
bring federal laws in line with section 15 of the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms which guarantees the right to 
equality for persons with mental and physical disabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Human Rights Act was enacted in 1977 to provide for 
an informal process for resolving cases of discrimination in 
areas of federal jurisdiction. 
Like most provincial anti-discrimination laws, the act 
establishes a specialized system of redress whereby 
discriminatory actions are discouraged by means of education and 
by ensuring that those who discriminate will bear the costs of 
compensating their victims.  The act applies to all federal 
government departments, agencies and crown corporations as well 
as federally regulated businesses and industries such as banking, 
transportation and communications.

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The human rights system essentially operates on a complaint 
basis.  A complaint of discrimination must be lodged with the 
Canadian Human Rights Commission before the process can go 
forward.  Moreover, the human rights system is self-contained in 
that there is no direct right to seek damages before the courts 
for acts of discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Human Rights Commission is the administrative 
agency responsible for promoting an understanding of and 
compliance with the act.  The adjudicative function under the 
legislation is carried out by human rights tribunals looking into 
complaints of discrimination.  They have the power to fashion 
reasonable remedies to address the unique social problems 
underlying these complaints. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Speech from the Throne on October 1, 1986 the then 
government announced its intention to proceed with amendments to 
the Canadian Human Rights Act.  On December 10, 1992 the former 
minister of justice, the Hon. Kim Campbell, tabled in the House 
of Commons Bill C-108, an act to amend the Canadian Human Rights 
Act.  That bill died with the dissolution of that Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In June 1996 during the last session of the Parliament, one 
amendment to the human rights act was made, adding sexual 
orientation as a prohibited ground of discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill completes the long stated goals of inclusiveness that 
I mentioned.  For example, the removal of barriers to facilitate 
equal access to the Canadian justice system.  This has been a 
longstanding goal of those with disabilities who have been either 
labelled mentally handicapped or denied methods to assist them to 
communicate in a court of law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was concluded that unless statutory provisions excluding the 
evidence of these persons was improved, they would continue to be 
discounted. These could include the removal of barriers to 
receiving testimony from persons with disabilities; allowing 
witnesses to use the medium with which they are most comfortable 
in order to testify in court; allowing individuals with a 
disability to use alternative methods, such as the voice, to 
identify the accused; and eliminating discrimination against 
persons with a disability in the jury selection process. 
Certainly we have excluded many worthy jurors in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is particular concern about the people with disabilities 
who are physically and sexually assaulted but who are unable to 
obtain the protection of the criminal justice system.  The 
previous legislation I do not think went far enough and 
amendments in this bill are in response to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also amends the Canada Evidence Act.  Clause 1 would 
replace section 6 of the Canada Evidence Act which currently 
allows witnesses who are unable to speak to give evidence by any 
means that would make it intelligible.  Clause 1 would extend 
this allowance to persons who have difficulty in communicating by 
reason of any disability.  This change could require the use of 
sign language or oral interpreters, assistive learning devices or 
real time captioning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to clause 1, persons with mental disabilities who have 
been determined to have the capacity to give evidence and have 
difficulty in communicating because of a physical or mental 
disability could give evidence with appropriate help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 1 would also allow a witness to give evidence about the 
identity of an accused either visually or by using a sensory 
method of identification.  This new section would permit the 
admission into court of voice and touch methods of identifying an 
accused person.  In most cases victims visually identify the 
accused first in a line-up and then in the courtroom as part of 
the evidence.  However, persons who are blind or who have low 
vision are often unable to identify an accused in this manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also deals with the offence of sexual exploitation. The 
child sexual abuse provisions of the Criminal Code, section 153 I 
believe, make it an offence for a person in a position of trust 
or authority to sexually exploit a young person. They also make 
it an offence for a person to sexually exploit a young person 
with whom he or she is in a relationship of dependency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 2 of this bill would apply the same prohibitions in 
relation to persons with disabilities.  Clause 2 would create a 
hybrid offence punishable upon summary conviction for a term of 
imprisonment not exceeding 18 months or upon indictment for a 
term not exceeding five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 2 would also create a new offence, sexual exploitation of 
persons with disabilities, that would be separate from the 
general offence of sexual assault. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1535"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT20"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT20"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1535

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of the reason for creating a new offence separate from the 
general offence of sexual assault is that specific recognition of 
the various ways in which persons with disabilities can be 
sexually exploited would allow individuals to be held criminally 
accountable for a much broader range of damaging and sexually 
intrusive behaviour.  This proposed offence would be easily 
recognizable on a criminal record as being one against persons 
with disabilities in vulnerable relationships as opposed to a 
generic charge of sexual assault. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The wording in subsections (5) and (6) removes the defence of 
mistaken belief in consent where that belief was based on the 
accused's self-induced intoxication or recklessness or wilful 
blindness.  Subsection (6) requires the judge to instruct a jury 
presented with the defence of mistaken belief in consent to 
consider the presence or absence of reasonable grounds for that 
belief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clauses 4 through 7 of the bill are designed to facilitate the 
inclusion of persons with disabilities on juries.  Clause 4 would 
permit a juror with a physical disability who is otherwise 
qualified to serve as a juror to be accommodated in order to 
carry out their duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 6 of the bill pertains to challenges for cause by the 
prosecution or an accused.  Currently section 638(1)(e) of the 
Criminal Code permits a juror to be challenged for elimination 
from the jury on the basis that they are physically unable to 
properly carry out their responsibilities.  Clause 6 would amend 
this section to prevent disability in and of itself from being a 
barrier to jury service, particularly if the person with the 
disability had been accommodated and was able to carry out the 
role of a juror. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, disability could be a cause for exclusion where, even 
with the aid of technical, personal, interpretive or support 
devices the person was still physically unable to properly 
perform the responsibilities of a juror.  That makes sense.  But 
this could happen for example in a case where a significant 
amount of visual evidence was involved and where the potential 
juror was blind.  The caveat is reasonableness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 8 deals with videotaped evidence.  The child sexual abuse 
provisions of the Criminal Code currently allow complainants 
under 18 to give evidence of a sexual offence by way of videotape 
so long as the tape has been made within a reasonable time after 
the offence was committed and provided that the complainant 
adopts the contents of the videotape during testimony.  The 
intention behind this section is to preserve the evidence of 
children who might not otherwise recall events that took place 
months or even years before, and to remove the need for them to 
repeat their story many times both in and out of court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 8 of the bill would allow similar videotaped evidence by 
persons with disabilities who might have difficulty communicating 
due to that disability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next section deals with human rights and the human rights 
system and clauses 9 and 10 amend the Canadian Human Rights Act. 
Clause 10 would limit the factors for assessing undue hardship 
for those of health, safety and cost in providing assistance in 
those special circumstances.  Accommodating special needs is not 
an absolute right and may not be practical or it may be 
unreasonably costly in certain circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the same three factors set out in the Ontario Human 
Rights Code.  It has been done in Ontario in this regard.  Bill 
S-5 would allow the governor in council to make regulations 
prescribing standards for assessing undue hardship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One or more of the contentious issues surrounding the duty to 
accommodate is what is meant by cost in determining instances of 
undue hardship.  Some equality seeking groups would prefer not to 
have any cost factors taken into a consideration of undue 
hardship. They fear that doing so would create two classes of 
human rights claimants, those we could afford to treat equally 
and those we could not.  Since cost is to be a relevant 
consideration in assessing undue hardship, they would like to see 
it limited to financial cost as is the case under the Ontario 
Human Rights Code. There is controversy there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The equality seeking groups find the whole notion of 
accommodation itself offensive.  In their view, notions of 
accommodation and undue hardship promote a second class version 
of rights.  That is unacceptable to them.  They suggest that the 
idea that the needs of disadvantaged people are special and must 
be reasonably accommodated presupposes that there is a norm to 
which people must conform or be considered different or abnormal; 
such a person's needs must be accommodated but only if they do 
not cause undue hardship to accommodate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the accommodation approach to achieving equality 
effectively leaves unchallenged the assumptions, institutions and 
relationships underlying discriminatory rules themselves. 
Accommodation permits an employer for example to avoid liability 
for what otherwise would be held to be a discriminatory practice.

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While accommodation will reduce the effects of the same 
treatment approach to equality in individual situations, it will 
not alter the overall systemic impact of certain rules.  It has 
been suggested that a better approach might be to hold employers 
and service providers under the federal human rights act to one 
standard of equality and then ask them to justify any deviation 
from that standard, rather than upholding discriminatory 
practices in attempting to fit people adversely affected by them 
into a general practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That has not been chosen in this bill and probably is too 
idealistic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 27 of the bill would restructure the existing ad hoc 
human rights tribunal panel under the Canadian Human Rights Act. 
The bill creates a permanent, smaller and expert Canadian Human 
Rights Tribunal composed of a maximum of 15 members, including a 
chairperson and a vice-chairperson.  Temporary members could be 
appointed to meet workload requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Appointments to the tribunal would be made on the basis of 
experience, expertise and interest in and sensitivity to human 
rights, as well as with regard to the need of regional 
representation. The chairperson, the vice-chairperson and at 
least two other members of the tribunal would be required to have 
certain legal qualifications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also would provide that the terms of office for both 
the chairperson and the vice-chairperson could extend during good 
behaviour for as long as seven years.  Other members would 
continue to hold office during good behaviour for terms not 
exceeding five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 27 contains provisions for remedial and also disciplinary 
measures which could be taken against any member of the tribunal. 
It is good to see some accountability measure built in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pursuant to clause 27, at any stage after a complaint of 
discrimination was filed, the Canadian Human Rights Commission 
could ask the chairperson of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal 
to institute an inquiry into it if the commission is satisfied 
that such action is warranted.  The chairperson would respond by 
assigning a member of the tribunal to hear the case.  In 
instances of complex complaints, perhaps a three member panel 
could be assigned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 27 would allow the chairperson to make rules of procedure 
for tribunal hearings.  These rules would cover such things as 
the summoning of witnesses, the production and service of 
documents, the introduction of evidence and time limits on 
hearings and decision making.  They could also deal with the 
addition of parties and interested persons to the proceedings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, clause 27 would create a new section 52 of the act to 
allow tribunal members or panels to take measures to ensure the 
confidentiality of an inquiry where certain conditions existed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under section 53 of the current act, if at the conclusion of an 
inquiry a tribunal finds that the complaint has not been 
substantiated, it must dismiss the matter.  Where however it is 
determined that the complaint has been substantiated, the 
tribunal may make an order against the person found to have 
engaged or to be engaging in the discriminatory practice.  This 
situation would continue under the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 57 of the act would also continue to allow any tribunal 
order, including those newly added to the bill, to be enforced as 
an order of the Federal Court of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would repeal sections 55 and 56 thereby eliminating the 
current review of tribunal structure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Human rights tribunals may make such specialized orders as 
compensating the victim of discrimination for any lost wages, for 
the cost of obtaining alternative services or accommodations, or 
for injury to his or her feelings or self-respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sections of the act also permit a tribunal to make a special 
order of compensation where a person is found to have wilfully or 
recklessly engaged in a discriminatory practice or still to be 
doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 27 of the bill would also continue to allow compensation 
for pain and suffering or for wilful or reckless discrimination. 
However it would increase the maximum penalty dollar amount to 
$20,000 from $5,000.  The rationale is that some provincial human 
rights laws have no limits on how much money can be awarded to a 
complainant while others have limits ranging from $2,000 to 
$10,000.  The raising of the limit under the Canadian Human 
Rights Act would ensure that tribunals had enough discretion to 
award an amount that was fair in the circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the issue of hate propaganda, section 13 of the 
Canadian Human Rights Act makes it a discriminatory practice to 
use the telephone or any telecommunications device undertaken to 
communicate messages which are likely to expose a person or 
persons to hatred or contempt because they belong to a group 
identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground, such as race, 
national or ethnic origin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under section 54 of the act a tribunal is currently restricted 
to use cease and desist orders where it finds that a complaint 
has been substantiated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 28 would expand the order-making powers of tribunals in 
these cases.  It would allow tribunals to compensate victims 
specifically identified in the discriminatory communication up to 
a maximum of $20,000 where the discriminatory practice was found 
to be or to have been engaged in wilfully or recklessly. 
The tribunal could also order the communicator to pay a penalty 
of up to $10,000.  In considering whether to order a penalty 
payment the tribunal would be required to consider such factors 
as the nature and gravity of the practice and the wilfulness or 
the intent of the communicator.  This would not be used lightly.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 28 is a response to the rising incidence of hate crimes 
around the world.  There seems to be a need to deter individuals 
and organizations from establishing hate telephone lines. Victims 
of such lines can apply for compensation and offenders can be 
subjected to a financial penalty to accomplish this deterrence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 32 of the bill would respond to these requests for 
accountability by requiring the commission to submit all reports 
of itself to Parliament through the Speakers of both Houses.  The 
clause is significant in that it would require the new Canadian 
human rights tribunal to report annually to Parliament on its 
activities.  This would provide some measure of transparency to 
the tribunal process and would serve to ensure the independence 
of the tribunal from the commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other noteworthy amendments include the retaliation clause, 
clause 14, which would make complaint retaliation a 
discriminatory practice which would be dealt with under the act 
like any other case of discrimination.  The idea seems to be that 
the anti-discrimination system created by the Canadian Human 
Rights Act would be better suited than criminal courts to deal 
with these types of cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The introduction of such long awaited amendments to the Canadian 
Human Rights Act has not been met with unanimous applause as one 
might expect.  While many of the amendments are clearly perceived 
as positive, in particular those pertaining to the creation of an 
expert permanent tribunal, most attention seems to be focused on 
what is missing from the package.  The same appears to be true of 
the reaction of the disabled community to the proposed amendments 
to the Canada Evidence Act and the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the Canadian Human Rights Act, the bill does not 
deal with the issue of same sex benefits or with the mandatory 
retirement provisions in section 15(c) of the act.  There are 
calls for amendments to expand the jurisdiction of the Canadian 
human rights commission to deal with dissemination of hate 
messages in any form, telephone mail or the Internet whether 
exported or imported. There are recommendations that the act be 
updated to respond to the transmission of hate messages and 
specifically that Holocaust denial be defined as constituting 
hate propaganda under the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to continue our evaluation of the existing federal human 
rights system's ability to promote and protect human rights into 
the future.  There will always be controversy on these matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The passage of this legislation is helpful but it is not the 
whole answer.  There is a cultural context of reasonableness, 
tolerance, common sense and goodwill on which these measures 
rest.  The historical Judeo-Christian ethic of Canadian culture 
is operative here.  Good people can make poor situations work if 
they want to.  Where attitudes change and are adaptable, much can 
be accomplished beyond mere rules of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To help the disadvantaged we need an economic engine that will 
generate the wealth to pay for our desired social programs. The 
good samaritan of the Bible could not have helped very much if he 
did not have the money to put his concern into action.  The 
samaritan had his own financial resources which were not someone 
else's taxes, unlike some of the others who passed by on the road 
that day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that right thinking about economics creates the 
economic engine to pay for the social programs and the very good 
things that need to be done.  We need to have balance and reason. 
This is a lesson the NDP may never learn and the Liberals are so 
reluctant to admit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers care about people.  We make every effort to be the 
voice of average Canadians as we bring the concerns of voters to 
Ottawa rather than bringing a central Canadian, top down Ottawa 
agenda back to the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers are supporting this bill today.  However, I need to 
comment on the number the bill has been assigned because it has 
an </I>S<I> in front of it.  That means it went through the Senate 
first, which troubles me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The contents of Bill S-5 are satisfactory as far as they go and 
we support the majority of amendments to the applicable acts. 
However, it is not the contents that concern me as much as the 
process through which this bill came to the House for debate.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the Constitution Act, 1867 gives to the Senate the same 
powers as the House of Commons (except that, by s. 53, money 
bills must originate in the House of Commons), it has to be (and 
usually is) accepted by opposition as well as government senators 
that the appointive nature of the Senate must necessarily make 
its role subordinate to the elective House.

either.  (There is still some question as to the 
constitutionality of Senate amendments of money bills, but in 
practical terms the Senate does not even attempt to amend them 
today). Because of the lack of government ministers in the 
Senate, virtually all government bills are by convention 
introduced in the House of Commons. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-7 was originally tabled in the House of Commons by the 
former justice minister and the current health minister in April 
1997 as Bill C-98.  The bill died on the order paper with the 
dissolution of the 35th Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current minister could have easily introduced this bill at 
the outset of the 36th Parliament, as there was not a great 
amount of legislation for her to be responsible for at the time. 
Instead the government, for reasons unknown, decided to introduce 
the bill in the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know how the Senate is currently in a state of flux. 
Canadians from coast to coast are wondering how effective the 
Senate really is.  Do senators truly understand the needs of 
average Canadians?  Who are they accountable to if they do not 
represent a specific constituency? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I have senators calling me in an outrage at my office, I 
want to make one point very clear.  There are senators who take 
their job very seriously, work hard for their province and region 
and who want to make Canada a better place in which to live. 
That is without dispute.  We even have senators with commendable 
attendance records.  Those senators would probably have a good 
chance of getting elected to that House and should have nothing 
to worry about by a triple E Senate concept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers are not upset with the handful of hard workers.  We 
are upset with the majority who look at the Senate as a place to 
simply collect a paycheque and then proceed to do work unrelated 
to the Senate.  It must be remembered that Reformers have not 
abandoned their hopes of solving the historical national problem 
of the Senate.  It is unfinished business in nation building and 
Reformers are committed to Senate reform, not abolition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of the House of Commons, we are here because the 
majority of our constituents want us to be here.  If my 
constituents are frustrated with my performance they will have 
their chance to get rid of me.  It is quite simple.  However, look 
at how difficult it is to get rid of an unpopular senator, 
someone who has gone out of the bounds of rules.  It is next to 
impossible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of Parliament do not want to become rubber stamps.  We 
do not want to rubber stamp Bill S-5.  The House of Commons is an 
elected House and legislation should go from here to the other 
place.  Senators who feel they too often rubber stamp bills from 
here should perhaps line up and support the Reformers who want an 
elected upper house. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government House leader's office had indicated to me today 
that the reason Bill S-5 was not introduced first in the House 
was that the agenda in the fall was too busy.  That stretches 
credibility.  It said that it was essential to get the bill 
through as quickly as possible so it was started in the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The elected representatives of the Canadian people sit in the 
House of Commons, not in the Senate.  Canadians do not want their 
elected representatives relegated to the house of sober second 
thought.  They want government legislation to begin in the House 
of Commons and then proceed to the other place, not vice versa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue here is the principle of democracy and of good 
government.  I think there is a ring of Liberal arrogance with 
this move through the Senate with this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to conclude that we are supportive of the components of 
this bill.  It will clearly provide the necessary changes to 
enable persons with disabilities to play a more active role in 
the justice process, something the disabled community has long 
been calling for.  It provides for ways of redress and is part of 
a larger quest of Reform to change and update our government 
institutions to better serve every Canadian.

Speaker, I am pleased to rise today at second reading of Bill S-5, 
an act to amend the Canada Evidence Act and the Criminal Code in 
respect of persons with disabilities, to amend the Canadian Human 
Rights Act in respect of persons with disabilities and other 
matters and to make consequential amendments to other Acts.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am speaking to this bill as the Bloc Quebecois critic on 
human rights and the rights of the disabled.  Before I begin my 
speech on Bill S-5, I would first like to point out that it comes 
to us from the Senate and that the House of Commons, the forum of 
democracy that it is, occasionally debates bills from the other 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should point out that this bill, S-5, is absolutely 
identical to Bill C-98, which the former Minister of Justice now 
Minister of Health tabled at the end of the last Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the present government chose to allocate issues concerning 
the rights of the disabled and human rights to both the Department 
of Human Resources Development and the Department of Justice, I 
think it would have been far preferable for the Minister of Justice 
to reintroduce the bill in this House.  This approach would 
indicate the importance the government intends to give to these men 
and women, who are full-fledged citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members of the House of Commons have been given a mandate 
to represent the people and are accountable to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The practice of introducing bills in the Senate first and then 
in the House is questionable to say the least.  It could even tend 
to increase the importance of the other chamber.  If we are not 
careful, we will be back into the whole discussion about the 
existence of the other chamber, but that is not our aim, 
particularly as the Bloc Quebecois' position on this is very clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though it has not come from the House of Commons, I have 
no hesitation in emphasizing the great importance of this bill for 
the many physically and mentally disabled members of the community. 
In fact, four million individuals, 16% of Canada's population, are 
disabled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will, if I may, briefly review what has been done, or rather 
said, in this Parliament about the status of the disabled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1990, the Standing Committee on Human Rights and the Status 
of Disabled Persons, which no longer exists, tabled a report in 
which it recommended a broad legislative reform under which all 
federal departments and agencies, and all crown corporations, would 
examine and amend their acts and regulations so that the disabled 
could benefit from existing federal programs.  A number of other 
consultations took place later, but did not result in significant 
legislative changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In June 1996, a federal task force on disability issues was 
formed.  This task force, it should be recalled, was composed 
exclusively of government members and reported to the justice, 
human resources development, finance and revenue departments.  We 
should all admit and deplore the fact that little progress has been 
made with respect to the status of the disabled. 
The task force's main recommendations have never been followed up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is perhaps good news, because it could be seen as 
marking a beginning.  But it must not be forgotten that the status 
of the disabled is the responsibility of several departments and 
that action is required from each of them in order to implement the 
task force's recommendations.  Is this realistic? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take, for example, the revenue department, which could 
introduce legislation to improve tax credits for the disabled.  But 
that is another issue; I will focus for now on the bill before us.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will address the amendments to the Canada Evidence Act and the 
Criminal Code, and then the provisions concerning the Canadian 
Human Rights Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 1 of the bill makes two amendments to the Canada Evidence 
Act. First, it provides for the use of whatever means necessary to allow 
a witness who has difficulty communicating by reason of a physical 
disability to give evidence. The use of sign language interpretation is 
a concrete example of clause 1 of Bill S-5 at work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second part of clause 1 adds a section 6.1 to the Canada 
Evidence Act. 
This provision would allow for witnesses to use any sensory means, their 
sense of hearing for instance, to identify an accused. This way, a blind 
person who witnesses a crime could help identify the accused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clauses 2 through 8 of Bill C-5 amend the Criminal Code. Clause 2 
creates a new offence. Sexual exploitation of persons with disabilities 
becomes a crime separate from the generic offence of sexual assault. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This provision specifically recognizes that any person who is in a 
position of trust or authority toward a person with a disability and 
sexually abuses this vulnerable person is guilty of an offence. A 
parallel can be drawn between these provisions and those relating to 
sexual violence against children, which also constitutes a specific 
offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of clauses 4 to 7 of the bill is to make it easier 
for the disabled to serve on a jury.  Accommodation must be made to 
enable a disabled person selected as a juror to discharge this 
responsibility appropriately and fully like any other citizen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 8 would authorize video testimony for disabled 
individuals who have difficulty communicating directly during a 
proceeding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To sum up, these provisions amend the Criminal Code and the 
Canada Evidence Act and are designed to give disabled individuals 
full access to the criminal justice system, something organizations 
for the disabled have long been calling for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second aspect of this bill has to do with the Canadian 
Human Rights Act. 
First, clause 10 of Bill S-5 introduces what is commonly known as 
the obligation of accommodation into the Canadian Human Rights Act. 
Employers and providers of services governed by this act must 
accommodate the needs of the disabled and of the other groups 
mentioned in section 2 of the act, unless doing so would impose 
excessive hardship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If, for example, a complaint of discrimination is made against 
a federal department for failing to accommodate the needs of a 
disabled individual, that department must show that accommodating 
those needs would have imposed excessive hardship with respect to 
health, safety or cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the only three criteria of excessive hardship 
mentioned in the bill.  It would be interesting for the committee 
to hear what federally regulated employers had to see about this. 
I sincerely believe that these provisions will allow better 
integration of the disabled in the working world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, Bill S-5 creates a Canadian Human Rights Tribunal. 
Right now, there is a human rights tribunal panel composed of a 
president and 43 part time members. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1605"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT26"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT26"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1605

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed tribunal would be made up of a chairperson, a 
vice-chairperson and 15 members.  Creation of a tribunal 
specializing in human rights will certainly be greeted with 
interest, since human rights is becoming an increasingly complex 
area requiring particular expertise.  There is already such a 
tribunal in Quebec, as members know, and it has proven its worth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would, however, like to raise a few points into which we 
will surely have time to go more thoroughly when the bill is 
examined by the standing committee on justice after second reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first concerns the tribunal's independence.  As the 
Barreau du Québec has already pointed out at a sitting of the 
Senate committee on legal and constitutional affairs, the question 
of the tribunal's independence from the Canadian Human Rights 
Commission would need to be clarified.  At the moment, one could 
assume that the tribunal would be only a component of the 
Commission, not an independent body. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 48.3 also raises some questions.  It gives a great deal 
of power to the Minister of Justice with respect to disciplinary 
measures against a member of the tribunal.  The fact that the 
minister can be involved in a disciplinary measure against a member 
of the tribunal raises questions about the independence of that 
tribunal.  This is a matter into which the committee must look 
seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for clause 48.5, it reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The full-time members of the Tribunal shall reside in the 
National Capital Region, as described in the schedule to the 
National Capital Act, or within forty kilometres of that 
Region. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This gives me food for thought.  People competent to sit on 
such a specialized tribunal can be found anywhere in Canada or 
Quebec.  To accept this clause means choosing to deprive the 
tribunal of persons who could well be living in Vancouver or 
Toronto, Montreal or St. John's, Newfoundland.  This, to my mind, is 
a completely discriminatory rule, and one that is contrary to the 
public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To summarize my speech, the Bloc Quebecois supports all of the 
principles of Bill S-5.  This bill will provide persons with 
disabilities with better access to criminal justice as witnesses or 
jury members. 
The obligation for accommodations responds to demands from a number 
of organizations of persons with disabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People with disabilities have all the rights of other 
citizens.  I trust that Bill C-5 will not be the only measure of 
this legislature to meet their needs and expectations. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK184"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to speak today in the debate on Bill S-5.  As critic for 
persons with disabilities for the New Democratic Party, I am 
committed to the legislative process for human rights protection 
to be continually reviewed and updated due to evolving conditions 
for the disabled.  Bill S-5 is a step in the right direction in 
terms of equitable treatment for the disabled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seventeen per cent of the population can identify themselves as 
having a disability of one type or another.  The amendments to 
the Canadian Human Rights Act will work to prevent discrimination 
against persons with disabilities within the federal sphere.  A 
key amendment adds a provision that requires employers and 
service providers to accommodate the needs of people who are 
protected under the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The duty to accommodate is a concept viewed by persons with 
disabilities as essential to integration and inclusion in 
society.  The concept has been recognized and adopted 
legislatively throughout all provincial human rights 
jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Human Rights Act is the principal vehicle wherein 
the fundamental human rights of persons with disabilities and all 
Canadians are guaranteed.  Persons with disabilities are 
recognized under section 15 of the Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms. 
Under this section are various human rights acts established 
provincially and federally to ensure equal access and opportunity 
for persons with disabilities.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Duty to accommodate affects how we work, travel and communicate, 
basically all the fundamental aspects of social, political and 
economic life for persons with disabilities in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the past 12 years disabled persons have been fighting for a 
law that provides duty to accommodate in our federal human rights 
act.  It has taken so long probably and unfortunately, it would 
seem, because government agendas have taken precedence over the 
quality of life for persons with disabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is a start.  It represents the perspective of persons 
with disabilities.  It provides for a positive duty to 
accommodate subject to a standard of undue hardship.  Undue 
hardship is defined with respect to health, safety and cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that undue hardship be defined.  It is important 
to have a human rights policy base for limitations on undue 
hardship that will ensure a meaningful duty to accommodate 
persons with disabilities.  The undue hardship provisions must be 
clearly defined so they do not marginalize nor diminish the most 
fundamental rights of people with disabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without accommodation persons with disabilities will continue to 
be denied access to employment and to the most fundamental 
elements of our social being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If enacted, this law will bring clarity to the area of the law 
where the duty to accommodate applies equally regardless of what 
kind of discrimination it may be.  It is critical that people 
with disabilities are consulted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another positive aspect of the bill is that the commission 
cannot be a regulatory body.  It will only provide consultation. 
Input by disabled persons will also be included in the process. 
This is critical.  It is critical that people with disabilities 
are consulted in a regulation making process, especially with 
respect to undue hardship and limitation on accommodation.  This 
will help to further establish their needs to fully integrate 
into society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One issue that is not included in the bill and will hopefully be 
included at a later date is the reference to income status as a 
ground of discrimination.   Also the bill needs to include 
assurance that the human rights system at the federal level is 
effectively working by ensuring that training of investigators at 
the commission level happens.  The tribunal process needs to 
effectively meet the needs and concerns of the citizens of Canada 
who are facing discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I endorse the content of the bill, especially with regard to the 
duty to accommodate, but we need a broader review of the human 
rights act and the human rights commission system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concerns of the disabled community are serious.  We need to 
provide answers and solutions to their needs.  They have gone 
unnoticed for so long and the bill will assist in addressing some 
of the issues faced by persons with disabilities.  As a 
government and as a nation we need to ensure that persons with 
disabilities are given equal opportunities, the same 
opportunities share by all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to put forward at this time some of the comments of 
a member of the disabled community, Ms. Lucie Lemieux-Brassard: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The duty to accommodate with regard to employment is critical. 
Should an individual have their job changed or eliminated because 
their wheelchair doesn't fit in regular cars or because there is 
no weekend accessibility for a bus for the disabled?  No. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to assess the needs of the individual.  We need to look 
at the abilities and disabilities of the person and then search 
for a solution that will compensate for a functional limitation. 
The solution must assist the disabled person to carry out his or 
her job duties.  This is about fairness and equity, not cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spoken with many members of the disabled community and 
would like to raise a couple of other points.  The bill is 
important but it still needs work.  There needs to be a broader 
review of the human rights act to address disability issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process at the present time is driven by an individual 
complaint system and that is problematic.  Accessibility 
complaints usually take two years for resolution.  Usually 
resolution comes in the form of one person's complaint being 
answered.  It does not, however, address the same complaint that 
many may have across the country.  They are not resolved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an example.  A person complains that there are no 
TTY services in the Dorval airport in Montreal.  To resolve the 
issue a TTY service is installed in the airport.  This is driven 
by a single complaint. 
Do we need to lodge a complaint for every single airport in 
Canada? How do we ensure that all airports have a TTY?  How about 
the rest of the deaf communities across this country who will not 
benefit from a TTY service because federal access standards are 
not guaranteed?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a perfect example of why disabled persons need full 
accommodation across this country. In other words, the bill does 
not deal with systemic problems. It is a complaint driven 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The disabled community is reasonable in their demands but they 
do not want to have to wait years to make life more accessible to 
all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-5 is a step in the right direction in respecting the 
rights and quality of life for disabled persons in our 
communities.  But there are still many more steps which need to 
be executed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to draw attention to the fact that in October last 
year a landmark decision occurred in the supreme court respecting 
the rights of the deaf to have appropriate sign language 
translation services available in hospitals and other public 
institutions. I am still waiting to hear how this landmark 
decision is going to work its way into the hospitals, schools and 
other public institutions in this land.  I think all members of 
the disabled community are still waiting for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Ontario right now there are great concerns among 
post-secondary students who are deaf or hearing impaired.  They 
see that their funding is being jeopardized and made much more 
complicated by the present process of moving jurisdictions for 
their funding. They are being moved from the federal jurisdiction 
into provincial loan jurisdiction.  Instead of finding life 
becoming a little easier to deal with, it is just simply one more 
hurdle for them. It is time that we started eliminating hurdles 
across the board for people with disabilities and not removing 
one and adding another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I support Bill S-5.  It is our duty to accommodate 
the dreams and the plans of our disabled citizens.  They have as 
much if not more to contribute to this country as any one else. 
For that reason I am in support of this first step. 
<P><A NAME="LINK185"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am honoured to rise in the House today to speak at 
second reading of Bill S-5, an act to amend the Canada Evidence 
Act and the Criminal Code in respect of persons with 
disabilities, to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act in respect 
of persons with disabilities and other matters and to make 
consequential amendments to other acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been chronicled, this bill has been adopted with one 
amendment from the Senate last December 1997.  Before I delve 
into the whole objective of this particular legislation I would 
like to outline the principle of this amendment which was adopted 
in our neighbouring house, the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment was tabled by Senator Kinsella and dealt 
specifically with clause 16 of the bill.  Clause 16 of Bill S-5 
would permit the information relating to the prohibited ground of 
discrimination to be collected provided that this was done as 
part of the adaptation of carrying out a special program, plan or 
arrangement pursuant to section 16 of the Canadian Human Rights 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an important distinction where special programs are 
recognized by section 16 to prevent or reduce disadvantages in 
employment or in the provision of goods and services that are 
being suffered by a group of individuals on the basis of a 
certain prohibited ground of discrimination.  For one reason or 
another, this original legislation did not address all of the 
grounds of discrimination prohibited by section 2 of the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For that reason this amendment to section 16 of Bill S-5 I would 
suggest is a very positive motion brought forward by a senator in 
the neighbouring house.  Senator Kinsella therefore presented 
this amendment to rectify the omission which was adopted by the 
Senate.  I congratulate the senators for their participation in 
this legislation. 
As a result, section 16 of Bill S-5 which is before us today has 
been rectified and is consistent with all of the provisions of 
the federal Canadian human bill of rights.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to move on to Bill S-5 as a whole.  The preamble I 
would suggest sets out a very, very important principle and a 
philosophy that I am sure all members of the House would embrace. 
That is the attempt to remove all barriers, “the removal of 
barriers to their full participation in society” specifically 
referring to those with disabilities.  Certainly accessibility is 
a noble goal and this legislation takes a giant step in that 
direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill, like all Canadian anti-discrimination statutes at the 
provincial, territorial and federal levels, has this preamble and 
sets out this principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second paragraph of the preamble also brings our attention 
to the fact that for individuals and groups who are 
disadvantaged, identical treatment does not always lead to 
equality.  Again this is a sometimes very difficult principle to 
understand, but certainly it is an important principle for 
identical treatment does not always lead to equality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many members of this House, and I would suggest unfortunately 
many of them in the official opposition, will have difficulties 
with this proposition because identical does not always mean 
equal.  I am curious to see how this reaction will be taken by 
the members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party members are opposed to the principle of special 
treatment.  They do not seem to understand that equal treatment 
does not always mean equal.  They seem to have a hang-up with 
definitions, as we have seen with the definitions of “distinct” 
and “unique”.  But surely all members must come to understand 
that persons with disabilities in the absence of special measures 
would not always enjoy equality.  There is the rub. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill certainly is a good example of circumstances where the 
principle of identical treatment versus equality as embraced by 
the Reform Party simply will not work.  If it does not work here, 
there is perhaps a larger situation in this country where it will 
not work as well, mainly the country of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third preamble also speaks in a positive way of the 
necessity of removing discriminatory barriers to ensure equality. 
This again is in conformity with section 15 of the Canadian 
charter of rights which provides for the possibility of 
legislative assemblies to enact legislation to provide for 
affirmative action programs.  May I say that I fully support this 
principle and I fully support this preamble in its entirety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Evidence Act as addressed by Bill S-5 will provide 
for communication assistance for persons with special 
communication needs, whether it includes sign language, oral 
interpretation, apparatuses such as a Bliss board, assistive 
listening devices and the like. It also allows for persons to 
have individuals present to assist in their use of these devices 
when deemed necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Witnesses with disabilities will then be permitted to identify 
an accused for example by using auditory or tactile methods. This 
is an important step forward and takes us again into the 21st 
century with respect to the use and application of technology in 
our criminal courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These aids were not always readily available.  I would suggest 
it is implicitly good that this legislation makes provision for 
these devices.  It will also of course increase the participation 
of those who are visually challenged in the courtroom.  I believe 
this initiative to that extent speaks equitably to the needs of 
persons with disabilities and I fully support this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also support the principle of the proposals to the effect that 
they will assist persons in their ability to receive protection 
from discrimination.  Again this is an important aspect of the 
bill.  It stresses that those who may experience discrimination 
will not experience further discrimination as a result of taking 
actions to protect themselves. I would suggest that this is 
something we should all fully support and embrace in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill looks at the issue of making our courtrooms more 
accessible and user friendly.  That is a catch phrase that has 
taken on a life of its own, but I think it adequately sums up 
what this bill permits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the amendments as they pertain to the Criminal 
Code, Bill S-5 again has a very good principle behind it.  The 
summary that sets out these objectives will provide persons with 
disabilities greater ability to give testimony in a courtroom 
specifically by using videotapes. 
This is presently available for some but this will expand the 
parameters to allow persons suffering from disabilities to use 
this method of testimony.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Persons with disabilities would also not be excluded from jury 
service.  If by using assistance they can participate in our 
criminal justice system as jurors, I believe that this is an 
implicitly good principle and one which I again embrace fully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the issue of sexual exploitation of a person with 
a disability in a dependent relationship.  This bill makes 
specific changes to identify this as a very important change to 
the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Human Rights Act would be affected with respect to 
Bill S-5 and adds to the human rights act the duty of 
accommodation as an obligation to address the needs of persons 
protected under the act, for example by ensuring that the 
workplace is wheelchair accessible.  I use that simply as one 
example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also requires employers and the providers of services to make 
accommodations for persons with disabilities unless they 
demonstrate that this would cause undue hardship.  I would 
suggest that this is a common sense approach to make allowances 
for persons perhaps in business who may have some reasonable 
explanation for their inability to accommodate. However, at least 
it opens the question and the avenue for both sides of the 
equation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a principle I believe this is a good thing in and of itself 
but there are some questions that this raises.  For example, does 
the provider of the accommodation have the opportunity to 
establish that he or she has a reasonable justification for not 
being able to accommodate?  Why would he or she have to wait 
until the complaint is tabled to try to defend this reason? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In essence it may create a reverse onus situation.  I would 
suggest that this may be something that needs to be tempered or 
looked at at the committee level. The human rights commission 
would basically be the court of final analysis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As previously mentioned in my introduction, the bill also amends 
the Canadian Human Rights Act to recognize that an individual may 
suffer from discrimination on a number of different grounds at 
once.  These grounds of discrimination are listed at section 2 of 
the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It ensures that all incidents of discrimination will be taken 
into account by one tribunal and that each instance of 
discrimination would not necessarily have to be considered in 
isolation or separately.  It would allow for one tribunal to hear 
a case that pertained to one individual in its entirety.  I would 
suggest that this is a common sense approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-5 also provides for a number of administrative changes. 
Among these the Canadian Human Rights Commission will report 
directly to Parliament instead of to the Minister of Justice. 
Once more I think this is in and of itself a good thing and a 
great move toward accountability to the Canadian people through 
through Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ceiling for the maximum limit of compensation for pain and 
suffering or for wilful or reckless discrimination has also been 
raised from $5,000 to $20,000 in keeping up with the economic 
climate of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-5 also reformulates the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal. 
Like my colleague Senator Kinsella who raised this matter in the 
Senate, I have some concerns with section 27 of this bill, 
specifically as it pertains to sections 48 to 53 of the Canadian 
Human Rights Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These sections state that the tribunal will be appointed and 
there will be a number of members who must have experience, 
expertise, interest and sensitivity to human rights. This is 
indeed a welcome suggestion but my concern lies in the fact that 
the amendments will stipulate that members of the tribunal must 
or should be members of a bar of a province or the Chambre des 
notaires du Québec.  I ask the question why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen many tribunals and governing boards.  I even used 
the example of a disciplinary committee of most bars where there 
are lay persons who are participants and members of these 
tribunals.  I as a lawyer myself question why a person would have 
to be a member of a bar to be on this tribunal.  Surely there is 
enough cynicism out there about lawyers having make work programs 
for themselves.  I see you, Mr. Speaker, may have some doubts 
about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this limitation should be studied again at the committee 
level.  There are other administrative tribunals as I suggested 
that have members who are not members of provincial bars.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment proposed to clause 14 of Bill S-5 modifies section 
14 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.  Specifically it adds an 
anti-retaliation clause, something that is unfortunately absent 
from the Canadian Human Rights Act in its present form.  I would 
say that it constitutes a weakness.   An anti-retaliation clause 
means that persons could be discriminated against if they have 
filed a complaint and therefore would be open to retaliation or 
threat of retaliation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By a complainant not having protection from retaliation a person 
would certainly be hesitant to file a complaint in some 
circumstances.   There may have to be some legislative fine 
tuning to define the parameters.  That is not to say that this 
matter should not be approached very cautiously. There is always 
the concern of false complaints being filed against individuals. 
We want to be very careful before we tread into this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, we in the Conservative Party are supportive of 
this legislation.  It seems that the bill deals particularly with 
tribunals and with the provision of persons with protection from 
discrimination. It is good to have an opportunity to discuss the 
issue.  Certainly the questions have to be studied at the 
committee level.  We need to hear from witnesses to discuss some 
of the specifics of the application of the bill, the process it 
will follow.  Generally the criminal justice system and the 
legislation the bill touches upon will benefit from this 
initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It further promotes the expansion of access, which is a very 
important cornerstone of our criminal justice system.  It 
promotes access to the courts, which in many cases can be very 
intimidating for both victims and members of the public as it 
pertains to the jury system.  It expands human rights which have 
to be viewed as an implicit good in and of themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these reasons and the reasons I have stated throughout my 
remarks, I am as supportive of the bill as I am sure all members 
of the House will be. 
<P><A NAME="LINK186"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to add a comment to the remarks that have already been 
made in respect of the bill, an act to amend the Canada Evidence 
Act and the Criminal Code and an act to amend the Canadian Human 
Rights Act.   The topic that is being discussed is very 
important, particularly with respect to persons with 
disabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague mentioned earlier in his remarks the work of 
Senator Kinsella with respect the bill. I have known Senator 
Kinsella for many years, going back to when I was first with the 
Human Rights Commission in Nova Scotia.  At that time Senator 
Noel Kinsella was one of the leading people in the field of human 
rights in New Brunswick.  I think he was the chairperson of the 
New Brunswick Human Rights Commission for a number of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very good at a time when we often hear negative remarks 
about senators to know that we should not jump too quickly to 
paint everybody with the same brush and to see that people like 
Senator Kinsella is carrying forth an interest in which he has 
been involved for many years in a way that is producing some 
positive results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I add my support to the bill.  The remark made by my hon. 
colleague about members of the board being required to be lawyers 
is a very valid concern.  I have been involved for many years 
with administrative law and was not a lawyer.  I have known many 
people who have been involved in tribunals and administrative 
boards.  It is very important to recognize that another 
perspective can come to issues from people who are not lawyers. 
Quite often that perspective that is very useful in determining 
issues of importance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that reservation I my support to the remarks made by both 
the preceding speaker and the hon. member for Dartmouth.

I know mutual admiration and respect flow back and forth between 
those two individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also commend the member for Halifax West for his continuing 
and past work in the area of human rights.  He will do a great 
job for his constituents in that and other areas.  His comments 
are very telling and very relevant.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> It is my duty, pursuant

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo—Alberni, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will be splitting my time with the member for Calgary Southeast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our critic, the member for New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, 
outlined our position on Bill S-5.  I will take a different tack 
and explore where the bill has come from.  It has come from the 
Senate.  The Reform Party position is that it should not be 
coming from there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let examine the history of the Senate.  In the British system it 
is the House of Lords.  Legislation went from the Commons up to 
the Senate and then on to royal assent.  My party believes it is 
not correct to have legislation originating in the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate only represents two of the five parties in the House 
of Commons. There is not fair representation in the Senate. 
Senators are appointed as opposed to members of the House who are 
elected.  Legislation should originate in the House and then 
proceed through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate does not represent the people or the regions as it 
was meant to do.  Senators represent the parties that put them 
into place.  It is unlike members of the House who have to go 
back to their constituents.  Should introduce legislation or 
represent a view our constituents do not like, we do not get 
re-elected.  Senators are there until 75 years of age.  They are 
not accountable for the positions they take. There are no 
constituents to say they did not represent them and they want 
them out of there.  That does not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill by originating in the Senate is flawed.  We support the 
legislation.  We are not talking about the legislation.  It is 
the concept or the principle as to where the legislation is 
coming from.  We believe it should be coming from the House.  We 
are all accountable.  We are all elected.  We represent our 
constituents as opposed to those in the other place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe I have made my point.  I wanted to get it on record. 
There are a number of other bills like Bill S-5.  We will 
continue to push the line of thinking that bills should originate 
from elected representative in the House of Commons. 
<P><A NAME="LINK188"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I listened intently to the comments of my Reform 
colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-5 demonstrates that the Senate can have a significant 
amount of input.  It has moved a very meaningful and important 
piece of legislation which all members of the House seem very 
keen to support.  Could my friend comment on that? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1640"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be very interested to hear his comments with respect to 
whether his party, if it were ever in a position to appoint 
members to the Senate, would have the same opinion that they do 
today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Gilmour:</B>  Mr. Speaker, on the first point, there 
are only two parties represented in the Senate, the Liberals and 
the Conservatives.  When legislation is brought into the Senate, 
the NDP, the Reform and the Bloc do not have representation.  At 
the beginning of the legislation they are not represented.  We 
have the views of two parties as opposed to five.  That is 
unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the second question, we have already had an elected senator, 
Senator Waters of Alberta.  We would like the people of Canada in 
all provinces to be able to elect their senators.  Right now B.C. 
and Alberta have senatorial selection acts in place which allow 
senators to be elected.  Stan Waters was elected in 1989 in a 
municipal election.  A lot of people say the costs are 
horrendous.  The election can be tagged onto an municipal, 
provincial or federal election, so the costs are not huge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concept is that the people of Alberta chose Stan Waters.  We 
think the people of all provinces should choose their senators so 
that they then represent the people that sent them and not the 
party that put them in place. 
<P><A NAME="LINK189"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to speak briefly to Bill S-5, notwithstanding my 
displeasure with the fact that the bill originated in the Senate, 
an issue that I will address in a moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some personal background working with persons with 
disabilities, particularly the severely handicapped in Canada. It 
is a constituency that I am deeply concerned about because the 
handicapped, particularly the severely disabled, are the most 
disadvantaged and disenfranchised when it comes to being able to 
express themselves and to participate fully in political life as 
well as in the judicial system.  These are people who we often 
forget about because their voices are in many cases quite 
literally silent, people who have no voice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For that reason I am delighted with the intent of the bill which 
is to provide special access to those who are disabled, those who 
are handicapped, to our judicial system.  It is a very worthwhile 
objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I worked with an organization called the Neil Squire Foundation 
which develops technology for those who are disabled to better 
communicate and interact with the world. Technology such as the 
ability of high stem non-verbal quadriplegics through complicated 
robotics to type out words and express themselves through 
computer technology is revolutionary technology which is giving a 
voice to those who are quite literally voiceless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The conventions of our judicial system do not always permit 
people who are physically disadvantaged to participate in giving 
evidence at trial and so forth.  For that reason I am delighted 
the government has taken steps after extensive consultation to 
make such provisions in this act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reading the act there are one or two particular provisions I 
am concerned with under the section 2 amendments to the Canadian 
Human Rights Act.  I notice that section 48(1), under the 
amendments to the Canadian Human Rights Act, states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Tribunal which will be appointed and established—the 
members appointed to that Tribunal will be persons who must have 
experience, expertise, interest in and sensitivity to human 
rights. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That seems on its face to be a harmless and sensible provision.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing that concerns me in creating criteria for the 
appointment of people to government bodies is that these criteria 
ought to be open to all Canadians, regardless of their religious 
or conscientious beliefs, to serve on such bodies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This may seem like a bit of a stretch, however, given the recent 
amendments to section 2 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, which 
inserted last year the enumeration of sexual orientation under 
the purpose clause of the act, I can imagine the situation where 
a person deeply concerned about human rights may not agree with 
the principle of sexual orientation as an enumerated ground for 
protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply raise this question because it is conceivable that 
under section 48(1) such an individual could be prohibited from 
taking a seat on the Canadian human rights tribunal.  It is 
conceivable that the appointment of a minister of a particular 
religion, for instance, with certain convictions about the 
question of sexual orientation but who is still deeply dedicated 
to the principles of human rights protection in general could be 
objected to on the basis that human rights, as now defined by 
this act, includes sexual orientation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one of the issues in which we find a potential tension 
between freedom of religion and freedom of conscience, and 
freedom from discrimination based on the grounds enumerated in 
the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply raise that as something for consideration.  Perhaps as 
we proceed with this bill the government could address whether or 
not the criteria for appointment to the tribunal could 
potentially prejudicially affect those who do not agree with all 
the enumerated protections under section 2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having addressed the substance of the bill, I would like to 
speak to the process which is before us today, as has my hon. 
colleague from British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no secret that the Reform Party opposes the current 
operation of and the system of appointments to the Senate. 
However, of course, it is an established part of our 
constitutional framework.  It is something we recognize.  It is 
something we have to work with.  However, there is a longstanding 
convention in this place and in our mother Parliament, a 
convention which is respected by all parliamentary governments, 
that the lower house, the elected house, the House of Commons, is 
the place where legislation ought to originate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an important principle.  We are the commons.  We sit in 
this place representing the people of Canada with a democratic 
mandate.  We are accountable.  Quite frankly, the members of the 
other place are not accountable.  They are accountable to no one 
but themselves.  Witness the atrocious antics of Senator 
Thompson. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other parties may disagree with whether and to what extent the 
Senate should be reformed.  But surely we can all agree that the 
government should do everything within its power to cause all 
legislation to originate in this place, in the democratic house 
of this Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people in this House belong to five recognized political 
parties.  The people in the Senate belong to only two recognized 
political parties.  That means there are three distinct 
perspectives which have gained substantial support from the 
Canadian people, perspectives which are represented and 
articulated in this place every day, which have no presence, no 
representation and no articulation in the Senate.  For that 
reason alone I think it is atrocious that this government would 
ride roughshod over our conventions, over our traditions and over 
the democratic legitimacy of this House by allowing such 
legislation as this worthy bill to originate in the other place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply want to put myself on the record as saying that I 
believe close to 100% of my constituents believe that the other 
place should either be reformed and elected or, if not, 
abolished. 
They do not, I believe, want to see that place legitimized 
through the introduction of government legislation. And so I add 
this caveat. While I am pleased with my colleagues to support 
this bill, I am displeased, to say the least, that we have to 
continually fight against this government's effort to legitimize 
this unelected and unaccountable Senate.

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to attempt to be as fair as I can to the federal 
government.  To a large extent, the government's involvement up 
to this point has been marginal.  I think it has been marginal 
for a number reasons, the biggest one being that the provincial 
government has never basically kept the Department of Transport 
abreast of what has been actually happening in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To provide the House with an overview of what has been 
happening, the Saint Croix River is an international heritage 
river.  It was designated a heritage river by the Government of 
Canada back in the early 1990s.  A plan was submitted by the 
province of New Brunswick to ensure that this heritage river 
designation was in place.  I was part of the process of 
designating that river a heritage river. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now what we have is a group of individuals from the United 
States coming up with a plan to create one of the most offensive 
environmental undertakings that one could imagine on that river. 
They have basically been given a blank cheque by the province of 
New Brunswick to do so.  Again, there has been a lot of debate in 
New Brunswick on this very project. In the summer months of 1997 
it was front page news in all the provincial newspapers in New 
Brunswick for a number of weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently I wrote a letter to the premier of New Brunswick 
stating some of our concerns, my concern as a member of 
Parliament and the concerns of others who are doing business in 
that area.  Landowners and a group of international citizens 
called the Saint Croix River citizens committee have taken 
offence to what the government in the province of New Brunswick 
wants to do there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This story goes back a number of years to when a company from Nova 
Scotia, related by the way to the leader of the NDP, the L.E. Shaw 
group of companies, a very reputable company I might add, 
proposed doing a similar type of business, a quarrying business 
on the banks of the Saint Croix River in the Bayside Ports area. 
The company, Shaw Industries Limited, is a very respected 
company.  At the time, it stated that if the citizens of the area 
were against this type of project happening it would abandon all 
plans for that type of development.  Mr. Ken Hardy, speaking on 
behalf of the company, stated publicly that it was no the way 
they did business.  If the people in the area did not want this 
type of development he was not going to do it.  He kept his word. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The company in question, the Shaw company, originally had to 
spend $250,000 to develop a plan for this quarry.  It had to go 
through a public tendering process, a call for tenders, to come 
up with a plan for this.  So there was a public involvement or a 
public tendering process so that all companies in Canada could 
bid on that project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, when the Shaw company decided not to do the deal, aside 
from the fact that it honoured its commitment to not do the deal 
if the people were against it, it also could not secure markets 
in the United States.  This can be verified by the Shaw group. 
The United States aggregate market is a very tough market to 
break into.  The company could never penetrate the U.S. market 
for aggregate materials.  It also had the problem, if it had 
proceeded, that it did not have a market.  However, it did not 
proceed because it was sensitive to the public outcry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have now is a company from the New York-New Jersey 
waterfront entertaining doing the same thing.  Lo and behold, it 
did not have to go through any public tendering process.  It did 
not have to submit a proposal.  It was invited to come up and 
take a look at the project by none other than the former minister 
of economic development in the province of New Brunswick, Al 
Lacey, obviously a former cabinet minister in the government of 
Frank McKenna. 
He was a minister at the time the Shaw group proposed doing this. 
He was looking for business interests.  His job was to secure 
business interests.  He was a paid lobbyist on behalf of the 
group out of New York and New Jersey.  He went down there with a 
magnificent plan for these people to move into Canada and do a 
piece of business.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Lo and behold he was successful at bringing them into New 
Brunswick without having to publicly tender or submit proposals 
on anything.  Those doors were all knocked down for the Waterman 
group.  They simply came and said what they would do.  Mr. Al 
Lacey was to lead their cause.  Obviously they would get the type 
of co-operation they needed from the province of New Brunswick, 
and they have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is disturbing to the folks living along that international 
body of water on both sides is that the proponents lied publicly about 
what they want to do.  I mentioned this in the House before. This 
is where Transport Canada, led by the former minister, had a proposal to 
take over, to assume ownership of that port and that quarrying 
facility.  It was a document that the premier of the province of 
New Brunswick actually denied existed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chief spokesman for the company, Al Lacey, the paid 
lobbyist, a former minister of the crown in the province of New 
Brunswick, lied publicly.  He lied to the media.  He lied to 
business interests.  He lied to me as member of Parliament on 
their true intentions of taking over that port.  Lo and behold 
lies will eventually catch up with you.  We know that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A 40 page document was leaked to me indicating step by step, 
inch by inch, how the group would take over the port, the group 
out of New York and New Jersey, and owned by a man by the name of 
Randy Waterman.  When that document surfaced they all scurried 
like rats trying to get away from it, but they could not.  They 
were videotaped on national television lying through their teeth 
on what were their true intentions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government continued its sort of conspiracy of silence. 
There is no transparency at all in this process.  It simply 
pursued the course it was intent on pursuing and not deviating 
from to make sure that this group out of New York and New Jersey, 
led by Mr. Waterman and represented by Mr. Al Lacey, would get 
their way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They lied on their intention to take over the port.  Their 40 
page document amounts to nothing more than what I call economic 
blackmail.  I will table it in the House for all to examine. They 
state that unless they get full and complete ownership of the 
port they will abandon their plan to take over the port. That 
amounts to economic blackmail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The local people were absolutely outraged when that secret 
document surfaced, indicating that they wanted to take over the 
port.  It did not end there.  What has happened in the meantime 
is that they went after the provincial government.  They said 
that maybe they would not abandon their plans to assume 
ownership of the port if they struck a better deal.  The better 
deal was to give them the land.  They would do the job and 
compete with other American interests located in other parts of 
North America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have actually achieved what I call the ultimate in economic 
blackmail.  Now the province is entertaining selling them the 
lands.  The lands in question are not federal lands.  They would 
be provincial lands that would be handed over to the company for 
a 40 year project.  In other words, the life of this project 
would be 40 years.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This sounds quite bizarre but it is accurate.  Two weeks of 
mining this aggregate at the price they would be receiving for 
the aggregate in the United States would actually pay for the 
cost of the entire package of land on which they want to do the 
40 year deal.  That is absolutely bizarre.  This is better than 
giving them the land.  They are selling it to them at what we 
would consider a bargain basement price.  It is a deal made in 
heaven for these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do these people get their foot in the doors of government in 
the province of New Brunswick?  It still has a democratic process 
where things like this have to be debated and talked out in a 
public forum.  There was a complete conspiracy of silence in the 
province of New Brunswick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of economic development refused to provide me with 
information.  He does not correspond with a member of Parliament 
representing people living in that area.  A brick wall has been 
put up between the government of the province of New Brunswick 
and me and the citizens group representing citizens up and down 
both sides of that international water.  There is something wrong 
in the process when that happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who are these people?  That is a big question.  I had serious 
discussions with the FBI and the RCMP.  There are a lot of 
unanswered questions about these companies as represented by Mr. 
Randy Waterman and owned by Mr. Randy Waterman.  They are big and 
they are powerful.  They operate out of New York and New Jersey. 
That should tell us something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They basically have a cartel.  They actually control the 
aggregate business in the east coast of the United States.  It is 
impossible for foreign interests to import aggregate into the 
United States.  Hence, the inability of the Shaw group to 
establish markets there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a fellow by the name of Al Lacey.  I would not consider 
Al to be a stupid man.  He is certainly not stupid.  He heard the 
bells and whistles and immediately said he knew a group 
that could do this deal.  They can establish markets.  They can 
make this thing profitable but they happen to live outside 
Canada.  They happen to be one of those families down in the 
United States that have been very successful in the aggregate 
business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The worst of all deals possible is taking place at the moment in 
the province of New Brunswick because its government does not 
care about transparency when it comes to business with 
individuals, in many cases individuals of ill repute.  If we look 
at the legacy of the government of the province of New Brunswick 
in the last 10 years, a number of deals have gone flat, have gone 
belly up, because it had not done its homework.  The FBI and 
other police officials in the area have suspicions about these 
people and what their true motives might be in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggested that the premier of the province of New Brunswick 
should undertake a full scale investigation which the citizens 
committee has demanded from day one.  The government has been 
reluctant to do that.  I do not think it wants to know the truth. 
The people in that area demand to know what is going on. They 
deserve full and complete transparency in that entire piece of 
business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is incumbent upon the Government of Canada, the Department of 
Transport and the minister to say there are a lot of unanswered 
questions, some of which were recently brought to their 
attention, that need to be complied with.  As I said at the 
outset, I do not think the province of New Brunswick has been 
full and complete in the information provided to the minister and 
the department.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my nine years of serving the constituents of Hamilton West in 
the House of Commons I have never heard a more self-serving 
speech than the one just enunciated by the member for Charlotte, 
than the previous questions asked and the past speech made by the 
hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This reminds me to ask the hon. member how his relationship is 
after his recent foray into the role of mudslinger.  His 
constituents should know via the news media in the New Brunswick 
area that the member for Charlotte has cast a lot of innuendo 
around this project.  He has degraded the personal and business 
ethics of respected individuals who have taken an interest in 
developing this port improvement project at Bayside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The project responded to a request from the province of New 
Brunswick.  It would have created much needed jobs and economic 
activity in New Brunswick.  It has received environmental 
approval. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was halfway expecting the member for Charlotte to apologize 
today to the federal government, to the province, to the 
companies and to the individuals he brought into disrepute.  I 
expected him to ultimately admit his conflict of interest in the 
matter and to explain to his constituents and people across the 
country that his home is situated on a piece of land located next 
to the port property he is so concerned about.  Imagine that.  No 
conflict there.  Regrettably the hon. member chose not to 
withdraw his motion today.  That is why I have to say what I have 
said here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us address the motion by the hon. member who is so concerned 
about the involvement of Transport Canada in a quarry development 
project adjacent to the port of Bayside, New Brunswick.  The 
entire quarry project as proposed by Charlotte County Ports 
Limited would be situated on land owned by the province of New 
Brunswick and not by Transport Canada.  Approvals for such 
development fall under the jurisdiction of the province of New 
Brunswick and not the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only involvement by the government is that Transport Canada 
is presently the owner of an adjacent facility that could be 
utilized for shipping the quarry products to international 
markets.  In that regard Transport Canada has accepted for 
consideration an application for a remission of rates on the 
applicable wharfage tariff.  That is as far as our involvement 
goes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transport Canada received a request to lease a section of land 
that would permit the stone to be loaded directly on to ships for 
transportation to market.  Regulations require that such requests 
be submitted to the department for consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both these requests have been reviewed in the context that they 
would expand the existing private-public partnership and would 
ultimately benefit the port through substantially increased 
revenues and the creation of badly needed additional outside 
storage area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, due to the significant divestiture process being made 
under the national marine policy, the request for the lease has 
been put on hold.  The application for a remission of rates has 
been denied as it did not meet the criteria specified in the 
remission of or substitution of rate regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transport Canada is currently negotiating the transfer of the 
Bayside port facilities under the national marine policy and its 
divestiture program.  The national marine policy will ensure 
Canada has the modern marine transportation it needs to compete 
in the 21st century.  It will help to ensure that shippers have 
access to safe marine transportation, that the service levels 
reflect realistic demand and that the users who pay have more say 
in the future of their port. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past Canada's port system was heavily subsidized by 
Canadian taxpayers.  It suffered from overcapacity and too much 
bureaucracy.  Under the national marine policy the government 
will no longer dictate port operations or local business 
decisions.  At the same time the Government of Canada will 
continue in a regulatory role its commitment to a safe marine 
transportation system and a clean environment.

port of Bayside, is being transferred to provincial governments,

in this proposed project is very minimal.  I think we heard that 
from the hon. member when he first spoke.  It is limited to being 
the existing owners of an adjacent facility that could be used to 
export the material. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that decisions on the port's future will be left up to 
local operators, I cannot support the member's motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is unfortunate that we are today reduced to debating 
one isolated example of insider lobbying in a proposed 
divestiture deal because the problem is pervasive. It almost 
invariably accompanies any sort of privatization negotiations in 
this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why Reformers temper our firm belief in the benefits of 
privatization with a demand that safeguards be legislated which 
are applicable to all privatization deals, not only to control 
lobbying, but to prevent the improper disposal of public 
assets to clients or cronies of powerful politicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last summer Doug Young's successor as defence minister 
criticized Somalia inquiry commissioner Peter Desbarats for 
writing a book on his experiences with the inquiry.  Apparently 
the minister found it unseemly that Mr. Desbarats would profit 
from information gained, as the minister put it, “at public 
expense and as part of the performance of a public duty”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet scarcely a month after leaving office Mr. Young was doing 
exactly that.  He was selling his experience. On the night of his 
electoral defeat a reporter asked Doug Young what his plans were 
and he said “I can tell you one thing.  I am not going on EI”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, Mr. Young and fellow defeated New Brunswick Liberal Paul 
Zed set up shop in Ottawa under the name of Summa Strategies 
Canada Inc. as Sparks Street lobbyists.  Between the two of them 
they have racked up an impressive number of clients. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is very interesting.  When they were in power, neither 
Young nor Zed had anything good to say about lobbyists.  In fact 
they declared war on the profession.  Canadians were assured that 
the Liberals would just say no to lobbyists.  The current Prime 
Minister said that during his tenure nobody would need to hire a 
lobbyist to press for access to his government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young denounced the Conservative government's Pearson airport 
contract as the work of lobbyists.  With a bit of deeper digging 
they found some Liberals in the pile and they backed away from 
that.

Transport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  I 
would like to understand how it is that this member's 
intervention has anything to do with private member's Motion No. 
282. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  It sounded to me like the hon. member 
was reciting a chronology of events which was discussed by the 
two members who spoke previously in this debate. I am reluctant 
to interrupt the hon. member.  He may not be addressing the 
motion directly, but I am sure he is about to. 
As I said, the point of his debate has been similar to the points 
raised by other hon. members in the debate already, so I am 
reluctant to intervene.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, thank you for your 
intervention.  I assure you I am leading to the heart of the 
matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once the government's hearings on lobbying got started, the 
complexity of the lobbying activities became very apparent. Then 
despite all the strong words promising to clean up the system, 
the Lobbyists Registration Act failed to live up to expectations. 
Once installed on the other side of the House, the Liberals 
decided that not all lobbying was a bad thing.  The final 
legislation avoided issues such as restricting frequency of 
contacts or limiting fund raising activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, Young is prohibited for two years from 
meeting with officials in the departments of defence and human 
resources development because he presided over them during his 
last year in government.  He is however free to lobby officials 
in other departments, including transport where he spent most of 
his tenure here in the last Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rules also prevent Mr. Young from discussing the business of 
his clients with any minister who handles the same portfolio that 
he or she held as Young's cabinet colleague. Therefore, the 
industry and finance ministers are off limits but there is 
nothing to stop Mr. Young from approaching the ministers of 
transport or trade on behalf of a client. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young is also restricted to giving advice on matters already in 
the public domain. Theoretically he cannot make use of specific 
knowledge of programs or policies he might possess by virtue of 
previous positions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, none of these restrictions apply to Mr. Zed because 
he served as a mere parliamentary secretary in the last 
government and he is available for front man. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of Summa Strategies' first clients was very familiar to Mr. 
Young, CNR which he privatized in 1995.  The president and CEO of 
CN, Paul Tellier, was the former Clerk of the Privy Council, one 
of the most powerful people in Ottawa.  I cannot help 
but wonder what he could possibly learn or gain from hiring Mr. 
Young. Other Summa Strategies clients include the RCMP, the 
Prince Rupert Grain Company, and SNC-Lavalin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Interestingly, a company called Defence Remediation Inc. which 
is a land mine clearing company is listed as a client of Summa 
Strategies. I guess it will have to wait until June 1999 before 
Doug Young with all his department of defence expertise can 
represent it personally. Right now he can only deal with 
transport matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about Charlotte County Ports Inc., a front company 
which wants to acquire control of one of the few profitable local 
ports in Canada, Bayside port, on behalf of a very muscular New 
Jersey based supplier of construction aggregate. The only thing 
Canadian about Charlotte County Ports aside from its registration 
is another ex-politician, a former New Brunswick Liberal cabinet 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To digress momentarily, it is impossible to talk about Doug 
Young's post-parliamentary activities without touching on the 
very smelly Maritime Road Development Corporation's New Brunswick 
highway deal. In this instance, he was not representing a client 
but a consortium which he himself was the head of, at least until 
he realized that a former federal minister cannot work for a 
company or project that had been directly affected by his 
decisions as minister until two years after leaving office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because MRDC will be collecting tolls on a stretch of highway 
built under the 1995 federal-provincial highway agreement which 
Young oversaw as transport minister, he changed hats. Instead of 
being president, he is now chairman of the board since January 
22. Obviously switching positions is not the answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, the federal ethics commissioner does not believe 
that Mr. Young's highway activities violate the code of ethics 
because Ottawa is not in charge of the project.  Just as it does 
not own the land surrounding Bayside port, because Ottawa is not 
in charge of the project and did not select the contractors who 
would build it. I feel a lot better.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The term lobbying comes from the lobby outside the House of 
Commons in the British parliament buildings.  It was there that 
interested parties and petitioners would try to capture the 
attention of members of Parliament before they went in to cast 
their votes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a sign of the diminishing role of Canadian members of 
Parliament that we do not find any lobbyists in this lobby. 
Everyone in Canada knows perfectly well that the real government 
decisions take place far from the House of Commons so lobbyists 
concentrate on people in the PMO, key cabinet ministers and 
senior bureaucrats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If nothing else, the large number of lobbying firms in this 
town, even though they do not ever appear in the lobby, is a 
testament to how far our system has moved away from control by 
the ordinary citizens.  The influence on public servants is 
particularly disturbing as they are out of the public eye and not 
subject to elections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Firms like Summa make their money by trading on knowledge and 
contacts of their principals about the inner workings of 
government.  They tend to be providing advice to clients and 
opening doors or making representations on their behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question we must ask ourselves which should make the 
government squirm is could Doug Young and Paul Zed be successful 
lobbyists if the Liberals had not won the election? What exactly 
do they have to sell? 
<P><A NAME="LINK200"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I could 
say ditto and you would have heard much of what I am going to 
say, but there is a saying that it takes three times to make a 
bad habit and twelve repetitions to break it.  I think we are 
going to need 12 times a lot to break the bad habits that the 
Liberals have gotten into. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise today to support the private member's motion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
undertake a review of the federal Department of Transport's role 
in the Charlotte County Ports Inc. quarry project. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the debate on C-9, I listened with great interest to the 
speech from the member for Charlotte on the Bayside port in New 
Brunswick.  I have actually had the opportunity to be there and 
it is a beautiful area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bayside port is a small port on the Saint Croix River, an 
international body of tidal waters.  It is very well situated for 
shipping with close access to U.S. markets.  It is one of 
Canada's most profitable ports but the Canadian government wants 
to privatize the ports. The Bayside port makes a significant 
contribution to the continuing regional and economic growth in 
New Brunswick.  It is a vital element in the communities in 
southwestern New Brunswick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it somewhat insulting to have the parliamentary secretary 
suggest that the area where the port is located has no real 
aspect in this whole deal of the Charlotte quarry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Charlotte has made interesting remarks during his 
speeches concerning the group from New York and New Jersey 
wanting to take over the Bayside port.  No point getting into 
that because we should not be worrying about what the Americans 
do. What we need to worry about is what our government is not 
doing. It is not protecting Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go back to 1994 when the quarry project was first 
proposed by L.E. Shaw.  That company had to drop its plans 
because it could not break into the sand and gravel market in the 
U.S.  The only way to get into that business if one wants to ship 
to the U.S. is to be owned by the Americans.  Surprise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have an American company, a large American conglomerate 
whose plans are to take over the Canadian port.  This by itself 
is something but add the fact that this American company hired 
two former members of this House, one of them being the former 
transport minister, to lobby the federal government to allow the 
transfer of the Bayside port into their hands, and now we really 
have something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I am supporting this motion.  Doug Young as former 
transport minister initiated the national marine policy which 
calls for the divestiture of our Canadian ports.  Now that he has 
put the privatization process in place, he and ex-MP Paul Zed are 
going to personally profit from it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Calling for a review of Transport Canada's role in the Charlotte 
County Ports Inc. quarry project is reasonable when a former 
transport minister is involved in lobbying his ancient colleagues 
in Ottawa or his Liberal friends in power in New Brunswick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a lack of transparency in the quarry project. 
Were other companies allowed to bid?  Have there been independent 
environmental studies?  The people of New Brunswick deserve 
better than this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 2 last year the voters of Acadie—Bathurst decided not 
to send Doug Young back to Parliament.  That should tell the 
government something.  When the voters in someone's own area know 
enough not to put him back here, nobody should be listening to 
him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But it seems, as the </I>Globe and Mail<I> put it, Doug Young has 
remained in the power game. The knowledge he got while at 
Transport Canada is proving to be very profitable for him because 
the Bayside Ports situation is not the only situation.  While 
transport minister Doug Young finalized the privatization of 
Canadian National railway, guess who was his first client at the 
consulting firm, as the House heard from my colleague from the 
Reform Party: Paul Tellier, chairman and chief executive officer 
of CN. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not all.  In 1995 Doug Young, while he was in the federal 
cabinet, made a deal with the province of New Brunswick, a 
federal-provincial highway agreement. Have I got a deal for 
you.  Now Doug Young heads the international consortium 
Maritime Road Development Corp. which was awarded a contract to 
build a four lane divided highway in southern New Brunswick. The 
province of New Brunswick will then lease the road from the 
private owners and travellers will have to pay tolls on the 195 
kilometre stretch, including the 23 kilometre section built as 
part of the highway agreement signed by Doug Young in 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the next 30 years it is estimated New Brunswick taxpayers 
and the travelling public will pay out $2.6 billion in lease 
payments and tolls.  They are going to pay tolls to a company 
headed by Doug Young, former transport minister, to drive on a 
section of highway that was funded by the federal and provincial 
governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hard to believe this is not a conflict of interest.  Doug 
Young will be benefiting at the expense of New Brunswickers.  We 
could have read in the newspaper that the present Minister of 
Transport has asked the deputy minister to begin discussions with 
provincial counterparts to find ways of protecting future public 
investments in highways when they are transferred to private 
hands.  If that is not reason enough to question Doug Young's 
credibility, nothing is. I commend the Minister of Transport for 
his action but we need to go further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go back to the member for Charlotte's motion.  That lack 
of transparency in the Charlotte County Ports Inc. quarry project 
is also often lacking in the public partnership deals.  The New 
Brunswick minister of justice acknowledged the need for both 
government and business to understand these transactions require 
greater transparency in order to ensure public trust as well as 
guard the public interest.  That is a very important point 
because politicians do not have public trust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Brunswick auditor general's report called for a halt to 
these projects until there is genuine analysis of the real 
benefit to the province's citizens from this approach to the 
delivery of government services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government should take note of these words of 
caution too, as there are more and more public and private 
partnerships happening.  Just last evening I met with people in 
Happy Valley, Goose Bay, Labrador regarding the alternative 
service delivery in the privatizing of that base. I heard 
concerns from that community very similar to the questionable 
actions in my aforementioned statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, I reiterate my support for the member's motion. 
There has not been enough transparency in the Charlotte County 
Ports Inc. quarry project and I believe a review would be 
advisable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Before we carry on 
with debate, I apologize to the hon. member for Churchill again 
for missing her constituency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since there is no further debate, as is customary in Private 
Members' Business on a non-votable motion, the member raising the 
motion is given five minutes to rebut.   But it is clearly 
understood that when the member has his five minutes that is the 
end of the debate.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):</B> Mr. speaker, I 
appreciate the members who spoke on behalf of my motion.  I do 
want to take the parliamentary secretary to task for some of the 
things he said.  I can understand, coming from the Hamilton 
harbour area, how he might have dredged up some of his remarks. 
It would not be uncommon.  The member has engaged in that type of 
activity many times in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his remarks it was only when he deviated from the written 
word prepared by the minister's department that he got in 
trouble.  When he speaks off the top of his head and he has to 
speak on his own, he always gets in trouble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to take him to task on some of the things he said in 
this House which are not accurate.  He buys into every single 
thing the people from New York and New Jersey have said about 
this project.  Shame on him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is time he did his own investigative work on this 
project.  What he talked about is the number of jobs that would 
be created in this deal.  Do you know what it would be?  Five 
jobs, as indicated by the first spokesman for the group as 
represented by the Randy Waterman interests.  His name was Wayne 
Lockhart. In a public meeting he said to a citizens group there would 
be five jobs.  Why?  Because it is not labour intensive.  It is 
done by the use of the biggest equipment known to mankind, so 
there are not a lot of jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was not good enough.  How are five jobs going to get the 
interest of any community?  How is a community going to get 
excited over five jobs given the fact that they could decimate a 
pristine historic river?  They went back to the drawing board. 
When they presented their papers to the province of New Brunswick 
for submission for the project, the five jobs had suddenly grown 
to 50 jobs on the same project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is where the parliamentary secretary should have done his 
work.  The investigation of any quarry site, any aggregate site, 
based on the amount of volume they are going to do out of this 
quarry, in North America would be five jobs.  They used an 
exaggerated number of jobs to gain the attention of the province 
of New Brunswick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the loudmouth from Hamilton speaks and claims that I have a 
conflict of interest because I live in the area, he is absolutely 
correct.  I carried this fight on long before I arrived in this 
House.  I am working on behalf of my constituents. I am not going 
to lay over and play dead because of the big boys from New York 
and New Jersey. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know where this guy is getting his information, but I 
will tell members one thing.  It is not coming from the citizens 
of the area that I represent.  He is being fed information 
directly out of New York and New Jersey to support their case. 
There is a direct funnel into the heart of the government of the 
province of New Brunswick via Al Lacey, a former member of the 
crown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this particular case, as the Reform member mentioned, Doug 
Young, a paid lobbyist, is on the record as working on behalf of 
these people. A former minister of the crown actually was the 
architect for the privatization act.  If he is going to speak 
about the project, if he is going to speak about individuals, he 
should get his facts right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The environmental process used in the province of New Brunswick 
is a flawed process.  The citizens of the area asked for a full 
scale independent environmental assessment of the project. That 
is all they asked for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do they have?  They have an in-house process that actually 
flies in the face of scientific information provided.  In fact, 
the citizens of the area hired two certified geologists to 
examine the area in question.  Do members know what they found? 
Three fault lines in the area, two of which run through the very 
businesses in the area, which the province of New Brunswick or 
the proponents of the project have never declared publicly.  Why? 
Because they would upset the very businesses in the area, one 
being owned by Moore Clark, one being owned by a company 
called Woodstock Cold Storage, and others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is documented by two certified geologists that this project 
would endanger those very businesses and the infrastructure in 
the area, information absolutely overlooked by the parliamentary 
secretary and all the environmentalists on the payroll of the 
province of New Brunswick.

literary critic Northrop Frye stated:  “If Canadian universities 
are underfunded so badly they can no longer function effectively, 
Canada would disappear overnight from modern history and become 
again what it was at first, a blank area of natural resources to 
be exploited by more advanced countries”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our youth deserve a quality, accessible educational system. I 
will soon be visiting students in my riding at Sir John A. 
Macdonald high school and I wish I could bring them encouraging 
news about the future of education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our youth are increasingly faced with a deteriorating, less 
accessible education system.  It is a crisis that the people in 
my riding of Halifax West, people throughout Nova Scotia and 
people across the country will increasingly suffer from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a mysterious complex problem with unknown elaborate 
solutions.  This Liberal government has cut federal funding from 
post-secondary education by $1.5 billion since 1995 alone.  The 
average student debt is $25,000.  Shame on this government for 
trying to dig the country out of debt by dumping the problem on 
to the backs of our youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government cannot hide the truth from Canadians, that 
it is pushing for the privatization of our post-secondary 
institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the Minister of Finance about this.  I informed him that 
Human Resources Development Canada predicts that by the year 2000 
45% of new jobs will require 16 years of education.  I also 
referred him to a government study which shows that since 1980 
public transfers for education have been cut in half, from $6.44 
for each dollar of student fees in 1980 to less than $3 in 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the government thinks that youth today are more wealthy 
than the youth of the early 1980s.  If so, I invite the Minister 
of Finance and his staff in Halifax to show me where these hoards 
of youth with excess wealth are hiding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister, in his response to my question, began talking 
about how parents could save more through RESPs.  Then he went on 
to talk about tax credits to help pay tuition.  Again I wish to 
refer the minister to all of the people in my riding without work 
who, whether parents or children, cannot bear the thought of 
mounting $25,000 in student debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The youth of Halifax West deserve the opportunity to learn and 
to develop skills to build a future, as do all the youth of 
Canada.  We cannot afford to risk their future or ours by wasting 
their talents or by creating more financial barriers to 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to go on record as challenging the Minister of Finance 
and the Liberal government to adopt the following principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accessibility should be a new national standard in higher 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Post-secondary education is a right, not a privilege for the 
declining number of people who can actually afford it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principles of accessibility and affordability should guide 
any reforms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Student aid should be based on need rather than merit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A national system of grants for post-secondary education should 
be a priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tuition fees should be frozen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is high time to move to a system involving grants for 
post-secondary education and to ensure that eligibility for 
grants is based solely on need and not the short term demands of 
mega corporations which are increasingly driving our research and 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a first step of goodwill toward the future of our youth, and 
thus of the country, the government should immediately commit to 
reinvest in education, starting with this year's drastic and 
hurtful cut of $550 million.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the government's commitment to 
the economic future of Canadians is clear.  Assistance to those 
who need it in order to prepare for the jobs of the future is the 
linchpin of our policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year provinces will receive $25.2 billion under the Canada 
health and social transfer, which covers federal contributions to 
post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As promised in the recent election, the government will increase 
cash transfers to the provinces so that over the 1997-98 to 
2002-03 period provinces will receive nearly $7 billion in extra 
cash compared to the previously projected levels.  This was only 
possible because the government had already taken tough decisions 
on the deficit and the Minister of Finance had met the targets 
set out in successive budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1996-97 budget increased tax assistance to higher education. 
The measures included the extension of the tuition tax credit, 
enriched treatment of registered education savings plans, and 
allowed single parents attending school to claim the child care 
expense deduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By 1998 the average post-secondary student will receive about 
$1,200 in combined federal-provincial tax assistance each year, 
in effect an increase of 30% from the $900 received before these 
measures were put in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are significant changes.  In the Chamber hon. members 
recently heard the Prime Minister announce the creation of the 
Canada millennium scholarship fund.  The fund will provide 
assistance to Canadians pursuing education and skills upgrading. 
We will be giving a helping hand to low and middle income 
Canadians who are eager to meet the challenges of the 21st 
century labour market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said in the opening remarks, the government's commitment is 
quite clear.  The measures that we have and will put in place 
will give Canadians the tools to build a better future.  We are 
certainly committed to ensure that Canadians and young people 
have an opportunity to improve their skills and access to 
education.  We have committed to that before.  We will continue 
to do so as we move forward.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on 
December 1, 1997 I asked the President of the Treasury Board 
whether the government would settle the pay equity dispute 
fairly, once and for all, or signal to the public that pay equity 
dead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under federal jurisdiction section 11 of the Canadian Human 
Rights Act provides that it is discriminatory practice for an 
employer to establish or maintain differences in wages between 
male and female employees who perform work of equal value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1984 the Public Service Alliance of Canada filed a pay equity 
complaint on behalf of its members.  They are still waiting for 
their money in 1998.  We have all had the honour of listening to 
every excuse imaginable as to why it has not been done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past 14 years the Public Service Alliance of Canada and 
the Treasury Board have been through four years of joint 
union-management pay equity study, almost six years of hearings 
before a Canadian human rights tribunal and months of fruitless 
negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1993 federal election the Liberals promised that if 
elected they would stop the stalling tactics of the Conservative 
government and work on an acceptable solution.  I guess that was 
just another one of those promises the electors need to forget 
once the polling stations close. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals' idea of a solution was to continue the stalling 
tactics before the human rights tribunal.  When that did not work 
they put some money on the table.  The money is an amount which 
only partially closes the wage gap between male and female 
salaries for work of equal value.  They are hoping that time will 
be on their side and that their employees will be forced to wait 
so long for pay equity that they will agree to any amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a perception that big business and the wealthy can tie 
things up in court through appeals for so long that it either 
breaks the small business or an average person runs out of money 
or dies.  I do not think Canadians ever expected this to be the 
tactic of our government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see it with the Singer workers in Quebec.  Government members 
do not care that they will be in their graves before that is 
settled.  If they did they would have resolved it by now.  We are 
still seeing it with the workers affected by the human rights 
decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did Mr. Mulroney have as much trouble getting his money?  Did 
the government wait 14 years to pay $474 million in cancellation 
fees to get out of the EH-101 helicopter deal?  Will it take 14 
years to finalize the Pearson International pay up?  I think not. 
Why are they being paid and not the workers?  Because government 
workers are ordinary Canadians, low and middle income Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In December the President of the Treasury Board misrepresented 
facts.  At the same time that PSAC representatives were meeting 
with Treasury Board officials to continue the talks on pay 
equity, the President of the Treasury Board was conducting a 
press conference announcing that the negotiations were to end.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government did not want to find a way to settle the dispute. 
The offer put forward by the Treasury Board fails to comply with 
the Canadian Human Rights Act and pay equity guidelines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Have we reached a point where we have to go to the Department of 
Justice to encourage the government to comply with the law?   Can 
Canadians trust that the government will comply with the decision

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is time to set the 
record straight.  We have nothing to be ashamed of when it comes 
to pay equity.  We have made a firm offer of $1.3 billion to 
settle this longstanding dispute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The union hides behind a smokescreen of rhetoric and refuses to 
have its members vote on this offer.  The union leadership 
demands are in excess of $5 billion.  The PSAC leadership says 
that it cannot in good conscience present the offer to its 
members.  We believe its members should have an opportunity to 
decide on their own what is a fair and equitable settlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has the responsibility to protect and balance the 
interest of all Canadians.  As such we must ensure that pay 
equity payments respond to legal requirements.  The government is 
firmly committed to a principle of pay equity and wants to have a 
fair and equitable solution to this dispute with PSAC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Treasury Board has shown considerable flexibility in its 
negotiations.  In April we tabled an offer valued at $843 
million.  In August we enhanced it to $1.3 billion in a further 
effort to reach a negotiated settlement with PSAC.  The 
government believes a negotiated settlement will be in the best 
interest of all parties and would end the uncertainty for 
employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tribunal decision will most likely leave some issues 
unresolved which will require further discussion with PSAC.  This 
means further delays.  It may require that the parties file for 
judicial review on the decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Negotiations allow the employer and PSAC to resolve this matter 
and show that it must be accomplished to resolve these issues.  A 
joint resolution would get the cheques in the hands of employees 
sooner and would be in everyone's best interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Give the workers a vote.  Let us not hide behind rhetoric.  Let 
the workers decide now.

the House is now deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly, this
