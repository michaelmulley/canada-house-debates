</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay—Okanagan, Ref.)</B> moved for 
leave to introduce Bill C-267, an act to amend the Canada Health 
Act (conditions for contributions). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, my bill is actually a notification 
protocol for emergency response workers who come in contact with 
infectious diseases.  These people put their lives on the line 
for us when attending accidents.  If they come into contact with 
an infectious disease, no protocol allows them to be notified 
because of a concern for the patient's confidentiality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My bill is designed to provide that protocol while still 
providing the confidentiality necessary.  It uses the vehicle of 
the Canada Health Act to initiate the program.  Once initiated it 
would not require further pressure, as it were, from the Canada 
Health Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill was previously introduced by the NDP in a previous 
Parliament as well as by myself in the last Parliament.  It was 
supported obviously by us and by them, and by the Liberal 
government when it sat as the official opposition prior to 1993. 
I hope all members will co-operate in the swift passage of this 
bill as it is critical for those who are defending our needs.

I rise on a point of order.  The bill just introduced by the 
member for West Kootenay—Okanagan is critically urgent for 
emergency response workers.  They put their lives on the line to 
protect Canadian citizens.  They happen to be meeting in Ottawa 
this week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member mentioned, his bill was previously introduced by 
the NDP.  It was supported by the Liberals when they were in

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA-YUKON OIL AND GAS ACCORD IMPLEMENTATION ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK15">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK16"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Kilgour (for the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development)</B> moved that Bill C-8, an act respecting 
an accord between the Governments of Canada and the Yukon 
Territory relating to the administration and control of and 
legislative jurisdiction in respect of oil and gas, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK17"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise to address the House on Bill C-8, the Canada-Yukon oil and 
gas accord implementation act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am extremely pleased to be introducing to the House yet 
another bill which reflects the changing political circumstances 
in Yukon. I know that my hon. colleagues will want to join me in 
supporting and applauding the territorial government's ambition 
to take a new provincial-type responsibility at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are exciting times in Yukon, which is in the midst of a 
number of historic developments.  The 35th Parliament dealt with 
land claims and self-government legislation for Yukon's First 
Nations.  We also addressed the establishment, through separate 
legislation, of the Yukon Surface Rights Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I am asking hon. members to support the transfer to the 
Yukon government of the administration and controls of onshore 
oil and gas resources.  I am also proposing through Bill C-8 that 
the territorial government be granted the authority to legislate 
in regard to these resources.  In other words, I am seeking the 
support of the House to move the devolution process forward 
another step in Yukon. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first steps of this transfer to the Yukon Territory were 
taken in the 1980s.  The present government made a commitment to 
continue implementation in a planned and orderly manner and without 
delay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prime Minister Chrétien confirmed this course of action and 
the government's desire to promote political development in the 
North in his speech to the Northwest Territories legislative 
assembly in November 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of the Yukon including the Yukon's First Nations 
fully support the transfer of responsibilities and the passing of 
the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The transfer process does not mean that the federal government 
is trying to abdicate its responsibilities.  Instead it is the 
expression of the real and justified desire of the northern people 
to take greater control of their lives. 
It is a matter therefore of transferring responsibilities to the 
appropriate authorities and of ensuring that decisions are made 
locally in the best interest of those concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the people of the Yukon, the transfer of responsibility 
for natural resources is vital to their political development. 
They are convinced that resource development will provide the basis 
for a strong and healthy economy in the territories through to the 
21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Yukon's gas and oil resources are for the most part as yet 
undeveloped, although not for lack of interest.  Uncertainty as to 
land and resource ownership has slowed the development of the Yukon 
for over 20 years. 
With the passing of the Yukon land claims legislation in 1994, 
negotiations currently under way with the Yukon First Nations and 
the settlement of pending territorial claims in the near future 
will get oil and gas exploration activities going once again. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-8 is being brought forward under the terms of the 
Canada-Yukon oil and gas accord which was signed in May 1993. 
Under this accord the federal government agreed to introduce 
legislation to give the territorial government the additional 
legislative powers necessary to manage and administer onshore oil 
and gas resources.  This will be accomplished through amendments 
to the Yukon Act as set out in Bill C-8. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the date of transfer the federal government will also pay to 
Yukon the moneys it collected in petroleum revenues from onshore 
sources in Yukon. 
Once the transfer is completed Yukon will receive an annual 
revenue of approximately $1.5 million from the Kotaneelee 
project.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assure hon. members that no new federal money will be required 
to support this transfer process.  Once the transfer of 
responsibilities and funding is completed, the federal government 
will no longer be directly involved in managing onshore oil and 
gas resources in Yukon.  It will be done at the territorial 
level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the offshore areas will continue to be under the 
jurisdiction of the federal government and the federal regime 
will continue to apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Territorial legislation will be passed which will establish a 
new regime for managing and regulating oil and gas activities. 
The legislation will address exploration, development, 
conservation, environmental and safety issues, as well as the 
collection of resource revenues.  The replacement of federal 
legislation by territorial legislation will take place 
simultaneously with the transfer of administration of oil and 
gas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also assure hon. members that the transfer of these 
legislative powers to Yukon will not affect the ability of the 
Government of Canada to fulfil its mandate in any area of federal 
responsibility.  It will not diminish our authority with respect 
to international affairs, national security, the environment, the 
resolution and implementation of land claims, or the creation of 
national parks. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to keep in mind that the Government of 
Canada will also have the power to resume responsibility for the 
administration and monitoring of gas and oil operations on all of 
the lands, with a view to settling aboriginal land claims.  This 
clause will therefore guarantee Yukon First Nations the possibility 
of selecting underground lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the supplementary rights assigned to the 
territories will not in any way reduce the authority of the 
National Energy Board over pipelines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsequent to the transfer of legislative powers to the Yukon, 
Yukon First Nations subject to settlements already in effect will 
receive a portion of the royalties collected by the Government of 
the Yukon Territory, as set out in the land claims agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-8 will allow the Government of the Yukon Territory to 
exercise its jurisdiction over onshore gas and oil.  The 
territorial government will not obtain greater powers than are 
given to the provinces under section 92(<I>a</I>) of the British North 
America Act of 1867. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, no party to this agreement or this legislation 
shall modify aboriginal rights or rights arising out of existing 
treaties protected under section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is of major importance to the Yukon First Nations. 
These provisions ensure that Bill C-8 cannot and will not undermine 
the advantages the Yukon First Nations have obtained through 
agreements on land claims and self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, since the bill was presented during the 35th 
Parliament, further consultations have been held with the First 
Nations concerned.  The Yukon Council of First Nations has 
indicated its support of the bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Yukon government will be expected to manage oil and gas in a 
manner that serves the interests of all Yukoners including 
aboriginal people.  I note that the Yukon government is also 
working closely with the first nations on the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members should also be aware that Bill C-8 has strong 
support from the oil and gas industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This transfer is clearly in the best interests of the 
governments of Canada and Yukon as well as individual Yukoners. 
It is fully consistent with the devolution initiatives taken by 
previous governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that in mind I urge my hon. colleagues to support Bill C-8 
so that the devolution process can move forward and Yukon can 
continue to evolve politically and administratively. 
<P><A NAME="LINK18"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Ref.):</B>  Mr.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a pleasure to be here this morning to speak to Bill C-8. 
Bill C-8 has been kicking around basically off and on for quite a 
while.  It is an act respecting the Canada-Yukon Oil and Gas 
Accord Implementation Act.  The bill reflects the government's 
recognition of the important role of oil and gas exploration in 
the northern territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The territories are the site of approximately a quarter of 
Canada's remaining discovered petroleum and approximately a half 
of Canada's estimated potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Oil and gas exploration and development is an important key to 
the future economic well-being of the territories.  We are 
already seeing a wide range of possible benefits from such 
mineral discoveries as the BHP Diamond Mines.  I have no doubt 
that as settlement in the north increases and infrastructure 
expands we will see an ever increasing benefit to the north from 
natural resource developments of all sorts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the legislation before us today is important to the 
economic future of Yukon, it is also in accordance with the 
Reform Party position on two very important issues.  First, the 
Reform Party of Canada strongly supports transferring control of 
natural resources to the provinces.  The legislation calls for 
the devolution of provincial-like powers to the Yukon territory 
by transferring the administrative and legislative control over 
oil and gas to the Yukon government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is demonstrating its commitment to 
political devolution to the Yukon territory.  Reform supports 
increased provincial or territorial control of natural resources 
and decreased federal control over natural resources including 
control over the oil and gas industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the bill concurs with Reform's belief in the equality of 
all provinces.  While Reform supports decreased powers on the 
federal level it also supports increased powers for the Yukon 
government.  The powers held by the territory should not exceed 
those held by any of the provinces.  The bill does not transfer 
greater powers than those held by the provinces under section 92, 
92(a) and 95 of the Constitution Act, 1867.  As was stated in the 
unity debate, equality between provinces is absolutely essential 
to the equal treatment of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While Reformers support the legislation we also have some 
concerns.  In recognition of the unique situation in the north 
the legislation respects aboriginal land claims and settlement 
rights.  The legislation does not diminish aboriginal treaty 
rights under section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982.  It is 
consistent with the legislation concerning wildlife, the 
environment and land management regimes under this section. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation also states that any inconsistencies will be 
resolved in favour of legislation implementing the treaties.  All 
these provisions are important to the acceptability of the 
legislation to aboriginals in the Yukon territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concerns I speak of are with regard to the federal 
government's retention of the right to reclaim control of land to 
settle aboriginal land claims.  This provision is intended to 
protect the rights of first nations still in negotiations with 
the government.  However investors may be slow to undertake 
exploration development projects until land claims are resolved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not to suggest that the provision should be removed, but 
the government must develop and adhere to a time line for 
negotiations so that exploration and development are not 
continually delayed. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1025"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was previously anticipated that negotiations with all Yukon 
first nations would have concluded by February 1997.  The 
anticipated date was then extended to July 1997.  However, as of 
September 19, 1997 only half of the Yukon first nations had 
reached agreements while the remaining seven were still in 
negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I urge the government to resolve land claims as 
quickly as possible so that potential investors can confidently 
proceed with oil and gas development in the Yukon territory with 
all the benefits for those who live nearby. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also concerns regarding the government's retention of 
the right to reclaim lands and to take certain actions in the 
event of a sudden oil supply shortfall.  This provision complies 
with Canada's international obligations as outlined in the 
International Energy Agency oil sharing agreement.  The same 
international obligations were responsible for the introduction 
and implementation of the national energy program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Westerners need not be reminded of the disastrous impact the 
national energy program had on Alberta's economy during the 
so-called energy crisis.  Because of the very nature of the north 
with its relatively limited opportunities to obtain income from 
manufacturing, for example, especially due to difficulties in 
transportation and lack of infrastructure to support the kinds of 
development taken for granted in the southern part of Canada, 
Yukon is extremely dependent on natural resource jobs and 
revenues.  It will therefore suffer even greater hardship than 
Alberta did should the federal government deem it necessary to 
implement controls like those used during the last energy crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There must be some commitment by the government to give much 
more serious consideration to the impact of its actions on the 
Yukon territory, on the Yukon economy and on the social and 
economic well-being of the Yukon people should there be an oil 
supply shortfall or energy crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, Ottawa must learn by its errors with Alberta and not 
treat any part of Canada ever again with such cruel indifference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation affecting Yukon in this respect should set the 
precedent for other provinces resulting in amendments to existing 
legislation that will protect all provinces from economic 
disasters like that brought upon Alberta under the national 
energy program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The power gained by Yukon through the legislation is economic. 
Not only will the Yukon government have jurisdiction over 
exploration, development, conservation and management of oil and 
gas but also over resource revenues.  The legislation allows the 
territory to raise revenues by any mode or system of taxation in 
respect of oil and gas in the territory.  It also gives the 
territorial government control over the export of gas and oil 
from the territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will reduce the economic dependence of the Yukon 
territory on the federal government and allow it to develop its 
own economy as the more successful provinces have already done. 
Others such as Newfoundland and Labrador are still struggling to 
get out from under Ottawa's thumb and profit from their own 
natural resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the legislation keeps the federal government too 
involved.  The federal government will continue to collect 
resource royalties on annual resource revenues exceeding the 
first $3 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform opposes federal collection of resource royalties from 
resource industries in any province but especially those in the 
provinces and territories where resource revenues are the 
foundation of the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite those concerns, however, all interested parties have 
expressed support for the legislation.  During the summer of 1996 
I had the great opportunity to travel extensively in Yukon with 
my wife.  While I was there I spoke with a broad section of Yukon 
residents.  There were some real concerns over the legislation 
basically based on being underneath the federal wing for so long 
and on what would happen when some of the powers were transferred 
to the people of the Yukon territory.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While these concerns were there and expressed in great detail, 
there was also great anticipation by people looking for the new 
opportunities that were to be gained from this piece of 
legislation, basically for their freedom from the red tape from 
Ottawa which they have been wrapped up in for so long. I 
appreciated that and I know where they are coming from.  I can 
see where the opportunity now arises for these people to go 
further with their endeavours on their own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian and Yukon governments have committed also to 
consult with aboriginal peoples on significant oil and gas 
decisions affecting traditional lands prior to the completion of 
land claims negotiations. Otherwise we might have in the Yukon a 
repeat of the situation at Voisey's Bay in the province of 
Newfoundland and Labrador. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There a mining company invested billions of dollars to acquire a 
site but every imaginable hurdle has been thrown in the path of 
that development. Hurdles are being thrown by the federal 
government, especially agreeing to delay development at Voisey's 
Bay while the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development spends a few more years, nobody knows how many more 
years, supposedly working to settle land claims which have been 
under negotiation for a generation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to wonder when I see how the federal government gets 
itself involved in something like the Voisey's Bay situation. We 
have the potential of between 3,000 and 5,000 jobs in a section 
of Canada that desperately needs those jobs. We all know that the 
people of Newfoundland and Labrador desperately want to go to 
work, yet the federal government is basically stopping them from 
doing so.  I have to wonder at the power we allow our governments 
to hold in certain areas such as this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that Newfoundland and Labrador is supposedly one of the 
poorer provinces in Canada.  Yet it has the chance right now of 
probably becoming the Alberta of the east with the Voisey's Bay 
project.  And here we sit holding up maybe one of the greatest 
developments in the world at this point in time. I have to 
question the wisdom of this government on that issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes it seems there are departments opposing northern 
development rather than working to assist northern development. 
In that case I am particularly pleased to see the federal 
government stepping back and turning oil and gas exploration and 
development over to the local level of government closest to the 
situation and best able to deal with it, namely the territorial 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know beyond a shadow of a doubt when we give people 
sitting 1,600 or 2,000 miles away from any given situation the 
power to make decisions on things that should be left to the 
provinces, the territories or the local governments, we seriously 
jeopardize Canadians' ability to further their lifestyles in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation respects the unique situation north of 60 
without compromising the principle of equality.  Most important, 
this act incorporates grassroots concerns and amendments.  This 
legislation is part of a greater process that involves the 
devolution of control not only over oil and gas but over 
education, health care and economic development in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This transfer of power will give the Yukon people their proper 
voice in the way their lives are to be governed and greater power 
over the quality of their lives.  Therefore Reform generally 
supports this legislation and recognizes it for what it is, a 
most important step in the political evolution of the Yukon 
territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like this House to study the concerns that we have in 
regard to this piece of legislation and to fully understand maybe 
finally that more power is not necessarily more beneficial when 
it is controlled in Ottawa as we are doing today in this House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this being my 
maiden speech and in keeping with the practices of this House, I do not 
think it will come as a surprise to anybody if I start by thanking the 
constituents of my riding of Saint-Jean for putting their confidence in 
me once again. Although this was not an easy election for the Bloc 
Quebecois, I am buoyed by the fact I was elected with a 9,000-vote 
majority in Saint-Jean. So I want to take the opportunity, at the 
beginning of my first speech in this new Parliament, to thank the 
voters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now move on to the other end of the continent, more precisely the 
Yukon. 
We have before us today a bill respecting an accord between the 
governments of Canada and the Yukon Territory relating to the 
administration and control of and legislative jurisdiction in respect of 
oil and gas. This is indeed a bill to amend certain acts, including the 
Yukon Act, and conferring new legislative powers to the Yukon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of “conferring”, let us look at all the powers that will 
be devolved to the Yukon. Jurisdiction over all oil and gas operations 
will be transferred to the Government of the Yukon Territory, which 
will, among other things, administer and control the development of oil 
and gas resources. We realize that this region presumably has enormous 
potential. Some fields are already producing, but there are probably 
many more. 
In keeping with the agreement signed with the Yukon Territory, the 
federal government is now transferring this jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding exploration, as I just said, this region of Canada is 
very likely to be immensely rich in oil and gas. So all responsibilities 
with respect to exploration will also be transferred to the Government 
of the Yukon Territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as resource development, production and conservation are 
concerned, problems relating to economic development and the 
environment often crop up. I will come back to this later, 
because I had an opportunity to witness such problems during one 
of my trips to the Yukon in 1994. The Yukon government cannot 
take over the responsibility of managing and controlling oil and 
gas without also having power over the environmental preservation 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The responsibilities relating to management, exports, safety, 
revenue collection and the environment are all being transferred to the 
Yukon government which, in turn, will have to table legislation 
patterned on the laws that are in effect elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Up to a point, one can understand Ottawa's attitude, which is 
always the same, namely that a policy must apply from coast to coast, in 
much the same way. The Yukon government was asked to draft legislation 
that will be patterned on what is being done elsewhere and that will not 
give powers exceeding those granted elsewhere. It is somewhat 
unfortunate. Such is this federal government's centralizing attitude. It 
is incapable of completely decentralizing and telling the other levels 
of government to do as they please; instead, it tells them it will 
decentralize but under certain conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to look at the Yukon from a geographical 
perspective. Unlike the Reform member, I feel that those primarily 
concerned are the 14 aboriginal communities in the Yukon. I will 
describe them during my remarks and I will also talk about the status of 
negotiations, but it is important to look at the geographical location 
of the aboriginal communities in the Yukon, to find out who their 
neighbours are, to see whether agreements are also in the making over 
there, and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Inuvialuit forms the Yukon's northern border. People are always 
saying it is a big word, but it is in fact an Inuit word. As you know, 
there are four major Inuit regions in Canada. The Inuvialuit was the 
first region to be recognized in the self-government agreement. We then 
come to the Nunavut, which is its immediate neighbour, and to northern 
Quebec, where the Nunavik is located, before finally reaching another 
large Inuit region of Canada, northern Labrador. 
Self-government agreements are being negotiated for these regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Inuvialuit agreement was signed in 1993. The Nunavut agreement 
was also signed, and an autonomous government will take over in that 
region on April 1, 1999. Negotiations are also under way in the Nunavik 
region. 
Unfortunately, in the case of Labrador, things are a bit stalled at the 
moment. I urge the government to speed up the process because they have 
some catching up to do.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the northern part of the Yukon, in Inuvialuit, the Inuit have 
already signed self-government agreements. Further west, there is the 
border with the United States. Yukon borders on Alaska in the west. I 
wish to point out also that there are many Inuit in Alaska and that 
there is a circumpolar forum, which, by the way, I would like to 
acknowledge, and which includes not only the Inuit of Canada but also 
those of Russia, Siberia and Alaska. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the east are the Northwest Territories. The Nunavut will begin 
a bit even further east, but right next to the Yukon, there are the 
Northwest Territories with great first nations who are in fact covered 
by another bill that will be considered this afternoon, Bill C-6, 
dealing with the Mackenzie Valley. The nations involved here are the 
Gwich'in, the Dene, the Metis, the Dogrib and the Deh Cho. These are the 
great first nations right next door to the Yukon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the south, of course, lies British Columbia. That province 
starts below the 60th parallel, and we are all aware of its great rich 
and diverse native cultures, spread out overmore than 200 native 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel it is important to properly describe the Yukon, because that 
territory is surrounded by great wealth that not only includes oil and 
gas but also native cultures that are extraordinarily vibrant. 
This is what concerned us at the outset.  It is not really a case 
of whether the federal government is well advised to decentralize 
a particular aspect of the oil issue, or whatever.  We also 
considered the impact this would have on native peoples because, 
and I will come back to this later, in Canada's history the native 
peoples got short shrift and this is still the case today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was listening to my colleague in the Reform Party speaking 
earlier about Voisey's Bay.  Voisey's Bay, in Labrador, is 
generating billions of dollars already, and there is a native 
community, Davis Inlet, that wants to move.  The government had in 
fact undertaken to move it.  Now we learn that the move will not 
take place for another five or six years.  In the meantime, 
Voisey's Bay is on land to which claim has been laid by the native 
people in the area and they are still being ignored.  So that is 
the historical fact, and unfortunately history has a tendency to 
repeat itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in Quebec have always paid attention to native communities, 
although attempts have been made to suggest otherwise.  Having 
travelled throughout Canada, I have to say that Quebec has no 
apologies to make with respect to its First Nations.  Quebec is in 
the vanguard and intends to stay there.  That is why, in our 
discourse, you will always notice us first directing our attention 
to native issues on bills involving anything north of the 60th 
parallel, because unfortunately, that is the way things are.  The 
Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development is also 
responsible for all economic development north of the 60th 
parallel.  We are keeping an eye out for the interests of the First 
Nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, speaking of the Yukon, I must tell you how much I enjoyed 
a trip I made there in 1994.  We arrived in Whitehorse and met with 
the First Nations. 
The Council for Yukon Indians was there.  There are 14 native 
communities in the Yukon and these people explained to us where 
they were, at the time, in their negotiations for self-government. 
There are 14 native communities, but they have not all reached the 
same stage of autonomy.  Some of them have signed final agreements, 
others are still working toward that stage.  As I told you, I will 
shortly give an overview of what stage they have reached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The trip to Whitehorse was really something.  As I said, we 
met the Council for Yukon Indians, who briefed us on the progress 
that had been made.  Then, at their own expense, they flew my 
daughter and me to Dawson City, the site of the old Klondike.  This 
ties in with the bill before us today. 
Many years ago, there was a gold rush in the Klondike, leaving the 
land completely disfigured in the Dawson City area.  There are 
piles of rocks everywhere, evidence of the complete disregard for 
the impact on the environment when the gold rush took place.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only thing that mattered was finding gold. Dawson City is a 
great place but flying in is not much fun. I must confess that 
personally I was not too brave during the two-hour flight on a DC-3. My 
daughter travelled with me and she found it rough too. When the plane is 
taking off, one wonders if it will ever get airborne. There is this 
terribly loud noise and everything is shaking inside the plane. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did some checking and I am told the DC-3 is the plane with the 
best safety record in the past 50 years in Canada. 
My daughter was almost in despair when we asked the travel agent what 
plane would be taking us from Whitehorse to Dawson City, a two-hour 
flight, and the agent, while pointing at the picture of an old DC-3, 
told my daughter, who was 12 at the time: “You will be flying on this 
plane”. My daughter came up to me and said: “Dad, they want us to go on 
an old DC-3, that cannot be right”. My answer was: “Of course not. It 
must be a joke”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But when we got to the airfield, we realized that, unfortunately, 
it was no joke. It is somewhat sad that the people in that region are 
serviced by equipment that is so out of date. It certainly was an 
experience and one I am not about to forget. It was a thrill of a sort. 
The plane does not fly very high; it is kind of scary at first, but all 
was fine in the end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We made it to Dawson City. By the way, Heritage Canada owns half 
the town. It is an interesting looking town, with its dirt roads and 
wooden walkways. The buildings have all been declared heritage buildings 
and they reflect the old days. It is almost like finding ourselves in 
the Far West. I take this opportunity to salute my aboriginal friends 
out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One time, we went for a drink in a bar, a saloon like the ones they 
had in the West in the old days, with swing doors and all. We had a 
drink and watched a French cancan show. It was quite special. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> With your daughter? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand:</B> No, my 12-year old daughter did not join us, 
she was not allowed on the premises. I had her baby-sat with other 
aboriginal children and this was an interesting experience for her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gérard Asselin:</B> Are you still in your DC-3? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand:</B> No. I have arrived.  I got off the DC-3 
and I walked around Dawson City. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first nations welcomed me with open arms and took me on a 
long tour.  The high point was probably fishing on the Yukon River, 
which is an extraordinary crystalline blue green, because the water 
comes from glaciers.  I was told the water contains many minerals, 
which account for its colour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was really extraordinary.  We caught a 20 lb salmon.  I 
have pictures to prove it, because people say fishers exaggerate 
the size of their catch.  I can tell you personally that we caught 
a 20 lb fish.  The native people had killed a moose, and we were 
given a wonderful welcome to native festivities in Dawson City.  It 
was unfortunate though that my daughter does not like game. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was involved in an unfortunate incident.  I got caught with 
a bag from McDonald's after the official supper.  I had to explain 
to the grand chief hosting us that the contents were for my 
daughter and not me, of course, because I had eaten my fill of this 
wonderful meal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to recall the social contract at the time. 
We told these people as we did others elsewhere in Canada that we 
were taking their land because we needed the natural resources: the 
forests, mines and oil.  And then we told them that we would send 
them to communities on little parcels of land and would look after 
their survival, their education, their health, their economic 
development and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, people tend to forget that.  People tend to say “The 
Indian affairs budget is huge.  We are paying for these people and 
we are tired of paying for them”.  However, we forget the social 
contract of the time, and I have made it my duty to refer to it in 
each debate. 
We have to realize that we took 95% of the land on this continent 
and plunked these people down on 5% of it.  We did the same thing 
in the Yukon too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also made grand laws at the time, or what we thought were 
grand laws.  We systematically regulated the lives of the native 
peoples. 
That was the Indian Act.  We—and I think this includes the federal 
government—are beginning to realize that not only is this 
legislation outmoded, but there is barely any explanation for its 
still being applied today. People do not even own their homes. 
When someone dies, a decision has to be made about whom it will go 
to next.  There are no rights of succession.  The act contains some 
provisions that are hard to apply in today's reality.  The sole 
solution is self-government, and the aboriginal nations of the 
Yukon, like those elsewhere, understand this.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember very clearly that, when we were voting on this act, 
when we were discussing the bill on the Yukon, representatives of 
the 14 aboriginal nations were up there in the gallery, awaiting 
the historic moment.  At that time, they had been actively involved 
for 21 years in working toward an agreement with the federal 
government.  Finally, in November or December of 1994, an agreement 
was reached and people were very pleased with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, I would like to give you an overview of the progress in 
negotiations.  As I have said, and have just referred to again a 
few minutes ago, there are 14 aboriginal communities in the Yukon. 
It is important for me to refer to the document, because not only 
is it rather complex, but also the names themselves are often 
complicated.  People are wondering what we said.  And it not easy 
for me either. 
At this point in my speech, I must take a more formal look at the 
legislation. I also wish to salute these communities, because they are 
all friends of mine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Little Salmon-Carmacks and Selkirk first nations both signed 
self-government agreements on July 21. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About the December 1994 agreements I referred to earlier, I should 
point out that six of the 14 aboriginal communities had signed their 
final agreements. People thought that the issues of self-government and 
territorial claims had been settled. Since then, we have continued to 
make progress. The agreements involving the two communities I just 
mentioned came into effect on October 1, 1997. These communities joined 
those that had already signed agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government and the Tr'on dek Hwech'in first nation, 
from the wonderful, historic city of Dawson, which I just 
described when relating my perilous experiences, concluded 
negotiations on self-government on May 24. It is expected that 
agreements will be concluded by the end of the year, and that 
they will be ratified in early 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Negotiations with the Dena Council of Ross River are in the 
preliminary stages. I remember that, at the time, there was a 
particular issue. The Kaska Dena community was very close to the 
B.C. border and people were wondering whether most of the reserve 
was located in British Columbia instead of the Yukon. These 
people had a lot of reservations about how things were conducted. 
They were the minority among aboriginals in the Yukon. They were 
not very inclined to get fully involved in negotiations on 
self-government. 
I notice today that at least they have gone beyond the preliminary 
stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was expected that the council would submit shortly a 120% 
selection of lands. They decided to increase the area covered by the 
claim to 120%, and the government expects that the lands selected will 
include large areas with a high mineral potential. So there is this high 
potential, and as I was saying also, the Yukon is rich in oil and gas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the first nations in the Yukon have found a way to give 
real meaning to self-government by having a land claim base that is 
large enough to ensure their self-sufficiency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Negotiations with the Liard first nation are under way and deal 
with the selection of rural lands with a high oil, gas and forestry 
potential. The bill we are considering today has a certain impact on 
every native land claim. We will have to be careful with this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Negotiations with the Liard first nation are almost concluded and 
will cover what are called mining and community lands. I know that the 
federal government wishes to conclude the negotiations by March.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the first nation of Carcross-Tagish, meetings are now 
under way.  Right now, negotiations are focussing on rural lands. 
Agreements have been signed on a certain number of claims.  The 
first nation should soon be submitting claims regarding specific 
sites. It is anticipated that negotiations with respect to 
self-government should be over by year's end.  The final 
agreement should be signed by March 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Negotiations for the final agreement regarding land claims and 
the agreement with respect to self-government for the first nation 
of White River have almost been concluded. 
It is expected that negotiations will be wrapped up in 
December 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first nation of Kluane submitted land claims slightly in 
excess of the allowable area.  The final agreement, including the 
land claims aspect, is 62% complete, and the agreement with respect 
to self-government has been 85% worked out.  This means that a few 
details remain to be wrapped up before the final agreement is 
signed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Negotiations on the Ta'an Kwach'an council's final land claims 
agreement and agreement with respect to self-government have to all 
intents and purposes been concluded.  They cannot be finalized, 
however, until the problem of the band's separation from the first 
nation of Kwanlin Dun is resolved. 
There is a dispute over this.  What they want is to divide the 
reserve in two, or to take steps to provide land for the second 
community other than the lands it currently shares with the other 
aboriginal nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the Kwanlin Dun first nation, there have been no 
negotiations since June 1996. Last June, the first nation submitted 
a proposal that falls outside the frame of reference established by 
the definitive umbrella agreement.  There was a definitive umbrella 
agreement intended to cover all of the question of negotiation, the 
parameters and the guidelines, but they did not want to fit into 
it. Negotiations are, therefore, still under way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aboriginal communities which have not yet signed 
agreements are the first nations of Champagne and Aishihik, Nacho 
Nyak Dun, the Tlingit of the Teslin area, and the first nation of 
the Gwitch'in Vuntut. 
We still have some work to do with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I felt it was important to give a progress report on each 
negotiation process, because we have certain misgivings.  We are 
certainly in agreement with any bill that encourages 
decentralization.  When the government decides to turn all of the 
matter of gas and oil over to the Yukon Territory, we are in 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind you that we are among those who decry the 
encroachment of the federal government onto areas of territorial 
and provincial jurisdiction.  Unfortunately, and I do not want to 
bring the Quebec situation into this, we are becoming aware that 
the throne speech and the position this government is taking show 
that there is encroachment, particularly in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois will, of course, support any bill encouraging 
decentralization. We are the only sovereignist group in this House, and 
anything that smacks of decentralization fits in very well with our 
philosophy. Likewise, any kind of centralization does not fit in with 
our philosophy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was telling you that we had concerns, and they are the following. 
The people who have already signed agreements are pretty much the 
masters of their lands, including use of the lands themselves and their 
surface and subsurface resources, forests, etc. But for those who have 
not yet signed, there may be a little problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The native peoples, in their great wisdom, once again, have decided 
that they will not resort to blackmail by saying: “We want to block the 
bill”. They are saying that they are in agreement. There has also been 
a change in government. 
There is today an NDP government in the Yukon, which is much more open 
to native issues. Apparently, the native peoples have a very good 
relationship with the Yukon government. That government promised it 
would not allow operating permits on lands claimed by native peoples, 
because of all the responsibilities that will be transferred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was telling you that we had a concern, and it is the fact that 
the bill does not deal with this issue. The federal government has a 
fiduciary relationship with native peoples, and permits to extract oil 
and gas on lands claimed by native peoples cannot be allowed before 
there is a final agreement on native self-government and land claims.

</I></B></P><P align=left>So it is unfortunate that there is no provision for this in 
the bill.  We will, however, vote for the bill, even in the absence 
of this provision. We will be decide whether we should move 
amendments in the standing committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After discussions were held with the Yukon government, and 
especially with the governments and potential governments of the 
Yukon first nations, they all told us that they were in agreement 
with the bill and that they hoped that the Yukon government would 
keep its word.  You know that these are people who have heard a lot 
of promises over the centuries and that these promises have often 
been broken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore urge the Yukon government to respect its 
undertaking not to issue mining licences to companies on lands 
included in native claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For my part, I urge the federal government—I see the 
parliamentary secretary is here—to finalize the agreements with 
the people in the Yukon.  As soon as the land bases for all the 
Yukon first nations have been worked out and responsibility for 
self-government turned over to the 14 Yukon nations, attention can 
then be given to how mining licences are issued. We hope that the 
Yukon first nations will finally be able to benefit from the 
subsoil and surface wealth of the land they are now occupying or 
have occupied from time immemorial. 
I therefore urge the federal government to step up negotiations and 
the Yukon government to keep its promise and not to issue licences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois will support Bill C-8, perhaps with certain 
amendments—we will see on the standing committee—and I wish 
a long and prosperous life to the Yukon first nations.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to be speaking for the first time in the House.  I would 
like to thank the people of Yukon for bringing me here.  I feel I 
can hardly add further to the comments of my hon. colleague from 
Quebec on the north. I would like to say that what he found 
strange and wondrous is indeed very normal for people in the 
north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-8 is an act to implement an accord between the Government 
of Canada and the Yukon Territory.  It relates to the 
administration, control and legislative jurisdiction with respect 
to oil and gas.  It is an important act for the people of Yukon 
as it will transfer additional legislative powers necessary to 
undertake through Yukon legislation all aspects of the management 
and administration of onshore oil and gas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation will give the Yukon government provincial like 
powers to administer our own business and to do it in the public 
interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is very important considering that for the last 100 years 
Yukon has not been able to do that in its own interest and has in 
fact been penalized.  Any resources or any income that we have 
brought to ourselves has been directly deducted from our budget, 
so this is very important for northern people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This process of devolution of provincial like powers will not 
affect any settlement of aboriginal land claims because the 
federal government will retain the capacity of regaining that 
authority and it will do so if it is necessary to settle a Yukon 
land claim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-8 is the necessary legislation to transfer the authority 
of oil and gas to the Yukon government.  It is very significant. 
It confirms Canada's commitment as set out in the northern oil 
and gas accord signed in 1993 to transfer to Yukon province like 
powers to regulate and manage Yukon's oil and gas resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be viewed as a commitment from Canada to Yukon for the 
political evolution of Yukon and to the concept of devolution and 
should be linked to an orderly transition of the transfers of 
other remaining resources like forestry and mining to the people 
of Yukon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We expect that the federal government will complete the 
devolution of all these powers to the Yukon government by 1998. 
That may be very optimistic but we believe it can be 
accomplished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Devolution is a transfer process in which the federal government 
will transfer all northern affairs programs of the Department of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development to the Yukon government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1898 a separate Yukon territory was created.  In 1902 our 
first small civil service was established.  In 1948 the Yukon 
Territory suspended its rights to income tax collection in 
exchange for annual federal funding transfers.  In 1979 the 
federal government effectively signed over decision making powers 
for many programs to elected territorial representatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 the umbrella final accord agreement for land claims was 
signed after a 30 year series of negotiations.  Being someone who 
lives in Yukon, my whole life evolved around land claims.  It was 
always discussed and it still is.  It affects every single person 
who lives in Yukon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 consultations on the transfer of northern affairs 
programs began.  In 1997 we are dealing with the transfer of the 
administration and control of legislative jurisdiction in respect 
to oil and gas and, as I said, 1998 is the target set for this to 
be completed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Devolution is an issue of fundamental importance for the Yukon 
people.  It will signal the end of a quasi-colonial attitude to 
the north and a beginning of a process to gain greater economic 
self-reliance.  It will reinforce participatory democracy because 
it will give northerners a meaningful democratic role in the 
development of our own region, communities and a more efficient 
use of resources needed to provide services to the northern 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Devolution is an essential part of aboriginal self-government 
and self-determination.  With the continuing settlement of Yukon 
land claims and self-government agreements Yukoners, on the basis 
of a relationship based on partnerships, can look to the future 
as citizens of Canada and not as possessions of the crown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in Yukon are looking forward to obtaining the 
responsibilities of managing their land and resources. Devolution 
is good governance and it will create employment and 
economic opportunities.  It will also increase the stewardship of 
our environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal devolution is part of a parallel process within the 
Yukon government.  The Yukon government must develop the 
necessary legislation and regulations to fill the federal void 
when it comes to the oil and gas regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Yukon government has been actively working with first 
nations in the development of such a regime.  The working group 
began and has been actively engaged since January 1997 in the 
development of Yukon oil and gas regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has been a very positive experience which has resulted in 
the development of an oil and gas regime that is acceptable to 
the Yukon first nations governments, of which there are 14, the 
territorial government and the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal and territorial legislation dealing with the 
transfer of province like powers to Yukon and the development of 
the oil and gas act regulations is a demonstration of a 
successful working relationship with the first nations and the 
beginning of a new era in the relationships between people of the 
north and the central Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It opens opportunities of economic development for Yukoners. 
After completion of the transfers, the Yukon people, through 
their own legislation, will manage and regulate oil and gas 
activities including exploration, development, production and 
conservation, environmental and safety regulations and the 
determination and collection of resource revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Yukon government is committed to table the Yukon oil and gas 
act this fall and to have an open consultative process with 
Yukoners on the regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Yukon Act has been amended to transfer to northerners new 
responsibilities and new legislative powers in relation to 
exploration of oil and gas; the development, conservation and 
management of oil and gas, including the rate of primary 
production; oil and gas pipelines; the raising of money in 
respect to oil and gas in the territory for the benefit of the 
people in the north; and the export of oil and gas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments will include provisions to allow the federal 
government to continue to exercise its other responsibilities 
including taking back the administration on any lands in Yukon in 
order to settle or implement aboriginal land claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada-Yukon oil and gas accord is fully consistent with the 
legislation implementing aboriginal or treaty rights under 
section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982, including legislation 
establishing wildlife land management and environmental regimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The accord does not diminish Canada's capacity to settle or 
implement land claims and both levels of government are committed 
to consult with aboriginal people on significant oil and gas 
decisions affecting lands within their traditional territory 
prior to the conclusion of land claim settlements.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill includes significant financial provisions to support 
the Government of Yukon in the implementation of its new 
responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It needs to be recognized that this piece of legislation is the 
result of extensive consultations and close co-operation between 
the officials of the Yukon Territory and federal government 
officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the Yukon government has actively involved First 
Nations in the process, including the development of the oil and 
gas legislation and management process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Council for Yukon First Nations gave support for the present 
legislation and to the devolution process in March 1997, support 
ratified by letter from Grand Chief Shirley Adamson on August 1, 
1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The working relationship and close co-operation of the three 
parties, the federal government, the Yukon government and Yukon 
First Nations, has been very successful.  The three parties are 
now committed to completing the remaining land claims and 
self-government agreements by the fall of 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yukoners elected a territorial government with an agenda focused 
on completing land claims and devolution, creating employment and 
economic opportunities, fostering healthy northern communities, 
respecting our environment and building trust in government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is facilitating the implementation of the working 
agenda of the territorial government.  On the basis of a 
respectful government to government relationship with First 
Nations of Yukon and negotiating in an open way implementation of 
agreements like the oil and gas accord, we are creating a 
positive relationship among all levels of government, an example 
I think well set for the rest of Canada to follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Devolution is not by any means downloading of responsibilities 
by the federal government. The devolution process is and should 
include the necessary funding from the federal government to 
deliver the services included in the devolution agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Devolution is about partnership and the assumption of new 
responsibilities and obligations. Yukon First Nation 
governments established a working partnership on devolution and 
signed a number of accords. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the Yukon government and Yukon First Nation 
governments have made arrangements concerning their working 
relationship during implementation of specific devolution 
transfers, particularly arrangements concerning the transfer of 
oil and gas responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The devolution of the Yukon northern affairs program is a major 
step in the evolution of responsible government.  There is a lot 
of goodwill to maintain a co-operative process for the devolution 
of the northern affairs program to the Yukon government. This 
co-operation is a very positive way to transfer in an orderly 
manner the new decision making capabilities to Yukoners and the 
territorial government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Devolution is good government.  It will give the Yukon 
government, a local government with locally elected 
representatives and locally accountable, appointed officials, the 
effective control over land and resource management 
responsibilities. The territorial government will be in a better 
position to integrate decisions over resources and will be able 
to serve more effectively the Yukon people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This transfer of federal resources to the territorial 
government, financial, capital and human resources, must be at the 
level that guarantees the provisions of adequate services and 
present levels of funding. We are all aware that in the last few 
years the northern affairs program has been subjected to federal 
cutbacks and there must be assurances that the resources 
transferred are enough to provide for the delivery of the 
mandated responsibilities of the transferred programs. We are 
expecting that the federal government will not withdraw any 
funding from the programs considered for the transfer to the 
territorial government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This negotiated agreement is a historical component for Yukon 
and the Yukon government, the First Nations of Yukon as well as 
for Canada.  It fully protects the interests of the First Nations 
of Yukon and we are confident in its compliance with the land 
claims and self-government agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreement bodes well for the future of Yukon and all 
Yukoners and in maintaining the spirit of co-operation among the 
federal, territorial and First Nations government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the House to proceed quickly with this bill.  Its 
Successful passage and proclamation will implement a significant 
step in the devolution of powers from the federal government to 
the territorial level and will show a great deal of respect for 
the First Nations and the people of the north who live a life 
that is very remote from Ottawa and very disconnected.  Yet we 
have been very dependent on the decision made in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again I urge a speedy passage to show respect for the work 
that was put into this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to speak to Bill C-8, the Canada-Yukon oil and gas accord 
implementation act.  I will share my time with the hon. member 
for Cumberland—Colchester. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The administration and management of oil and gas is an important 
and highly visible province-like function which will allow the 
Yukon government and Yukon First Nations with land claim 
agreements to share oil and gas revenues.  These revenues are 
currently valued at $2 million per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Platitudes of self-government are wasted if the government does 
not back those platitudes with some type of a management process, 
with some type of a source of income, making self-government 
affordable and therefore making self-government possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill transfers authority to the Yukon territorial 
government, providing and giving control over the exploration, 
development, conservation and management of onshore gas 
resources, oil and gas pipelines, the raising of money in respect 
of oil and gas resources in the territory and the export of oil 
and gas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Onshore oil and gas resources apply to all of Yukon landward of 
the Beaufort Sea mean low water mark, including the two bays of 
Shoalwater and Phillips Bay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to understand that this bill allows the federal 
government to take back administration and control of oil and gas 
in Yukon lands in order to settle or implement aboriginal land 
claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of areas of concern in this bill.  The 
Inuvialuit Regional Corporation, which represents signatories to 
the Inuvialuit Final Agreement, a land claim agreement brought 
into force by legislation in 1984, objected to several aspects of 
the proposed legislation when it was Bill C-50 in the last 
Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This opposition relates to the transfer of management over the 
Yukon offshore, defined as the adjoining area in the bill, to the 
Yukon territorial government and the protection of those areas. 
The Inuvialuit argue the adjoining area defined in the 
legislation is part of the Yukon north slope which falls within a 
special conservation regime established under their final 
agreement.  The Inuvialuit consider Phillips Bay, an area 
specifically included in the transfer, to be part of their 
national park, while Shoalwater Bay is a highly significant area 
of Inuvialuit traditional use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Inuvialuit Final Agreement, lands of the Yukon north 
slope are to be protected until a wildlife and conservation 
management plan is adopted.  While such a plan has been 
developed, it has not been adopted. The Inuvialuit have argued 
the transfer of jurisdiction over the north slope is inconsistent 
with the obligations in their agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-8 has been changed slightly from the former Bill C-50 of 
the 35th Parliament to address some of these concerns.  Clauses 6 
and 8 would amend the Yukon Act to permit the Government of 
Canada to protect certain areas of land and future land claim 
settlements or the implementation of a land claim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The addition of the word implementation recognizes that out of 
the 14 bands that are signatories to the Inuvialuit Final 
Agreement, only six have made their land claim selections.  This 
would allow the federal government to designate lands 
traditionally used by the bands that have not finalized their 
land claim selections as those where no oil and gas activity 
could occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a great concern to those First Nations groups that have 
not yet selected their land under the Inuvialuit Final Agreement. 
Clause 8 allows the federal government to take back the 
administration and control of oil and gas in any lands in Yukon 
to settle or implement land claims.  It can be questioned whether 
or not the federal government will require the land to be 
returned to its original state by the oil and gas developers if 
such land is required for land claim settlement or 
implementation.

about giving the tools to a territory, to a region in Canada to 
become independent and self-sufficient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative Party agrees and supports a greater devolution 
of political and especially economic power to the territories. 
Part of that transfer is regulatory power.  It is time to move 
forward on this legislation which has been on the agenda since 
1987. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the legislation.  We think it is important.  We think

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I wish to add a few comments to those of my associate from South 
Shore regarding the accord between the Government of Canada and 
the Government of the Yukon Territory which divests power and 
authority from the federal government to the Yukon Territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To me it seems like a natural evolution: a political transfer of 
power to the Yukon Territory.  It is certainly appropriate and it 
is similar to the powers the provinces have had for years and 
decades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party supports the legislation, 
basically because it evolved from Progressive Conservative 
legislation that began in 1987 through 1988, starting with the 
northern accord. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like so many of the Conservative policies, like the GST which 
the Liberals picked up, embraced and enhanced, free trade and low 
inflation that worked so well for the economy of Canada, 
hopefully this policy will also work out well as the powers are 
devolved to the Yukon Territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most community groups and organizations support this legislation 
in the Yukon area.  The Council of Yukon First Nations supports 
it on the condition that those First Nations that have not had 
their land claims addressed still have access to the land claims. 
Clauses 6 and 8 of the new bill address those issues.  I feel 
that their issues are at least addressed temporarily and 
hopefully there is a process to address future problems that they 
have in so far as land claims go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Yukon territorial government has supported it strongly and 
urges the quick passage of it.  It requests that it proceed 
expeditiously.  The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers 
of Canada certainly supports it and urges it to go ahead.  It is 
prepared to work with the First Nations groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Yukon Chamber of Commerce says that it is the key to 
economic stability in Yukon.  Certainly we support that and we 
support them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is timely for the Yukon people because it offers new 
opportunities for them for employment and for economic 
development.  At this time in Canada there is more oil and gas 
exploration than at any time in the history of our country. There 
is no reason that the Yukon should be left out of that economic 
surge.  It has the technology in the industry with three 
dimensional size technology, horizontal drilling which maximizes 
exploration and reduces the number of failures and also maximizes 
productivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is certainly an appropriate time to have the gas and oil 
jurisdiction turned over from the federal government to the 
territorial government and have it totally control the situation 
and benefit from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I support Bill C-8, as does our party, as long as 
the First Nations concerns are addressed.  I believe they are 
addressed.  There is a dispute settlement mechanism built into 
Bill C-8 which will address any future concerns they have. It is 
a welcome transfer of power and it will help the Yukon Territory 
establish economic self-sufficiency for now and long into the 
future.

in my speech as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, some native communities have not completed 
arrangements to set up their own government or their territorial

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I agree with the hon. 
member's comments that the native community has faith in the 
federal government but sometimes has less faith in provincial and 
territorial governments.  However, I believe that clauses 6 and 8 
address his concerns.  If native communities have future land 
claim problems, clauses 6 and 8 allow the federal government to 
take back control of certain territories if it is in the 
interests of the natives and if the natives have claims on that 
territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that amendments can be made to the bill.  It is not 
perfect.  No bill is.  However, we will be working with the 
native communities to come up with appropriate amendments to 
address their concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Probably one of the basic issues is the fact that the native

<P><A NAME="LINK26"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Kilgour (for the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development)</B> moved that Bill C-6, an act to provide 
for an integrated system of land and water management in the 
Mackenzie Valley, to establish certain boards for that purpose 
and to make consequential amendments to other acts, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK27"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise to address the House on Bill C-6, the Mackenzie Valley 
resource management act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am extremely pleased to be sponsoring this bill which will 
build on two other legislative initiatives that are already 
redrawing the political, social and economic face of the 
Mackenzie Valley in the Northwest Territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In December 1992 legislation was enacted to implement the 
comprehensive land claim agreement of the Gwich'in of the 
Mackenzie Valley.  In 1994 the Sahtu Dene and Metis comprehensive 
land claim agreement was also given effect by legislation passed 
by this House. 
We are also continuing to negotiate agreements with the other 
claimant groups in the Mackenzie Valley.  These are historic 
agreements for the beneficiaries, for the residents of the 
Northwest Territories and for all Canadians.

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aboriginal beneficiaries now have the land base and the 
financial resources that will enable them to more fully manage 
their own affairs.  Residents of these areas in the territories 
as well as the territorial government and industry have the 
certainty of land ownership and resources rights that come with 
settlement agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to inform hon. members that many provisions of 
these land claim agreements are already being implemented.  After 
many years of difficult negotiation, the Gwich'in and Sahtu Dene 
and Metis are finally beginning to enjoy the benefits of land 
ownership and financial security. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the government has a number of important issues to 
resolve on these agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chapter 24 of the Gwich'in agreement and chapter 25 of the 
Sahtu Dene and Metis agreement provide for the establishment of a 
system for co-management of resource use in the regions covered by 
the agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More specifically, two agencies will be set up for each region 
covered by the agreements: a land use planning board and a water 
and land board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, an environmental impact review board will be established 
for the Mackenzie Valley, which includes the whole western part of the 
Northwest Territories, with the exception of the region inhabited by the 
Inuvialuit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-6 will establish these bodies. Also, in order to ensure 
responsible management of the environment and to strengthen the 
government in western Arctic, Bill C-6 will create a land and water 
board for the whole Mackenzie Valley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The board will ensure a co-ordinated and consistent process to 
regulate the use of land and water throughout the Mackenzie Valley. This 
is very important to the residents of that region, since activities 
taking place upstream can have a major impact on communities living 
downstream. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a few minutes to expand on the provisions 
of Bill C-6 so that hon. members can appreciate why it is a good 
bill for the Northwest Territories and for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-6 provides a co-ordinated system of regulating land and 
water use throughout the Mackenzie Valley.  In so doing it 
ensures regulatory consistency between the settlement areas and 
adjacent lands within the Mackenzie Valley.  Bill C-6 also meets 
the government's commitment to give aboriginal people a greater 
role in determining resource use as provided for in the two land 
claim agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within each claimant area the representatives of aboriginal 
people will make nominations for half of the members on each of 
these new boards.  This will ensure that the traditional 
activities and lifestyles of the different aboriginal groups in 
the Mackenzie Valley will be considered in the making of resource 
management decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is expected that this type of resource co-management will 
allow traditional aboriginal activities and lifestyles to 
successfully coexist with other forms of economic development. 
This is resource co-management in the truest sense of the term and 
in the form of co-management that the Royal Commission on 
Aboriginal Peoples fully endorsed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to guaranteeing a voice for aboriginal people, the 
new land and water regulatory regime will provide more 
opportunities for the public to participate in decision making. 
People from the Mackenzie Valley will sit on these boards and 
there will be an opportunity for input from private citizens and 
interest groups through public hearings. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-6 defines how the new system will work and the interaction 
between the various bodies. However, I should point out that the bill 
does not deal with surface rights. A surface rights board designed to 
settle any dispute relating to private land access in the Mackenzie 
Valley will be established under another bill. 
In the meantime, land claims agreements include provisions for the 
settling of such disputes.

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bodies established under Bill C-6 are government boards whose 
mandate is to look after the public's interests. Members will be 
appointed by the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, to 
whom they will be accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each body will have to consult the public, more specifically 
aboriginal groups, government organizations and industries, before 
making decisions or recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This new system is patterned on the Northwest Territories' 
resources regulating system which puts, as it should, the decision 
making process in the hands of local people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development is 
currently responsible for managing and regulating crown lands in the 
Mackenzie Valley, while the Northwest Territories' water board monitors 
the use of water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Bill C-6, each region that will be governed by an agreement 
will have its own regional land and water board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Outside the areas covered by the agreements, and with respect to 
transregional activities, the Mackenzie Valley land and water board will 
be responsible for making regulations. In other words, the land and 
water boards of each region covered by the agreements will become a 
standing committee of the main Mackenzie Valley land and water 
organization, which replaced the Northwest Territories water board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-6 also provides for the establishment, in each of the 
regions covered by the agreements, of a land use planning board 
responsible for developing a land use plan, whose approval it will 
recommend to the government. These boards will develop land use plans 
for all land in the regions covered by the agreements. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An important purpose of land use planning is to protect and 
promote the social, cultural and economic well-being of the 
residents of the settlement area by setting goals and priorities 
for governments and industry.  While the interests of all 
Canadians must be taken into account, special attention will be 
given to the rights and well-being of any affected aboriginal 
group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-6 will also create a new environmental assessment regime 
for the Mackenzie Valley.  The environmental impact review board 
will be established as the main instrument for environmental 
assessment and will carry out the duties currently performed by 
the northern affairs program of the department under the CEAA, 
the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While this new assessment regime has adopted many of the 
features of the CEAA, including extensive consultation 
requirements and the same assessment criteria, it goes beyond the 
CEAA in that it applies not only to the federal crown lands and 
projects but to settlement and commissioner's lands as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that virtually all lands in the Mackenzie Valley will 
be subject to the same rigorous assessment process.  Industry 
will welcome the certainty, consistency and efficiency of the new 
regime.  Great effort has been put into ensuring that duplication 
is avoided and all will receive equal treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Additionally Bill C-6 undertakes the creation of a cumulative 
impact monitoring program.  This program will carry out periodic 
environmental audits and will pull together the data which will 
help track the cumulative impacts of development activity 
throughout the Mackenzie Valley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to assure the House that the Government of the Northwest 
Territories and First Nations were thoroughly consulted on this 
proposed legislation. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These past few years, federal officials met on a number of 
occasions with their Northwest Territories counterparts and with 
representatives of the Gwich'in and the Sahtu Dene and Metis to develop 
an approach to the establishment of these organizations that would be 
acceptable to all parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also conducted extensive consultations about the legislation per 
se. Drafts of Bill C-6 were distributed to various interest groups to 
get their input and feedback. In addition, a background document on the 
proposed resource management scheme was released to the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After this information was distributed, Indian affairs officials 
went on a public consultation tour in the Mackenzie Valley. 
These consultations have proven highly productive.  Government 
employees have prepared information kits on the bill and the 
regulations for the public to provide the private sector and the 
aboriginal and non-aboriginal residents of the Mackenzie Valley 
with a clear understanding of the entire process leading up to the 
resource management clauses in the bill.

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to announce to the House that there was a great 
deal of support for our bill.  A number of the aboriginal groups in 
the Mackenzie Valley, however, have not yet settled their land 
claims, and therefore feel that the establishment of regulatory 
bodies for the entire Mackenzie Valley is premature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the government acknowledges their concerns and is 
dealing with them, we feel that it is important to move ahead with 
the establishment of these bodies so as to avoid confusion later. 
These aboriginal groups will be entitled to appoint members to 
these bodies without jeopardizing their ability to negotiate their 
land claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I firmly believe that the new resource management regime 
offers these groups better representation than they currently have 
within the decision making process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The establishment of a new regulatory mechanism for the 
Mackenzie Valley cannot be done piecemeal.  The hon. members will 
readily understand that we cannot end up with more than one 
regulatory mechanism for the same territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A cohesive regulatory process for land and water use will be 
to the advantage of the entire Mackenzie Valley.  It will provide 
the private sector with the transparency and certitude required to 
enhance the attractiveness of investing in the area. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From an environmental review perspective, it is also important 
to have a valley-wide regime. More and more we are looking at 
environmental problems in total.  Rivers and streams cannot be 
arbitrarily separated by artificial boundaries. We must deal with 
entire ecosystems and adapt to a new way of managing 
environmental regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to assure the House that the proposal to establish 
valley-wide boards for the regulation of land and water use and 
environmental impact review is fully consistent with the Gwich'in 
and Sahtu agreements and has their support. These are examples of 
good planning and good public government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First Nations that have not yet settled their claims will have 
the opportunity to be represented on these new boards.  For all 
residents of the Northwest Territories the new regime will mean 
more immediacy in decision making. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill also is fully consistent with the devolution of 
provincial type responsibilities to the territories and with, as 
I mentioned, the report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal 
Peoples which endorsed this unique type of resource co-management 
for the north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of the Northwest Territories will over time 
assume the federal role of responsibilities in each of these 
areas.  The territorial government strongly supports the concept 
of public valley-wide boards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members can appreciate, Bill C-6 will accomplish three 
important goals. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it will meet the requirements of the agreements with 
the Gwich'in and the Sahtu Dene and Metis on regulating the use of 
land and water.  Bill C-6 therefore represents a major step toward 
meeting our obligations under territorial claims and will form the 
basis of new partnerships with aboriginal peoples and other 
residents of northern regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, Bill C-6 will provide a new system for managing the 
Mackenzie Valley, which will be more user friendly, more 
transparent and easier to understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will ensure that all residents will be involved in 
decisions on issues involving them. 
It will also ensure a fair assessment of proposals by allowing all 
residents of the region to give their opinion when positions are 
taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These improvements will encourage investment and economic 
development in the regions covered by the agreements and throughout 
the Mackenzie Valley.  The people in the north, like all Canadians, 
will reap the rewards of this economic activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, Bill C-6 will also establish a system that complies 
with standards of prudent environmental management.  In keeping 
with our national goal of protecting and preserving the environment 
for generations to come, the bill will guarantee that environmental 
assessments will be standardized and thorough.

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now ask my hon. colleagues to support Bill C-6 so that 
the government's obligations under these regional land claim 
agreements can be fulfilled and that the evolution of strong, 
local public government can continue in the Mackenzie Valley. 
<P><A NAME="LINK28"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as 
this is my first opportunity to speak in the House, I would like 
to congratulate you and your colleagues on your election. I am 
from that part of Canada lying between the Pacific salmon dispute 
and the Atlantic groundfish strategy called Saskatchewan.  Since 
this is my first opportunity to speak in the House, I do want to 
thank the people of Prince Albert for the trust they have placed 
in me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prince Albert has been called Canada's most illustrious 
constituency.  This is because of its history of having elected 
three of Canada's previous prime ministers.  I contend, however, 
that Prince Albert remains Canada's most illustrious constituency 
for more reasons than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Saskatchewan River runs through my constituency. 
Historically it was a major trade route for the fur trade.  Today 
it provides hydro-electric generation and recreation areas 
enjoyed by people from across Canada and around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The constituency has a progressive and innovative farming 
community which, by the way, has a strong interest in the 
Canadian Wheat Board legislation which passed quickly before this 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have forestry.  We have diamond exploration.  We have small 
towns and the city of Prince Albert.  We have pioneers and 
visionary business people.  We have it all.  We are Canada's most 
illustrious constituency and I am proud to represent it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One other thing I would like to mention this morning is that I 
am proud to wear the red poppy that commemorates the sacrifice by 
so many Canadians in defending our nation, its democracy and its 
freedoms.  I trust that we will be worthy of their sacrifices 
which were supreme. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that I will now turn to the business at hand which 
is the consideration of Bill C-6, the Mackenzie Valley resource 
management act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The stated purpose of the bill is to provide for an integrated 
system of land and water management in the Mackenzie Valley and 
to establish certain boards for that purpose.  The bill is 
enabling legislation which implements obligations between the 
federal government and the Gwich'in, the Sahtu Dene and Metis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those agreements, proclaimed September 22, 1992 and June 23, 
1994, called for an integrated system of land and water 
management to apply to the Mackenzie Valley through the creation 
of certain boards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Gwich'in claim was negotiated, debated and proclaimed during 
the 34th Parliament by the Tory administration.  The Sahtu Dene 
and Metis land claim, Bill C-16, was debated in the spring of 
1994 and was opposed by the Reform Party due to the excessive 
size of the land claim agreement.  Its provisions called for a 
settlement area of about 108,200 square miles or about 280,200 
square kilometres which comprised roughly 27% of the entire 
Mackenzie Valley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To put this in perspective, the land area alone included in the 
agreement was roughly five times the area of the entire province 
of Nova Scotia.  It was for the benefit of only 1,755 persons, of 
whom only 982 are adults.  Taken on a per person basis, the 
claims average about 61 square miles each and the economic cost 
of the agreements was in the order of $130 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party opposed Bill C-16 because there was no legal 
rationale for this fee simple conveyance. A new bureaucracy was 
created and, furthermore, the commitment to self-government made 
really no sense given the small and highly dispersed population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party's position respecting land settlement claims is 
clear. It supports honouring treaties according to their original 
intent and according to court decisions. The agreements made in 
that legislation and those which this legislation enables were 
negotiated rather than subjected to court decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the foregoing, the Reform Party's policy further 
states that settlement of land claims will be negotiated publicly 
and all settlements will outline specific terms, be final and 
conclude within a specific timeframe and be affordable to Canada 
and the provinces. 
I believe that the agreements on which this bill rests fail the 
test of finality and affordability and as such have serious 
consequences for Bill C-6, which is currently under discussion. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1150"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lastly, in setting the background, the Reform Party supports the 
right of individuals entitled to reside on settlement lands to 
choose to hold their entitlement privately or in common. Nothing 
in the agreement gives the people any individual rights over the 
land in question. All rights are held in common. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a context in which the bill is drafted and for our 
party's consideration of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a new member there is a lot to learn and, like most members, 
I suppose there is far more teaching than there is learning at 
times.  As this is the first piece of legislation for which I 
have prepared, I was not sure where to begin.  I found out, 
though, that the office of the minister transmits the pertinent 
information to the office of the critic who in this instance 
forwarded it to my office for review in preparation for the 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Included in the material is a list of the organizations with 
whom the minister has consulted in drafting and reviewing the 
proposed legislation.  I found in the material several one page 
letters. Some congratulated the minister on the initiative and 
some were non-committal in tone, but they all expressed a hope 
that the proposed legislation would be useful in pulling together 
some of the loose threads in the regulatory and approval 
processes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit that will be a vain hope as we look further through the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One letter which came to my attention later and did not come 
through the office of the minister was not so very complimentary. 
It was submitted by an organization by the name of the Northwest 
Territories Chamber of Mines which has an interesting motto, 
especially in the context of the debate over debt, spending and 
taxes “digging Canada out of debt”.  I would think that any 
organization or for that matter any person committed to digging 
this country out of the debt hole in which it finds itself is 
worthy of serious attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe these people have been consulted in the 
preparation of the legislation and certainly I feel that is a 
serious deficiency. They believe “that the sheer complexity of 
the new regime will overload the capacity of northerners to deal 
effectively with resource management issues”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This House must listen to the concerns of all those outside the 
land claims process and take immediate steps to review the legacy 
of a former administration which was out to right every wrong, 
whether real or perceived. Canadian taxpayers will be burdened 
for years to come because of their policies.  Job creation will 
suffer and resource development may be slowed down and investors 
will begin to look elsewhere for investment opportunities as the 
cost of doing business in Canada's north increases as a result of 
Bill C-6 and similar legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Legislation of this nature is the reason for many mining 
development hold-ups such as Voisey's Bay.  We know the 
importance of development in the north due to the unemployment 
figures in the north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Resource companies, we know, must conduct their affairs in an 
environmentally sound manner. There is a necessity for regulatory 
regimes and they must ensure compliance with the regulations 
developed for the common good. Those facts are not in dispute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is also not in dispute is the need for rules which are 
capable of clear interpretation, fair and equal in their 
application.  The standards set by regulators must be high but 
must also be capable of being achieved. The decisions rendered 
must be timely and arbitrariness must be minimized. The process 
should be unified so as to minimize cost and uncertainty for 
those to whom the system applies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, it should provide for predictability both in the cost 
of compliance and in the likelihood of approval being granted 
after review of the application. The system as it exists today is 
both complex and cumbersome and achieves none of the goals 
previously set out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The express goal of the new legislation is that it would 
address the flaws in the current system, but instead it delivers 
the same uncertainties and adds yet another layer of bureaucracy 
with poorly defined jurisdictions. The net result of the 
legislation as it stands would be to substantially increase 
uncertainties and cost to development while failing to deliver 
benefits to the environment or to the stakeholders identified in 
the agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among the many concerns this bill has raised among stakeholders 
are the potential for interference in the staking of mineral 
claims, change in the status of leases and land use permits, new 
powers to boards to suspend permits and leases, poorly defined 
terms for new rights for compensation, unfair enforcement policy, 
poorly defined jurisdictions which have the potential for serious 
delays in even beginning a review of an application to develop a 
promising area.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed legislation does not address, apart from a 
numerical formula, how members of the committee are to be 
selected, although one of the letters supplied to my office 
mentions beginning the process of training members of the various 
boards and panels before the proposed legislation was even 
introduced in the House.  That letter was received in the office 
of the minister in the spring of 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does not specify what criteria will be used in 
determining who is eligible for appointment to the boards and 
panels, if any, nor does it specify the process for appointment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed legislation calls for the creation of separate 
boards in each settlement region with offices to be maintained in 
each.  There is a mere suggestion in the bill that the boards 
could share technical facilities but there is no requirement to 
do so.  This arrangement is likely to cause uneveness in the 
development of regulations and in their application. Developments 
crossing jurisdictional lines may be subject to several boards 
with the likelihood of different results from their review 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fears of developers as litigation will be required to 
resolve the disputes arising from lack of clarity in the proposed 
legislation were not put to rest in departmental briefings.  The 
possibility of litigation is a major concern and need not have 
arisen had the government held extensive public hearings 
throughout the process of developing Bill C-6 rather than waiting 
until it had passed the point of no return. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the immense area of land to be administered and the 
possibility of duplication of technical resources with lower 
individual budgets and staffing as a result, the boards will be 
unable to perform adequate evaluation of projects stretching over 
those vast distances.  This is particularly troubling in 
transitional times when everything must continue without 
interruption.  We know that people's livelihoods depend on these 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the debate on Bill C-16, Reformers warned of the 
potential for the creation of a massive bureaucracy as a result 
of those agreements.  Those fears have now been realized with the 
proposed boards and panels exercising broad powers over both 
claim and non-claim territory.  Hunting, trapping, resource 
development, forestry and more will fall within their authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With a population of only 40,000 people, the western Arctic will 
be subject to a proliferation of administrative authorities. 
There is also no limitation of the board's authority within the 
settled claim areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these reasons the Reform Party respectfully opposes this 
bill. Opposition to this bill should not be seen as opposition to 
the settlement of outstanding land claims with Canada's 
aboriginal people.  As has been stated earlier, the Reform Party 
does support final affordable settlement of all outstanding 
claims.  We believe that wider consultations are the answer to 
those negotiations.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have before us 
today a bill that I consider extremely technical. It is difficult to 
relate to this bill on a personal basis, as can be done with Bill C-8 
dealing with the Yukon, because it concerns the establishment of certain 
boards to manage water, land, etc. For this reason, I will stick rather 
closely to my text. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I have the opportunity, and because debate on native issues 
can often be uninspiring and difficult, I like to stimulate and enhance 
the debate by relating incidents we may have witnessed during our 
visits. Unfortunately, I have never been in the Mackenzie Valley. 
Because of the technical content of this bill, I will perhaps stick more 
closely to my text. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So I am pleased to speak today to Bill C-6 dealing with the 
establishment of certain boards to provide for an integrated system of 
land and water management in the Mackenzie Valley, and with 
consequential amendments to other Acts. This wording is found in several 
pieces of legislation, including Bill C-8 to amend certains acts, which 
we discussed earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, Bill C-6 sets up a coordinated and integrated 
system of land and water management in the Mackenzie Valley. In fact, 
this bill meets a statutory obligation under the comprehensive land 
claim agreement with the Gwich'in and with the Sahtu Dene and Metis. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1200"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT24"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT24"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1200
<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Gwich'in comprehensive land claim agreement was signed April 
22, 1992 and the Sahtu Dene and Metis comprehensive land claim agreement 
was signed September 6, 1993. I have some concern here about the land 
claim agreement. In the last Parliament, after the October 1993 
election, the House resumed sitting in February and it seems to me that 
this bill was introduced at that time. The agreement was probably signed 
on September 6, 1993, but the implementing legislation was most likely 
introduced in February 1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These agreements provide for the establishment of an integrated 
joint management regime for land and waters in the Mackenzie Valley by 
establishing three boards. 
My hon. colleague listed them, but I will repeat anyway: the land use 
planning board, the Mackenzie Valley land and water board and the 
environmental impact review board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As in Bill C-8, in developing legislation to implement agreements, 
an effort was made to ensure as much as possible that the economic 
development and environmental aspects are taken care of. As we can see, 
this bill meets its target in this respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These boards will be established as government organizations with 
their own staff and budget, using government approval procedures and 
funding terms. A land use planning board will be established in each of 
the Gwich'in and Sahtu Dene and Metis settlement areas. These will be 
five member boards. The first nations and the federal and territorial 
governments will each appoint two members, who, in turn, will appoint a 
chairperson. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The goal is to have a kind of parity committee, given that the 
boards are funded in part by the government. This type of parity for 
committees can be found in several bills. We in the Bloc Quebecois are 
always inclined to say that this parity should be achieved as early as 
possible in the process. As a general rule, when the designated members 
meet, they are supposed to select a chairperson, who will often also be 
a first nations leader. I think this is a laudable effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The boards will have the power develop and review plans as well as 
propose changes to be made to plans concerning the use of all land 
outside the area assigned to local administrations and within the 
designated areas for the entire Mackenzie district. 
As soon as a plan is approved by a first nation and by the 
government, it will be used to guide the region's development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second board, the Land and Water Board, will consist of 17 
members.  The permanent regional panels will consist of five 
members located in each of the Gwitch'in and Sahtu Dene and Metis 
settlement areas.  In addition to these 10 individuals, seven 
members will be appointed by the government and by the first 
nations of the three settlement areas located outside these areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, the goal is native participation.  In this regard, 
it must be admitted that such participation is a given and is 
commendable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The board will have authority for issuing land use permits and 
water licences with respect to development activities outside the 
Mackenzie Valley settlement area, or affecting more than one of 
these areas.  The area is fairly specific.  It is inhabited by Dene 
exclusively and there are sub-areas often bearing names related to 
the Dene culture:  Gwitch'in, Deh Cho, Dogrib, names you will often 
hear, which are significant for the bill before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A permanent regional panel will issue licences according to 
the needs of the settlement area.  This new settlement system will 
make it possible to implement land claim agreements based on the 
Northwest Territories Water Act.  Before these agreements, certain 
laws had been put forward by the federal Parliament. 
These laws will be amended by the bill before the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreements will be implemented by means of new land use 
regulations based on the existing regulations, on the Territorial 
Lands Act, another law that will be amended by the present bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, this bill provides for the creation of the Mackenzie 
Valley Environmental Impact Review Board.  You have to picture the 
area, which the Mackenzie River cuts right through. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1205"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT25"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT25"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1205

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, whenever an economic development project is implemented, it has 
an impact on the environment. While the purpose of the bill is to ensure 
some consistency, it also creates problems. I will explain why in my 
conclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The environmental impact review board is the counterpart of an 
economic development agency, which assesses projects from an economic 
development perspective. So, the Mackenzie Valley environmental impact 
review board is being established and will consist of 11 members, 
including a chairperson. Again, the aboriginal community and the 
government will be equally represented. 
This is a positive development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All development activities on the lands and waters of the Mackenzie 
Valley, including those affecting Indian reservations or lands governed 
by a settlement with a first nation, will be subject to the 
environmental impact review and assessment process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said earlier that it will create problems, and I will explain why 
in my conclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reviews and assessments in the Mackenzie Valley will be conducted 
primarily through the board and will partly replace measures relating to 
the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. Once again, the bill amends 
an existing act. 
That board may recommend to the minister responsible for a development 
activity that a proposed project be rejected or that the environmental 
and socio-economic conditions in which that activity can proceed be 
defined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So it is more than just the environment. The social and economic 
impact of a development project on the aboriginal peoples will also be 
considered. So we must admit that we are pleased with this item because 
the considerations will include not only the environment for aboriginal 
peoples, but also their economic development and the impact of the 
project on the community. It is important to assess these, and the bill 
provides for this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These boards, the three boards that I have just mentioned, will 
replace the land and water regulations applied by the Department of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development and by the Northwest Territories 
Water Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill provides for a procedure to monitor the cumulative 
effects—and this also is important—of land and water used on the 
environment in the Mackenzie Valley, and also for regular independent 
environmental audits that must be made public. It can happen very often 
that the immediate environmental impact of an economic development 
project will be examined, but not the cumulative effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned this earlier. At the time of the gold rush in the 
Klondike, the immediate impact was not the only concern, but we are now 
stuck with huge hills of dirt and rocks that were extracted and left 
behind. This definitely has a very adverse impact on the environment. 
The impact was immediate and cumulative. So this is a bill that deals 
with these two concepts and we are pleased with it in that respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This could be the job of a board or a department.  The 
Gwich'in and the Sahtu Dene and Metis must play an important role 
in carrying out these functions.  So, I think the famous parity for 
all boards achieves this objective. I would remind you that there 
are sub-regions that are not necessarily affected, that have no 
agreement for the moment; these will be covered by the bill, and 
this will soon become a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it important, particularly because I did so earlier 
for the Yukon, to situate the Mackenzie Valley for you.  It is the 
part of the Northwest Territories not included in Nunavut.  As I 
said earlier, the Yukon is bordered in the north by Inuvialuit, one 
of the four Inuit regions in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore the region we are looking at, which is covered by 
the bill, runs right alongside Nunavut, which, I remind you, will 
come into its own in terms of self-government and territorial 
claims on April 1, 1999.  I would like to acknowledge the interim 
commissioner, who is ensuring a smooth transition.  He is our 
former colleague, Jack Anawak, who was appointed to the position 
and who is in charge of the entire transition process that will 
lead to self-government and land claims settlement in Nunavut.

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The region affected by the bill before us today is the one 
immediately adjacent to the Nunavut.  It is bordered on the west by 
Inuvialuit—as has already been said—and by the Yukon, by the 
Nunavut to the east and the 60th parallel to the south.  On the 
shores of the Mackenzie River are towns that have also been the 
subject of bills, Fort Norman, Fort Franklin, Norman Wells, Fort 
Wrigley, Fort Simpson, many regions that are particularly rich in 
oil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the 18th and 19th centuries, these places served both 
the whites and the Indians as trading posts or winter command 
posts.  There was, of course, no oil exploration, or need for it, 
at the time. These places were needed instead for the fur trade or 
as command posts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The renowned Hudson's Bay Company, for instance, had a trading 
post at Fort Franklin between 1945 and 1950.  A Catholic mission 
also settled there, in a teepee like construction.  Only during the 
sixties did the Dene settle permanently in Fort Franklin, which 
they called Deline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fort Norman, was also founded as a trading post in 1810, with 
the aboriginal inspired name of Slavey Tulit's, meaning “mouth of 
two rivers”.  At first, this place was of seasonal importance for 
the Dene, then became a permanent settlement in 1872.  Then, as an 
undeniable sign of the colonization of the Northwest Territories by 
westerners, the English in particular, a hewn timber Anglican 
church was built at Fort Norman.  A great tourist attraction, this 
building is also a sign of the impact of development by the 
English. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 18th century, the Northwest Company, a subsidiary of 
Imperial Oil Limited, operated there.  This company also operated 
out of Norman Wells on the east bank of the Mackenzie River.  It 
was there that it obtained mining concessions in 1918 and 
discovered oil in commercial quantities the following year.  So it 
is an area very rich in oil and gas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The demand for oil from Norman Wells understandably reached 
its height during World War II.  The need for oil was great. 
Canada and the world were at war.  The war machine depended on oil. 
Their production therefore reached a peak at this time.  This was 
followed, in 1947, by a dramatic drop because the demand was no 
longer there.  Demand went up dramatically later and Imperial and 
Canada mined these deposits jointly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Norman Wells is the easternmost point of the Canol pipeline. 
This pipeline was built during World War II so that the community 
could ship its top quality light crude, a strategic resource, to 
the Alaska route and to centres in the south.  The oil pipeline 
that extends from the Northwest Territories to Zama, Alberta, also 
ends at Norman Wells in the north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall, by the way, discussing the Canol pipeline when we 
looked at the bill concerning wells at Norman Wells. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have tried to show, the Mackenzie Valley is rich in 
natural resources and in history.  It represents an important 
chapter in the history of relations between Canadians and the 
native peoples.  It seems obvious to me that those settlers bold 
enough to do business in this area of the country made their 
fortunes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to repeat everything I said about Bill C-8, but 
it is pretty much the history of Canada all over again.  The first 
settlers arrived, took possession of the land and the resources and 
made vast fortunes.  The native peoples are still stuck on reserves 
waiting for the day when they will reap the economic benefits.  We 
know that they are practically living like a third world nation, in 
very difficult socio-economic conditions.  It is a shame that a way 
has never been found to share equitably the wealth generated by the 
multinationals and by Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Was this done at the expense of the native peoples?  I have just 
told you that it was.  That is the big question.  Naturally, 
there are grey areas.  Some people blame the multinationals or 
the Canadian government, while others argue it is the fault of 
the native people for refusing to assume their responsibilities. 
But there is no denying that the socio-economic conditions of 
native peoples are far inferior to those of all other Canadians.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So even if this needs to be qualified, we believe that this great 
epic did not always benefit aboriginal peoples. It did very often 
benefit Canadians who struck it rich, but at the expense of aboriginal 
lifestyles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of Canadians settled in the Mackenzie Valley and spread 
their culture there. Many Indians also live there. There are first 
nations, including the Dene in certain subregions, who are extremely 
proud of their subregion and who have been living in these areas since 
time immemorial. There are, among others, the Gwitch'in, the Sahtu Dene 
and Metis, the Deh Cho and the Dogrib, all subregions of the Greater 
Mackenzie Valley where aboriginal peoples have shaped Canadian culture 
through their ancient aboriginal heritage. 
They have also preserved their culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The information we have today on the aboriginals living in the 
valley is still incomplete. However, observations made by western 
explorers and traders who travelled through this area confirm that the 
Dene nation split into three cultural groups: the eastern group, which 
includes the Yellow Knives, the Dogribs and the Hares, the Slaveys, the 
Chipewyan and the Beaver; the southwest group that includes the Nahane, 
the Sekani, the Babine and the Carriers; the northwest group that 
includes the Kutchin, the Loucheux, the Ahtena and the Khotana. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see that in the Dene culture, there are also subcultures, 
and these people inhabit areas in the Mackenzie Valley covered by this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The word Dene comes from one of the main language groups, the 
Athapascans, who spread out across Canada, from the Rocky Mountains to 
Hudson's Bay. 
In fact, I have in my office a lovely map representing the 50 aboriginal 
languages still being used across Canada. I must say that Athapaskan is 
indeed a widely used aboriginal language and one of the main aboriginal 
languages in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally—if I may open a brief parenthesis here—the 
retention level of these languages is probably better in Quebec than in 
the rest of Canada. In fact, statistics show that language retention is 
better among natives in Quebec than elsewhere in Canada. I will close 
this parenthesis by saying that 50 languages is not insignificant; it 
goes to show how rich the aboriginal culture is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Athapaskans came up with a word that is both very simple and 
very rich to describe any human being, male or female, any 
individual or people, including themselves: Dene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently, this word was given a narrower meaning in the 
political arena. It has become identified with the first nation 
settled in Denendeh, in the Deh Cho Valley—the Mackenzie 
Valley—also called Dehogà by the K'ahsho got'ine. In the Dene 
language, earth, the land, is called “ndeh” or “nne”, hence 
Denendeh, the land of the people, of the Dene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the parliamentary debates translation team will no doubt be 
calling my office, as they did after my speech on Bill C-8, but we must 
keep the aboriginal names. I find it important to keep repeating these 
names in this House so that we do not forget the great aboriginal 
culture. I think it is only doing them justice to mention these peoples' 
names. I also appreciate that it is not easy to keep track for those 
recording our proceedings. I can assure them of my full co-operation in 
providing them with any information they might need after I conclude my 
remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the writings of Father Morice, aboriginal nations in 
the Mackenzie Valley lived off fishing and caribou hunting. They also 
trapped. Their means of transportation were, and still are, canoes in 
the summer and snowshoes or dogsleds in the winter. With whatever they 
hunt or trap, they make toboggans, clothes, including mittens and coats, 
and fish nets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, when I visited the neighbouring region, where the Dene 
influence is also noticeable, I was impressed by the beautiful and warm 
mitts, coats, moccasins and clothes that are made and decorated in the 
great aboriginal cultural tradition of that region of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the early days of colonization, relations between the Dene 
and westerners have always been marked by struggles for territorial 
ownership. These disputes concern Canadians, who are not very familiar 
with their object and primary cause. 
In fact, conflicts occur when the government does not consult aboriginal 
peoples regarding the development and disposal of their lands. The 
problem is not a new one: it has always existed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The disputes essentially relate to the fact that aboriginals and 
westerners do not share the same vision of the world. Their values are 
different and often opposed. Let me give you an example. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1220"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT28"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT28"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1220

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We westerners have a tendency to say that the land belongs to us. 
We set boundaries, we mark out the lands we buy in the cities and in the 
country. In aboriginal culture, the land belongs to everyone. This major 
philosophical difference has often generated problems. The solution is, 
of course, to establish the kind of relationship that will benefit both 
cultures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be realized that, for the first settlers and for the 
immigrants who followed them, Canada represented an opportunity for a 
new life. But in the case of aboriginal people, their lives would never 
be the same. 
In precolonial times the aboriginal people were autonomous and 
independent, with their own political system, their own social 
system, their own educational system.  Afterward, they saw their 
property and their lands slip from their control.  A number of 
historians and ethnologists feel that Canada's prosperity in the 
north was achieved at the expense of the Indians, as I have already 
said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Colonization concentrated initially on the agricultural lands 
of the south.  The resource-rich lands were, however, exploited 
almost as soon as they were discovered, for instance the treaty 8 
and treaty 11 lands in this particular region.  Gold was discovered 
in the Klondike in 1896, and the gold rush began. 
That is what prompted Canada to sign treaty No. 8 with the Dene, 
who were opposed to prospectors and miners coming through their 
territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I referred to Voisey Bay when I was speaking on Bill C-8.  The 
same thing is still happening today.  We arrive, we explore, we 
find huge deposits, and we move into lands that have always been 
inhabited by aboriginal nations as if they were our own. We churn 
out millions of dollars without any concern for fairness, for 
paying back part of it in the form of royalties, at least to the 
aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The treaty was signed in particular because of the 1920 
discovery of oil deposits at Norman Wells in the Mackenzie Basin. 
We can see the spirit behind the treaties, that they were mutual 
agreements.  From the moment that wealth was discovered, there was 
an interest in signing treaties in order to avoid problems. 
However, when there was no wealth, we left people alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada put a lot of effort into trying to convince the Indians 
that signing Treaty No. 8 and Treaty No. 11 would mean no 
encroachment on lands and no meddling in their life, which was 
based on hunting, fishing and trapping.  As I said, the signing of 
Treaty No. 8 and Treaty No. 11 has to be seen in the context of the 
political and economic events of the time that were shaping 
Canada's future.  These treaties came about as a result of the 
Klondike gold rush between 1896 and 1898 and of the development by 
both individuals and businesses of resources like oil and gas, 
which we looked at earlier in connection with Bill C-8.  These 
events created a very fevered climate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Indians, furious at the damage to their economy and the 
fires in their forests—people did not bother to cut down trees, 
the forest was simply burned so mining equipment could be brought 
in—reacted strongly to the invasion of their lands.  In June 
1898, the Indians around Fort St. John refused to allow police and 
miners onto their land until a treaty was concluded.  The 
government felt that a treaty had to be concluded with them on 
their rights to the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The treaty commissioners met the Cree and the Dene, who owned 
324,900 square kilometres from northern Saskatchewan, Alberta and 
British Columbia to south of Hay River and of Great Slave Lake in 
the Northwest Territories.  Under Treaty No. 8, the crown continued 
its policy of offering benefits to Indians who allowed settlers to 
move onto their land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This treaty includes the usual clauses on the surrender and 
transfer of land in exchange for government protection, although the 
commissioners did not discuss these clauses with the northern aboriginal 
population. There were no discussions, these clauses were simply 
applied. So these are the infamous clauses referred to as the 
extinguishing clauses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The negotiations went on for many months, and as can often be seen 
throughout the history of Canada, these negotiations show a lack of 
understanding by officials of the conditions laid down by the Cree and 
Dene nations. When these treaties were negotiated, the commissioners did 
not explain clearly to the first nations the meaning of the concepts of 
surrender and transfer contained in these documents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the Indians, any talks on these lands were based on the 
assumption that they would keep what they considered to be sufficient 
land in their respective areas, while allowing newcomers to share them.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, while according to western philosophy the land 
must be owned by someone, according to aboriginal philosophy, the land 
belongs to everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many nations thought they were signing peace and friendship 
treaties, not land transfer treaties. It is also unlikely that, in their 
eagerness to close these deals quickly, commissioners spent very much 
time explaining the concept of land transfer in any great detail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am saying has been faithfully reported in the report of the 
royal commission on aboriginal peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a word, the concepts and principles of land transfer contained 
in these two treaties reflect a different reality, depending on whether 
one is an aboriginal or a Canadian. No sooner were the treaties signed 
that the authorities started passing legislation and drafting 
regulations limiting the fishing, hunting and trapping activities of the 
aboriginal peoples, which is exactly what they had been afraid of. As a 
result of these measures, the Dene were condemned to live in poverty and 
the very foundation of their economy was undermined, while the newcomers 
on the land benefited and continue to benefit from the godsend that the 
natural resources in the Mackenzie Valley truly are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ownership of the land and resources covered by Treaty No. 8 and 
Treaty No. 11 has given rise to lengthy discussions on politics and 
economics, court challenges, comprehensive claims and an inquiry, the 
one conducted by Mr. Justice Berger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it important to give an overview of the purpose of the two 
agreements. 
The bill before us today stems from two agreements, one concerning the 
Dene settlements on Sahtu land and the other concerning the Gwich'in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we pay attention to the way the agreements are worded, we can 
see that the purpose of both the Gwich'in and the Sahtu comprehensive 
agreements are identical. It is worthwhile taking a closer look. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Dene, Metis and Gwich'in people of Canada negotiated the 
agreement with the following objectives in mind: first, to clearly 
define the right to own and to use the land and its resources; second, 
to confer the rights and benefits set out in the agreement in exchange 
for waiving certain claims which the Dene, Metis and Gwich'ins have, in 
any part of Canada, by treaty or otherwise. That is the famous 
extinguishing clause I referred to earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, to recognize and promote the way of life of the Dene, Metis 
and Gwich'in, which is based on their cultural and economic relations 
with the land. For them, the land is something that belongs to everyone. 
So, this treaty attempts to reconcile the two philosophies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, to promote self-sufficiency for the Sahtu Dene, Metis and 
Gwich'in, and to recognize their ability to fully participate in all 
aspects of economic life. They want to move away from the infamous 
Indian Act. They want a land base with adequate resources to ensure 
their own economic autonomy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, to grant specific benefits, including allowances, lands and 
other economic benefits, to the Dene, Metis and Gwich'in. 
Sixth, to grant to the Dene, Metis and Gwich'in rights regarding 
wildlife harvesting, as well as the right to take part in the decisions 
relating to wildlife management and to hunting, in accordance with 
aboriginal culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seventh, to give to the Dene, Metis and Gwich'in the right to take 
part in the decisions on the use, management and conservation of land, 
water and resources. The bill before us today applies specifically to 
this part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eighth, to protect and to preserve wildlife and the environment in 
the region covered to the settlement, for the benefit of present and 
future generations. Another cultural trait of aboriginal people is that 
they often think of future generations. Mohawks, among others, often 
speak of the seventh generation. In other words, their current decisions 
are based on the fact that the seventh generation must also benefit from 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, to guarantee to the Dene and Metis the possibility of 
signing agreements on self-government. These changes are being 
negotiated and could become reality in the days and months to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Dene, who live in the south of that territory, continue to 
consider Treaty No. 8 and Treaty No. 11 as the legal and political basis 
of their relations with Canada. It is the same everywhere. People say 
there have always been problems regarding the implementation of these 
two treaties, and there are still problems today.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They want to review the original treaties and interpret them. 
At the time, in certain numbered treaties, there was a reference to 
providing a medical kit.  Today, aboriginal peoples feel they are 
entitled to full medical services.  And the government is rejecting 
this wholly or in part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, aboriginal peoples would like to see effect given to 
Treaty No. 8 and Treaty No. 11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me finally to the position of the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gérard Asselin:</B> Mr. Speaker, my colleague, the hon. member 
for Saint-Jean, is giving an excellent speech before the House, a 
speech that required a great deal of research, because the member 
is concerned about aboriginal communities.  He is giving an 
excellent speech in the House, having spent much time and effort, 
and I find it unfortunate that there are only two Liberal members, 
and even only one Liberal member out of the 155 in the House. I ask 
therefore for a quorum count. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  An hon. member has 
called quorum.  Do we have a quorum? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>And the count having been taken:</I> 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The Chair has 
determined that there is a quorum in the House. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my 
colleague for all the significance he attaches to the aboriginal 
voice and to the aboriginal nations in Canada.  It is a pity that 
people are more interested in having lunch than in hearing about 
the future of the aboriginal nations.  This may be a reflection of 
government behaviour toward aboriginal issues in recent years.  I 
feel it is quite symptomatic of what is going on.  I would like to 
thank my colleague nevertheless. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK30"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont—Dundas, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on a point of order.  With all the respect I have for my 
colleague opposite, and in particular his commitment to and work 
in the area of aboriginal affairs, to somehow want to leave us 
with the view that having lunch is more important than the issue 
before the House is total rubbish.  On the other hand, I do not 
think it is parliamentary to reflect on the absence of members. 
It does not serve well either side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to take any more time of the House because the 
issue being debated is very important.  I salute my colleague 
opposite who does a tremendous amount of work on this issue. 
However I hope he would stay to the debate and substance of the 
issue rather than reflect on the presence or absence of members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The government whip 
is quite correct.  It is an established precedent in the House 
that we do not reflect on the absence or presence of members of 
the House. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, you will agree with me, 
however, that the procedural question as to whether there is a 
quorum does not mean that the House is full at that time.  It means 
the opposite rather.  I think that is what my hon. colleague meant 
to say.  I agree with the hon. government whip that I may have gone 
further than I meant to when I said that the Liberal Party was more 
interested in having lunch than in looking after the aboriginal 
nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the position of the Bloc Quebecois, and I will conclude 
with this since I have not much time left, the Bloc Quebecois will 
oppose this bill on the following grounds.  There are two 
agreements, one with the Sahtu Dene and the other with the 
Gwich'in. 
The government said it would use those agreements as the basis of 
a bill which would handle the entire question of water and lands in 
the Mackenzie Valley.  By that very fact, all of the other 
communities have not settled their claims are being included.  That 
strikes us as a major problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have consulted these communities and they have told us that 
they had pulled out of the negotiations and that now legislation 
was being applied to them, implementing follow-up or application of 
an agreement that does not concern them. 
In other words, no land claim agreements were concluded with them, 
and here we are imposing one because of agreements that were 
reached elsewhere. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1235"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically, the Deh Cho and the Dogrib withdrew from the 
agreements and were not consulted on anything further.  Today they 
are faced with a bill that will be including them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are implementation problems of such proportion, in my 
opinion, that the Bloc cannot today support such a bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point was raised in discussions, particularly with the 
Deh Cho and the Dogrib.  They wanted complete sovereignty over 
their land. 
In other words, they no longer wanted to be a part of Canada, and 
the federal government is totally opposed to that sort of thing. 
I wanted to raise the point because I did not want this example to 
be used to tell Quebec that the native peoples in northern Quebec 
were entitled to separate from northern Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is not permitted in Canada, it should not be permitted 
in Quebec either, and if this is the case, the sovereignists and 
the federalists should not be going at each other over the ins and 
outs of this debate.  I felt it important to say that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the Bloc Quebecois opposes Bill C-6, because it 
wants it to apply only to the native peoples in the Sahtu region 
and to the Gwich'in, with whom the government has agreements.  We 
oppose having the bill apply to the others as well. 
Accordingly, the Bloc Quebecois opposes the bill at second reading. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK31"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in the spirit 
of the aboriginal royal commission, the passage of Bill C-6 is 
not just about honouring federal government obligations or paying 
moral debt to aboriginal people.  It is about the development and 
implementation of firm and consensual foundations for a new 
relationship between aboriginal and non-aboriginal Canadians.  In 
this case it is about a fair sharing of Mackenzie Valley land and 
water resources and the strengthening of a relationship of mutual 
and peaceful co-existence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my pleasure to rise in the House to participate in the 
debate on Bill C-6, an act to provide for an integrated system of 
land and water management in the Mackenzie Valley, to establish 
certain boards for that purpose and to make consequential 
amendments to other acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill implements obligations under land claims agreements 
between the Government of Canada, the Gwich'in, the Sahtu Dene 
and the Metis respectively.  The main purpose of the bill in 
accordance with the land claims agreements is to create an 
integrated co-management regime for land and waters in the 
Mackenzie Valley that would be applied through the creation of 
certain boards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These boards will be comprised of 50% first nations 
representatives and the other 50% federal and territorial 
representatives.  This will give the first nations a far stronger 
role in decision making.  It is the result of extensive 
consultations and a co-operative effort among the northwest first 
nations, the territorial government and the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Sahtu Secretariat Incorporated supports the enactment of the 
bill.  The Gwich'in Tribal Council is on record supporting the 
bill.  The Government of the Northwest Territories supports the 
intent of the bill.  The Canadian Association of Petroleum 
Producers and the Canada Energy Pipeline Association support the 
bill.  We support the bill and speedy passage of the legislation. 
One of the main reasons for our support is the co-operative 
effort behind the drafting of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill provides the land use planning boards with the power to 
develop land use plans and to ensure that future use of the land 
is done according to the approved plans.  The land and water 
boards and their panels are given the power to regulate the use 
of the lands and the water, including the issuance of land 
permits and water licences.  The Environmental Impact Review 
Board will be the main instrument for the examination of the 
environmental impact of proposed development, including public 
review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With an increase in local accountability and responsibility, 
particularly when the northwest first nation and the territorial 
government will be in the majority position on each of the boards 
being created, there is no question that the new integrated 
system of land and water management in the Mackenzie Valley will 
be far more sustainable in the long run. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the Kluane first nations and non-aboriginal people 
who live in an area of Kluane have land use planning boards.  The 
population in that area is just over 300 people and those 
meetings regularly draw out over 150 people to participate in the 
planning and care of the land in that area.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have made polluters responsible for policing 
themselves.  Degradation of our environment including air, soil 
and water has increased under the government.  Canada is falling 
behind its international obligations to protect the environment. 
Our Arctic is polluted because of specific actions or policies of 
the federal government.  The federal Government of Canada is 
failing to protect our air, water resources and ecosystems, and 
there is a long record to prove it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all aware of and have experienced the dramatic 
implications, including in my own riding, of the cuts in spending 
and staff the government has imposed on Environment Canada.  The 
impact of such a policy has been compounded by provincial and 
territorial cuts in the same areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have seen the environmental protection service of 
Environment Canada hard hit with the downsizing of the 
government.  This was the branch that set unenforced regulations 
on industries like mining, chemical production, and pulp and 
paper.  We are aware the federal government with its ideological 
doctrine of business competitiveness and deregulation is imposing 
declining standards on our environmental conservation programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are optimistic that the devolution process and the 
implementation of land claims agreements like the one being 
completed by the passage of the bill will stop the trend to 
degrading our environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The relationship between the first nations and the environment 
is one embedded in a different cultural relationship and is not 
there for short term economic gain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples grasped 
the spiritual relationship of the first nations with their 
environment.  The final report of the commission indicated the 
ultimate importance to aboriginal societies of the spiritual 
relationship to the land.  The relationship arises not only 
because of dependence on the natural world for life itself but 
out of a belief that human beings were placed on earth at 
creation and given special responsibilities for the stewardship 
of our environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The views of aboriginal society will now be included in the new 
resource policy for the valley.  It will be its responsibility to 
manage land and water in the valley in the most appropriate way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a pleasure to be present and participate in the debate of 
a bill promoting a more positive relationship between aboriginal 
groups and the rest of Canadians.  Bill C-6 has implemented a new 
approach concerning the recognition of the rights of aboriginal 
people in the management of land and water resources.  This new 
approach ratifies respect for the treaty relationships that 
Canada is creating with our aboriginal societies.  That is good 
for aboriginals of the country and good for Canada as a nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I reiterate our support for the bill and will 
work for its passage in a quick and speedy way that shows respect 
for the people who so carefully drafted the bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK32"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to make a few remarks about the principle of Bill C-6. I 
believe in and will speak to the principle of the bill.  I make 
these remarks as the Progressive Conservative critic of Indian 
affairs and northern development.  I also make them as someone 
who has over the years watched from a distance.  Frankly I have 
been amazed at the length of time it takes for the valid 
aspirations of aboriginal peoples to be satisfied by the 
Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am most thankful that aboriginal leadership in the Mackenzie 
Valley has been so very patient over the decades with what I am 
willing to bet was an endless round of negotiation with 
government officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is no ordinary bill.  It represents a principle that is so 
laudable and so welcome Canadians should be thankful it has 
arrived after so many years of toing and froing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members may know this bill represents a conclusion of sorts 
to the precedent setting litigation and negotiation of aboriginal 
title claims in the Northwest Territories. Perhaps some will 
remember that the native peoples up there were faced with what 
some saw as the stark reality of a huge development project 
showing up on their doorstep without any input from them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially there were and remain, of course, concerns about a 
disruption of a way of life, a disruption of the lands and the 
waters.  For people in the Northwest Territories, life is the 
land and the water. One of the most remarkable features of this 
land is the great and powerful Mackenzie River, one of the 
world's longest at 4,241 kilometres.  It and its huge valley need 
to be respected and protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am only just learning the history of this land myself. Perhaps 
it would be useful to cite some of it respecting this matter so 
that other members might better understand this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 2, 1973, 24 years ago, some 16 bands filed a caveat in 
the land titles office in Yellowknife claiming aboriginal rights 
to almost half the land in the Northwest Territories. When they 
did that, they got the government's attention.  The effect of 
that caveat would have been to make any further land grants in 
the area subject to the claim of the Indians if it were 
subsequently found that they had a valid legal interest in the 
land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That may sound like legalese and I suppose it is, but it is very 
important legalese and it was very important to the eventual 
settlement of the land claims in the Northwest Territories and in 
Canada as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hearings were held and an interim judgment was handed down from 
the Supreme Court of the Northwest Territories which upheld the 
caveat saying “that there is enough doubt as to whether the full 
aboriginal title has been extinguished, certainly in the minds of 
the Indians, to justify the caveat or to protect the Indian 
position until a final adjudication can be obtained”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This process has moved slowly and if you will pardon the pun it 
has moved glacially slowly.  Of course, the federal government 
appealed.  That hearing was to take place before the appellate 
division of the Supreme Court of the Northwest Territories in 
June 1975.  Assuredly, this has been a slow process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile, tired of waiting but wanting to get on with the job, 
behind the scenes the aboriginal leadership negotiated 
successfully with the then minister of Indian affairs to engage 
in preliminary discussions to develop the groundwork for a 
comprehensive settlement of Indian claims in the Northwest 
Territories. Essentially the aboriginal leadership pushed the 
idea of fairness, not a radical idea.  They were adamant that a 
settlement of native claims must precede the pipeline or any 
other major development projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This evolved slowly.  Maybe for some it was terribly slow. 
Certainly a great many people got tired of waiting.  Finally it 
evolved to the present date, until Bill C-6 is before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill, I am told, was developed by a co-ordinating group 
comprised of representatives from DIAND, Northwest Territories 
government, representatives of the Gwich'in Tribal Council, the 
Sahtu Secretariat and the Department of Justice.  We are all 
hopeful that their many years of dialogue have borne fruit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party is in favour of transferring 
responsibilities and power to the local level and sharing 
management and development duties. We believe, as most Canadians 
believe, that this is an important step in empowering all 
residents of the Northwest Territories. In principle, the joint 
boards this bill will establish are a good idea.  However, I am 
looking forward to the hearings before committee to give it 
closer examination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is intended to implement obligations under land claims 
signed five years ago, as well as in September 1993. In 1992, the 
Gwitch'in Tribal Council settled a comprehensive land claim that 
provided for 22,422 square kilometres of land in the northwestern 
portion of the Northwest Territories and 1,554 square kilometres 
of land in Yukon. 
It also provided for subsurface rights, a share in the resource 
royalties derived from the valley, tax free capital transfers, 
hunting rights, a greater role in the management of wildlife, 
land and the environment, and the right of first refusal on a 
variety of activities related to wildlife.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are good things and surely we have made some headway since 
1973.  Yet if they represent one principle it would be one 
related to good government.  I am sure the current minister would 
recognize the efforts and the success of the previous 
Conservative government in establishing this excellent 
partnership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us provides for the establishment of management 
boards to co-ordinate environmental assessment and land and water 
regulation in the Mackenzie Valley.  The valley is 4,241 
kilometres long.  This is a huge undertaking by the government of 
this country and I commend the government for it. People often 
think of the north or the Mackenzie Valley as a barren wasteland. 
On the contrary, it has been home to the Inuit and the Dene for 
10,000 years. Martin Frobisher's expeditions back in the 1570s 
were the first recorded visits to the Northwest Territories by an 
outsider. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope this bill will go some way to ensure that with all the 
wealth and the potential to be found under the surface of the 
land and the water in the Mackenzie Valley that outsiders respect 
the land and water and that they show some respect for the people 
who are called the insiders of the Mackenzie Valley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for allowing me as the representative 
for the Conservative Party to participate in this debate. The 
Progressive Conservative Party of Canada supports this bill.  We 
support its goals and aspirations. Furthermore we support the 
goals and the aspirations of the people who live in the north and 
who have brought this bill forward. 
<P><A NAME="LINK33"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have a couple of points with respect to the hon. member's speech. 
He claimed that the aboriginals have claimed up to half the 
territory of the Northwest Territories.  This rather ambitious 
claim could have been dealt with in two ways, through the courts 
or through negotiation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the years following that claim, governments have decided not 
to use the courts as a method of resolving these claim disputes. 
When a dispute arises if one partner feels he is in an 
advantageous position it is very unlikely that he will be willing 
to go to court.  He obviously wants to negotiate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He lauded the past Conservative government for negotiating away 
large tracts of land and many rights and benefits not on the 
basis of long term residency in the Northwest Territories but on 
the basis of race.  Could the member comment on whether he 
believes this is the way to go? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about first rights of refusal on many activities.  Is 
that the correct way to go?  He knows that when one group obtains 
rights it is usually at the expense of another group.  I would 
like him to clarify some of these things for me, especially the 
issue of adjudication or negotiation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his questions.  He raises some valid points.  We in this 
House have to remember that these issues are not completely 
settled yet.  It is second reading of the bill.  We have a way to 
go yet. 
I was alluding to the general thrust and the point of the bill. 
Certainly we support that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member commented on the size of the land claim 
agreement, the fact that it deals with surface rights and that 
the north is a polyglot of people and represents more than just 
the native peoples. Many people have moved to the north in the 
last couple of hundred years.  The bill applies to everyone in 
the north.  It is our belief that there is room for everyone and 
there is room in this bill to include everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not the intent of this party to leave any group out and I 
do not believe it is the intent of the bill to leave any group in

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Children and 
Youth), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak on Bill 
C-6, the Mackenzie Valley resource management act. I have been 
listening to my colleagues on all sides of the House speak to 
this bill.  It has been a very interesting and rewarding 
experience, to say the least, that we have agreements on various 
aspects, if not the total intent and principle of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the principles on which this bill is based are sound and 
acceptable I believe to most members. The obligation to provide a 
bill to help us to give life to provisions of those claims that 
have been settled is quite clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an obligation because we have enacted legislation at 
another time that clearly indicates that in order for those 
claims to have full effect and force, this regime needs to be 
enacted.  That is quite clear.  It is indisputable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that Bill C-6 is proposed to enhance local public 
government in the Mackenzie Valley, to provide certainty and 
consistency for residents and industry and fulfil outstanding 
obligations under the Gwich'in and Sahtu Dene and Metis land 
claim agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not unusual for any government to find itself in a 
catch-22 situation because not all things happen at the same time 
or at the same speed. There are those in the Mackenzie Valley 
area who have yet to settle their claims. There are those who 
have concerns but we are only at second reading of the bill.  It 
is quite plain to see that the democratic process will allow them 
to have their say, that will make provisions for them to speak 
their mind to the bill and to quell their fears. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some features of the Mackenzie Valley resource management act 
will act as an advantage to Mackenzie Valley First Nations 
without claim settlements. These are to be interpreted.  When we 
interpret them each individual and group comes up with its own 
interpretation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, clause 5(2) should give some comfort to those 
individuals.  It speaks to the aboriginal and treaty rights being 
protected under that clause.  It is an act that would be reviewed 
in consultation with First Nations, which I just spoke to 
previously.  Clause 5(1) states that it does not affect the 
Indian Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clauses 99 and 112 provide for the nomination of members to the 
boards, thereby providing a much stronger voice in resource 
management decision making throughout the Mackenzie Valley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 108 allows for permanent regional land and water panels 
on settlement of land claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also advances for the Government of the Northwest 
Territories.  It clearly support this.  We have in writing the 
support of the territorial government for this integrated 
management resource regime.  It is a system it feels holds the 
principles of equality that will allow for all groups to come 
forward and to participate with a good sense of fairness and 
equal participation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also talks about public boards in parts 4 and 5 while 
integrating the regions.  It provides a form of public government 
that may accommodate self-government, co-management of resources 
endorsed by the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of these issues and nuances that relate to it or aspects of 
it could be debated by various members but generally the 
obligation for us to enact this bill is clear.  The principles 
that it holds are democratic, fair and representative and I 
believe have a fair buy-in from all parties concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is not into a regime of overregulation so that 
industry cannot move.  That is not what this government is on 
about.  We are not about exclusion and hiding a set of guidelines 
that preclude everyone else.  That is not the extent to which the 
government would like to operate.  What we are on about is to 
make it so that the goals are commendable and that there are 
clear reasons for this House to support this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary has informed the House that the 
regional land claim agreements of the Gwich'in, the Sahtu Dene 
and Metis commit the government to establish a new resource 
regulatory regime in the respective settlement areas.  They have 
also heard from NDP members, members opposite, and my hon. 
colleague from the Conservative Party who just spoke about some 
of these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The boards created under Bill C-6 are public government boards 
which will operate in the public interest.  These boards are 
extremely important.  Not only is the process important but the 
ensuing products of this act will be extremely important because 
they are integrated and they are meant to serve all people.  They 
are meant not to prejudice, nor to abrogate or derogate the 
rights of those who have yet to settle their claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent of the government is to serve all fairly.  That is 
what raises the whole spectre of a catch 22.  In trying to serve 
all members of its constituencies fairly, we face this dilemma. 
We are at second reading.  We know that those individuals who 
have concerns have the opportunity to be heard.  That is 
extremely important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the new regime, people from the Mackenzie Valley will sit 
on the boards.  There will be an opportunity for increased input 
through public hearings.  As well the nominees of different 
groups will bring their own perspectives to the boards resulting 
in a balance of interest and best overall decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak to why it is absolutely important that we 
have this regime.  In the Northwest Territories we are about to 
become the producer, a significant producer of quality diamonds 
in Canada's north.  By 1998 the first mine will account for about 
6% of the world's diamond production by value.  With other 
prospects coming into production this could climb to 15% or more 
within the next 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not hear much about that.  We hear about Voisey's Bay and 
all of the other regimes which are coming forward, but this is 
significant.  This is the largest diamond development in the 
western hemisphere, outside of a small diamond development in 
Colorado to the south of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The diamond industry is unlike any other.  Canada will soon join 
an exclusive club of producers of one of the most valuable and 
coveted commodities on earth.  We are believed to be in the top 
percentage of the highest value of diamonds in the world. Diamond 
mining produces an exceptionally high return on investment at 
approximately 50%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example a company which is currently in diamond development 
in the north will recover the capital costs associated with its 
first mine at Lac de Gras within the first five years of 
operation.  How many businesses do that? Usually there are long 
term strategic goals for economic recovery in a new business. 
This is significant.  The company will go on to generate over 
$14.3 billion in income during 25 years with just one mine. 
There are other proposed mines.  Its profit over that same period 
is estimated at $4.3 billion.

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, I am aware that there are fair returns for the people who 
live there, but there are other things we must consider. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada will also be a major beneficiary of the 
north's new diamond mining industry.  It will earn $2.4 billion 
in taxes and royalties just with the first diamond mine.  The 
federal government's net fiscal benefits increase to $4.4 billion 
when royalties, corporate and personal income taxes, indirect and 
induced fiscal impacts and grant offsets to the Government of the 
Northwest Territories are factored in. These are all new numbers. 
They are not generated by our government but they are out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of all the parties involved, the Northwest Territories stands to 
gain the least from this lucrative industry.  It will receive 
only $.2 billion.  So far that is the information we have and the 
information I have. All this to say that the $7 million raised 
annually in tax revenues by the territorial government will be 
far less than what it will spend on infrastructure and social 
programs over the lifetime of the mine.  That is significant 
considering the cutbacks various levels of government have 
experienced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite advertising claims, diamonds are not forever.  The 
governments and people at the territorial level feel that the 
newest industry in Canada, developing diamond value added 
industries in Canada should be done in the north.  Billions of 
dollars and potentially hundreds if not thousands of 
manufacturing and retail jobs are at stake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every diamond producing country in the world demands valuation 
and sorting take place within its borders before diamonds are 
exported. This apparently is the standard.  Many require that 
diamonds be set aside for domestic production or insist on a 
cutting and polishing industry domestically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, thriving diamond industries exist in places as 
diverse as Gaborone, Botswana, Freetown and Perth.  In the 
Northwest Territories the residents and the leaders believe no 
less and we share the same view that those value added activities 
should happen within our own borders.  What happens in the 
Northwest Territories is good for Alberta, Manitoba, B.C., 
Saskatchewan, Newfoundland, Quebec and Ontario because we have a 
small population.  We attract those people by way of service 
contracts and workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I go home I travel almost every week with workers who are 
going out to those activities including the other mines that had 
a rough ride with their stocks and shares last night. Nonetheless 
there is that kind of development in the north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Northwest Territories we have other activities that are 
ensuing.  Lots of land has been put up for bid for exploration. 
Some very welcome contenders have put bids on those.  I cannot 
say the names of those groups.  They are in the oil and gas field 
and we also have gold and other mineral resource development in 
the north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Oil and gas is a major industry for our people in the north and 
we value that.  That is why we seek a balance with this 
legislation.  We know we need to have that kind of a balance.  We 
know we need to be able to speak to all the parts of this bill, 
all the constituents of this bill, not just one aspect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is extremely important that the recipients, the major 
benefactors in terms of resource development, be northerners. 
That does not mean them exclusively.  It means other levels in 
this country, the federal government, the territorial government, 
the municipal governments, industry and various other industries 
from abroad should benefit as well.  There is a balance to be 
struck but there is far greater opportunity than I think we 
recognize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an important bill because it is a step forward in the 
devolution process in the Northwest Territories. 
It will ensure government for and by those directly affected by 
the decisions.  It will ensure better overall planning of 
development, as well as a better understanding of the cumulative 
environmental effects of development. These boards will serve the 
interests of land owners, developers and the public alike.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not a stranger to the views that prevail out there on this 
particular bill.  I have had access to industry members who do 
not necessarily favour it.  I have had access to aboriginal 
groups who do not favour various parts of this bill but who think 
the principles if they apply to everyone are fair and okay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had access to the groups that will be well served by this 
bill but who understand and are sensitive to their colleagues. 
They know that nonetheless unless they have this bill they will 
not be able to enact those provisions in their claims.  They 
cannot move forward to actualize and implement their claim the 
way they should unless they have this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore the dilemma we have is that we must do our level best 
in this House, as members of the House, to serve all of those who 
would best be served by finding the balance in the legislation to 
respect the rights of all those who will be affected by it. That 
does not mean we do not do anything, that we are caught in 
inertia or that we are paralyzed. It means that we must be 
careful and thoughtful, which is what we do as legislators, and 
we should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new boards will have powers under the legislation.  The 
boards will have the right to summon witnesses and order them to 
give evidence or produce documents necessary for carrying out the 
board's responsibilities.  This will be enforceable in the same 
manner as an order of the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Decisions and orders of the boards may be appealed to the 
Supreme Court of the Northwest Territories.  If there is a 
conflict between this legislation and a land claim settlement, 
the settlement agreement will prevail.  That is apparently the 
law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The law is subject to interpretation and it is subject to the 
way it is enforced.  Laws are not meant to be brutal.  Laws are 
meant to be enforced considering the human factor.  The human 
factor is a multifaceted one.  It is one which has many sides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not live in the Northwest Territories, especially in the 
Mackenzie Valley, in a homogeneous setting.  We live in a 
heterogeneous setting.  We have many cultures and many groups. 
We have many people with different levels of education and 
skills. We have people who are in industry.  We have people who 
have an extreme attachment to environmental issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We continue in our own way in the Northwest Territories to find 
the balance.  I as a legislator am tasked with this.  My view is 
that it is important that we fulfil the crown's commitments to 
the Gwich'in, the Sahtu Dene and the Metis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the parliamentary secretary has indicated, extensive 
consultations have taken place regarding this legislation.  I 
appreciate the concerns and issues which have been raised by the 
First Nations in the Northwest Territories.  It is my obligation 
as their member of Parliament to see this time as an opportunity 
for discussion and debate to continue.  Let them come forward 
with their views.  They can best speak to them.  I cannot speak 
on their behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore urge my hon. colleagues to join me in supporting 
Bill C-6.  It speaks to many of the issues I have raised, such as 
the profile of one of the major developments in the western 
hemisphere, the whole diamond industry, which is unprecedented in 
North America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an opportunity to build. We have an opportunity to 
share.  We have an opportunity to work together.  I do not see 
any mitigating factors which would prevent us from doing that.  I 
do not see anything stopping us from engaging in a process that 
is fair, consultative and that looks for the best product for our 
citizens.  It is our obligation to do that as members of 
Parliament, as ministers of the crown, or whatever role we are 
engaged in in an official capacity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope we will take this opportunity to invite those who have 
questions to come forward and to speak for themselves.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>   Mr. Speaker, I was 
particularly impressed with the content, passion and the obvious 
understanding with which the hon. member presented her arguments 
in favour of Bill C-6. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a couple of questions I would like to address to the 
hon. member which deal with some of the words used which 
reverberate very favourably in my mind.  These are words like 
fairness, balance and the development of the economy for 
individuals and entrepreneurs as well as for the country at 
large. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member if she would please tell the House to what 
degree would her government be prepared to amend the proposed 
bill which is now before the House to accommodate some of the 
questions and concerns that the first nations, the Metis and 
business people have, as well as other people across Canada.  She 
states rather correctly that many of the things that will be done 
here will affect not only the Northwest Territories but Alberta 
and other provinces and the federal government in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if she would address to what degree will she and her 
government accept amendments to accommodate the various 
conflicting interests at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have been in 
Parliament for nine years, now in my third term.  It has been my 
experience that amendments are a way of life when we are dealing 
with various acts and bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking very strongly about the principles of this bill. 
I have not heard any amendments come forward. I do not have a 
list of amendments. Those groups that will best speak for 
themselves, that have those concerns have not come forward and 
given me those lists or inventories of amendments. I am not the 
minister to speak to those or the parliamentary secretary. They 
will be dealt with in a fair and judicious manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we must remember that the principles of the bill should 
be upheld and not be undercut by amendments which would take the 
bill down.  That would not be acceptable.  It would defeat the 
original purpose of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that we have a consultative process and ideas are 
brought forward which will best reflect what is needed for all 
constituents concerned with this bill.  I think those will be 
entertained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot come forward today and say that certain sections of the 
bill will be amended.  I cannot do that because it is 
unrealistic.  I would assume it does not undercut the principles 
of the bill or undo the bill generally. At various stages 
amendments are entertained.  However, I do not know of any 
specifics from the constituent groups yet. 
<P><A NAME="LINK36"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to the hon. member and I congratulate her on her 
remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to comment on a couple of things in the bill in general 
and specifically on the devolution of power to the NWT.  I would 
like her to comment on the government's position about the 
devolution of power.  Is there a willingness on behalf of the 
government to follow up Bill C-6 with necessary bills and 
regulations which will eventually lead to some type of provincial 
recognition by the government of Canada, as many other provinces 
have evolved in the country?  Is there a willingness on behalf of 
the government to follow that through? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I cannot speak on 
behalf of the minister responsible for this bill. However, within 
the confines of the territorial government's legislative assembly 
a speech was given about the support for devolution.  Following 
there were arrangements with regard to health and we transferred 
responsibilities for that.  We are in the process of looking at 
various other opportunities on both sides which will speak to 
honouring the whole process of devolution. However, we must take 
caution.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In devolving responsibility we must understand that there are 
many players and many people are affected.  There are the Inuit 
people, the first nations people, the Metis people, the 
non-aboriginal people who come from all parts of Canada to be 
permanent residents of the north, whom we love and respect, who 
share with us in our toils every day in building a wonderful part 
of this country.  We must be cautious that we do not exclude, 
undercut or destroy the rights of those people in achieving what 
we might perceive to be a higher goal. We must be conscious of 
that and that is not easy to do.  It is complicated.  It is 
complex and is something that requires a great deal of 
sensitivity and a great deal of care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague will know that there is a commitment but it is 
one that is undertaken with great caution. 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
compliment the member on her commitment to bringing jobs to the 
Northwest Territories, to the diamond mines that are currently 
under development and the classification and sorting of the 
diamonds, these highly skilled and quality jobs.  It is vital 
that we recognize that they could quite easily be located in the 
north and add value to the development of the northern economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a little concerned about the numbers of boards and 
jurisdictions we are creating.  This bill creates about five or 
six different boards for a very small population.  I appreciate 
the environmental concerns and the fragility of the environment. 
I have two questions for the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, how can we ensure that development will proceed apace as 
it can and perhaps as it should to provide job opportunities and 
skills and economic development for the north? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I am concerned about the devolution of powers by the 
minister.  The bill gives the minister powers to delegate 
responsibilities to the Government of the Northwest Territories. 
It is not clear to me whether these boards will always report 
back to the minister specifically or whether it is within his 
power to delegate the reporting responsibility of the boards back 
to the Government of the Northwest Territories or to him always. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague 
raises some very important points.  There is no doubt in my mind 
that this bill is directly aimed at dealing with the issue of 
certainty which will give comfort to the various constituent 
groups that they can proceed in a balanced and sustainable way 
with development.  That is easier said than done.  We do not 
always have friendly partners in that process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The north has exemplified through the kinds of agreements it has 
reached over the years under various development regimes that it 
can work together and I think this bill will aid that. When this 
bill comes to its final resolution it will do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of devolution is a little more complicated.  I am not 
sure of all the micro managing details and all the tasks assigned 
to the various members of the board.  I am not that familiar with 
the bill.  I am aware of the general structure of what would 
result from this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The boards are designed to have an adjudication process that 
would serve itself well without too much interference, but there 
is an overriding obligation because it is government legislation. 
It would not be guided on every detail of what it does.  There is 
a process for them to be the masters of their own destinies, as 
we would have in the House standing committees but on a higher 
level.  It requires legislation to enact those boards.  They have 
the power to guide themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not totally familiar with the reporting system but I know 
they have a great deal of autonomy.  They must be arm's length 
and I believe the bill speaks to that quite clearly.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
sat here too and listened to the member opposite speak with 
regard to this bill.  Bill C-6 was originally introduced in this 
House on December 12 as Bill C-80. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to get back to the speech of the member opposite if 
I may for a moment. She mentioned quite proudly the diamond mines 
in the north, and justifiably so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember not that long ago standing in this House raising some 
concerns about the length of time it was taking to come on stream 
through the red tape and bureaucracy that we tend to create in 
this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has taken years of frustration for the owners and the 
participants in the BHP diamond mine to get up and on stream 
while the competition in other countries went ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want this House to be well aware of the legislation that we 
create in this House, how it can hamper the development and the 
process in these areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Make no mistake about it, the legislation that we developed here 
hampered the diamond fields of the north.  It never helped them, 
not one bit.  I want to make sure this House is fully aware of 
that.  I want to make sure the member opposite is also aware of 
that and takes that into consideration as we debate this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many concerns with regard to this bill in the north. 
Some I have heard from the opposite side, and some from this side 
too have tried to address this.  The main concern here is that 
when we pass legislation, it is far easier to pass it than to 
repeal it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we go through Bill C-6 and talk to all the players involved, 
not just one or two, we find there is an abundance of concern 
with regard to where this bill is going and what we are 
attempting to create here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have no problem with setting up some of these boards to help 
the people in the different areas but we do have concerns when we 
hear from people in these outlying areas saying about the lack of 
consultation with regard to this, the complexity of the laws, the 
complexity of the language used in order to create these laws not 
fully understood by the participants involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That has to become a concern of every politician in this House 
when we allow this to take place.  We all know legal language is 
probably the hardest language to understand next to a politician. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to be very aware of what we are doing when we create 
laws formed basically by lawyers here in the House so that when 
we go out to the people to try to put through legislation they 
fully understand the legislation being put in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From some of the letters we have we know this is not what 
happened here.  We know that the concern is there due to this 
legal language.  We also know there is concern. I heard today 
that there was concern that this was legislation by exhaustion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about over 30 drafts of this legislation going 
forward to these people and basically being online until this got 
through some of these areas.  I have concern about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also have concern when we talk about areas such as this 
regarding cost.  We know these people cannot afford to come to 
Ottawa to address these concerns.  We also know there are some 
areas they cannot get to, say Yellowknife. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is wrong with our sending people out there to talk to them? 
I have done it. 
I am sure other members of the House have done it too.

</I></B></P><P align=left>These people deserve to be heard.  We are enacting legislation 
in the House pertaining to the way they live, make their living 
and in many cases raise their families.  We in the House have to 
be very aware of that.  We have to make sure there is absolute 
clarity when we make such legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Sahtu and Dene Band information session in September raised 
many question.  Far too many of them were answered with 
uncertainty.  It scares me when I hear that their questions were 
answered with uncertainty.  Why?  Often the response to such 
matters was that it would have to be settled in court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am just an ordinary person from a place called Vernon, British 
Columbia, just outside Armstrong.  When I read people are afraid 
we are creating policy that will wind up in court, I have grave 
concerns about where we are going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we sitting here as a government, as opposition members and 
as other members of the House to create legislation to further 
lawyers?  Or, are we supposed to be here to further the benefit 
of the people so they do not have to worry about legislation that 
introduces the idea it may have to be settled in court.  I 
question that and I worry about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also question of the extra time limits that will be 
imposed and the extra level of bureaucracy and the red tape that 
will be created, especially in the further exploration and 
development in mining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know what happens in the mining industry. We all have 
grave concerns about what will happen if the industry ever 
decided one day that perhaps Canada was not the place to do 
business in.  We have to address some of these concerns.  We hear 
from exploration companies that unnecessary red tape is already 
creating this distinct possibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sat and still sit on the natural resources committee.  I can 
remember agreeing with all parties in the House in the last 
session to preparing a draft policy entitled “Keep Mining off 
the Rocks in Canada”.  We worked very hard on it.  Yet not one 
decision of that committee has come to the floor of the House. It 
sits on some shelf gathering dust.  Maybe that is a make work 
project for government, keeping people busy dusting off policies 
that would benefit the Canadian populace as a whole.  We supply 
people to dust them off every now and then so that maybe they can 
refer to them but never in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It makes me wonder about the legitimacy of much of the committee 
work, as I am sure many members of the House wonder.  We put in 
many hours trying to clarify legislation, only for it to be taken 
from our hands and drafted into language that very few of us 
really understand.  The lack of clarity has to be the first 
concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have to be concerned about what we are creating in the 
process with regard to the legality problems that could be 
created and fostered.  We have to consider seriously a system 
that could be under-resourced.  I have not heard much about this 
concern, but we have to consider it, especially its technical 
capacity. We have to be aware that it might put us at a 
disadvantage in dealing with the large workload the bill will 
create by agreements and changes in leasing permits. 
We have to be concerned about many of these areas.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When the legislation goes to committee I would like to see the 
amendments seriously debated and considered instead of just 
washed over.  If we were to address some of the amendments that 
come forward with regard to the bill it would take away a lot of 
the worry for the people living up there, both native and 
non-native.  It would definitely take away some of the worry for 
mining exploration companies, the biggest employer in the area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has to happen in legislation if we are to go forward with 
good pieces of legislation that benefit everybody.  These are 
legitimate concerns.  I hope members of the House understand 
them, look at them and are willing to address them through 
committee work.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I thank my colleague for his remarks and his concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In December 1993, DIAND published an information package on the 
Mackenzie Valley resources management bill.  The package was 
announced in the northern media in January 1994 and distributed 
to all first nations in the Mackenzie Valley, other pertinent 
aboriginal and non-aboriginal groups, communities, industries, 
federal and territorial government departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In June 1994, DIAND officials met in Calgary with the Canadian 
Association of Petroleum Producers, CAPP, and with the Canadian 
Energy Pipeline Association, CEPA; in May 1995 in Calgary again 
with CAPP and CEPA; in June 1995 in Vancouver with the Canadian 
Mining Association and Northwest Territories Chamber of Mines; in 
August 1996 again with CAPP and CEPA; in April and September 1997 
with the Northwest Territories Chamber of Mines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member feel the government has an obligation to the 
Gwich'in and Sahtu regarding their land claims? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, yes, it does have an 
obligation.  It also has an obligation to everybody and to listen 
to everybody.  That is what the House is supposed to be for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member reads through his notes he will quickly realize 
that the DIAND information session in September 1997 raised many 
questions that were left unanswered.  The ones that were answered 
were answered with uncertainty, often with the wording that such 
matters would be settled in court.  If legal recourse is the only 
way to settle matters, it is time to amend the legislation.  The 
hon. member should be aware of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to look at all of it before we go ahead and just pass 
legislation.  Just because part of it is right does not make the 
whole right.  Why would we pass something that is 50% good and 
50% bad?  Why would we pass anything that has anything bad in it? 
It should be 100% good if at all possible.  That is good 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Good legislation is not having to go back 10 years from now and 
having to amend something that we put into place in the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was 
rather interested in my colleague's comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member referred a bit to the previous speaker, the hon. 
secretary of state of the Liberal Party.  Implicit in her remarks 
was efficiency.  I remember my colleague stating rather correctly 
that there was an impediment to the establishment of exploration 
companies and so on.  Implicit in the other comments was that 
this would expedite, make better and make more efficient the 
decision making process.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member comment briefly on exactly how the creation of 
four to seven boards—and it is not quite clear how many there 
will be—would actually expedite and make more efficient the 
decision making process and thereby make it a more profitable 
venture? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, at least three new 
boards will be created.  There is absolutely no way that will 
speed anything up.  We all know what happens when we get tied 
down in bureaucratic red tape. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sat on the natural resources committee.  We looked for a one 
window shop.  Now we have created more than that.  We have 
created more legislation, more red tape, and more headaches for 
exploration and development in that area in particular and in 
land management.  More bureaucracy is exactly what we are 
creating.  Instead of trying to make something smaller and more 
simple we are now expanding to make it more complex and more 
frustrating for everybody trying to do business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Will it cost more tax dollars? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson:</B>  It will definitely cost more tax 
dollars.  There is absolutely no doubt about that.  It will cost 
a fair amount in more tax dollars for more uncertainty.  That is 
exactly what we are doing. 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very 
interested in the recent exchange between my colleagues from 
Kelowna and Okanagan—Shuswap.  I have a couple of questions for 
the hon. member for Okanagan—Shuswap. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a bit confused.  If we have worked on these problems for so 
long we do not want to pass something that is not right.  We want 
something that is simple and that natural resources will 
understand.  We want a lot of things out of the legislation we 
will obviously not get.  We need something that can be worked 
with, something that is balanced and something that is fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think my hon. colleague can have it both ways.  There 
is no way he will be right 100% of the time.  We all know that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member to explain the term under-resourced, another 
word that puzzles me.  He used that term in his speech.  He said 
something about conditions in the north or development being 
under-resourced.  Could I have an explanation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will answer the last 
question first.  When we put these boards into place we had to be 
very aware that it would cost taxpayers a lot more money.  It is 
under-resourced to handle this issue at this point in time. There 
is absolutely no doubt about that.  Taxpayers will have to pick 
up that cost and we have to remember that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for being right 100% of the time, no.  I do not think anybody 
in the House has ever been right 100% of the time, at least no 
member who is still living.  I am not sure about those who have 
passed away.  I have read many times in their speeches that they 
absolutely thought they were right 100% of the time, and the rest 
of us have had to suffer for their decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One reason I am here is to make sure those who think they are 
right 100% of the time take a second look and maybe even a third 
look, a sober sincere look. 
<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
address the House on Bill C-6, the Mackenzie Valley resource 
management act.  I am pleased to join my hon. colleagues, the 
secretary of state and the parliamentary secretary, in speaking 
in support of the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will explain the roles and responsibilities of the new boards 
the bill establishes and how they will bring decision making to 
the residents of the Mackenzie Valley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-6 will establish a total of six new boards, two of which 
will have jurisdiction throughout the Mackenzie Valley.  The 
other four boards will be regional institutions, two in the 
Gwich'in settlement area and two in the Sahtu settlement area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Bill C-6 each of the Gwich'in and Sahtu settlement areas 
will have a regional land use planning board composed of two 
nominees from the aboriginal beneficiary group, two from 
government and a chairperson.  Support services will be provided 
by a small technical and administrative staff. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1345"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This board will be responsible for land use planning for all 
lands and waters within the settlement area, except for lands in 
national parks or within the boundaries of a local government. As 
the parliamentary secretary has stated, the purpose of this 
planning will be to protect and promote the social, cultural and 
economic well-being of the residents of the settlement area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aboriginal organizations, governments and the general public in 
each settlement area will have an opportunity to comment on draft 
land use plans or any proposed changes to the plan.  The plan 
must be approved by the affected aboriginal group and the federal 
and territorial governments.  It will be reviewed every five 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The land and water authorities in the settlement area will 
conduct their operations according to the approved plan.  Each 
board will monitor the implementation of its land use plan and 
will determine whether development proposals conform with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From time to time these regional land use planning boards may 
participate in co-operative planning exercises with similar 
institutions in adjacent areas.  Of course, it is hoped that 
eventually the Dogrib, the Deh Cho and the other Treaty 8 areas 
of the Mackenzie Valley will become part of this overall picture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A regional land and water board will also operate in each of the 
settlement areas.  These boards will consist of five members: 
two from government, two from the aboriginal beneficiary group 
and a chairperson. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The regional land and water boards will issue, amend or renew 
land use permits and water licences for all lands and waters in 
the settlement area, except where these powers are already 
exercised by a local government. Support will be provided by a 
small technical and administrative staff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These boards will not issue licences or permits for projects 
that are not compatible with the land use plan for the settlement 
area.  As well, proposals must have been subjected to an 
environmental impact assessment before a licence or permit will 
be issued. This permitting and licensing process takes into 
account certain protection and guarantees for waters that lie on 
or flow through settlement areas granted by the Gwich'in, Sahtu 
Dene and Metis land claim agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-6 also includes provisions for inspections, for fines and 
for prison terms for persons who contravene any regulations made 
under this legislation or who fail to comply with the terms of a 
permit. The board may also order that compensation be provided to 
a First Nation with a claim agreement for any substantial change 
in the quality, quantity or rate of flow of waters through or 
adjacent to the settlement lands of the First Nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill obviously takes an ecosystem approach to this problem, 
similar to that which we have in conservation areas of other 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In looking beyond the settlement areas, of which there are five, 
these regional land claim agreements foresaw the need for a 
co-ordinated system of resource regulation throughout the 
Mackenzie Valley.  Toward this end, Bill C-6 will authorize the 
governor in council to establish the Mackenzie Valley land and 
water board to promote co-ordination and consistency in the 
regional permitting and licensing process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This valley-wide board will deal with issues or projects whose 
impacts may cross settlement areas or will be outside settlement 
areas.  Special panels may be established for this purpose. The 
land and water board of each settlement area will become a 
permanent panel of the larger valley-wide board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sixth board which will be established under Bill C-6, the 
environmental impact review board, will also exercise 
jurisdiction over the entire valley.  This board will be located 
in Yellowknife and will have up to 11 members, including a 
chairperson. 
It will have equal nominees from government and aboriginal 
groups, including at least one member from each of the Gwich'in 
and Sahtu organizations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The environmental impact review board will assess and, where 
necessary, publicly review all development proposals in the 
Mackenzie Valley.  Based on these assessments and reviews, the 
board will recommend rejection or approval of projects to the 
minister.  Its members will be supported by a small environmental 
and administrative staff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objective of the board is clear: to ensure that the 
environmental impacts of development proposals in the valley 
receive careful consideration before actions are taken.  The 
board will also ensure that these development proposals do not 
cause significant adverse affects outside the valley.  It will 
ensure aboriginal organizations, government and the public have 
the opportunity to express their concerns during the assessment 
and review process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-6 stipulates that preliminary screening, assessments and 
reviews of development proposals are to be carried out in a 
timely and expeditious manner.  As an initial step, all proposals 
will be screened to determined whether an assessment is required. 
The assessment will determine whether a full scale review is 
required. It should be noted that the minister may order that a 
review be undertaken even if the board decides it is not 
necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a review is undertaken, the review panel must have at least 
three members.  Aboriginal people will have guaranteed 
representation on the review board when the proposal is within a 
claim settlement area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once an environment review has been completed under Bill C-6, 
the minister has a number of options.  The minister may accept 
the recommendations of the review panel; refer the 
recommendations back to the panel for further consideration; 
accept the recommendations, with modifications, or reject them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's decision on how to proceed with the board's 
recommendations may be augmented by information that was not 
before the review panel or on matters of public interest not 
considered by the review board.  Once a decision has been made, 
it will be implemented by the appropriate regulatory authorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These boards establish a comprehensive system of checks and 
balances for resource management in the Mackenzie Valley area. 
They do this while meeting the spirit of the recommendations on 
co-management put forward by the Royal Commission on Aboriginal 
Peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having mentioned that document, I want to review with all 
members the four principle bases on which the commission says we 
must deal in the future with aboriginal people.  Those principles 
are recognition, respect, sharing and responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In pursuing Bill C-6 we will find that the original inhabitants 
of this part of Canada and the north have been recognized and 
have been dealt with as partners.  They have been dealt with with 
respect by their required appointment to these various boards and 
by the rights they have negotiated under land claim agreements. 
They are sharing with us in the co-management of development and 
resources.  We are saying to them “You have major 
responsibilities in this area to protect not only your settlement 
area but the whole of the Mackenzie Valley resource, be it 
natural or human or aesthetic”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have letters from the Premier of the Government of the North 
West Territories, Don Morin, approving and supporting Bill C-6. 
I have letters from the Gwich'in Tribal Council and its 
president, Willard Hagen, a letter from the Sahtu Secretariat 
Incorporated from the president, Larry Tourangeau, a letter from 
the president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers 
and a letter from the Canadian Energy Pipeline Association all 
approving Bill C-6.

Bill C-6 is partially in response to those who wanted resources 
management in the north to be accessible to northerners.  This is 
a more open, visible and locally responsible form of managing 
resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having original panels of a board with meetings and hearings 
held in regions is expected to be more cost effective than 
holding meetings in Yellowknife.  In this integrated system, the 
developer will apply for land and water authorization in only one 
place.  If the development is wholly within a settlement area, 
the developer will obtain the authorization from the original 
panel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is the following.  Does the member feel that the 
creation of a regional land and water panel and a valley-wide 
board is a duplication or an increase in bureaucracy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Finlay:</B>   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question 
from the parliamentary secretary, although I only heard about 
one-third of it. I think he said something about the number of 
panels.  I explained that there were six.  Of course, when we get 
the other settlement areas there will have to be another two 
panels for each one.  I do not know how we can get away from 
panels if we are going to share responsibility and get input from 
the people who care about the place they live, about its future 
and its development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if I have answered the parliamentary secretary's 
question, but that is my point of view.

negotiations and consultations among the interested parties shut 
out Parliament from the decision making process.

for the development of the legislation; the role of the 
bureaucracy, the acceptance of public input and the balance 
obtained among divergent sides, etc.  This is an opportunity to 
decide if committees should be given more resources, more freedom 
to travel, to get in touch with the people of Canada and enhance 
the credibility of this House with the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a fundamental value behind the implementation of 
this legislation.  One of the major issues during the free trade 
agreement was the future of the water resources of this country. 
Canadians were extremely concerned that the policy implemented by 
the federal government was detrimental to the capacity of 
Canadians to manage one of the most abundant resources in this 
country, water.  For Canadians engaged in the free trade 
agreement debate, Canadian water was not a commodity to be traded 
in a commercial market or just a resource to be exploited.  In 
this bill we are doing justice not only to the aboriginal people 
but to those Canadians who fought for the prohibition of bulk 
export of Canadian water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation clearly recognized that for aboriginal people 
as well as for many other non-aboriginal Canadians land and 
water are not just economic commodities.  This kind of 
co-management system makes it more likely that water will not be 
traded as a good.  This bill also is a formal recognition by the 
Government of Canada that land and water are an inextricable part 
of aboriginal identity, deeply rooted in moral and spiritual 
values.  In doing justice to aboriginal people, Parliament is 
indirectly recognizing those who took a similar approach to the 
water issue during the critical debate on the Canada-U.S. Free 
Trade Agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Different societies do have different views on property or 
resource rights.  The views of the federal government and some 
provincial governments are of open access or indiscriminate 
exploitation of natural resources that can be bought and sold in 
a commercial market.  Aboriginal people view land and other 
resources as their common property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Different values and visions create different management styles 
that could led to conflict and confrontation.  Bill C-6 creates 
conditions to eliminate or minimize cultural clashes and promote 
or return to aboriginal people their rights to take part in the 
governance and management of land and resources.  It is clear 
that we are addressing a fundamental concern of aboriginal 
people, their role in the management over land and water as well 
as other resources critical to their goal of self-sufficiency and 
self-reliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The co-management approach will allow an optimal balance between 
the values and beliefs of aboriginal people with the values 
and beliefs of other segments of the Canadian population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very pleased with the message being sent to the 
aboriginal communities of Canada through the implementation of 
this bill.  The co-management created for the land and water 
resources in the Mackenzie Valley is a positive model for all of 
us.  It indicates that co-operation and honest, transparent 
dialogue create condition for substantive changes in the 
relationships between first nations and the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More experiments in regional public government, shared 
jurisdiction and shared management of resources may be coming and 
we look forward to them.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, we support the speedy passage of this legislation 
and we call on the Government of Canada to proceed as soon as 
possible with its response to the recommendations of the Royal 
Commission on Aboriginal Peoples and to include the Parliament of 
Canada in the overall process of policy decision making and 
evaluation in this new relationship with the aboriginal people of 
Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak today on Bill B-6. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was introduced first on September 26, 1997 and is the 
reincarnation of Bill C-80 from the last Parliament which was 
tabled in the House on December 12, 1996.  Its intent is to 
establish management boards to co-ordinate environmental 
assessment and land and water regulations in the Mackenzie Valley 
of the Northwest Territories.  It fulfils the requirements of the 
Gwich'in and Sahtu land claims agreement of the 34th Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-6 requires that 50% of the new board members be nominated 
from first nations and 50% from people from the Government of 
Canada and the Northwest Territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot commend enough the action involving both aboriginal 
and non-aboriginal people working together toward a common goal, 
making a concerted effort to try to develop an intelligent way of 
managing the resources of the Northwest Territories, taking into 
consideration water and other environmental aspects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The goal was supposed to be to build a single environmental 
impact assessment process that streamlines the process for 
obtaining water licences and land use permits.  We in the Reform 
Party would have absolutely no disagreement with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as often happens in this House, reality and fact do not 
bear up with what is happening in these bills, for the stated 
intent and the actual intent are two very different things 
indeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we analyse this bill carefully, and I commend my colleagues 
from the Reform Party who have done a tremendous job on this, we 
see a very different situation brewing.  Rather than having a 
single co-ordinated effective and responsible board, we see a 
situation mired in uncertainty, a situation where not one board 
is developing but three boards, a situation where there is not a 
lot of agreement but a lot of disagreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We oppose Bill C-6 because it is not doing what it is supposed 
to do.  It is simply not going to develop this concerted 
co-ordinated effort.  There are many people in the Northwest 
Territories who are saying much the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chamber of mines in the Northwest Territories said the 
confusions, delays and cost of this new system have ground 
mineral exploration to a painful halt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the intent is to develop the resources of the Northwest 
Territories in a way that is going to be beneficial to aboriginal 
and non-aboriginal people, this bill is failing miserably.  By 
this process grinding to a halt, it is compromising aboriginal 
and non-aboriginal communities that desperately need the work in 
the Northwest Territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the unemployment rate there and in aboriginal 
communities across this country it is absolutely horrendous.  It 
is disgusting.  The responsibility for this falls directly at the 
feet of this and every government we have had in the last 20 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time and time again, from the Royal Commission on Aboriginal 
Peoples to auditor general reports to committee reports in this 
House, new ways to develop employment among aboriginal 
communities have been repeatedly sought. 
We had a golden opportunity with Bill C-6 to develop the 
incredible resources of the Northwest Territories in a sensitive 
and environmentally friendly manner.  However that is simply not 
occurring.

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By holding up this process with what the government has created 
it is grinding development and therefore employment to a slow and 
painful halt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The system was far better defined and unified in other 
agreements.  The lack of clarity in the process for selecting 
members of the board was also called into question as there is 
very little transparency in the system.  As I mentioned before, 
rather than creating one board the government in its wisdom chose 
to create three boards.  Why?  No one knows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conversations with other industry representatives consulted by 
the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development during 
the development of the predecessor to Bill C-6 confirms the 
understanding that a single review process which avoids 
duplication of time and effort is the most important issue.  We 
in the Reform Party would gladly support Bill C-6 if that 
objective were to be fulfilled.  In fact it is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Northwest Territory Chamber of Mines has called for 
substantial amendments in two areas of the bill which we in this 
party support.  A lack of clarity in the law and in the rules is 
likely to produce very uneven regulations across the region and 
from one applicant to the next, resulting in highly indigenous 
processes that will prevent development and in so doing prevent 
employment from occurring in the north.  This situation is not 
only occurring in the Northwest Territories. This situation is 
occurring across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province of British Columbia through the current land claims 
process will be balkanized.  It will be carved into a number of 
little fiefdoms, each of which will have its own rules and own 
regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us imagine trying to do business in a situation like that. 
The situation that is carving out parts of my province will not 
only hurt non-aboriginal people.  It will hurt aboriginal people 
more than anything.  People simply cannot engage in business if 
they have to bypass rules and regulations throughout the province 
in many different areas.  Development becomes almost impossible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is occurring all over the place.  I wish the government 
would take the initiative to work with aboriginal people and with 
the non-aboriginal community to form together co-operatives and 
groups in which development could occur wherein both communities 
are taken into consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One big fear in the process—and Bill C-6 is an example of 
it—is that the government is creating these little enclaves with 
different rules and regulations.  It simply does not understand 
that in creating an absolute Pandora's box of rules and 
regulations it becomes virtually impossible for the left hand to 
know what the right hand is doing and for any co-ordinated 
development to occur.  It becomes impossible for the private 
sector to develop these areas and in so doing the creation of 
jobs is prevented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Northwest Territories Chamber of Commerce made another 
important point with respect to Bill C-6.  It said the new system 
was seriously under-resourced, especially in its technical 
capacity, and would be at a disadvantage in dealing with the 
large workload created by transitional arrangements and changes 
to leasing and permits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand how the government through the bill could 
actually create three underfunded and underequipped boards to 
take on the extremely important task of developing the resources 
of the Northwest Territories in an environmentally sound manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the situation we have to oppose Bill C-6 because it does 
not devolve jurisdiction of resource management to local 
territorial activities in an intelligent fashion.  It makes no 
provision for the extra resources required to maintain the 
technical expertise to supplement the three boards being created.

<A HREF="#LINKT63"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to make another point that is very important with 
respect to the situation and the way in which this government and 
previous governments have dealt with aboriginal people and 
employment.  One goal of Bill C-6 is clearly to improve 
employment among aboriginal and non-aboriginal people in the 
Northwest Territories.  This is very important and we in the 
Reform Party are fighting hard to ensure it occurs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However that simply is not occurring.  I will give one important 
example which gives an enormous insight into the utter, dismal 
and abysmal failure of the government in trying to create jobs 
among aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government invested $1 billion in an economic development 
scheme for aboriginal people that came out of the department of 
Indian affairs.  This is something we could approve of if it 
would make a difference.  The proof in the pudding or the Litmus 
test lies in what happened to unemployment levels among 
aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened?  Did the levels go down?  No.  Did they stay the 
same?  No.  They went up.  The unemployment rate went up with an 
investment of over $1 billion in the economic development of 
aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the social outcome and social costs of the horrendous 
situation?  On some reserves unemployment reaches over 50%. 
Under these circumstances I should refer to the legacy of this 
and previous governments to aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation is that the infant mortality rate is almost two 
times that of the rest of the population.  The tuberculosis rate 
is almost eight times that of the rest of the population.  Sexual 
abuse admitted by the aboriginal people themselves is at an 
epidemic proportion on some reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After working in aboriginal communities as a physician I can say 
the situation is not getting better in many of them.  It is 
getting worse.  The cold hard reality on the floor, in the 
trenches, on the reserves is that people are suffering.  There is 
blood on the hands of this government and previous governments. 
There is blood on their hands.  The government is continuing to 
deal with the aboriginal people in exactly the same way as it has 
done before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only way that anything will change—and Bill C-6 had an 
opportunity to do that—is by putting responsibility and 
accountability into the hands of the aboriginal people.  We must 
ensure we end separateness, the segregation that has occurred for 
decades.  We should start to treat aboriginals as equals and 
march together to build a better and stronger country for both 
aboriginal and non-aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This can only happen where real jobs are created.  This can only 
happen where an investment is made in aboriginal people to help 
them help themselves.  This can only happen when the ties that 
bind the institutionalized welfare state end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless we end the institutionalized welfare state, nothing will 
change on the streets.  Aboriginal people are suffering on the 
streets of east Vancouver and downtown Toronto.  Nothing will 
change on aboriginal reserves from Newfoundland to British 
Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to look at the issue in a new way.  We must stop looking 
at the situation among aboriginal people that governments have 
created, that of a sacred cow which cannot be changed.  We must 
look forward to working together with aboriginal people to 
empower them and help them to take care of and be responsible for 
their own lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are different but the differences between us can be used to 
build bridges between us, to build harmony and to create 
co-operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government and previous governments have used the 
differences as a lever, as a tool or as a wedge to create 
separate developments.  The social costs are being borne by the 
people.  We must stop separate development. 
We must work together for a united development and to build a 
stronger Canada for all people.  Not only is it possible.  It is 
a necessity.  Not only is it imperative.  It behoves us to take 
the initiative to work with people.

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One great failing and sadness in working with aboriginal people 
in detox units, in emergency departments, on aboriginal reserves 
and in jails is the utter, abysmal failure of policies directed 
toward these people.  It must not happen any more.  We have to 
stop thinking that it is them and us.  We have to think that we 
are all human beings.  We must use our differences.  There is 
much we can learn from each other.  There is much beauty in the 
aboriginal cultures of our country that we can use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was utterly fascinated by the explanation of a wife of an 
aboriginal chief in my riding about their incredible abilities to 
use herbs to treat many medical illnesses.  This is virtually 
unknown in the medical community.  We know it is out there but 
how people actually do it is something we can benefit from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, aboriginal infant mortality rates are higher than 
that of any other group in the country.  Their children suffer 
from poverty and malnutrition approaching that which occurs in 
third world countries.  Alcohol and drug abuse are of epidemic 
proportions.  I implore the government to work with the Reform 
Party and aboriginal people to develop sound, constructive 
solutions to provide a better future for everyone.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He was asking why we have three new boards.  The first one is 
the planning board.  It is quite simple.  It is on the Gwich'in 
settlement claim.  It is according to the law.  This is why we 
have planning boards for them. 
It is similar to what we have in our own municipalities.  We need 
to take care with the planning.

<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concerning the rest of the member's comments, I had a problem 
deciding if he was more in favour of industry or the First 
Nations.  My question is what does industry want?  Industry is 
eager to see land claims settled, greater certainty for 
investment and fair and expeditious administration of application 
for land and water use.  This stable regulatory regime with a 
single environmental process and clearly defined regulations and 
environmental assessment standards will provide a positive 
environment for development in the western Northwest Territories. 
We have had many consultations with the Canadian Association of 
Petroleum Producers, the Canadian Energy Pipeline Association and 
the Mining Association of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the member talks about the First Nations I agree with him 
that a lot needs to be done. I have one simple question for my 
colleague from Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca.  If he is concerned about 
First Nations government, why did the Reform Party vote against 
self-government in the Yukon and against the Sahtu land claim? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank my hon. friend 
from the Liberal Party for his question.  He actually asked three 
questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He mentioned the boards.  People who have analysed this, 
including the Northwest Territories mines group and other groups, 
have clearly stated that it is not a problem to have one board. 
It is a problem to have three boards. People who are involved in 
this are asking why are we investing in three boards.  This is 
bureaucracy running wild. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of investing in three boards, we could invest in one and 
use the saved money in more useful ways to improve the 
socioeconomic situation for people in the north.  Perhaps that 
would be a better investment of taxpayers' money.  That is what 
we in the Reform Party would like the government to do.  It has 
an opportunity to do this when amendments are put forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member asked whether I am for industry or for aboriginal 
people.  The reality is that we are for the people of the north 
who are going to use the industry of the north.  We are for both. 
It is by having a co-operative relationship with both that both 
can benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend asked about the situation with the land claims. 
Unfortunately what has been happening with many land claims is 
that the non-aboriginal communities are not being taken into 
consideration during their development.  Negotiations are taking 
place only with aboriginal people often behind closed doors.  We 
would like to develop a land claim situation where both 
aboriginal and non-aboriginal people can come together to discuss 
and debate the situation and form an agreement for the 
utilization of the lands of the north where both communities are 
taken into consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government and the Government of British Columbia in many 
cases have excluded non-aboriginal people.  You cannot get a 
workable agreement where one community is not taken into 
consideration.  You cannot get a workable solution where the 
agreement is often negotiated behind closed doors, where there is 
a lack of transparency and a lack of accountability.  These are 
the problems we have with many of the land claims situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are completely in favour of aboriginal people becoming 
masters of their own destiny, as are all non-aboriginal people in 
this country.  Part of the problem has been that aboriginal 
people have not had this.  They have not been masters of their 
own destiny and have not had the responsibility and the power to 
do just that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aboriginal people deserve to be treated the same way as anybody 
else in this country.  To do anything less is an insult to them 
and everybody else. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay—Okanagan, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I have some questions and I will omit any preamble so 
the hon. member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca will have an 
opportunity to answer.  These are questions many people have on 
their minds when they look at this bill. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1535"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first of these questions is, is there anything about this 
bill which will serve to help keep mining in Canada and more 
importantly to keep mining dollars in Canada?  Second, will it 
cause or create employment for Canadians, Canadians of all racial 
origins?  Third, will it lead to economic self-sufficiency for 
northern residents no matter what their racial origin?  Fourth, 
will it provide environmental protection in an efficient and 
cost-effective manner? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank my hon. friend 
for his extremely succinct and pointed questions.  In essence 
they are the questions that must be asked and answered if this 
bill is going to pass. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first question related to whether this bill keeps mining in 
Canada.  It does not.  The mining groups have clearly stated that 
this bill rather than expediting mining in this country has done 
the exact opposite.  It has ground the whole process of 
development to a sickening halt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other question asked ties into that and was on environmental 
protection.  The resources in this bill are simply not there to 
provide for the adequate analysis of environmental protection for 
the Northwest Territories.  Some government members are nodding 
their heads.  What they ought to do is listen to the members from 
the Northwest Territories, the mining groups and the economic 
development groups from the Northwest Territories to understand 
that this bill does not have the resources to do what it must do, 
which is to develop the mining industry in the north in an 
environmentally sound fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend also mentioned employment for aboriginal and 
non-aboriginal peoples.  As I said before, rather than creating 
employment, this bill has forced development to grind to a halt. 
In grinding development to a halt, it has ground the creation of 
jobs to a halt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does it lead to economic self-sufficiency?  One hopes that it 
would.  It has the potential to do that.  I hope the government 
will take into consideration the intelligent suggestions that 
have been put forth by my colleagues in the Reform Party which 
will help to mould this bill into a situation that benefits both 
aboriginals and non-aboriginals, the people, the industry and the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I was 
particularly intrigued by the comments of my colleague when he 
said that a billion dollars has been placed in a fund for 
economic development for aboriginals.  It is inconceivable to me 
that that amount of money would not in fact have improved the lot 
of our native brothers and sisters. I would like to ask him what 
happened.  Where did the money go?  Could he explain so that the 
Canadian public would know not to go down the same road again? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague 
from Macleod for a question that has to be answered in this 
House.  The best person to answer it is the minister of Indian 
affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do know that the billion dollars did nothing to increase 
employment among aboriginal people.  Rather than doing that, we 
know that the unemployment rate is increasing. What is 
interesting is that not only is it increasing but it is 
increasing at a rate higher than the rate of population growth of 
the aboriginal people.  That is absolutely worse than we could 
possibly imagine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not know where this money has gone but empirical evidence 
suggests that these moneys were misappropriated and did not go 
directly to the people in need.  It belies one of the biggest 
problems in speaking to aboriginal people on and off reserve. 
Much of the money could go to them to do good things in terms of 
skills training, social programs and health care issues that need 
to be addressed.  Instead of this money going directly to the 
people who need it, this money is being absolutely swallowed up 
by a bureaucracy that has run wild.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise today in this historic place to speak on Bill 
C-6, an act to provide for an integrated system of land and water 
management in the Mackenzie Valley, to establish certain boards 
for that purpose and to make consequential amendments to other 
acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As this is my maiden speech in the House, I would like to take a 
moment to express my gratitude to the voters of Calgary East. 
They are the reason I am here today and I assure them I will be 
their voice in this House over the next four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to thank the volunteers who so tirelessly 
worked on my campaign.  Most important, I want to express my 
thanks to my family.  My wife Neena, my daughters Priti and 
Kaajal, and my son Aman have stood by my side over the last few 
months and I realize the next four years will be trying ones but 
I want to express just how much they mean to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak to several of the concerns that I and my 
party have with this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform's main opposition to this bill evolves around the 
creation of yet another level of bureaucracy.  In addition there 
are specific industry concerns that need to be addressed before 
this legislation comes into being.  It would be much easier to 
iron out any wrinkles in the agreement prior to its taking effect 
than to introduce an amendment to legislation at a later date 
which only adds to the bureaucratic jungle and the backlog of 
legislation we currently face.  Our time and energy as 
parliamentarians could be better spent elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that said, I do realize the validity of the goals of this 
legislation and in particular the need to implement past 
agreements made by the Government of Canada.  It is also 
important to take steps to better manage and protect our lands 
for our children and our grandchildren. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are dealing today with an agreement made by the Mulroney 
government.  In 1994 under Bill C-16 a land claims agreement was 
made between the federal government, two First Nations bands and 
the Metis calling for an integrated system of land and water 
management to apply to the Mackenzie Valley through the creation 
of certain boards. The Reform Party opposed Bill C-16 due to its 
creation of an additional and unneeded level of bureaucracy and 
opposes Bill C-6 that we are debating today for the same reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 10 minutes I do not have the time to go into great detail on 
all the concerns.  However, I would like to spend a moment or two 
on an issue that is of great concern to me, the establishment and 
management of the various boards that act as watchdogs over the 
use and development of the Mackenzie Valley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These various boards will be partly comprised of individuals 
nominated by the First Nations involved and partly from the 
nominations of the territorial and federal governments.  I have 
no real concerns over the appointment of individuals nominated 
from the territorial and First Nations groups involved.  However, 
with this Liberal government's previous history of nominating its 
political pals from days gone by, I am concerned that this will 
be yet another political patronage ploy for the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One only needs to look at the government's appointments to the 
Senate since it was elected to power in 1993 to see that it would 
much rather appoint its political pals than the best suited 
individuals for the jobs.  With its record I am left to wonder 
how the government will decide to choose who will sit on the 
various boards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular I am concerned as to the technical expertise these 
individuals will bring to their positions on the board.  As it 
deals with a very sensitive environmental area, I would ask the 
government to put aside its own political agenda, that is making 
sure all of their political pals are not put in place, and ensure 
that board members are put in place because they are the best 
individuals for the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other involved parties have specific concerns with this 
legislation as it currently stands. 
The Northwest Territories Chamber of Mines, which speaks for some 
600 groups and individuals, has serious concerns after the 
briefing it was provided by the Department of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development at the end of September.  Specifically the 
Northwest Territories Chamber of Mines has four main concerns.

<A HREF="#LINKT68"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only does the bill provide new obstacles for resource 
development, it also raises several concerns about the 
possibility of litigation in the future.  It also leaves the 
various parties open to the use of deliberate delaying tactics in 
the periodic environmental reviews that must occur under this 
bill. I have already expressed my concern over the election 
process of board members which the chamber also raises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In each of its concerns there are several compounded and complex 
issues within each area of concern.  I would like to take a 
moment or two to outline some of the complexities of these issues 
and hopefully someone from the government side will help to 
clarify any confusion that exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the obstacles for resource development, there is 
growing concern over the rights to compensation, the powers 
granted to the boards regarding permits and leases, and an 
enforcement policy which can best be described as confused. I 
believe that for effective management of the land and water 
resources in the Mackenzie Valley area there needs to be more 
specific policies set in place before this bill is passed into 
law. We need to be proactive in setting out specific guidelines, 
especially in the areas of jurisdiction of the boards.  We cannot 
be making up the rules as we go along. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, several questions remain unanswered concerning the 
unresolved issues not addressed in this bill. The participants of 
the briefing session that DIAND held in Yellowknife at the end of 
September left with the understanding that such unanswered 
questions would only be resolved by the courts. Our current court 
system is weighed down enough with litigation. It would take 
years before litigation arising from the flaws in this bill could 
be resolved.  This should not and cannot happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With environmental concerns playing a fundamental role in how we 
approach matters regarding land and water management, the concern 
over various delaying tactics that groups can impose in ensuring 
that the periodic environmental reviews and assessments that must 
occur through the bill is real and must be dealt with.  Although 
the government officials feel that these concerns are improbable, 
past experience suggests that these concerns are indeed 
justified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I conclude, I would like to reiterate our concerns with 
the bill and why our party will be opposing it at second reading. 
There are too many unanswered questions as to how the land and 
water management will be structured.  In my opinion the 
government is simply reacting to the commitments made by the past 
government without thinking about the environmental consequences 
of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree that the government should hold to its responsibilities 
even if they were made by previous governments. However, the 
question remains, at what cost?  We should look more closely at 
what the consequences of this bill are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second reading deals with the principle of the bill. Without 
some major amendments at committee and at the report stage we 
feel that this bill will do more damage than it will do good.  It 
will only cause a more confused bureaucracy with unclear 
regulations, regulated by a board or a series of boards that are 
appointed by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our environment should be first and foremost in our minds as we 
study this bill in more detail. 
I therefore urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this bill 
as it is.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I have a few comments for my colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party complains about having three boards. 
Effectively there are three boards but I would just like to 
mention that these boards are co-ordinated.  I would like to 
explain the activities of the boards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although each board functions independently, the legislation 
provides for inter-related activities in relation to the 
planning, environmental assessment and regulations of 
developments on land or water in the Mackenzie Valley.  Upon its 
receipt of a proposal, the regulatory authority assesses whether 
or not it is in conformity with the land use plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The land use planning board is involved only on referral or 
application when there is a dispute.  A preliminary screening of 
the environmental impact of the proposed development is conducted 
by the regulatory authorities and government departments and 
agencies.  This preliminary screening expedites the process 
whereby developments with little impact need not be assessed by 
the environmental impact review board, including those 
developments normally exempt from assessment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a development could have a significant impact or may be cause 
of public concern it must be assessed by the environmental impact 
review board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party also talks about having government's power to 
the people of the First Nations.  He needs to understand that the 
Mackenzie Valley is one of the largest regions in the country. 
When one travels from Yellowknife to Inuvik it is far.  The 
Mackenzie River is the longest river in the country.  It is 
important that we have a water board which understands that when 
the river flows from Yellowknife going to the Arctic that it 
passes through all the regions of the Mackenzie Valley.  Having 
these boards comply with the land claims decisions, we feel that 
the boards should be very close to the community and community 
based. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were only going to have one board it would cost much more 
because travelling from Inuvik to Yellowknife or the opposite 
costs a lot of money for the citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will be my last remark before my question.  The Reform 
Party seems to be think this is a mining bill, not a resource 
management act.  All it talks about is mining. However, it is 
more than a resource management act.  The Reformers are asking 
for just one board, but the reality is that the First Nations, 
the Gwich'in and Sahtu, have requested their own boards.  Does 
this mean that the Reform Party does not take into consideration 
the requests of the First Nations of the Mackenzie Valley to have 
their own planning boards? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  Madam Speaker, let me tell the member 
what our real problem is.  Our real problem is the level of 
bureaucracy the government is creating.  We do not have much of a 
problem regarding the intent of the bill.  We understand the 
intent of the bill but we have a problem in the way the 
government is going about doing it.  It is creating another level 
of bureaucracy.  It is fine to say that it has free votes on 
everything, but why does the federal government have a hand in it 
by appointing certain members to the board? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know from past experience that the government is going to 
appoint to the board some Liberal MP who has been defeated or 
someone who may not have the proper expertise.  Therefore, we 
definitely have a concern about this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member should listen to what the Reform Party has been 
saying.  We have no problem with the intent of the bill.  We have 
a problem with the way the government is going about having the 
bill implemented and in the way it is set up.  That is the 
problem we have with this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I would 
like to comment on the last two speeches made by the hon. member 
for Calgary East and the hon. member for Okanagan—Shuswap. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that what we need to understand is something 
which has not been mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Mackenzie River Valley is one of the greatest river systems 
in the world.  It ranks up there with the Amazon, with the Nile, 
with the Mississippi, with the Yangtze Kiang and with others.  We 
could probably put the whole of the maritime provinces into the 
Mackenzie River Valley and have lots of space left over for some 
of the huge caribou herds that used to roam there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleagues seem to forget that we are not dealing with 
tightly knit southern Canada, a fully developed area; we are 
dealing with thousands of acres, thousands of hectares, and 
disparate people.  Many people still live off the land, they eat 
food produced on that land and their wish is that the rivers 
continue to run cleanly and freshly. Their wish is to maintain 
that land as closely as they can to the way their great spirits 
left it to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I never saw the word mining in the bill when I was studying it. 
It never came up.  If we allow the Chamber of Mines of the GNWT 
to tell us how to do it there may not be a Mackenzie River Valley 
worth talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friends say that there are too many boards.  As the 
parliamentary secretary has already said, the Gwich'in want to 
have a board.  They want to be represented.  They want to have 
control over the large area in which they live.  The Sahtu want 
to have a board.  Depending on what agreements are made with the 
Dene and the Treaty 8 nations and the Deh Cho we might have six 
more boards.  We might have three.  We might have one.  That is 
the way things are done. People's responsibility has to be 
allowed to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask my colleagues whether they have considered that the 
Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples spent $6 million over five 
years, or maybe it was $5 million over six years, to write many 
pages containing over 400 recommendations dealing with our 
fiduciary and our constitutional responsibilities to the 
aboriginal people of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not going to solve the problem if we keep looking at this 
as “this is not quite as efficient as it should be” and “the 
miners have not got full control” and “development will not 
occur because the investors will not put money in unless they can 
control everything” and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time is running out.  We have a report which some of us have 
studied and done some work on.  I said it this morning and I will 
repeat it now.  The report says that the solutions to our 
problems with respect to the aboriginal people becoming a 
functioning part of this country—and they were the original 
inhabitants—are four: recognition, respect, sharing and 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Parliament has the total responsibility of seeing that we 
come to terms with this problem in our Constitution, with these 
people, who are the original inhabitants of this land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard nothing more than fine words.  I have heard no 
practical ways to deal with this matter that are not at least 
suggested in the bill, such as boards that are local. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want my hon. friend to tell me how things like these little 
enclaves or masters of their own destiny or an institutionalized 
welfare state are going to help the situation and how Bill C-6 is 
not going to help the situation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  I thank the member for asking the 
question.  We do not have a problem with the Mackenzie Valley.  I 
think the member is right.  It is nice clean water and all the 
rest.  The First Nations have every right to take full advantage 
of it for their prosperity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a problem with the record of this government, the 
government intervention through this bill, a creation of a level 
that we feel will not utilize fully the Mackenzie Valley. That is 
the problem we have and that is why we are saying let us look at 
it again so that we can clean out the bureaucracy level and make 
sure that the people of the First Nations take full benefit of 
the Mackenzie Valley.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to rise in the House today for my first intervention in 
this Parliament addressing the House on this very important bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to sincerely thank my constituents for once again 
sending me back to this House to represent them. I pledge to do 
my very best for them, to do the job that they expect of me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I begin by reiterating what my colleague from Esquimalt—Juan de 
Fuca so eloquently said a few minutes ago about the need for 
aboriginal and non-aboriginal people to work together in this 
country.  Clearly that should be a very important motivation for 
all of us for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the surface this bill seems to work in that direction.  It 
appears that it is going to get aboriginal and non-aboriginal 
people working together.  The reality is that it will not really 
achieve that because participation on the environmental and 
resource management boards is specifically tied and allotted to 
individuals based on membership in either the Gwich'in or Sahtu 
Dene bands. It is not because they are local to the area.  It is 
not because they have a vested interest in the future of that 
area.  It is because they are members of the Sahtu or the 
Gwich'in bands that they will receive membership on these boards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit that when we single out groups in our society and 
assign them special rights based on distinguishing 
characteristics, we do them a disservice and we denigrate the 
fundamental principles of democracy. I will argue that 
undermining democratic principles is always harmful to society 
and in the instant issue will prove most harmful to those whom we 
most wish to help, aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us examine for a minute a world without democracy to better 
understand how human circumstances fare in such a world.  Let us 
look at the history of this world going back several hundred 
years, going back actually more than a millennium where kings and 
feudal systems and fiefdoms were the order of the day, where 
there was no democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under those systems, who had rights?  We all know how those 
rights were determined.  Kings had all the power.  Kings were not 
elected.  When they came down the birth canal they were already 
elected to be king.  They did not have to run for office.  They 
did not need anybody's consent.  They were going to be king or 
queen, whatever the case might be, because it was their 
birthright. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the kings there were others such as barons, earls and so 
on who had progressively less power but who were still above the 
lowly serfs.  The serfs comprised the great majority of the 
population.  They were people with absolutely no power, with 
absolutely no say.  They were people who were virtually owned by 
the king. They were the property of the king.  The king could do 
whatever he wanted with them.  He did not need to ask permission. 
He was an absolute ruler and they were absolute servants to the 
king. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>History evolved, thankfully for us who live in this day and age, 
with great thinkers like Plato and Aristotle and later Thomas 
Paine and Jean-Jacques Rousseau and others.  They envisioned and 
refined a new social order, a new social contract which had at 
its foundation and core the rejection of elite special status in 
favour of equality of all people under the law.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The emergence of democracy was a very slow and painful process, 
first experienced in rudimentary forums in ancient Greece. Later 
the evolution of our modern democracy had its beginning in 1066 
with the signing of the Magna Carta, a very important document. 
This document was hard won and began the slow process of 
stripping the kings of their immense power and devolving that 
power to the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the following nine centuries after the signing of the 
Magna Carta democracy became much more entrenched in Europe and 
North America. In fact I would argue that North America and later 
Canada and the United States became the apogee of democracy owing 
largely to the fact that the ties to the monarchy were less 
strong in North America than they were in Great Britain.  As a 
matter of fact, the ties to the monarchy were severed completely 
by the United States in their War of Independence. Consequently 
it was very easy for the United States to adopt a truly modern 
democratic system without any ties to the monarchy whatsoever. 
North America, Canada and the United States have since become 
synonymous with democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that the fundamental reason we as Canadians enjoy 
one of the highest living standards in the world is not an 
accident.  It is not as a result of the fact that we live in a 
resource rich country, although it certainly helps.  Look at the 
Soviet Union, a resource rich country.  For the most part the 
people there live in dire circumstances.  It is not an accident. 
Now we see some hopeful signs with the emergence of democracy.

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Madam Speaker, as I was saying, the fact 
that we in North America enjoy one of the highest living 
standards in the world is not an accident.  If we look at the 
resource rich country of the former Soviet Union, we can see very 
quickly that it did not fare nearly as well as we did.  This is 
simply because it had a political system which did not allow 
human beings in that country to achieve their potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That system is democracy.  It is a fundamental cornerstone upon 
which not only our country is based, but on which our economy is 
based. We cannot achieve without the freedom to achieve. We 
cannot achieve without the freedom of contract. We could not have 
achieved what we have in North America without democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us compare that with the situation in the former Soviet 
Union.  The system there said that government and not the people 
was the centre of all power, that the communist party was the 
only political party.  There was no option or choice. If one were 
to belong to a political party it had to be the communist party. 
The communist party determined that it was going to own the means 
of production and dictate how the economy would run and dictate 
how people ran their lives.  It was going to even dictate whether 
or not there would be freedom of religion in the country and it 
determined that there could not be freedom of religion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were so many things about the former Soviet Union that I 
cannot reiterate them all in this short intervention. Suffice it 
to say that human liberty was suppressed to the point where the 
economy could not work.  The economy crumbled in on itself and 
the people of that country during that time suffered a very low 
standard of living which resulted in a virtual collapse in 
1990-91 when the Soviet regime finally ended.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we see the emergence of a democracy, albeit not a total 
democracy at this point, but it sure has come a long way from the 
days when I was a kid and I watched the news at night and saw 
what little there was coming out of the Soviet Union.  Certainly 
there has been a lot of progress made there and we are very 
hopeful that is going to continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a democracy in North America.  As I said earlier it is 
democracy that is responsible for giving us so much in this 
country.  I would argue strenuously that without it we would not 
be where we are today and we could not be where we are today.  If 
we abandon democracy, we do so at our peril because we will start 
slipping backward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the forgotten people in North America who have always been 
precluded from joining our democracy are the aboriginal people of 
this country.  They have been precluded from becoming a part of 
this democracy from the beginning contact and colonization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The system of governance in this country and successive 
governments in this country have ignored, belittled and 
marginalized these people from the beginning of Confederation. 
They have been largely Liberal administrations I might add, 
largely Liberal governments. I would ask any aboriginal people 
watching today to remember that.  Liberal governments for the 
most part have dominated the House of Commons during this 
century.  It is the Liberals who have constructed the welfare 
state and the dependency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Native people in this country did not get the right to vote 
until 1960.  How could we possibly consider that they were part 
of a democracy when for the first almost 100 years of this 
country they did not even have the right to vote let alone run 
for office?  It is a small wonder that the level of anger and 
hostility and hopelessness is so pervasive and so high on 
aboriginal reserves in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a small wonder that these people are bitter and angry and 
confused and are wondering what the future holds for them.  They 
see this Canadian dream being lived all around them and they are 
not participating in it. They do not know why and they are angry 
and they are looking for answers.  They are looking for some 
respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government gives them the kind of respect as to set up 
these phoney baloney management boards and says “Yeah, we are 
going to give you half the seats on the board”.  What kind of 
respect is that to show to a human being? It is like “You could 
not make it on your own, you could not do this unless we created 
this special situation for you so that you would have a chance to 
sit on these boards.  If we do not do this, you cannot do it. You 
are not good enough to do it on your own”. I reject that 100% 
completely and totally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Local control or local input into resource management can be a 
good thing but it should not be based on anything other than the 
fact that there are people who are local to the area and who have 
a vested interest in the decisions that may affect them and may 
affect the land they are living on.  It should not be tied to 
membership in a native band.  It should not be tied to membership 
in anything other than the community of interest that surrounds 
the area that could be affected by decisions that are made, 
environmental decisions, land use decisions and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk for a minute about the welfare state that has been 
built up around aboriginal people in this country.  I am not sure 
if the House is aware that the dependency on welfare in this 
country by aboriginal people exceeds $1 billion at this time.  It 
is growing faster than the rate of inflation and the rate of 
aboriginal population growth combined.  That did not come from 
me, it came from the auditor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general also points out that over one four-year 
period the department spent an additional $1 billion over its 
regular spending for economic development.  One billion dollars 
in addition to its regular spending because the department had 
this elite top down arrogant attitude that it could solve all the 
problems on reserves by micromanaging from Ottawa.  Guess what 
happened.

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That $1 billion expenditure translated into a progressive 
increase in the unemployment rate, the dependency rate and in the 
social assistance envelope that the department has to provide 
every year for social assistance on reserves.  In other words, it 
had no affect.  The auditor general said in his report that if it 
had any effect whatsoever, the affect would have been a negative 
one rather than a positive one. One billion dollars, it did not 
help the people it was designed to help and cost every taxpayer 
in this country a serious amount of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about what the auditor general said in his most 
recent report to Parliament on aboriginal health care.  The most 
revealing aspect of the report was that the Government of Canada 
and the Ministry of Health are so unconcerned about the fate and 
health of aboriginal people that over a 10 year period dependency 
on prescription drugs was actually facilitated by the department 
to the point where in one three month period there were more than 
700 people who had 50 prescriptions or more for mood altering 
drugs.  The government has known about this problem for 10 years. 
The auditor general said so and has harshly criticized the 
government because it has done absolutely nothing about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit that the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development is without accountability.  The government is without 
accountability.  What it is trying to do is window dress the 
whole affair by creating these so-called management boards and 
land claim agreements to try to give people the appearance that 
the government is actually concerned, that it is actually doing 
something.  The reality is it sits on its hands and does nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at the issue of the Stony reserve in Alberta.  The people 
on the reserve had to cry out through the media.  They lived 
under the threat of their houses being burned down before they 
could finally get the minister of Indian affairs, kicking and 
screaming, to agree a forensic audit of that band.  Now we see, 
as a result of the forensic audit, charges are being laid.  The 
truth is coming out.  Hopefully the whole truth will come out.  I 
still think there are still some people on that reserve who are 
concerned that the whole truth does come out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again this is the Liberal way.  It is the way obfuscating what 
is really going on by creating the impression that something is 
being done about the very serious problems which exist on many 
Canadian reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was speaking with some aboriginal people yesterday who came 
from southern Ontario.  While we agreed during the meeting that 
we would not agree on all points, at least we had some common 
ground.  These people said they could not understand why a 
minister who had fiduciary responsibility to them was actually 
intervening in a court case and trying to undermine their 
position in that case.  I will not get into the details of it. It 
is one more example of the Liberal way of speaking out of both 
sides of your mouth at the same time.  It is one more example of 
creating an illusion for the benefit of your political numbers in 
the next poll that you are actually doing something when you 
really are not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that aboriginal people across the country have caught 
on to the system.  I think they know the system better than the 
government.  The aboriginal people of this country are not going 
to be satisfied with these kinds of initiatives in the future.  I 
submit to the House and to the aboriginal people of this country 
that the way out of this mess is for them to be included as full 
and equal partners in this democracy, for them to be afforded 
every opportunity as any other Canadian.  The way for the future 
in Canada is the equality of all Canadians, recognizing that 
aboriginal peoples have unique culture, unique characteristics 
and a unique language.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think most Canadians embrace the notion of that.  Most 
Canadians find that something to be proud of, that we have this 
kind of a culture within our nation's boundaries.  We have a 
culture that people from other parts of the world, Japan, Germany 
and so on, come over here to see for themselves.  I have people 
coming to my riding from Japan who want to see for themselves 
aboriginal culture, who want to see a display of aboriginal 
culture, who want to watch a dance, who want to tour a museum or 
who want to view aboriginal art.  I think that is a great thing 
for our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit to the House and to the aboriginal people of this 
country that being a country that embraces the notion of 
expressing our culture and our diversity does not mean 
entrenching inequality and special rights within the laws of our 
land. I submit that is not the way of the future for this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is principally why I oppose this bill.  I believe it is 
undemocratic.  I believe it does not reflect the true values of 
Canadians and, most of all, I believe in the long run it will do 
nothing to assist aboriginal people who really want to assist 
themselves at the present time, who really want to have a future 
for themselves and their families within this country, who really 
want accountability, who really want to have an opportunity to 
see themselves in the future with the same opportunities and with 
the same economic circumstances as every other Canadian. That is 
why I oppose this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. 
member for Kitchener—Waterloo, crime prevention; the hon. member 
for Vancouver East, health. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds—Dollard, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Skeena for his speech. I 
have first of all a comment for the member for Calgary East, the 
previous speaker for the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We say in French he made une affirmation gratuite. I do not know 
how to translate it.  It could be an unfounded assertion or 
misleading affirmation about the number of people sitting on the 
board, the next board and a future board.  He talked about 
patronage.  I want to let him know that on the planning board 
there will be five members for the Gwich'in and the Sahtu.  There 
will be two members from the Gwich'in, there will be two members 
from the government, one coming from the federal government and 
the other one coming from the Northwest Territories government, 
and the four will name a president. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the next one, the land and water board, there will be 
seventeen members.  Of the seventeen members five will come from 
the Gwich'in, five will come from the Sahtu and three will be 
from the first nations, the Dogrib, the Deh Cho and the people 
from treaty No. 8 who are not part of the negotiations right now, 
and three other ones will be from governments, two from the 
federal government and one from the Northwest Territories 
government. That means we will have two members from the federal 
government and those sixteen will name a president. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the environment impact assessment and review board, there 
will be eleven members, five from first nations, five from 
government and from the government there will be three from the 
federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are looking at what this government has done as nomination 
for the Nunavik area we have named dozens and dozens of people 
for nomination there.  If we named them it is because they are 
good people. They are dedicated people and competent people. All 
the nominations we have done for the Northwest Territories are 
very good nominations. What the member said before is really 
misleading the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Skeena mentioned that he would like to have first 
nations as a full and equal partner. My question is very easy. 
Does he mean by full and equal partner that he and his party do 
not recognize the treaty signed between the first nations and the 
governments? 
Does he mean that equal and full partner means assimilation? Is 
this why the Reform Party is voting against the initiative to 
give aboriginal control over their future?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Madam Speaker, when the member refers to 
treaties, in many cases in Canada treaties were signed more than 
100 or 200 years ago.  In the case of the Sahtu Dene and Metis 
and in the case of Gwich'in, those treaties were signed a very 
short while ago by this government in the last Parliament.  These 
are not treaties the government was bound to 200, 300 or 400 
years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government had a historic opportunity in negotiating with 
aboriginal peoples in Yukon and the Northwest Territories to 
change direction and say it was not going to go down the road it 
had been before because it did not work.  We have seen the 
results and live with the results.  It is not an accident that 
the aboriginal infant mortality rate is twice as high as for the 
rest of Canadians.  It is not an accident that the social 
pathologies on reserves are so much worse than for other 
Canadians.  It is not an accident that the suicide rate is six to 
seven times as high in reserve communities as it is elsewhere in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada has created welfare colonies right 
across this country, encouraged welfare colonies, built up a 
welfare dependency cycle around these people and put them in a 
position where it was very difficult, some would argue well nigh 
impossible, to break that welfare dependency cycle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the government doing now?  It is constructing more of 
the same.  It is finding new and better ways to do the old thing 
which is separation and segregation rather than inclusion and 
equality.  The people who pay the price every time, by far the 
highest price, are the aboriginal people who are signed into 
these treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government had a historic opportunity to do something 
different but it is so tunnel visioned and so caught up in the 
old ways.  Here we are about to enter the 21st century and they 
are talking about 17th century thinking on that side.  I cannot 
believe this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot believe these people do not understand democracy and 
democratic principles and that the fundamental principle of 
democracy is the equality of all people before the law.  When 
those principles are violated there are consequences. The 
consequences in this case are going to be paid mostly by the 
aboriginal people who are affected by these agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the member looks at me and asks if I recognize that these 
people have rights, they have human rights and democratic rights. 
They ought to have the same rights as I.  They have never been 
afforded these rights and it has been largely Liberal governments 
that have denied them those rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the hon. member not to look at me.  There was no 
Reform Party 20, 30, 50, 100 or 200 years ago but there was a 
Liberal Party and that is where it came from. 
<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I want to share a perspective of developmental boards, 
management boards of resources, our lands, our rivers and our 
waters throughout Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government, in its wisdom, had to recognize aboriginal 
peoples on the vision of the future of all peoples on this land, 
aboriginal people would be a majority in this House of Commons. 
Aboriginal people would be a majority in the Senate. Aboriginal 
people would be a majority on the Supreme Court of Canada, at the 
infancy stage of this country.  We were the majority of the 
population of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, in hindsight, government is preparing to acknowledge that 
aboriginal people can have a say on the land use policies and 
resource use policies of this country and in the regions of Yukon 
and Northwest Territories.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a step in the right direction.  I welcome that in my own 
constituency with regard to the Athabasca lakes and the uranium 
mining that takes place there.  We do not have resource 
development boards to govern or to look at the future of the 
environmental, economic and social impact the hon. member is so 
concerned about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Resources are the wealth of the country.  Without income there 
would be no economic cycle.  To create new wealth the resources 
are being tapped away.  If we include aboriginal people at this 
level it is a start.  It may not be the answer for all, but the 
Dene, Innu and Cree all have a vested interest in investing their 
traditional lifestyle of time immemorial in the future 
development of the entire country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge the Reform member who boldly stated the country was 
going in the wrong direction, or had a history of making 
mistakes, to share with us the vision of the Reform Party for a 
brighter future for aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aboriginal people signed treaties in recognition of the 
British and French nations along with the Dene, the Mohawk and 
the Haida, all nations of North America.  They were willing to 
recognize the power of the country and the resources that need to 
be developed for the betterment of all but in co-operation and 
with respect for each other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The management boards are a step in the right direction. I ask 
for his analysis of the new millennium and the relationship 
between Canada and the aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Madam Speaker, I will try to respond very 
succinctly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. member for his intervention.  I disagree with 
him on one point he made.  He said that resources were the wealth 
of the country.  I beg to differ.  People are the wealth of the 
country and resources are the tools.  I submit the bill being 
debated today provides no vision for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very best we could do for aboriginal people is to treat them 
as equals and with respect, the same respect we have for 
everybody else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are areas with high populations of aboriginal people. 
There are concerns about land use.  There are concerns about 
resource extraction.  This is not because of the aboriginal 
people but because they have a vested interest in the land.  They 
live there.  They are local to the area.  I certainly believe 
they ought to have the right to exercise some control over the 
decision making but not on the basis of being aboriginal. 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is an honour for me to address the House for the 
first time.  I would ask for a little latitude to mention a few 
things before talking about Bill C-6. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is certainly an honour to be in the House to represent the 
good people of Dewdney—Alouette.  May I begin by acknowledging 
the people who chose me to represent them in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The riding of Dewdney—Alouette encompasses a number of diverse 
communities which stretch from Pitt Meadows in the west to 
Mission, to Harrison Hot Springs and to Agassiz in the east.  It 
is a diverse mix of urban and rural settings.  For many people in 
the riding it is the last frontier of affordable housing so that 
they can work in Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The forestry and fishing industries are vital to the economic 
make-up of the area.  I salute the people of those communities 
involved in that work.  It is certainly a beautiful place to 
visit.  I would say it is the most beautiful riding in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I acknowledge a few of my constituents, in particular a few who 
live in Mission and those who live right in my house.  Those are 
the most important constituents, my wife Wendy and my children 
Jordana, Reanne, Kaelin and Graedon.  It is this support, as it 
is for all of us who sit in the House, that make it possible to 
make this commitment to our country.  I thank them personally for 
that. 
Family is a very important part of my life.  We all make 
sacrifices to be in the House.  Members of all parties appreciate 
those who are at home supporting us.  Family is the life of our 
country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time for those who have been silent for a long time to get 
involved.  I talked to a number who were disillusioned with the 
governance of the country.  Apathy is at an all time high. People 
are disillusioned.  I believe it is time we restored the 
commitment of the House to the people of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to be a member of a party committed to restoring the 
confidence of people in their government through real structural 
parliamentary reform.  That is where Bill C-6 can be addressed. 
While it is well intended it does not deal with real structural 
reforms needed to address the concerns of the Mackenzie Valley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My own riding has eight bands represented, the Sto:lo nation 
being the largest in the area.  Several bands are part of the 
Sto:lo nation:  the Chehalis, the Douglas, the Katzie, the 
Lakahahmen, the Samahquam, the Scowlitz, the people of Seabird 
Island and the people of Skookum Chuck. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleagues have mentioned before when talking about the 
bill, we recognize the validity of the goals of the legislation 
and the need to implement commitments made by Canada under land 
claims agreements.  Land and water management and protection of 
the environment in the Mackenzie Valley are issues of importance 
both to the residents of the region and to Canadians in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our objection and what I would like to focus on is the creation 
of another level of bureaucracy as was mentioned earlier by some 
of my colleagues.  I received a phone call during the election 
campaign from one of my own constituents, a member of the 
aboriginal community.  As my hon. colleague from Skeena 
mentioned, a co-dependency relationship seems to have been 
established between the federal government and many aboriginal 
peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The young lady phoned me and said “I am really tired of the 
process I have been through.  I just want to be a Canadian.  I 
just want to be someone who is treated the same as all other 
people in Canada”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party's focus on equality and the establishment of equality 
for aboriginal peoples and all peoples of Canada strikes at the 
heart of this young lady's comments and a need for real 
structural change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people bring forward legislation they have an idea of what 
they are doing, at least we hope they do.  We argue that the 
level of bureaucracy to be created would not serve the people of 
the area well.  It would hinder true economic development of the 
area and the needs of the people there.  It is certainly 
something that needs to be addressed and examined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members on this side would like to focus on a new relationship 
with the aboriginal peoples of Canada, one that focuses on the 
equality of all Canadians including aboriginal peoples.  We have 
seen and heard from a number of a constituents in ridings across 
the country of terrible things that have happened in their 
personal lives.  We think about the fact that real people are 
affected by legislation.  We see the effects of legislation on 
many people in our aboriginal communities and the co-dependent 
relationship which seems to have developed over the last several 
decades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spoken with people from aboriginal communities, the rank 
and file people on different reserves in my riding.  People are 
looking for involvement at the grassroots level and at the 
governing structure of reserves. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1640"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT79"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because the rights of each individual on the reserves are not 
the same we all know of different stories of people who have been 
abused.  Those are things that need to be addressed.  The best 
way to address them is with fundamental changes, structural 
changes to the system, the implementation of programs and the 
implementation of an aboriginal affairs policy that addresses all 
people of all communities and has a primary function of equality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members on this side fully support honouring treaties according 
to their original intent and court decisions.  We also support 
that aboriginal people be part of the process.  We see some 
trouble with the bill as was mentioned by some of my colleagues 
before.  The levels of bureaucracy would hinder the involvement 
of rank and file individual people of the Mackenzie Valley.  We 
see the principle of the implementation of the boards as a 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The structure of the proposed legislation does not address the 
real concerns of changing the system to address the needs of 
individual people.  That is where our objections would lie.  Many 
times people will say different things about different groups of 
people.  We fully support aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We look at different people who have come to our offices with 
troubling circumstances.  We shake our heads and wonder how it 
could have happened.  We want to focus on helping all Canadians 
to achieve equality and to add to this great country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support aboriginal people, rank and file individuals who 
often tend not to have a real voice in their own communities.  We 
see leadership in some bands—not all of course—that does not 
fully recognize the contributions of all members of the local 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We object to Bill C-6 on the basis of a number of principles 
that were mentioned earlier.  We look forward to being able to 
see real parliamentary reform and structural reform in our 
aboriginal communities to give them a real say at the local 
level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague from Skeena mentioned earlier in his analogy of 
kingdoms and fiefdoms, the power structure disables the people at 
the rank and file level from being involved.  In essence it shuts 
down the ability for real involvement by people. It was a very 
good analogy.  We on this side of the House would like to work 
with the government toward looking at fundamental structural 
changes for the good of our aboriginal people.  The equality of 
all Canadians is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another person I did not mention or thank at the beginning of my 
speech whom I would like to thank now is not with us.  It is my 
father.  He was a veteran.  He served the country and fought in 
World War II.  He really instilled a sense of democracy in me 
personally.  We had many debates about freedoms and democracies. 
I saw the scars and the pain he carried with him from the horrors 
of war, the things he saw and had to endure.  In fact he lost 
many of his friends.  Even 50 years after the fact tears would 
well up in his eyes as he thought back to the friends and mates 
he had lost in the war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The battles fought by our veterans were for the equality of all 
Canadians, so that all people would have a say. That is the 
principle for which he and his colleagues fought.

expressed equality for all Canadians and our aboriginal people 
who have not had that full opportunity, the full rights and 
privileges as all other citizens of Canada have had. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close by restating our concern for the aboriginal 
communities and the fact that in Canada we would like to see 
equality for all people, to bring about a healing, to bring about 
concern for all people, to help solve the injustices of the past 
which previous structural policies have put in place.  It is time 
for a change, as my hon. colleague mentioned, not a time to go 
down the same road.  It is time to address these factors of 
equality and that all Canadians are equal before the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Mackenzie Valley is a great area, part of a great country. 
While legislation can be well intended, we see structural 
problems with the implementation of these boards.  We need to 
have that in place in order for it to work well and it needs to 
be right before implementing it.  That is where my main objection 
lies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, I thank you for listening intently to my 
comments. It is an honour and a privilege to be here and I hope I 
have many opportunities to speak on different bills.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I listened carefully to my colleague from the riding of 
Dewdney—Alouette and I listened to my colleagues from the Reform 
Party and to their contradictions and misunderstandings about 
this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One member stated that these new boards will have no power and 
will be an empty shell.  A number of members from the Reform 
Party stated the opposite, that they will have too many powers. 
Some are scared about the cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Mackenzie River is long and the area is huge.  The Mackenzie 
River is 4,000 kilometres long.  What we are doing right now is 
transferring power from DIAND to the people of the Mackenzie 
Valley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Mackenzie Valley Land and Water Board, the Regional Land Use 
Planning Board and the Environmental Impact Review Board will be 
transferred from DIAND to them.  Right now we have many senior 
employees from DIAND travelling weekly to the Northwest 
Territories.  That costs a lot of money because it is a very 
large area.  They do not move from Yellowknife to Inuvik just 
like that.  It is impossible.  We are transferring the power to 
the people of the First Nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have one question for my friend.  How could the Reform Party 
say this bill is no good for aboriginal people knowing that the 
elected majority in the legislature of the Northwest Territories 
is made up of aboriginal people, knowing that the Premier of the 
Northwest Territories is Metis, knowing that the Minister of 
Renewable Resources in the Northwest Territories is Metis, 
knowing that the Gwich'in Council is in favour of this bill, 
knowing that the Sahtu Council is also in favour of this bill? 
How could he state that this bill is not good for the First 
Nations when all the First Nations people in this region are in 
favour of it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  I thank the hon. member for his 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I would look at the leadership versus rank and file 
aboriginal peoples.  We are focusing on the relationship between 
the two and the fact that while the elected leadership of the 
area may be in favour of this bill we are looking at the actual 
process, the actual implementation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague opposite mentioned returning power to the 
aboriginal people in the area.  We would question, then, why this 
great bureaucracy, this great number of people involved on the 
boards from the federal government side?  Perhaps we should be 
turning it over to the local people, with accountability and 
responsibility being placed on the people within that area, 
similar to a municipal type of government.  That is what my 
response would be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is basically the process we are talking about.  The power 
structure and the implementation of the plan are what we are 
concerned about.  We are not concerned about the intent of the 
bill.  We are concerned about its implementation and its 
practicality to the people of the area. 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I want to 
compliment my colleague from Dewdney—Alouette on his maiden 
speech and his characterization of his riding.  I am sure we all 
remember when we said equally glowing things.  I appreciate that 
because it makes us remember why we are here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I worked with the previous member for Churchill, Elijah Harper. 
He is a Cree Indian.  I remember an exchange with the Reform 
Party in the last House when Elijah was dealing with a bill much 
like the bill which is before the House today.  It was a bill 
which gave powers to a group of aboriginal people, a unified 
people.  Reform members were saying that it would be far too 
expensive and that if we carried on that way British Columbia 
would end up as a native community and all the other people would 
have to leave and that sort of nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Elijah stood and he said “My colleagues in the Reform Party, 
you just do not get it, do you?  You do not have the foggiest 
notion of what I am talking about.  I am talking about my people, 
my ancestors, the people who have inhabited this land for some 
10,000 to 15,000 years.  They lived here without the benefit of 
gasoline, internal combustion engines, high powered rifles, 
airplanes, helicopters and a lot of other things”.  I am glad 
Elijah is not dead.  He would be rolling in his grave if he had 
heard the speech today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member used a very poor analogy.  He suggested that perhaps 
the native people were not democratic.  Surely my colleague knows 
that one of the problems is that the 625 First Nations consider 
themselves to be independent, individual First Nations.  They 
have a system of government and a way of operating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before we came along they traded right across the country, from 
California to Nova Scotia, from Alaska to Florida.  They worked 
out things together.  They had regions.  They did a little 
fighting now and then and took a few prisoners.  They took a 
scalp or two, but most of the time they settled their differences 
at councils, by talking.  We have to learn that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is this nonsense about them all wanting to have 
equality. That is a very hard term to get hold of.  My friends in 
the Reform Party use it without due consideration.  What they 
mean is, we throw the native people in with everybody else to 
follow the same rules.  If they are in B.C., they will follow the 
rules of B.C.  If they are in Vancouver, they will follow the 
rules of Vancouver.  If they are somewhere else, they will follow 
those rules. That is not what they want at all.  That is not why 
we have spent a long time trying to redress the balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, former governments and people thought we could assimilate 
the natives.  They were not educated.  They were savages.  They 
did not have a system of government because we trampled on it. 
We did not pay much attention to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the early treaties, yes, we have read about them. 
They sat, said nice things to one another and they welcomed them 
to share this country.  That is what they want to do again.  That 
is what this is bill is aiming toward.  It is going to take time, 
goodwill.  It is going to take some knowledge of history and some 
knowledge of what is involved.  I do not hear much of that on the 
other side. I hear catch words and buzzwords.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If my colleague is so concerned about his native people, maybe 
he would tell us why his party opposed the Nisga'a agreement? 
Why are Reformers afraid that these terrible native people are 
going to take over the whole country and throw us out? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Madam Speaker, it is an honour to 
address the comments of my hon. colleague.  I thank him for the 
compliments at the beginning of his comments.  I do not thank him 
for his comments after. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not see Mr. Harper today.  I guess he was not supported by 
his people in a re-election bid.  The hon. member talked about 
ramblings and he actually called aboriginals savages.  We would 
have nothing to do with that kind of comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about power structures and abuses of former 
governments.  We agree with that.  We are looking for a change in 
the balance.  We are listening to rank and file aboriginal 
people.  There are people that are concerned with power 
structures within their reserves.  Not to acknowledge that is to 
ignore the facts and needs to be addressed. Equality is not a 
buzzword here.  It is something we believe in and it is something 
we are moving and working toward. That is where our policy lies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have treaty advisory committees in British Columbia.  I had 
an opportunity to talk to all the mayors in my riding and they 
have great concern about the process.  Their great concern is 
because they have a minor part.  The municipalities are living 
hand in hand with the aboriginal communities but they do not have 
an opportunity to sit down at the table with each other.  The 
process is structured so that they have observer status but not 
participatory status.  They are concerned about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the federal government leaves, the people of both 
communities are left to work out the relationship between them. 
We would like to see that addressed so that they would have an 
opportunity to work together. 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the debate on this bill is not about the degree of 
respect for aboriginal people held on one side of the House or 
the other.  I know the Liberals would like to make it a debate on 
that and go into their usual rants about how they see themselves 
as being the purest of the pure as far as having the best of 
motives and everyone else's motives are rotten and suspect.  That 
is nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members need to examine some of these measures on their merits. 
They need to get away from some of the rhetoric and some of the 
emotionally buzzwords that are used, unfortunately, by 
government, I hope not to obscure clear headed debate on the 
merits of these proposals.  Certainly it should not deter people 
who are examining these bills in the public domain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-6 is called the Mackenzie Valley land and water 
management act.  I assume this is what this bill is about. It is 
about good management of the resources on the land and the water 
resources of a huge, beautiful valuable area of our country.  It 
is rightly said that the people who live in that area should have 
the biggest say in the way the area is managed. That is the 
principle that we have tried to use right across Canada. 
Unfortunately we get made in Ottawa solutions that do not benefit 
the people in a particular area or region of Canada. 
We have been pretty blunt about pointing that out when it 
happens.  We have just seen in B.C. how the mismanagement by 
Ottawa of our salmon stocks has erupted into a huge concern and 
fight with real economic consequences.  It is not just people in 
one or another area of the country who suffer under bad 
management from this government and I think we need to point that 
out.

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us examine the kind of management structure that is being 
put into place by this bill.  First, the bill creates four new 
boards.  It creates a land use planning board in the Gwich'in 
settlement area.  It also creates a land use planning board in 
the Sahtu settlement area. Then it sets up a Mackenzie Valley 
land and water board with a regional panel in each of those two 
settlement areas and it sets up an environmental impact review 
board for the entire Mackenzie Valley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Mackenzie Valley land and water board can create panels 
besides the two that are set up in the Gwich'in settlement area 
and the Sahtu settlement area, and of course as other land claims 
are settled there are other settlement areas and presumably other 
land use planning boards and land and water boards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And so we have a proliferation of boards.  This is nice.  It 
gives a lot of people involvement and a say in what happens but 
the simple question is does this lead to power or to gridlock. We 
can say this scheme is wonderful, we are going to include 
everybody, we are going to give everybody we can a say and they 
can sit around the table and give their opinion and make a 
decision about how this happens. Then a little ways away another 
group will do the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is not the whole purpose of this to properly manage the land and 
water resources of a very valuable region, to manage them for the 
benefit of the people there?  Just to say that everyone gets a 
shot at this and is this not wonderful is simply nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The stated purpose of the bill is to provide an integrated 
system of land and water management in the Mackenzie Valley. That 
is a nice purpose.  Integrated sounds very nice.  That means 
coming together, meshing, working harmoniously and smoothly 
together for the protection of the environment and resources that 
are so important to people of any region, whether it be fish in 
British Columbia, whether it be hydroelectric power in 
Newfoundland and Labrador or whatever it is that people are very 
concerned about the management of land and water resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this system integrated?  By any normal, rational, intelligent 
definition I cannot see any reason to suppose that this is going 
to be integrated.  There are separate boards and panels being set 
up in each of the settlement areas and there is a total 
absence of any logical, coherent framework for doing this.  It 
does not say how the members of these boards are to be selected. 
It does not give any criteria for eligibility.  It has no process 
for the appointment.  It does not lay out who is responsible for 
what. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are no guidelines as to how a board decides what is 
allowable and what is not.  It does not say that if a development 
affects both regions or in future maybe multi-settlement regions 
if one board decides one thing and then another board has a 
different viewpoint who sorts all this out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are these projects supposed to be sorted out by the courts at 
enormous expense, enormous delays, enormous frustration where 
with the resources everyone throws up their hands, as they are 
starting to do in Voisey's Bay in Labrador, and wishes they had 
never started the whole thing?  Then the potential benefits for 
the people in the region are completely lost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the rant by the previous questioner of the last speaker 
about this wonderful heritage of aboriginal people. 
The Liberals are not the only ones who know and love, have worked 
with or have family members who are aboriginal people.  They want 
the same advantages, the same educational opportunities, the same 
goods and services, the same security and employment 
opportunities as any other Canadian.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The resources of a particular region are there to be developed 
to give that quality of life to the people who live there.  We 
must have a way to make sure that there is a logical, well 
thought out and workable solution so that the people of a 
region can decide how to protect, enhance and properly develop 
the resources, but not in such a hodge-podge, mish-mash way that 
no coherent decision is ever possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This decision making process is under resource.  It takes a 
great deal of technical expertise to do environmental impact 
assessments and all other assessments that have to be made. The 
development companies will say if they bring in this development 
or do this or that, it will be great. However, when those kinds 
of proposals are being evaluated there must be the same kind of 
technical expertise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there is no indication in this bill that the technical 
resources will be available to the decision makers who are being 
put in place.  To just put people in place and tell them to go 
for it and decide without giving them the resources to make well 
informed decisions is nonsense. Again, the bill does not allow 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was in the last Parliament when Reform opposed some of the 
measures that were brought forward on these settlements.  It was 
on the basis that if we are to set up power, authority, 
responsible decision making structures, it must be done in a way 
which will benefit the people involved.  We cannot have chaos and 
expect anyone to benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge the government to clarify the structure of these 
multi-boards it is putting place.  By the way, this is not the 
only decision making structure in that area. There is the 
territorial government and the councils of the people.  There 
will be these levels of decision makers, government and 
authorities. Human nature being what it is, there will also be 
competing interests and viewpoints. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not seen anything in the bill that would reassure me as a 
legislator, as someone who has the responsibility to examine the 
structure to see whether it does serve the interests of the 
people who will be affected.  I am not at all convinced that this 
structure is workable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To say that it includes aboriginal people in the decision making 
and therefore it must be wonderful and good and anyone who says 
it is not must have some sinister motive is complete nonsense. 
It would be absolutely irresponsible to accept the bill and its 
structure simply on that soft, fuzzy, mushy basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people who will be affected are looking to us to put in 
place a workable structure, one they can operate under. In the 
House we have standing orders, procedure in committees, rules of 
procedure and Beauchesne. Even then to your sorrow, Mr. Speaker, 
sometimes order and coherence do not always carry the day.  That 
is the way institutions and organizations and decision making 
bodies operate.  They have to be structured and under some kind 
of regulatory process which is clearly laid out so that people 
know what their responsibilities and jurisdictions are and what 
is allowable and what is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just to say that this is going to happen by magic is like 
blowing up a print shop and saying you are going to get a 
complete novel from the debris.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the House and this government have a responsibility when 
we put in structures and make regulatory changes. The goal is 
laudable.  I do not think anybody in this House would say that we 
should not have environmental protection for the northern regions 
or good management of land and water resources. Nobody here is 
saying that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we and the opposition are saying to the government is that 
instead of putting our hands over our hearts and saying we are 
being inclusive and allowing people to have a say, let us put a 
structure in place where we have a say in a way that is going to 
get some results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we in this House could just get up and shout at each other 
and say whatever we wanted whenever we wanted with no structure, 
no regulations and no standing orders, we would not be able to 
carry on the business of this country.  It is the same with any 
organization or decision making body that is put into place. 
There must be some clearly developed lines of how this is going 
to work.  This is entirely missing in this bill.  Maybe the 
parliamentary secretary can reassure us that there are some 
regulations that are going to be put into place that will remedy 
this defect.  I have not seen them but if they are not there they 
sure should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point I think it would be completely irresponsible to 
foist on the people of a huge, important and valuable region of 
this country this kind of a hodge-podge management system.  I 
urge members of this House to either see the government rectify 
these defects or to vote down this bill until these defects are 
rectified.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Karygiannis (Scarborough—Agincourt, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with great interest to my colleague across 
the way.  There were some key words, that it is not workable, we 
have to examine the structure.  She also said that it was 
irresponsible. The responsibility is not in the bill, the 
responsibility is standing up on one's feet and criticizing 
something by saying it is not workable, it is not this and it is 
not that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If my colleague across the way has some great ideas that she 
wants to bring forward I am sure this side will be interested in 
listening.  However, let us not call something irresponsible when 
it is not.  The responsibility here is criticizing something and 
not putting something down on the table.  That is the way the 
Reform Party has always been.  If it wants to call a spade a 
spade, let us not say the sky is falling.  Responsibility is 
being elected to this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government does not see its way and the great party 
across the way has some sense in where it wants us to go, put it 
on the table.  Do not just stand and criticize. If it has some 
constructive ideas, bring them forward instead of criticizing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I guess the hon. member 
was not part of the Liberal contingent when it was in opposition 
because as an observer of the political scene I almost never saw 
it bring forth anything constructive.  The criticisms of the rat 
pack were a big example of the order of the day.  It seemed to be 
its specialty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike the Liberal opposition, the Reform opposition has been 
very careful to bring forth constructive alternatives on major 
issues where it disagrees with government.  We were the first 
opposition, for example, to propose an alternative budget.  We 
were the first opposition to propose substantial changes to the 
Canada pension plan which we knew was not working even before the 
Liberals finally admitted it.  In area after area we have brought 
forth constructive alternatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government does not have the resources or the brain power 
to figure out how to bring forward a workable, logical and 
constructive framework for the management of resources then it 
probably should resign and let somebody in who can do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if it is going to get on with the job then the 
principles it should go on is that there should be clearly 
defined jurisdiction, responsibility and a line of authority and 
decision making that is identified, laid out and that people can 
refer to when these matters go forward.

I first of all thank my colleague for his speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My first comment is that I am sure he did not read the bill.  He 
is talking about the criteria for naming the people to the board. 
There is just one criteria for naming people to boards, and that 
is competence.  I hope by raising this question in the House he 
does not feel it means the First Nations are not competent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the member talks about court, about delay and about 
frustration.  We are just replacing what we are doing now.  We 
are devolving.  We are giving back to the people living in the 
Mackenzie Valley what they should have had long ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member said that the boards are not integrated.  It is 
totally the opposite.  This system is integrated because the 
Mackenzie Valley Land and Water Board and the Mackenzie Valley 
Environmental Impact Review Board will end those issues relating 
to the valley.  It is integrated, totally integrated. One thing 
is that the GNWT supports this bill because it is integrated 
valley wide.  It is for the people living there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is quite simple. Why does the member of the Reform 
Party want to impose her view and not take into consideration the 
remarks, the views of the people, the wishes of the people living 
in that area? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We told that to the premier of the Northwest Territories and he 
agreed.  The bands living there agree.  The minister of renewable 
resources agrees.  The people and the Government of the Northwest 
Territories agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the member not take this into consideration?  Why does 
she always want to impose her view and not take the views of the 
First Nations? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my view is very simple. 
That is whatever regulatory and management scheme is put into 
place must be clear and workable.  I would challenge the 
parliamentary secretary to find anybody who would disagree with 
that view, including the aboriginal people themselves who are 
most affected by this scheme.  That is the whole point.  They 
deserve the very best. I think it is repugnant to suggest that 
somehow competence is related to one's view of aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the kinds of tactics that the Liberals continually use 
when you criticize them.  If you criticize something the Liberals 
do, then you are criticizing the people who might be involved. If 
you criticize some kind of social program that the Liberals set 
up, then you are criticizing the people who are accessing the 
program.  This is complete nonsense.  I think the Liberals need 
to get away from those kinds of tactics and on to some valuable, 
logical and proper examination of what they are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the criterion is competence, then what is competence?  There 
are all kinds of people who are competent but competent in 
different things.  What kind of competence do we need for people 
who are managing land and water resources?  What kind of 
background do they need?  What kind of knowledge do they need? 
What kind of perspective of the area do they need? Those are the 
kinds of things that need to be spelled out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the best that the parliamentary secretary can come up with is 
the bare word competence, then surely we are in bigger trouble 
than I even thought we were. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can well imagine that the people of the area are in total 
agreement that they themselves should have the decision making 
authority and the authority to manage the resources in their own 
area. If the management scheme, which is the only point I am 
making, will lead to gridlock, confusion and disarray instead of 
to clear, proper and effective decision making, then nobody is 
well served, whether they are competent or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask this government to show a little competence and 
realistically address the very serious issues that I am raising, 
that the opposition is raising, instead of indulging in cheap 
shots and getting away from the real issues that are so important 
to the future of this area.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, what I find so interesting about what has gone on in 
this debate is that none of us would be debating this if it had 
not been for the excesses of the Mulroney era.  All of the 
legislation from which flowed this current bill was legislation 
that was initiated during the Mulroney era.  These very Liberals 
in government who are now defending every aspect of every 
agreement are basically defending the excesses of the Mulroney 
era. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In those heady days before there was effective opposition in 
this Parliament to talk about some of the potential downstream 
problems associated with some of the legislation in the north, we 
ended up with agreements that were constitutionally entrenched. 
This led to commitments being made in the north which are now 
leading to a circumstance where this government is attempting to 
cover up the cracks and deal with some very problematic 
circumstances in terms of resource development, how to operate 
the bureaucracy and how to operate governance in the north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a circumstance here where a member asked why we did not 
come up with some constructive solutions.  Last January I 
presented a paper on the very subject of how the governance of 
the western arctic could operate the western Northwest 
Territories after the creation of Nunavut which we all know is 
coming and very quickly it will be upon us, the creation of a new 
territory in the eastern arctic that is a province in everything 
but name with new governance.  We already have the contiguous 
territory of the Yukon.  Left between those two circumstances is 
a territory that many people are calling the western Northwest 
Territories.  Some people are calling it the western arctic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Presently the whole seat of government for the Northwest 
Territories resides in Yellowknife which contains half the 
population of the residual territory after the creation of 
Nunavut.  Several land claims agreements were initiated and 
legislated in the last Parliament but they all began during the 
Tory regime. There are competing interests between tribal 
groupings, Metis and non-natives.  They are often at odds as to 
what the future arrangement should be in the western arctic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So it is ridiculous to assert that there is a made in the north 
solution when it comes to this Mackenzie Valley land and water 
management act that is singular.  It is certainly anything but 
singular.  Bringing this whole arrangement into a workable 
fashion is turning out to be a very complicated arrangement 
indeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, in terms of resource development the north is a 
warehouse resources.  We need to generate interest and debate in 
southern Canada on the fate of what goes on in the north.  We do 
not get enough opportunity to debate this very important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Half the people who live in the western territory which wholly 
contains the Mackenzie Valley live in Yellowknife.  We went 
through a constitutional proposal to try to figure out a way to 
govern that territory, given all of the aboriginal settlements 
that have already occurred and those that are likely to occur to 
try to tie all the community arrangements into that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>After a very lengthy study, my ultimate conclusion was that the 
best solution would be to carry out the essential housekeeping 
changes to the current Northwest Territories Act which are 
necessary to take into account the upcoming division.  The 
western Northwest Territories could readily continue to operate 
under the amended Northwest Territories Act for the foreseeable 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of the Northwest Territories putting more service 
and program delivery responsibilities into the hands of the 
communities should continue to be encouraged.  That is what has 
been happening because of the reduction in federal transfers 
during the last Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at practical and pragmatic ways to deal with 
resource management in the Mackenzie Valley we have to remember 
that we have constitutionally entrenched commitments which flow 
from the agreements already in place.  However there is a better 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some laudable goals in the bill.  It is not so much 
the goals that we are concerned about.  It is the actual 
provisions within the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that the Northwest Territories is 90% 
dependent on federal funding.  In order to move away from that, 
the main industry that can accomplish it is mining.  There is a 
warehouse of resources and it is mostly mining oriented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The BHP mine proposal which will be a major stimulus to the 
economy of Yellowknife and the western Northwest Territories 
would not have occurred if it had not been proposed by a large 
corporation with patience and if the deposit had not occurred 
outside of one of the litigious land claims settlement proposals. 
There are lots of warnings from the mining sector that what is 
being put in place has all of the pitfalls of leading us into the 
circumstance where those kinds of developments will be very much 
put at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mining sector has a world full of experience. We know that 
most of the large mining concerns and many of the small ones, and 
more and more Canadians are operating in an international 
theatre.  They view some of the concerns in several ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are new obstacles to resource development in what has been 
considered by many to be a friendly environment. There are 
concerns about everything from the staking of mineral claims to a 
confused enforcement policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reliance on litigation to solve problems when it comes to 
the way this new board will operate came out clearly in an 
information session held by the Department of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development in the north. Concerns were raised about the 
vulnerability of this new process to delay tactics by certain 
parties. Then there is the lack of clarity in the process for 
selecting members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly have not gone through the full list, but what is 
clear is that the substantial amendments presented by the 
Northwest Territories Chamber of Mines revolved around two 
things.  One was the lack of clarity in the law and the rules, 
and the other was that the new system is seriously 
under-resourced.  Those concerns need to be dealt with in a very 
clear way in this legislation.  There should be amendments made 
to that effect.  We would certainly support them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It concerns me that we do not recognize the complexity of the 
legislation which we are dealing with.

the proceedings of the House of Commons who may not be aware of 
exactly what we are voting on.

would like everything read I will read it and, if not, I will 
proceed from there.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, in 1935 the Parliament of Canada passed 
the Fair Wages and Hours of Labour Act.  It applied only to 
private sector contractors working for the federal government on 
construction projects.  An example would be a new post office or 
some federal government public works project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In those depression era days, when jobs were scarce and the 
labour market was plentiful, such legislation may have been 
justified to some extent to ensure that labourers were not 
exploited and underpaid for the work performed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1983 Canada was in the midst of another depression, probably 
the worst one since the dirty thirties.  Since the legislation 
did not stipulate that wages and hours of work schedules were 
mandatory, the Liberal government of the day suspended all 
activity relating to schedules for construction projects on 
federal sites.  Those we will remember as the days of six and 
five, the wage and price control program the Liberals told 
Canadians they would never implement but did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems the Liberal government has a long history of 
broken promises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Schedules were frozen at 1982 levels so contracts would remain 
within this six and five range.  When the Liberals were defeated 
in 1984 the new government re-evaluated the need for these 
schedules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This evaluation revealed that the legislation was largely 
irrelevant and affected only a small segment of the construction 
sector, approximately 3%, and that the wages, hours of work and 
overtime problems it was designed to address in 1935 were being 
dealt with quite adequately under provincial legislation through 
collective agreements and by the marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Wage schedules and the survey on which they were based were 
found to be expensive to administer and statistically unsound. 
In 1987 the government officially suspended the issuing of 
schedules for a three year trial period.  That trial period found 
that the introduction of wage schedules would likely increase 
so-called fair wage compliant levels only marginally.  However, 
the cost to the department of those schedules was estimated to be 
approximately $270,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know these approximations are just that and generally they 
tend to run a lot higher than originally set 
out.  It was felt this high administration cost did not warrant a 
continuation of the practice of maintaining wage schedules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fast forward the VCR to April 24, 1997.  The prime minister was 
just a few days from calling a federal election, and the 
government's olive branch, Bill C-66, otherwise known as 
amendments to the Canada Labour Code, was in the process of going 
down in flames in the other place.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals, it seems, were in a bit of a panic mode.  The 
Reform Party was gaining momentum.  The Liberals feared that 
their reign was in danger of collapse and that one of the wise 
things to do was to dispatch the Minister of Labour to Hamilton, 
the centre of the universe, of course, and home of the former 
deputy prime minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an attempt to curry favour with the left and secure the 
Hamilton area seats, the minister announced the reinstatement of 
those expensive, outdated, unneeded, unnecessary schedules.  This 
was the same government that, only months before, announced with 
much fanfare that it would no longer set minimum wage rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Almost exactly a year ago, on October 30, 1996, the House passed 
Bill C-35, which aligned the federal minimum wage with the 
general minimum wage rates established by the provinces and 
territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rate paid to an employee is based on the employee's province 
or territory of employment.  That is a concept that the Reform 
Party agrees with, that the going rate in Alberta, British 
Columbia or even in areas of Alberta or British Columbia or 
Ontario should be the going minimum rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the portion of Bill C-35 that Reformers did not agree 
with was that, if the governor in council did not agree with the 
rate in the provinces, it could interfere.  We say, hands off. If 
it is good enough for private enterprise and if it is good enough 
for the provincial governments, then it should be good enough for 
the federal government as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government showed that it had at least a reasonable amount 
of faith in the ability of the provinces to set minimum wage, 
therefore we have to wonder why it would take the opposite 
approach on wage rates and hours of work in the construction 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the provincial minimum wages are satisfactory, why are the 
provincial laws governing construction wages and hours not 
adequate?  In other words, if someone is a contractor and had a 
job in Ontario working for the provincial government doing a 
public works project, then the federal government would not 
interfere.  It would be a deal between the contractor and the 
wage earner, the trades people or the labourers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If someone had a job in the private sector in Ontario—same 
contractor, now—then the marketplace would determine what those 
people were paid for their services.  However, the minister is 
suggesting that if that same contractor had a job working for the 
federal government in the same province with the same crew, it 
would be subject to the fair wages and hours of work schedules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really cannot get a grip on this because what is the 
rationale?  We have been led to believe that not only will the 
reinstatement of these schedules cost the government the bare 
minimum, $270,000, and very likely more dollars in administrative 
costs, estimates are that implementation of the wage schedules 
will add 2% to 5% to the tab for all construction projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is at a time when the country can ill afford increased 
contract prices.  Why are the contractors going to do this?  They 
are simply going to hedge their contracts.  They are going to 
build this in.  They are going to say, it is possible that the 
federal government is going to impose something on us later so we 
are going to have to build in something to protect ourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They simply cannot, as a contractor, as an employer, take on a 
contract for <I>x</I> dollars and then have the person who they 
are working for, in this case the federal government, come back 
and say that it has decided because of a complaint that as 
contractor you did not live up to the schedules and it will cost 
<I>x</I> dollars. 
The end result is that these contractors are going to build that 
extra price into the contract right up front.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to believe the things that the finance minister says 
about not embarking on a spending spree, and we would like to 
give him the benefit of the doubt on that, higher costs brought 
on by the implementation of this outdated practice will mean 
fewer projects and fewer jobs everywhere but in the labour 
program of Human Resources Development Canada. We can expect to 
have more bureaucrats as a result of these schedules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look back into history a bit more.  In 1996, the average 
hourly construction wage for union and non-union workers in 
Alberta was higher than what the government was paying its trades 
people.  That hardly seems to be rationale for bringing in 
schedules called fair wages and hours of work, when the 
construction industry is already exceeding what the federal 
government is paying its trades people. There is no rationale 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe this is a blatant attempt by the government to 
interfere in the marketplace.  It will cost taxpayers millions of 
dollars in unnecessary costs and ultimately, lost wages and lost 
jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps a lot of workers complained about unfair wages so let us 
take a look at that.  In 1990 an evaluation revealed that during 
the three-year trial from 1987 to 1990, six complaints were 
registered involving fair wages.  Two of these were in 
Newfoundland and Labrador where further investigation turned up 
that these people were in compliance.  In other words, there was 
no basis for the complaint.  Four were in Yukon where violations 
were found and arrears were collected. During this period, the 
Department of Public Works awarded 4,622 contracts with a greater 
value of $30,000 per contract for a total value of $1.428 
billion.  The fair wage arrears amounted to $31,401, an amount 
that is .00002% of the $1.428 billion total of other contracts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am told that over the last three and a half years in Alberta 
and the Northwest Territories there have been a total of 26 
complaints involving this legislation, virtually all concerning 
overtime and a few concerning wages.  Of these 26 complaints, six 
were said to involve so-called fair wages and two violations were 
found.  One violation involved wages in the amount of 40¢ an hour 
and the second is said to involve wages of less than $2 an hour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are you confused yet, Madam Speaker?  Because this is rather 
confusing to me.  Here are examples of workers who say they are 
not being remunerated fairly.  They make their complaints and in 
the last three and a half years, 26 of them were in Alberta and 
in two cases it was found that they were not coming up to the 
rates. These two cases are out of all the contracts that are 
awarded by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this process can be put in place, why is it that we need to 
implement these schedules? 
This is more than I can comprehend.  This sort of rationale 
escapes me.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Labour, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise this evening to speak 
to Motion M-9, a motion put forward by the member for Wetaskiwin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is urging the federal government not to reinstate 
wage schedules under the Fair Wages and Hours of Labour Act.  He 
also wants provincial wages and hours to prevail.  My hon. friend 
is a keen and intelligent observer of matters related to the work 
force. Very often he has interesting things to say.  I do not 
usually find myself agreeing with his point, however, I do 
respect his dedication, commitment and knowledge of workplace 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to this motion, I understand the reasoning behind 
it, but I do not support it for a number of reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me begin by describing for the members of the House what 
Fair Wages and Hours of Labour Act is exactly.  The Fair Wages 
and Hours of Labour Act began as a policy resolution of 
Parliament many years ago.  It was in 1900.  The act first 
emerged in 1935.  It was passed to provide that every contract 
with the Government of Canada for the building, remodelling, 
repair or demolition of any construction project must contain 
obligations covering the payment of fair wages, hours of labour 
and other working conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objective here, which I sure the member supports, is to 
ensure that the expenditure of public funds does not result in 
the exploitation of labour.  Because there is a Fair Wage and 
Hours of Labour Act every construction contract made with the 
federal government includes provisions requiring the contractor 
to pay the employees fair wages and to observe specified labour 
standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One effect of the legislation is to remove wages as an element 
in the tendering process.  In other words all contractors who 
wish to tender on a federal government construction project will 
know in advance what rates they will be expected to pay for the 
labour component of their costs.  A very good thing for 
contractors to know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past the wage component of the act was administered by 
attachments of schedules of wage rates to the construction 
contract signed with contractors on federal construction 
projects.  These schedules contain details pertaining to the 
classification of workers who were involved in the project and 
the fair wage rate for each classification in a particular 
geographic area.  The fair wage rates were determined by wage 
surveys prepared by the federal Department of Labour.  Another 
very good fair transparent way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process was discontinued in 1982, at least in part, because 
the cost of conducting the surveys was very high.  As a result 
the obligation to pay the fair wage remained.  It was left to the 
contractor to determine what that fair wage was.  There are some 
obvious problems with that approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During recent consultation, interested parties told officials of 
the department that the act could not accomplish its legislative 
purpose without the publication of fair wage schedules.  Even 
those who advocate the repeal of the act expressed the opinion 
that, should the act remain, then fair wage schedules would have 
to be published in order for the legislation to be effective.

<A HREF="#LINKT99"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An example of the problem associated with maintaining the act but 
not publishing the schedule is this. A complaint could lead to a 
decision during or after the completion of the project that the 
contractor was not paying a fair wage and must pay more 
retroactive to the beginning of the work.  That kind of liability 
could obviously be disastrous to a contractor and I do not think 
there is anybody in this Chamber who would want that to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last April, after almost a year of consultations with 
stakeholders in the construction industry it was announced that 
the wage schedules would be reinstated. However, the announcement 
included the fact that a new process would be put in place for 
determining the schedules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important that we understand this new process.  The 
idea is that the construction and labour relations associations 
which are employer groups located in every province will meet 
with the building and construction unions and also with the 
non-union contractor associations in each province and try to 
find a consensus on a range of fair wages for every trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the new mechanisms all the stakeholders will have the 
chance to take part directly in the decision making of fair 
wages.  If the schedules worked out by the stakeholders are 
consistent with the intent of the legislation then they will be 
adopted by government, but only then. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe in consultation and we believe that is a very 
important part of this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This method would seem to be a reasonable compromise.  However, 
any compromise, any agreement as to what is fair is not always 
easy to achieve. While we believe the reinstatement of wage 
schedules is in everybody's interest because of the certainty it 
would bring to employees and employers, we are not 100% certain 
the process will work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we have a pilot project in the member's home 
province of Alberta to find out.  This debate is very important 
and I thank the hon. member for bringing the subject forward. We 
are all concerned that we do the right thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that the decision in this discussion is a bit 
premature.  The fact is we will have better information once 
we have the results of the pilot project in Alberta and we should 
enter into that really gladly, because to find information, to 
find consultation should really be a goal of all members of 
Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, let me turn to the other part of the member's motion 
which contemplates replacing federal wage schedules with 
provincial schedules.  That idea fails to take into account that 
only five provinces and one territory have legislation similar to 
the Fair Wages and Hours of Labour Act. What would the member 
propose for the other jurisdictions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has put a lot of thought into his motion.  I 
congratulate him on beginning this important debate, but we are 
at the beginning.  I believe we must wait for the results of the 
pilot project in Alberta before we debate the matter further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The publishing of fair wage schedules after a transparent and 
open process leading to the establishment of those fair wages 
would allow workers and contractors to know what they will be 
receiving and what wages they will have to pay. There would be no 
surprises for anyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly it would be premature at best to cancel a program 
which has every success, all partners, before this pilot project 
has even begun.  I believe the member's motion must be defeated.

pleased to rise on behalf of my party, the Bloc Quebecois, and as 
its labour critic, to comment on the motion by my Reform Party 
colleague from Wetaskiwin, Motion M-9, which reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
not reinstate the wage schedules under the Fair Wages and 
Hours of Labour Act, but allow the provincial wages and hours 
to prevail.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the Fair Wages and Hours of Labour Act is to 
set standards for salaries and hours of work for people employed in 
federal construction projects.  More specifically, it provides that 
all construction contracts concluded by the Government of Canada 
must contain provisions requiring contractors to pay fair wages and 
to comply with the standards on hours of work and on overtime 
defined in the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a clear and noble purpose.  It also aims at removing the 
wage element from the tender process so that public funds are not 
used to exploit workers. 
This Fair Wages and Hours of Labour Act, which came into effect in 1935, 
was vigorously enforced until 1982, with pay grids or wage schedules 
designed in co-operation with employer and employee associations across 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These grids were attached to contracts dealing with government 
works, and this was done by agreement between the parties. But in 1982, 
all this stopped because it was established that the federal government 
intended to stop conducting the investigations that served as a basis 
for establishing the grids used to set fair wages and hours of labour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Starting in 1983, investigations were no longer conducted, which 
leaves us with a kind of vacuum that the Reform Party would fill by 
saying that such a grid should not be reinstated. Except that, as it 
happens, on April 24, just three days before the election was called, 
the then Minister of Labour announced in Hamilton that, if re-elected, 
the Liberal Party would reinstate the said grids. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After analyzing and holding consultations on the situation, we have 
come to the conclusion that it is in the public interest not to drop 
these grids, as suggested in the motion put forward by our colleague 
from the Reform Party, but to reinstate them at a future date, in the 
interest of the workers concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two points were of particular concern to us, the first one being 
that restoring these grids would work against the mechanisms that Quebec 
has set up in labour relations and on labour issues, namely Quebec's 
minimum wage act and everything to be found in collective agreements in 
Quebec in the area of construction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We found the answer to our concerns in a 1979 court ruling in 
Quebec by Mr. Justice Beetz, in the case of Construction Montcalm 
Incorporé v la Commission du salaire minimum, where the judge comments 
on an argument put forward by the defendant to the effect that the area 
is regulated by the Fair Wages and Hours of Labour Act; the judge made 
a ruling, on which we base our position in relation to Quebec. The 
ruling states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of these clauses is to ensure a minimum wage 
for all persons working for contractors who have been awarded 
a contract by the Government of Canada for the construction, 
restoration, repair or demolition of a structure. However, the 
act does not prevent the crown from signing a contract with a 
contractor who pays his employees an amount greater than the 
minimum wage. Furthermore, the act does not prevent 
enforcement of a provincial act providing for payment of a 
minimum wage or of an actual wage that is equal to or greater 
than the minimum wage provided under federal law.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>You will understand that, consequently, the fears or concerns 
we might have had have been dispelled by this judgment, which 
clearly states that federal law does not contravene Quebec 
legislation or prerogatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our second concern, and I will conclude with this, is to 
wonder what, in this situation, the fate of the workers concerned, 
the construction workers on federal projects, will be. 
Getting back to the bill, its intended purpose is to remove the 
wage aspect from the bidding process, so that cut-rate wages will 
not be paid in order to get a better chance at a federal contract. 
The intention in removing pay from the bidding process is to 
prevent public funds from being used to exploit workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we to understand that there is a sort of vacuum at this 
time, and that contractors can bid at cut rates for federal 
contracts?  If so, we know that the government commitment dates 
back to April 24, and now it is October 28. 
The matter has dragged on for a good six months, with a federal 
commitment in place.  There has been a loophole since 1984, a sort 
of laissez-faire approach, perhaps a dangerous laxity, bowing to 
the laws of the marketplace when the livelihoods of thousands upon 
thousands of workers in Canada are at stake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore consider that the government's commitment ought to 
be met, and met as soon as possible.  I do not know if the foot 
dragging is at the Department of Labour or with the Department of 
Human Resources Development, but either the government was serious 
and must move on it, or the Minister of Labour of the time just 
said any old thing.  That would perhaps not be surprising for this 
government, because it has changed its mind so often over the 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us think back to Mr. Trudeau in 1978, with the 18 cents a 
gallon promise—back in the days when we had gallons. 
and Mr. Clark's promise at the time, probably responsibly made, for 
he was the Prime Minister.  Mr. Trudeau made fun of him.  I 
personally remember hearing the radio spots as they are called, 
telling farmers that they would have to stop ploughing halfway down 
the row because gas would cost too much under the Conservative 
government.  Over the years, the Liberals perhaps increased the 
price from 18 cents to 35 cents a gallon, with never an apology, 
the same as with the promises about wage controls that the Liberals 
back then said they would never bring in.  And the GST recently. 
Liberals would never bring in wage controls, Liberals would never 
change the GST.  The Liberals would never renew the helicopter 
contract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know how these folks blow with the wind.  We perhaps have 
a good example in Mr. Trudeau, who was the defender of social 
democracy, of the just society, who never kept a promise either. 
So I am worried. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I oppose the Reform Party motion, and I am in favour of the 
government's plans, but I am very worried about how serious and 
responsible they are, when they say things on April 24 and on 
October 28, there is still no news.  Although I asked, I could find 
no up-to-date document regarding the restriction or the 
government's intentions.  We received the press release on April 
24.  That shows how serious this government is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could wonder where it is headed, apart from operating on a 
day to day, ad hoc basis, without ever, it must be said, keeping 
its promises. We therefore oppose the motion by our Reform Party 
colleague and fervently hope that the government will assume its 
responsibilities and keep its promises.

member and shame on the Reform Party for introducing this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Fair Wages and Hours of Labour Act was initially crafted in 
1935 to protect employees from substandard wages and to create a 
level playing field for contractors bidding on federal contracts. 
The government then stopped posting fair wages in 1987.  On April 
24 of this year the concept of the fair wages schedule was 
restored.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Tomorrow in Edmonton all of the major players in the 
construction industry in that province will be sitting down to 
work out a fair wages schedule for federal construction work for 
that province.  They will look at all of the classifications of 
the workers involved, the fair wage rates for those 
classifications and the geographic areas they apply to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Reform motion is an attack on the taxpayer.  It is an 
attack on fairness and an attack on youth employment 
opportunities. I will tell the House why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The underground construction economy costs taxpayers billions of 
dollars.  This issue of fair wage schedules is an issue of 
quality, of ensuring that the taxpayer gets full value for the 
dollar.  It is an issue of honesty, accountability and fair play. 
What does the hon. member fear about fairness and about ensuring 
quality control over the use of taxpayers' dollars? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion sets out to scuttle a process that is just gearing 
up, a process aimed at establishing a level playing field for all 
contractors.  Without establishing these wages, there would not 
be a level playing field for contractors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion supports the underground economy in the construction 
industry.  This is where fair-minded contractors lose out.  This 
is where Canadians simply wanting a fair and decent wage for 
their work lose out.  This is where the taxpayer loses. With cash 
paid for the job at the bottom of the subcontracting ladder, tax 
revenues are lost, EI contributions are lost and CPP 
contributions go unpaid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The timing of this motion seeks to subvert an important set of 
negotiations occurring this week.  It seeks to subvert similar 
negotiations that will follow in months to come in other 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Keeping federal construction contracts above aboard helps ensure 
taxpayers' dollars are not misused.  It helps to get the best 
value out of every dollar spent.  It helps to support fair-minded 
contractors.  It works toward the health and safety of all 
Canadian construction workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that my colleague the hon. member for Winnipeg Centre 
wants it on record that the NDP will be watching these 
negotiations very closely, not only the ones in Alberta this 
week, but in other provinces over the months to come to ensure 
that fairness and just wages triumph. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion deserves to be soundly defeated.  In fact the 
government should go one step further and ensure that in all 
federally tendered contract documents the following language is 
put in place:  “Contractors must hire qualified journey persons 
and indentured apprentices only”.  This language would go a long 
way to ensure that fair wages are paid, that improved health and 
safety is the practice and not the exception, and that youth are 
supported through apprenticeship programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Department of Public Works and Government Services were 
to ensure that all contracts had this language, it would go a 
long way to supporting good, solid apprenticeships for youth, job 
opportunities for young Canadians, support for those who support 
this invaluable education and skills training for young workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Resuming debate. Does

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B>  Yes, Madam Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are so many places to start I hardly know where to begin. 
My colleague the parliamentary secretary implies that employees 
are now not being paid a fair wage.  She says she would like to 
see that and so would I. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I would put to my hon. colleague that people are being 
paid fair wages.  Evidence of that is in my talk where I say that 
there have been very few complaints made.  Of the complaints 
made, a lot of them have been found to have no basis. There is 
quite conclusive proof that people are being paid fair wages at 
the time.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary further says that there is no 100% 
guarantee that the system they are considering will work.  I 
propose that the system now is working.  Case in point, there 
are .00002% of the cases where it is not working. That is so close 
to 100% I do not see how the parliamentary secretary could possibly 
argue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the matter of overtime, these schedules we are talking about 
would restrict workers to work eight hours a day.  Any time after 
that would have to be overtime. I realize that my friends in the 
more socialist parties would say that is great, that it is a good 
thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However a lot of contracts now are negotiated by the employer 
and the union to allow trades people and labourers to work four 
10-hour days rather than five 8-hour days. The result of that is 
when they are working away from home, as in the construction 
business, most of the time they can work their 40 hours in four 
days rather than five days and have a long weekend every weekend. 
They would have actually more time to spend with their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we come in with wage schedules that say that it cannot be 
done, then we will deny these people time spent with their 
families.  I am positive my colleagues would not want to have 
these people spending more time on the job and less time with 
their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought I had done such a good job of delivering information, 
unbiased of course, to my colleague from the Bloc that he would 
certainly support this.  I was very surprised to see that he 
would say “yes, yes, I think it is a good idea that the federal 
government would interfere with the wage schedules and hours of 
work in my province of Quebec”. I was amazed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought all along that the Bloc among other things, stood for 
more autonomy of the provinces, more devolution of power to the 
provinces, more made in the province solutions rather than top 
down things from the federal government, a paternal type of 
government.  I guess I was wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from the Bloc talked about a vacuum.  There is no 
vacuum.  The area that he claims to be a vacuum is filled by 
people who are getting fair wages.  The case for that again is 
99.888% of the contracts now are being paid fair wages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to close on this note.  I think my time is pretty well 
up.  I think that any time I am admonished by the NDP, my 
constituents leap up and say “yahoo, that guy is on the right 
track”.

the local community can do in the whole area of crime prevention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 35th Parliament I had the pleasure of tabling the justice 
committee report on young offenders.  It was on the final sitting 
day of the last Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One recommendation that came out in the report related to the 
whole issue of crime prevention.  Strongly underlying crime 
prevention, we in the justice committee recognized that it was 
imperative to allow local communities to take ownership in trying 
to deal with some of the difficult problems.  How can we prevent 
crime from occurring?  How can we make a safer and more secure 
community? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly justice at the community level belongs to the whole 
community.  It belongs to the schools, the churches, the 
families, the service clubs, the organizations, the police and 
the courts. However it has to be done in partnership.  For far 
too long we have not supported efforts at the community level to 
combat crime and to build safer communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to tell the House that on April 16 the 20th 
justice dinner is going to be hosted in the Waterloo region. That 
is where members of the community come together, the police, the 
crown, the judiciary, victims groups and service clubs.  They 
come together to try to see how they can better play a role in 
building a safer community. There is no question that the whole 
issue of diversion and prevention is much better than the one of 
apprehension and spending more and more money on reacting to 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased that we have a program of crime prevention 
which will be directed at the local communities where they can 
take ownership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very heartened when I put that question to the Minister of 
Justice because it is of critical importance. The program will 
succeed if the local communities take leadership and the federal 
and provincial governments provide back-up assistance.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
first I would like to commend the hon. member for raising the 
question and most important for the leadership role he has played 
in his own riding to establish a comprehensive and collaborative 
crime prevention approach through partnership in his community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best way to reduce crime in Canada is to prevent it. Crime 
prevention is a priority for this government, for the minister 
and indeed for all Canadians.  A recent poll stated that over 80% 
of Canadians consider that the government has an important role 
to play in crime prevention. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that crime prevention starts with understanding the 
various problems faced by the different communities, helping them 
identify their needs and involving them in finding solutions. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike our friends on the right and some of the opposition 
members I might point out we believe that to reduce crime we must 
support measures that alleviate the underlying risk factors that 
contribute to criminal behaviour, factors such as poverty and 
unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As promised in the Speech from the Throne, the government is 
developing a new initiative that builds on the work of the 
National Crime Prevention Council which this government 
established. This initiative will target community level 
prevention projects, as the hon. member stated, getting money 
into the hands of those who know what the problems are and how to 
best deal with them. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The program will obtain resources for activities based in the 
communities or initiated by them. To help communities develop 
programs, we will provide them with material resources and 
promote crime prevention measures.  We will also ensure they get 
the training they need and we will support innovative projects.

other orders of government, the private sector and other partners

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
the health crisis in the downtown east side community of 
Vancouver continues.  This community is facing an epidemic 
characterized by the highest incidence of HIV infection of 
intravenous drug users in the western world.  It is reported that 
there is a 50% infection rate of an estimated 6,000-plus 
intravenous drug users who frequent the area and now this crisis 
is spreading to other areas as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As reported today, HIV infected drug users are showing up in 
larger numbers in the Kamloops and Kootenay regions.  On 
September 25 the Vancouver and Richmond regional health board 
declared a public health emergency because of this issue.  On 
October 23 the board brought forward an action plan to respond to 
this crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a desperate need for leadership from all levels of 
government to combat this health crisis, to save lives, to 
protect the community and to reduce harm associated with 
obtaining drugs on the street.  So far the province of British 
Columbia, the regional health board and even the municipal 
government have responded, but not the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question being increasingly asked is where is the Minister 
of Health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since this summer I have raised this issue many times.  I wrote 
to the minister in July, in September and in October not only to 
make the minister aware of the extent of this health emergency 
and its devastating impact on people and the community of 
Vancouver East but also to request a meeting so this issue could 
be discussed further.  There has been no response and no action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the minister ignoring the national action plan on HIV, 
AIDS and injection drug use published in May and produced by the 
national task force?  Why is the minister not participating with 
other interested parties across the country in the 10th annual 
B.C. conference on AIDS taking place in Vancouver this very week? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that conference the chair of the national task force, Dr. 
Hankins, charged yesterday that politicians are afraid to take 
the lead on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to the political will shown by the federal 
government, I would agree with her on that assessment.  In the 
Vancouver <I>Sun</I> recently the Minister of Health was quoted as 
saying that the HIV injection drug crisis in Vancouver East is a 
justice issue, but when the Minister of Health was the justice 
minister in 1995 he told the then minister of health of British 
Columbia, when discussing the Cain report, that this was a health 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to stop passing the buck because lives hang in the 
balance.  How many more people have to die before this government 
takes action?  When will the federal Minister of Health show 
leadership as called for in the national task force report and 
make it clear that he will acknowledge this epidemic as the 
health crisis it is and take action? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister does not, in ten years can we expect a royal 
commission posing the same questions that the Krever commission 
has already posed such as why when we had the chance to act did 
the government do nothing, or why did lives have to be lost 
because the political will was lacking? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on the minister to act now or he may find himself the 
first witness called to task if his inaction and the government's 
inaction result in even more lives lost and devastated 
communities. 
<P><A NAME="LINK247"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the hon. member is quite right 
to place her concern where it is.  Unfortunately her assessment 
of what the minister and the department have been doing is 
completely off base. 
Health Canada is acutely aware of the situation in British 
Columbia and recognizes the seriousness of the issue from both 
regional and national perspectives.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Vancouver's HIV epidemic among injection drug users is an 
emergency health crisis.  It is a multifaceted health crisis that 
brings into play other illnesses such as hepatitis C, 
tuberculosis, alcohol and drug addiction and mental health as 
well as other factors like poverty, housing, transportation and 
access to services. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada will work in close co-operation with the Minister of 
Health of British Columbia and with the Minister of Child and Family 
Welfare Minister of that province, and also with other federal 
departments that are in continuous contact with the Vancouver—Richmond 
Health Council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada is presently working on the creation of an 
interinstitutional task force including federal departments and various 
regional and national organizations, in order to implement measures to 
deal with the health crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These groups will develop and implement a federal plan identifying 
the complete range of health determinants that are responsible for this 
crisis. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on discussions with provincial and local governments the 
federal response could include a range of activities such as 
developing new and innovative methods for delivering services and 
programs for populations at risk.  I include among them 
aboriginal peoples, women, people with mental illnesses and 
youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It could include activities to broaden community support for HIV 
intervention and care issues including interest in and compassion 
for injection drug users and, finally, improving the 
co-ordination of services in areas such as addictions, mental 
health, social services, housing and medical care.
