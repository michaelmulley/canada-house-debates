	<B>Mr. Janko Peri</B>G <B>(Cambridge, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 1997 it is 
expected that more than 500 Canadians will die as a result of fires.
<P>
	Fire damage related costs total over $10 billion annually. Studies 
show that public fire safety education not only saves lives but 
reduces the risk of fire.
<P>
	Today I would like to congratulate the initiatives of the 
Kitchener-Waterloo Civitan Club along with the Cambridge, 
Kitchener and Waterloo fire departments to invest in a first class 
public fire safety education facility for the region.
<P>
	The construction of the Children's Safety Village Fire Education 
Centre in Cambridge will help children and adults learn ways of 
preventing fires and protecting themselves from fires.
<P>
	On behalf of my constituents, I applaud the civic initiative taken 
by the Civitan Club for its efforts to achieve this worthwhile goal 
and the ongoing dedication of our local firefighters.

	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Bloc 
Quebecois is pleased to add its voice to all those who have 
recognized Josée Bournival for the accomplished athlete that she 
is. Josée Bournival won the  bronze medal in both slalom and giant 
slalom at the Special Olympics World Winter Games held in 
Toronto from February 1 to February 8.
<P>
	The purpose of the Special Olympics is to give persons with 
mental disabilities opportunities to participate in sports. In Quebec, 
some 1,000 persons with perceptual disabilities are being trained 
on a regular basis.
<P>
	Josée Bournival is an all-around athlete. Josée, aged 21, excels at 
swimming and athletics. Her ranking and winnings at the 1996 
National Winter Games in Calgary earned her a spot on the team at 
the recent World Winter Games. We take this opportunity to 
congratulate the 82 athletes who participated in these games and 
salute the trainers for their work, generosity and dedication.
<P>
	Bravo, Josée. Congratulations on your medals and your 
achievements.

	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, amid the 
uproar of the heritage minister's many flip-flops on CBC radio 
funding along with the deserved hoots of laughter when she recited 
the Liberal red book promise of stable multiyear funding for the 
CBC, a few points have been under reported.
<P>
	First the heritage minister is the person who hacked, slashed and 
gouged $414 million from the CBC funding in the first place. 
Giving back $10 million shows incompetence of immense 
magnitude. It is not only too little too late, but it exhibits 
management by crisis. She does not have a clue what she is doing. 
Her chewing gum and baling wire approach to the CBC is crushing 
that institution.
<P>
	The Reform Party on the other hand has a rational plan for the 
CBC to continue funding for CBC radio French and English 
services, Newsworld, RDI and Radio-Canada International and will 
privatize television and stereo.
<P>
	Second, former CBC president Manera has said the heritage 
minister's $10 million intrusion by cabinet direction ``amounts to a 
vote of non-confidence in the CBC directors; it has turned them 
into eunuchs''. I agree.

	<B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, over the last decade Conservative and Liberal 
governments and the leaders of our largest corporations have 
supported a series of policy initiatives that they said would create 
jobs.
<P>
	They said the tax burden had to be shifted away from 
corporations and on to individuals. They demanded free trade and 
NAFTA. They called for the GST. Deregulation. Privatization. Cuts 
to social programs. That was all part of a package. Those changes 
have been made, the agenda is in place, but the jobs simply have 
not arrived.
<P>
	Youth unemployment in Canada stands at around 20 per cent. 
Since 1976 the number of youths with full time jobs in Canada has 
fallen by one million. This is a betrayal of our youth and Canada's 
future. Without major changes to the way the government is 
managing the economy, this betrayal will continue.
<P>
	The youth employment strategy announced today is a band-aid 
solution and shows how out of touch this government is. As part of 
its strategy the government will make available to young 
Canadians virtual one stop shopping for information. Well if we do 
not see a drastic change in government policies, young Canadians 
will continue to look for virtual jobs. They might even be making 
virtual deposits into their virtual bank accounts.

	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
delighted to receive the October 16, 1996 joint statement on fetal 
alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol effects released by the Minister 
of Health and the Canadian Paediatric Society.
<P>
	FAS has widely been recognized in Canada as one of the leading 
causes of birth defects and developmental delay in children caused 
by alcohol consumption during pregnancy. The statement 
acknowledges that even casual use of alcohol during the early 
weeks of pregnancy may adversely affect the health and well-being 
of the child to be. Accordingly the joint statement recommends: 
``The prudent choice for women who are or may become pregnant 
is to abstain from alcohol''.
<P>
	That caution is an important one. I hope that Health Canada will 
quickly implement a strategy to educate all Canadians on the threat 
that alcohol poses to the unborn child.

occurring in 22 locations across Canada.
<P>
	I have encouraged entrepreneurs in 
Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington to attend the event

coalitions to share information about federal programs and

stimulate awareness and growth for new business endeavours in 
our area.

in Canada and throughout the world, last weekend marked the end 
of the holy month of Ramadan, a month of fasting in order to gain 
self-restraint and foster inner strength and fulfilment with God.
<P>
	The end of Ramadan is celebrated with Eid-Ul-Fitr, one of the 
most joyous occasions in the Muslim calendar. Over one billion 
Muslims worldwide, including nearly 500,000 here in Canada, use 
Eid-Ul-Fitr to give prayers of thanks, celebrate with friends and 
family, and rejoice in the love of God and of course Islam.
<P>
	On behalf of this House, I extend our warmest best wishes to the 
Canadians of Islamic faith on the conclusion of Ramadan and on 
the occasion of Eid-Ul-Fitr.

	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, for months now, the official opposition has been making 
very loud noises about the fact that the method used to determine 
claimants' benefits acts as an incentive for workers to join the 
underground economy.
<P>
	Workers' rights groups reached the same conclusion and made 
this very clear in a demonstration in opposition to the employment 
insurance reform, which drew 5,000 people in Rivière-du-Loup.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development is finally 
smelling the coffee. He has just noticed one of his reform's many

<P>
	Perhaps he could ask the Standing Committee on Human 
Resources Development to look immediately into all the blaring 
inequities resulting from his reform.
<P>

Yet, the quality of life of seasonal workers was at stake then and

	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, health care in 
this country and specifically in my province of New Brunswick has 
seen major cutbacks in funding from the federal government. This 
Liberal government cut the Canada health and social transfer by 
$2.5 billion last year and is scheduled to cut $4.5 billion this year.
<P>
	What has happened in the province of New Brunswick? Premier 
McKenna has now told our seniors that if they have to go into a 
nursing home and they own their home, he is going to take their 
home and all of their assets and he is going to sell them to cover the 
cost of putting them in a nursing home. They have lost their 
dignity.
<P>
	Enough is enough. The cuts have gone too far. The measure of a 
country is in the treatment it extends to its vulnerable citizens: the 
young, the old, the sick and the poor. On all of these accounts this 
Liberal government has failed.

local communities.
<P>
	The Sales and Marketing Resource Network, a volunteer based 
organization, was founded by a group of local business people in 
my riding. It assists young entrepreneurs and new small businesses 
in developing effective marketing strategies.
<P>
	Because of the network's mentorship program, many businesses 
have experienced renewed sales growth. In one example a local 
equipment dealer experienced an increase in sales from $1 million 
to $1.8 million. They attribute this growth directly to mentorship.
<P>
	It is encouraging to note that so many successful business people 
are prepared to volunteer as mentors for younger and less 
experienced entrepreneurs. Building upon this mentorship model 
and pooling expertise and ideas will ensure our future 
competitiveness.

since 1986, to the tune of 75 to 100 million dollars per year.

Quebec taxpayers had to pay when calculating the provincial tax

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, everyone is worried at the turn of events regarding the 
Government of Quebec's request for a constitutional amendment to 
modify its school boards. The Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs has taken us all a bit by surprise with his agitation, which is 
as sudden as it is unexplained.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister think that the present consensus of 
political stakeholders in Quebec is enough to proceed as he should 
or does he believe, as his Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
does, that a consensus is valid only if it includes lobby groups like 
Alliance Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Government of Quebec indicated that it wished to 
propose a constitutional amendment and we said that we were 
going to examine the possibility of helping it as much as possible.
<P>
	Obviously, the decision must first be taken in Quebec, and many 
groups will state their views. The Quebec minister told his federal 
counterpart that he wished to act on the basis of a consensus. So we 
are going to see how the debate unfolds in Quebec. When there is a 
consensus, fine, but I know that many stakeholders, both among 
religious groups and among linguistic groups, will make their 
views known to the National Assembly when the debate takes 
place.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like the Prime Minister to be a bit clearer. Can he 
tell us the kind of consensus the federal government feels is 
necessary in order for it to respond to Quebec's request?
<P>
	Yesterday, the minister talked about Alliance Quebec; the Prime 
Minister is talking about various kinds of groups. How extensive 
does this consensus have to be? And is the consensus of Quebec's 
elected representatives, of the political parties sitting in the 
National Assembly, not enough for the Prime Minister?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have just said that we will see how the debate unfolds in 
Quebec's National Assembly. I hope that those who have an 
interest in this question will make their views known. Afterwards, 
we will assess the situation.
<P>
	We are not about to reply to a hypothetical question. We are 
waiting to see what resolution the National Assembly will pass and 
the nature of the debate surrounding this issue. The question is 
premature and hypothetical at this time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I am sorry, but the question is not hypothetical; we are 
talking about a situation that has deteriorated because of the 
inappropriate, unexpected and absolutely incomprehensible 
intervention of the ineffable federal Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs. It is not hypothetical. He has stirred up discord in this 
affair, and that is a fact.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	By creating the impasse that may prevent the creation of 
linguistic school boards in Quebec, was the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs not himself responsible for the 
constitutional dead end in which we will again find ourselves?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are waiting to see what the National Assembly's 
resolution will be, the nature of the debate, and then we will review 
the situation. That was how we proceeded when the government 
received the Government of Newfoundland's request.
<P>
	On that occasion, we analyzed all the circumstances, and then 
the House made its decision. The same approach will be used to try 
to find a solution to this problem.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	On September 5, 1996 the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration made a statement to <I>La Presse</I> that Ottawa will not 
wait for Quebecers to reach unanimity on amending section 93 of 
the Canadian Constitution.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister not acknowledge that the approach of 
his colleague, the former Quebec Minister of Education, is far 
more positive and would make it possible to settle the matter, 
unlike the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs' proposal, which 
is aimed only at stirring up division and adding fuel to the fire?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there is no contradiction here. The Minister of Citizenship 
and Immigration has said that unanimity was not required. As for 
the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, he says that it will 
require a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8010"> 8010 </A></B>
<P>
consensus. A consensus is not unanimity. So both ministers have 
said the same thing.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I really wonder why the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs will not merely respond to what the Government of Quebec 
is asking of him.
<P>
	Why will he not agree to settle the problem? Why does the 
minister want to join forces with Alliance Québec and stir up strife 
and discord between the two communities in Quebec? What is he 
really after?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to add something in reference to 
yesterday. We know there is probably a consensus in Quebec at this 
time for language based school boards. The issue is to find a way to 
proceed that will ensure that all components of Quebec society can 
do this in confidence.
<P>
	Is the Government of Quebec's proposal, the one that is on the 
table, the way to go? The Government of Canada has no intention 
of commenting on proposals advanced by this or that group, and is 
not granting a veto to any group whatsoever.
<P>
	The Government of Canada is simply saying that, if the 
Government of Quebec builds a consensus on its proposal, it is 
highly probable that the Parliament of Canada will be in a position 
to proceed promptly with modernization of the Quebec school 
system.

that a former Canadian prime minister was accusing a former 
deputy minister of defence of participating in a cover-up of a 
murder in Somalia.
<P>
	The Prime Minister said that the Somalia commission had the 
time and the freedom to investigate these charges. But today Mr. 
Justice Létourneau, the head of the Somalia commission, had this 
to say: ``To suggest, as has been done, that we have ample time to 
investigate another high level cover-up and at the same time 
properly complete our current endeavours is both misleading and 
unfair''.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister acknowledge that what he said to the 
House yesterday about the freedom and the ability of the Somalia 
inquiry to investigate these charges was misleading and unfair?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> No, Mr. 
Speaker, what I said is that this inquiry has been going on for more 
than two years. There were three extensions. It had the time to call 
all the witnesses it wanted. It still has a month and a half to call the 
witnesses it wants and it is up to the inquiry to decide.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	We did not intervene. We gave it a clear mandate a long time 
ago. It accepted that mandate with a time limit. We have given it 
three extensions. The minister of defence gave very good reasons 
in asking it to complete its work.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister says the government did not intervene. 
The head of the Somalia inquiry also said clearly this morning that 
the government had interfered with the conduct of an independent 
public inquiry. What he could not say was whether the government 
had interfered for political reasons.
<P>
	I ask the Prime Minister directly did his government interfere 
with the Somalia inquiry for political reasons. Is there a political 
reason why the Prime Minister does not want the inquiry to get to 
the bottom of a high level cover-up in the Somalia affair?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there was clearly no political intervention by the 
government. We have let the commission operate for more than 
two years. The minister of defence gave some very good reasons 
more than a month ago to terminate the inquiry by the end of June, 
following the advice of the leader of the third party who was 
inquiring and asking the government to close it as quickly as 
possible so there would not be anything not judged by the 
commission before the election.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, that answer is not good enough for Canadians. Justice 
Létourneau said this morning that the government's decision has 
precluded the possibility of effectively investigating any cover-up 
at the senior level. He said the government understood clearly that 
this would be the impact of its decision to terminate the inquiry 
because they had informed the privy council of this implication 
before the decision was taken.
<P>
	What political reason did the government have for terminating 
this independent inquiry when it was specifically forewarned that 
the effect would be to prevent effective investigation of the 
cover-up at the top?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. leader 
of the Reform Party certainly understood this process a lot better in 
September of last year than he does now.
<P>
	I think it is fair to say that Canadians who have observed the 
commission now doing its work since March 1995 understand very 
well what has taken place there and understand very well what has 
happened in Somalia.
<P>
	If the hon. leader of the Reform Party really wants to know what 
motivated the government to provide a third  extension to the 
commissioners to conclude their work by June 30 it is very simple. 
It is a motivation that I hoped would have been shared by the leader 
of the Reform Party. I know it is shared by some of the members of 
his party who understand that it was time to get on with doing the 
<P>
<HR>

work that is required to allow the Canadian forces to do the work 
they are doing today, the work they have honourably done for a

them to do on behalf of Canada in the future.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister is taking a big risk by leaving the hon. 
member for Saint-Laurent-Cartierville in his position as Minister 
of Intergovernmental Affairs. It is like appointing a pyromaniac 
head of the fire brigade: he fans the flames.
<P>
	Today, the Prime Minister is trying to play down the 
inflammatory statements made by his Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs. The government tells us: ``We will wait 
and see what Quebec wants''. Well, Quebec has wanted to settle 
this matter for the past 20 years. There was a consensus. All 
political parties in Quebec agreed.
<P>
	Did the Prime Minister change his tune to avoid embarrassing 
his Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, who created the problem 
in the first place with his inflammatory statements?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I said it before and I say it again: we will wait until we 
have the wording of the resolution to be tabled in the National 
Assembly by the Government of Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	We will listen to the debate that I hope will take place in the 
National Assembly, and also to the people who make 
representations, and we will inform you accordingly. That is 
exactly what we did in the case of Newfoundland, and we will do 
the same in the case of Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs said that he 
rejected the idea of swapping the constitutional amendment for 
something else and that there would be no swap, that he failed to 
see how the government could win points by acting like a used car 
salesman and that it would lose votes in the process.
<P>
	Was the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs not acting like a 
used car salesman himself when he gave Alliance Quebec the 
impression that its agreement was necessary to get the 
constitutional amendment, thus giving it the clout it did not even 
know it had?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have said this several times but I will say it again, 
because the Leader of the Official Opposition may be somewhat 
hard of hearing. As I said time and again, I did not give a veto to 
any organization whatsoever.
<P>
	The question that must be asked is this: Is the official opposition 
saying that even if Quebec's anglophone community, which has 
more than one voice, had strong reservations about the 
government's proposal, it would be necessary to proceed 
regardless? That is a question the opposition should answer.
<P>
	I have a second question for the opposition, and I will close on 
this: Does the opposition consider the anglophone community as a 
pawn, as incapable of making up its own mind? Does it really 
believe the anglophone community would let itself be guided by 
the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, that it cannot make up 
its own mind?

	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it has finally been 
revealed that the government knew, prior to shutting down the 
inquiry, that Fowler, Anderson and Campbell could not be called to 
testify.
<P>
	According to the head of the inquiry, the government's 
suggestions that Fowler and gang could testify have been 
erroneous, unfair, not realistic, impossible and misleading.
<P>
	Would the Prime Minister agree with Commissioner Desbarats 
that his government, through its political interference, is trying to 
make the inquiry part of the Somalia cover-up?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have been 
extremely careful since coming to this responsibility not to 
comment on the agenda of the commission.
<P>
	Let me say that immediately upon becoming Minister of 
National Defence I said at that point that I hoped and we expected 
the commission would report by March 31, as its mandate called 
for. That should not have come as a surprise to anyone.
<P>
	Subsequent to that, based on a request by the commission, the 
government for the third time extended the hearing period and has 
asked it to report by the end of June. There is no question that if the 
commissioners decided they were not going to call certain 
witnesses then obviously they could not appear to testify.
<P>
	The decision always rested, since March 15, 1995, with respect 
to who would be called and what would be done with the 
commissioners and not the government. They chose the road they 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8012"> 8012 </A></B>
<P>
did and they were completely at liberty to do that. However, the 
government did make the decision that it was in the best interest of 
the Canadian forces in turning the corner on what we have to do to 
ask the commissioners, after three extensions, to report by June 30.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, that sounds like 
more question avoidance. The Prime Minister and the former 
defence minister said we would get to the bottom of this. The 
minister said he would not get involved. He certainly got involved 
by shutting it down.
<P>
	The inquiry chairmen say that the government used them to 
solve its political problems. They say that the government 
precluded the inquiry from investigating a high level cover-up. 
This is unprecedented and shameful political interference.
<P>
<B>(1435)</B>
<P>
	My question, as it was yesterday, is what is the Prime Minister 
trying to hide.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, no one is trying 
to hide anything.
<P>
	Is the hon. member and his party suggesting that when an inquiry 
is begun in this country it should run until such time as all the 
commissioners, all the parties thereto and all the lawyers involved 
in the procedure are satisfied that every witness has been heard, 
that every document has been recovered and that every question 
has been answered?
<P>
	If that is the position of the hon. member and his party, that from 
here on in this country when an inquiry begins it is appropriate to 
ask for extensions and it is not interference when we say yes but it 
is when we say no, then the hon. member and his party should go 
on record and say just that.

<P>
	On June 20, 1996, the Minister of Justice told the Senate 
committee on legal and constitutional affairs that the bilateral 
amendment of term 17 of the Terms of Union of Newfoundland 
with Canada did not apply as clearly in the case of section 93 of the 
Constitution Act, 1867.
<P>
	Would the Minister of Justice, the protector of Canada's 
Constitution, confirm the remarks of his colleague, the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, and that section 93 may be amended 
bilaterally by the Quebec and federal governments according to the 
proposal Quebec made last Friday?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, under section 43 of the amending formula of the 
Constitution Act, 1982, we can confirm without hesitation.

<P>
	Given what he said yesterday in the scrum, will the Minister of 
Justice confirm his objection to anglophone Quebecers obtaining

	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the chairman of the Somalia inquiry has accused both the Prime 
Minister and the defence minister of political interference with the 
inquiry, interference unprecedented in Canadian history.
<P>
	Before the decision was even made, the chairman had advised 
the privy council that such interference would cause a whitewash, 
yet the Prime Minister proceeded to shut down the inquiry anyway.
<P>
	My question is to the Prime Minister. Why did the Prime 
Minister choose a whitewash over the truth by closing down the 
inquiry? Are his interests in the Canadian forces or are they strictly 
political?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and

am astounded by the tone of the question from my hon. friend.

distinguished career in the Canadian forces. Surely if he is staying 
in touch with his colleagues who are still serving in the Canadian

<HR>

<P>
	The one thing I will say in response to my hon. friend's question 
is that we have not interfered nor do we have any intention of 
interfering in the process that involves the Somalia inquiry.
<P>
	I have as much respect for the judicial process and I am sure the 
hon. chairman of the Somalia inquiry has for the political process 
and the need to keep the two very separate all the time.
<P>
<B>(1440 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
served for 36 years in the armed forces and I was proud of that. 
Incidents that have happened since Somalia have caused me to 
question whether I can still be proud of it. I wonder if the minister 
realizes the impact of the inquiry.
<P>
	The Prime Minister, the defence minister and the justice minister 
all admit to being lawyers, but now their appointed lawyer, Justice 
Létourneau, has accused them of political interference in the 
process of the Somalia inquiry. He said that in future judges may 
have to think about whether they will accept serving on an inquiry 
because of political interference.
<P>
	Has it been worth it: a cover-up, a whitewash? Is it worth 
sacrificing judicial independence for selfish political gain?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member has 
touched on a question that is of vital importance, as I indicated in 
an earlier response this afternoon.
<P>
	If judges or other Canadians called on to participate in this form 
of inquiry make it a pre-condition that once the inquiry begins they 
be allowed to continue as long as they wish to ensure that 
everybody is heard, that every question is addressed and that every 
document is examined, then that is a legitimate question.
<P>
	We need to know from my hon. friend whether the commission 
or anyone else in this place, or anyone else who is observing this 
scene, agrees with that kind of a prospect, that once a process 
called a commission of inquiry has begun that not only is it a 
whitewash, it is a carte blanche.

	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Time and time again, the Prime Minister has told this House that 
the Somalia commission can hear any witness it wants concerning 
the cover-up in the Somalia affair, although Justice Létourneau said 
this morning that the government had in fact been advised that 
imposing a June 30 deadline would prevent the commission from  
hearing a number of key witnesses, including Ms. Campbell.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister maintain that it is business as usual 
for the Somalia commission, when, this morning, Justice 
Létourneau described the Prime Minister's statements as 
``misleading and unjust''?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the chairman of 
the Somalia commission of inquiry made a statement this morning. 
Thus far, I have refrained from commenting on the evidence heard 
by the commission, and I am not about to comment on remarks 
made by the judge who has judicial authority over the whole 
process.
<P>
	I think it is very important, in such matters, to always try to 
strike a balance between the role of the players in a judicial inquiry 
and the role of the government. Not only is it a custom and a 
tradition but it is also a Canadian reality that I intend to respect.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this role 
is viewed by the public as government interference in a 
commission trying to shed light on the matter.
<P>
	I must point out that, last April, the former Minister of National 
Defence announced that the worst was still to come in the Somalia 
affair. Clearly, this government knows things it does not want the 
commission and the public to know.
<P>
	Is the deadline imposed on the commission by the government 
not designed to ensure that the public will never know what the 
worst is?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am convinced 
that the Canadians who have been following the commission's 
proceedings realize full well that, the incidents in Somalia that 
resulted in the death of a number of Somali are basically 
unacceptable to the people of Canada.
<P>
	What is of interest to me in the hon. member's question is 
whether he thinks that, while the commission has already heard in 
excess of 100 witnesses, we really must comment on the witnesses 
who were invited to testify? Or that we should have set the 
commission's schedule?
<P>
	The hon. member is no doubt aware of the fact that, originally, 
hearings were scheduled to conclude by the end of December 1995. 
The government has agreed to extend the commission's mandate 
three times already. And, the last time, it was extended to the end of 
June.
<P>
<B>(1445)</B>
<P>
	If the hon. member and his party believe that commissions of

should propose this to the Canadian public and see how it reacts.

here is a summary of this case to date. There was a murder. There 
was a cover-up of that murder. The Prime Minister and the Minister

whitewash by ensuring that the Somalia inquiry cannot complete 
its original mandate.

justice be done by letting the Somalia inquiry finish the mandate it

	I would like to see him come outside and accuse me of 
obstructing justice. I would like to see him do that. He is very free

time that shutting down the inquiry would result in a cover-up and a 
whitewash. What more does he want to know? There is a murder

Speaker, in their responses today neither the Prime Minister nor the 
defence minister has acknowledged the seriousness of the charges 
made against the government by the Somalia inquiry 
commissioners, a commission that they themselves set up: charges 
of political interference with an independent tribunal, charges of 
making misleading and unfair statements on the work of the 
tribunal, and charges of contributing to a whitewash.
<P>
	Has the government no response to these serious charges other 
than to ignore them?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a great 
respect for legal procedures. I have great respect for the judiciary. I 
have been, as the hon. member well knows, very meticulous in 
never commenting on how the commission conducts its business, 
what witnesses  it calls or what testimony is presented by witnesses 
before that commission.
<P>
	I respect the tradition that governments have responsibilities and 
commissions of inquiry and commissioners who are members have 
their responsibilities.
<P>
<B>(1455 )</B>
<P>
	I have no intention on behalf of the government of responding to 
the comments that were made this morning by the commissioners. I 
fully understand they can be frustrated and concerned about the 
way they are going to have to do their work over the next several 
months.
<P>
	I think I can say on behalf of many Canadians, both inside and 
outside the military, that some people may have had some concerns 
about the way the commission has gone about its business. I am not 
one of them who is going to comment on it today.
<P>
	I hope the hon. member will understand that at the end of the day 
we can do all the squirming and twisting about what he meant in 
September, he can do all the kinds of exercises that he and his 
colleagues are going through here today, but he had better decide at

or in the future of the Canadian forces. Canadians know where we 
stand on that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr.

choosing to ignore the charges made by the commissioners against

making misleading statements and charges of participating in a 
whitewash.
<P>
	That being the case, how can the public possibly believe that the

when it is already ignoring what the commission is saying about 
interference, deception and cover-up?

	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member changes his approach to this whole question as often as he 
changes his hairdo. The whole problem is whether or not he 
understands what is going on.
<P>
	If the hon. member is asking us to get into a public debate with 
commissioners conducting a quasi-judicial inquiry, what would he 
then say about what we were doing? Would he say that it was 
political interference or does he understand the concept of 
separation between what the judicial process is about and what 
government is about?

	<B>Ms. Colleen Beaumier (Brampton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	According to a recent <I>Globe and Mail</I> article, the Indian 
government alleges that many Canadian based organizations are 
funding militants in Punjab. However, the RCMP indicates that this 
is not the case.
<P>
	Could the minister comment on these allegations by the Indian 
government and explain to the Sikh community why he is setting 
up a working group on terrorism with the Government of India?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, over the last several months we have seen the tragic 
consequences of terrorist activities around the world. One way of 
dealing with terrorism is to increase the co-operation between 
Canada and a number of countries to ensure that we share 
information and work together.
<P>
	Last summer at the meetings in Paris on terrorism we agreed that 
we would undertake to enhance these kinds of relationships.
<P>
	The working group between Canada and India is simply to 
improve our co-operation. In no way is it tied to any one specific 
group. In no way is it tied to particularly the Sikh community, 
which we see as making an enormously valuable contribution in 
this country. It is so valuable that this January we opened an office 
in the Punjab so we could take advantage of the enormous 
opportunities for trade and investment in that area between the Sikh 
community in Canada and their counterparts in India.
<P>
	It really is an opportunity for us to expand and develop a new 
relationship where the Sikh community can make an enormous 
contribution to Canada as a result.

	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	He will know that the red book indicated that jobs were going to 
be his number one priority. In October 1993, 1.5 million Canadians 
were out of work and today 1.5 million Canadians are out of work.
<P>
	He will also be aware that a number of organizations today 
presented an alternative budget with specific recommendations on 
job creation.
<P>
	Would the Prime Minister consider carefully these 
recommendations on how to create jobs in the next number of 
months before tabling the next budget?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we want to create more jobs and any good ideas to that 
effect will be considered by the Minister of Finance, who will 
make, as he has made in the past, job creation a number one 
priority.
<P>
	We are disappointed that unemployment is still too high. 
However, the reality is that in the last three years and four months 
more than 700,000 new jobs have been created in Canada. We wish 
it would have been more than that. All the private forecasters 
predict that next year is going to be a very good year in terms of 
growth and job creation. We will have job creation as the number 
one priority and results in 1997.
<P>
<B>(1500)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, during question period I ruled a 
question out of order. I want you to know why I ruled it out of order 
because I am going to take it one step further.
<P>
	The hon. member for Fraser Valley East said that the minister is 
involved in a cover-up. I judge that question to be out of order. 
More than that, an accusation like that in my view cannot be 
allowed to stand. I would appeal to the hon. member for Fraser 
Valley East to withdraw those comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
was repeating, I thought, the words-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I remind all hon. members that we cannot use 
other people's words to say in this House what we ourselves cannot 
say. It is for that reason that I judge the question to be out of order 
and it is for that reason that I put the question directly to the 
member for Fraser Valley East. I ask him to withdraw those words 
which I mentioned earlier.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will reluctantly withdraw.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> There are no conditions to a withdrawal. I appeal 
to the hon. member for Fraser Valley East, a respected 
parliamentarian. I simply put the question. Will the hon. member 
withdraw, yes or no?

debate. Many times there are many pressures on us to do one thing 
or another.
<P>
	I am going to appeal to an officer of the House who knows full 
well the extent of whatever his decision will be on all members. 
The hon. whip of the Reform Party is, as I said before, a respected 
member. This is no longer between the hon. whip, whom I do 
<P>

<P>
respect a great deal, or anybody else in this House. It is for the 
Speaker of this House, to whom you have conferred this authority, 
to judge that which is acceptable and unacceptable in this House.
<P>
	In view of that, I ask the hon. member to please reconsider. I ask 
him again if he will simply withdraw the statements that he made 
which I, as your spokesperson in this House, have judged to be 
unparliamentary.
<P>
	My colleague, I address myself to you directly. I ask you to 
withdraw those statements made in question period which I ruled to 
be unparliamentary and unacceptable.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do respect the Chair and I mean no 
disrespect but I did try to reluctantly withdraw. You would not 
accept that. I will not withdraw further.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It is more with sadness than anything else that I, 
as your Speaker, name Mr. Strahl. It is with regret that I have to 
name you for disregarding the authority of the Chair.
<P>
	Pursuant to the authority granted to me by Standing Order 11, I 
order you to withdraw from the House for the remainder of this 
day's sitting.

incident which has just occurred. If so, I will not hear your point of 
order. Is it on that incident?

matter.

point of order.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Mr. Speaker, would it be possible to ask you 
something about what has just happened, in order to prevent any 
recurrence? May I ask you a question?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Dear colleague, what happened here in the House 
is quite simply that there was a situation in which language was 
used that I judged to be unparliamentary.
<P>
	I can tell you that if I judge something to be unparliamentary 
today, it is with respect to this particular case. A case that arises a 
month from now will not necessarily be the same.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Mr. Speaker, my point concerns not the substance 
of the question but the procedure.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Dear colleague, if you wish to discuss the 
procedure with me, I invite you to do so in my office later. I will 
then be available to talk about the procedure.

	We have a few recommendations which I would like to briefly

must advise the government to be careful about its marketing of R

also warn the government that this policy has not worked in favour 
of Quebec on the tokamak project. We find the coast-to-coast 
aspect extremely alarming.

	The petitioners point out that corporate contributions to the 
public revenues of Canada are already the lowest among the seven 
major economies of the world. Whereas the corporations' share of 
that has fallen to less than 10 per cent, the share borne by 
individuals has skyrocketed. The petitioners also draw to our 
attention a number of problems with the existing tax system, 
including the GST.

particular, will there be an ongoing role for the Canadian Centre on Substance 
Abuse?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> The 
enforcement component of the strategy has been renewed. Health 
Canada will continue to provide leadership and undertake national 
co-ordination on substance abuse issues under the population 
health approach, working collaboratively with provincial agencies, 
non-governmental organizations, private sector, and multilateral 
organizations. Based on learnings and best practices developed 
during the second phase of Canada's drug strategy, Health Canada 
will focus its prevention efforts on the needs of youth, seniors and 
medication use, training needs of health professionals, 
transmission of HIV and overdose deaths among injection drug 
users, and impaired driving.
<P>
	Recognizing the important contribution of the Canadian Centre 
on Substance Abuse, Health Canada will provide a grant of $500K

Canada.

problem of family violence. Health Canada's goal is to reduce the 
incidence of family violence. The department's approach includes 
both short and long-term elements: Health Canada will continue to 
operate the National Clearinghouse on Family Violence, to offer 
training and education to frontline workers, to enhance the security 
of emergency shelters and to improve the legislative framework 
related to situations of family violence. At the same time, under the 
population health approach, Health Canada will focus on 
preventing family violence in the long term by expanding its 
understanding of the conditions that lead to violence or that 
increase the risks of violence and by acting on that knowledge.

was supposed to speak, but he was not recognized.
<P>
	I wish someone would explain what happened. According to 
procedure, a Liberal was scheduled to speak before our member, 
and our member was in his place-you saw him come in and go to 
his seat-but he was not recognized.
<P>
	I would ask the Chair to let us go back and resume debate on Bill 
C-60.

Parliament at third reading for a member of the government to 
speak first and then be followed by a member of the opposition.
<P>
	The Liberals decided not to present a speaker. I was on my way 
to hear the speech by the Liberal member. The spirit of the rules 
must be followed, but rules should not interpreted to the letter, 
which would prevent us from speaking on this bill, for which we 
have moved some 100 amendments and have made a number of 
suggestions and which will have significant financial impact.

	The House and the Liberal majority would be acting in bad faith 
if they failed to recognize the opposition member due to speak on 
the subject.

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> The Chair has heard the 
arguments and I thank members on all sides for their assistance on 
this matter but I think the answer is fairly clear.
<P>
	A quorum call was in progress and hon. members chose to come 
to the House or not while the bells were ringing. The bells were 
rung for the purpose of bringing members to the House. With 
respect, at the end of the quorum call naturally the Chair called for 
the resumption of debate on the bill which was before the House. 
Members who were here at the time the quorum call occurred will 
note that the Chair had put the question on the motion and called 
for debate but no one had risen to speak because the quorum called 
intervened.
<P>
	As your Speaker, I called for debate on the motion and no one 
rose to debate the motion. I do not want to say something that I 
should not say concerning the presence or absence of members 
from the House, but no one rose to speak on the motion. 
Accordingly, I said: Is the House ready for the question? And the 
answer was, yes. I then received the document to put the question.
<P>
	It may be that while the question was being put members entered 
the House but no one rose to speak while I waited for the document 
to put the question. I submit that the Chair has acted in accordance 
with the practices and principles of the House in this matter.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As the hon. member for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup just 
said, he was on his way to the House when the question was put to 
the House. He was too late. He must be here. If the hon. minister 
does not want to speak at third reading, that is his prerogative, he 
has no obligation to do so. For personal reasons, he decided not to 
speak.
<P>
	As you know, I serve the House, but, in my opinion, the situation 
is as I described it. There is no point of order, and the matter is 
closed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Mr. Speaker, when you checked to see if there was 
a quorum, were you not supposed to determine if there was a 
quorum according to the number of members in their seat?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> I counted the members in 
the House. I did not check whether they were all in their seat, but I 
determined that 20 members were present in the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Mr. Speaker, are you not supposed to count only 
those members in their seats?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> With all due respect to the 
hon. member, I do not think it necessary that every member be at 
his own seat. It is enough that he be in the House. There were 20 
members in the House when the bells stopped ringing. I counted 
the members  myself, and am satisfied the House Standing Orders 
were followed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Mr. Speaker, am I to understand that your ruling, 
based on the Standing Orders, is that you can count members 
regardless of where they are in this House for the sake of 
maintaining quorum?
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	If that is your ruling, I respect it. It is just that, in making your 
ruling, I heard you say: ``I think that-'', which seemed to indicate 
you were unsure. Could we please check what the Standing Orders 
say?
<P>
	If you tell me that is what they say, I will take your word for it. 
We will do the checking ourselves.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Perhaps I did not make 
myself clear enough, but the fact is that I was satisfied that there 
were 20 members present in the House, and that is what our 
Standing Orders call for. They were not in the galleries, they were 
here, in the House. I counted 20 members, so that is the end of the

	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.)</B> 
moved that Bill C-23, an act to establish the Canadian Nuclear 
Safety Commission and to make consequential amendments to 
other acts, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Cowling (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am more than pleased 
to speak in the House today regarding Bill C-23, the Nuclear Safety 
and Control Act.
<P>
	The current legislation in this area is 50 years old. As the 
minister noted earlier, it suffers from several deficiencies and is 
outdated. The development application and the use of nuclear 
technology for peaceful purposes brings many benefits to Canada. 
However, it also entails some important responsibilities.
<P>
	It is high time we had modern legislation to govern the 
regulation of nuclear activities. The benefits of nuclear technology 
include a safe and secure supply of energy, some 26,000 direct and 
10,000 indirect jobs and significant export revenues from the sale 
of Candu reactors and uranium.
<P>
	Nuclear science has brought us advanced medical treatments, 
agriculture and scientific applications and real environmental 
advantages. To maximize these benefits and minimize the risks, 
Canada has had to take certain precautions to protect public health 
and safety as well as the environment.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8023"> 8023 </A></B>
<P>
	Canadians insist on very high standards for the regulation of 
nuclear activity, higher than for most other forms of technology.
<P>
	Since 1946 the agency charged with enforcing those standards, 
the Atomic Energy Control Board, has done an excellent job. Its 
vigilance is one reason that Canada has an enviable nuclear safety 
record. However, the agency needs our help.
<P>
	I would like to take a few minutes to expand on the role of the 
AECB and to demonstrate why a new, modern framework is needed 
to ensure that the nuclear regulatory authority in Canada can 
continue to fulfil its mandate.
<P>
	As has already been mentioned, the Atomic Energy Control Act 
was proclaimed in 1946, shortly after the end of the second world 
war. Apart from one amendment in 1954, the act has remained 
essentially unchanged for half a century. During that time there 
have been dramatic changes in the extent and nature of nuclear 
activities in Canada and abroad and in society's expectations of 
government regulations. There has also been a shift in emphasis at 
the AECB. The agency continues to be concerned with the security 
of nuclear information and materials. Today, however, most of its 
activities focus on regulating the health, safety and environmental 
aspects of nuclear technology.
<P>
<B>(1550 )</B>
<P>
	In fact, these have been the most important issues for the AECB 
since 1960 when the first health and safety regulations were 
established under the Atomic Energy Control Act. In the 1970s and 
1980s concern for the environment surged to the forefront of the 
public agenda. This has also helped shape the AECB's modern 
mandate.
<P>
	Let me say a few words about how the AECB operates. The 
AECB is an independent regulatory agency reporting to Parliament 
through the Minister of Natural Resources. It is directed by a five 
member board, one of whom is the president of the board.
<P>
	The president of the board supervises approximately 400 officers 
and staff. Most of these employees are based at the AECB 
headquarters in Ottawa-

<P>
	<B>Mr. Kilger:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think you would find that the 
parliamentary secretary responsible for the very important 
portfolio of natural resources is in her place and ready to continue 
the debate.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> I am asking if there are 
members wishing to speak. If members who wish to speak would 
rise, I would recognize them.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary had the floor. I did not see her rising 
before. If she is rising, I will recognize her so that she can conclude 
her remarks.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Cowling:</B> Mr. Speaker, let me say-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Mr. Speaker, when you asked if someone wished to 
speak, when we asked for a quorum count, the hon. parliamentary 
secretary was already in the process of making her speech.
<P>
	When debate resumed, you said ``Resuming debate'' and the 
hon. parliamentary secretary said she did not wish to use the time 
she had left. That is what I concluded, since she said she was done, 
so we could proceed to other matters. Following this, our colleague 
rose and said: ``I wish to speak to Bill C-23''.
<P>
	Earlier, we experienced the same situation with Bill C-60 and 
you did not recognize our colleague, who had not reached his seat. 
In this case, I do not think you should let the hon. parliamentary 
secretary carry on, because she clearly stated her desire to end her 
speech.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> I appreciate the comments 
made by the hon. member for Joliette. I did not hear the hon. 
parliamentary secretary when she said, as the member pointed out, 
that she did not wish to continue to speak in this debate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	What I did say was: Resuming debate. No one rose. I said: Do 
other members wish to speak? At that point two members rose, 
including the hon. member for Abitibi. I concluded from that, since 
the parliamentary had already risen, she wished to resume her 
remarks.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8024"> 8024 </A></B>
<P>
	If she said otherwise earlier I did not hear it. She did not rise 
earlier, I agree, and that is why I asked again: Is there anyone who 
wishes to speak, because I assumed that the hon. member for 
Abitibi was going to speak.
<P>
	I think it is reasonable in the circumstances that the 
parliamentary secretary conclude her remarks, since the two 
indicated at the same time that they wished to speak.
<P>
	Accordingly, I call on the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Natural Resources.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Cowling (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, let me say a few words 
about how the AECB operates.
<P>
	The AECB is an independent regulatory agency reporting to 
Parliament through the Minister of Natural Resources. It is directed 
by a five member board, one of whom is the president of the board.
<P>
	The president of the board supervises approximately 400 officers 
and staff. Most of these employees are based at AECB headquarters 
in Ottawa, with resident inspectors stationed at all nuclear 
generating stations, at four regional offices and at a uranium 
mining division in Saskatoon.
<P>
	Hon. members may be interested to know that the large part of 
AECB's operating costs are recovered from operators through 
licensing fees. During 1994-95 licensing fees generated $28 
million in revenues, reducing the net cost to the federal government 
of delivering AECB services to $15 million. This annual 
expenditure will be further reduced as the board's cost recovery 
program matures over the next five years.
<P>
	Canada's approach to nuclear regulation is based on the 
internationally accepted principle that the operator of nuclear 
technology is responsible for safety and must justify the proposed 
use.
<P>
	The role of the AECB is to set safety standards and to ensure, 
through a variety of compliance mechanisms, that these standards 
are met. Like other national nuclear regulatory bodies, the AECB 
licenses facilities that use nuclear energy or nuclear material.
<P>
<B>(1600 )</B>
<P>
	One way to illustrate the scope of the AECB's regulatory 
activities is to note that about 4,000 licences or other permits are 
currently in effect across Canada. These include licences for 
nuclear reactors, particle accelerators used in industrial and 
medical applications, uranium mines and refiners, reactor fuel 
fabrication plants, heavy water plants, radio active waste 
management facilities and radioisotopes. Radioisotopes are used 
for everything from medical and research applications to oil and 
gas well investigations and in consumer products like household 
smoke detectors. In fact, radioisotopes account for about 90 per 
cent of AECB licences.
<P>
	AECB licencees are found throughout Canada. They range from 
corporate giants like Ontario Hydro to small companies providing 
inspection services to the industry, to private individuals operating 
out of-

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sorry to interrupt the 
member again, but it is once again about quorum. The Liberals are 
absent from the House. It is not only up to the members of the Bloc 
to listen-
<P>
	<B>Mr. McTeague:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very disappointed in the 
position taken by the Bloc members in calling a third time for a 
quorum count.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> There must be a quorum 
in the House. As I do not see one, I ask the following: Call in the 
members.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<I>And the bells having rung</I>:
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> I see a quorum. Resuming 
debate, the hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Natural 
Resources.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Cowling:</B> Thank you again, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	In administering its licensing system, the AECB works closely 
with other federal and provincial departments with responsibilities 
in such areas as health, the environment, transport and labour. This 
ensures that the concerns and legislative obligations of these 
departments are considered during the licensing process.
<P>
	The Atomic Energy Control Board is also responsible for 
regulating the import and export of nuclear materials, equipment 
and technology. The board is very active in the work of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency and ensures Canadian 
compliance with the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear 
weapons.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	In the latter task the AECB is concerned with both domestic and 
international security of nuclear materials and technology. In all its 
regulatory and licensing activities the AECB maintains a 
transparent approach. I believe that the board's responsiveness to 
public concerns has much to do with its reputation as an effective, 
responsible, independent regulatory body. However, more than 
ever before the public is concerned about health and safety issues 
and demands input into the AECB's decision making process.
<P>
	The Atomic Energy Control Act gives the AECB significant 
responsibilities and broad scope for regulating nuclear activities. 
Through periodic amendments to regulations and licensing 
conditions, the AECB has regulated the development of the nuclear 
industry in Canada effectively while ensuring the health and safety 
of workers, the public and the environment.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8025"> 8025 </A></B>
<P>
	Nevertheless there is an obvious and compelling need to 
modernize the legislation. Many people believe that the 50 year 
old statute as it now stands limits the AECB's effectiveness. The 
act's deficiencies have been noted by the courts, the media, special 
interest groups, parliamentary committees and the auditor general.
<P>
	Let me mention some of the more troubling weaknesses. AECB 
inspectors do not have the formal powers they need to carry out 
their responsibilities. The AECB cannot hold polluters financially 
accountable for their actions, nor can it order remedial action. The 
ceiling on fines is $10,000 and is far too low.
<P>
	The small number of board members hinders the decision 
making process and does not allow the agency the flexibility it 
needs to deal effectively with certain issues. The act does not 
provide explicitly for public hearings.
<P>
	Bill C-23 corrects each of these weaknesses. It formalizes 
inspectors' powers so that they can ensure the safe use of nuclear 
materials whether in a home based business or a nuclear power 
plant. The bill provides an appeal mechanism as well. Bill C-23 
also increases the maximum fine for violations to $1 million.
<P>
	The proposed legislation will enable the AECB under its new 
name, the Canadian nuclear safety commission, to act quickly to 
clean up radioactive contamination when concerns over liability or 
the polluter's inaction could cause delays that could threaten public 
health, safety or the environment. The legislation also sets up 
reporting requirements that ensure that any contamination by 
radioactive substances or possible exposures to radiation are 
reported to the commission for remedial action.
<P>
	Bill C-23 increases the number of commission members to 
ensure better professional and technical representation and to 
improve decision making. It allows the president to appoint 
members to sit on panels which will be more efficient in many 
cases than requiring decision making by the full commission. This 
legislation also requires the commission to conduct its proceedings 
in public wherever reasonable. This simply formalizes current 
practice by the AECB.
<P>
	Make no mistake, the AECB has been and continues to be an 
active, effective regulatory agency essential to the high technology 
industry. Hon. members must recognize that new legislation is 
required to ensure that Canada's nuclear regulatory agency has the 
appropriate mandate and the authority to carry out its 
responsibilities today and in the future.
<P>
	This proposed legislation acts on commitments made in the 
recent speech from the throne, commitments to sustaining our 
environment and to ensuring a modern regulatory regime suitable 
for the 21st century.
<P>
	I urge my hon. colleagues to act in the interest of all Canadians 
by voting in favour of this bill.

	We must not close our eyes, either, to the fact that the current 
arsenal of nuclear weapons in circulation on this planet represents 
a risk of totally annihilating the human race, and the public is very 
much aware of this.
<P>
	We all know that there are impressive quantities of nuclear 
weapons, plutonium and heavy water in Russia, and our 
governments fear a black market may develop. Non-democratic 
countries and terrorist groups might get their hands on atomic 
weapons or on the raw materials for producing such weapons. Even 
small countries can get them.
<P>
	I see Bill C-23 as only a tiny step toward enhanced government 
control, and one that is way too late in coming. It is a very tiny 
response to the justified fear of the public, of Quebecers in 
particular.
<P>
	This bill does not, in fact, solve anything much. In particular, it 
does not get to the heart of the problem.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	Will we really be better protected when this bill is passed? 
Hardly. What is this government doing to prevent the use of nuclear 
products in weapons of destruction? I do not think Bill C-23 
provides the answer to this question.
<P>
	As citizens we may well wonder whether this government 
realizes that mankind is living on top of a volcano. The existing 
legislation, which goes back to 1946, maintained an almost 
incestuous relationship between research, marketing and control. 
There was a genuine conflict of interest.
<P>
	Fortunately, the bill proposes to separate the two components. 
How could anyone expect those who develop new technologies and 
are supposed to market them to exercise effective and much needed 
controls?
<P>
	It is like asking the big oil companies to calibrate gas pumps. 
Not that I do not trust them, but I have very little doubt they would 
try to take advantage of the situation. So it took the federal 
government 50 years to realize that this legislation was ill 
conceived and did not satisfactorily protect the interests of 
Quebecers and Canadians.
<P>
	How can you expect the public, which has many fears about 
nuclear energy, to start trusting this government and the new 
nuclear safety commission? This public trust will be extremely 
difficult to rebuild, and I can hardly believe that, with the passage 
of this bill, all problems will disappear.
<P>
	In fact, I expect the government wants us to forget the latest visit 
of the Prime Minister to Russia, when there was some talk of 
purchasing nuclear waste and processing it here in Canada. At the 
time, this decision raised a wave of public protest.
<P>
	There is another matter the government probably could have 
dealt with as well by examining the question of nuclear energy and 
introducing a bill on the subject. All things considered, if we 
analyse research and development investments in the nuclear 
energy sector in Canada, it is clear that one province alone enjoys 
practically all the economic spinoffs in this sector. I am of course 
referring to the province of Ontario.
<P>
	Who else in confederation is as well endowed with the largesse 
of the federal government? Who else in this confederation has a 
vested interest in maintaining Atomic Energy of Canada Limited? 
Who else in this confederation gets so many of the spinoffs of this 
industry? It is Ontario, always Ontario, that is the winner in the 
area of research and development.
<P>
	If the government were half way serious, it would have used the 
opportunity to consider the question. In this area in particular, it 
could have extended its generosity to Quebec. It provides strong 
support for nuclear energy simply as a favour to the industry in 
Ontario, in my opinion.
<P>
	I had hoped that the federal government would commit to better 
distribute its research and development funds by amending this 
bill. I am not saying give Quebec the advantage, but give it what it 
is entitled to. It did the very opposite. We saw this recently with the 
closing of the regional offices of Atomic Energy of Canada, 
including those in Montreal. They close the Montreal offices and 
open others in Ontario.
<P>
	I would also have hoped that the government would make clear 
its desire for more research and development projects on the 
peaceful uses of nuclear energy.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	Nuclear medicine has a very definite place, and funding should 
be increased to enable hospitals to do research. The public will 
accept atomic energy only when it sees its peaceful uses and its role 
in everyday life and only when it sees the government has 
established near perfect means to control the risks involved in its 
use and development.
<P>
	The introduction of this bill in the House could also have raised 
the issue of funding for Atomic Energy of Canada for debate.
<P>
	I would now like to discuss the funding of the sale of Candu 
reactors around the world. It is all very well to make sales, but do 
the countries receiving them have the means to protect themselves 
and their people? What about financing the sale of CANDU 
reactors throughout the world? Atomic Energy of Canada is just as 
much of a bottomless pit as the Hibernia project off Newfoundland 
may be.
<P>
	Since this agency was created, billions of dollars have been sunk 
into it, and the government is only able to sell CANDU reactors by 
financing them with money from Canadian and Quebec taxpayers. 
In reality, the sale of CANDU reactors, with their supposedly safe 
technology, is nothing more than a clever way of subsidizing 
Atomic Energy of Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8027"> 8027 </A></B>
<P>
	This government would have done better to overhaul Atomic 
Energy of Canada's operations. The days when the government 
could squander taxpayers' money are long gone. When a 
government makes savage cuts to unemployment insurance, 
contemplates making cuts to old age pensions, and attacks the 
most disadvantaged members of society, it should start by cleaning 
up its own act.
<P>
	The necessary clean-up has not been done at Atomic Energy 
Canada, and Bill C-23 would have provided an excellent 
opportunity to do just that. The timing was right. The government 
missed the boat in this case as in so many others. This is a half 
measure that will only disguise the true extent of the atomic energy 
management problem.
<P>
	I think this bill comes too late. It is nevertheless worthwhile, 
except that it should have been better thought out. This is a bill that 
could have made a great many Canadians happy.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. 
member for Parry Sound-Muskoka-nuclear energy; the hon. 
member for Mackenzie-employment.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for Ontario.
<P>
	I am very pleased to have an opportunity to speak on Bill C-23. 
As the chairman of the natural resources committee, I had an 
opportunity, along with many of my colleagues from all sides of 
the House, to study the bill in detail. A large number of witnesses 
came forward to provide us with a number of opinions, and 
concerns in some cases, about the bill.
<P>
	I was pleased to see that during the report stage of this legislation 
that a number of changes were proposed by the government and 
were eventually incorporated into this bill.
<P>
<B>(1625 )</B>
<P>
	I would like to take a moment to thank all of those people who 
took the time to testify before us as well as to thank my fellow 
members on the committee, many of whom are sitting here in the 
House right now, for the work that they did.
<P>
	It is most important to recognize that this legislation is an 
attempt to find an appropriate balance. On the one hand it is an 
attempt to find a balance between ensuring the beneficial use of 
nuclear substances for the generation of power, medical research 
and medical technology, and on the other hand it is an attempt in 
putting in place a regulatory regime that ensures public safety and 
public health.
<P>
	That is the balance that has to be found when dealing with the 
nuclear industry. Bill C-23 does just that. It gets that balance. It 
puts it in place and does it properly.
<P>
	As some of the other speakers have mentioned previously in 
debate, this legislation is long overdue. The original legislation 
governing nuclear energy was passed in 1946. That is over 50 years 
ago. It was a time when the primary concern was one of national 
security, as opposed to one of public health and safety.
<P>
	This legislation is long overdue and I applaud the Minister of 
Natural Resources for assuming the responsibility and after 50 
some odd years bringing new legislation into the House that 
reflects the realities of the 1990s. Today we are far more concerned 
with the issues of health and safety than the concerns of national 
security.
<P>
	As I mentioned in my opening comments, the bill looks to create 
a balance. I would like to quote clause 3 of the bill which deals with 
its purpose: ``The purpose of this act is to provide for the 
development, production and use of nuclear energy and the 
production, possession and use of nuclear substances, prescribed 
equipment and prescribed information in a manner than prevents an 
unreasonable risk to national security, the environment or the 
health and safety of persons and is consistent with Canada's 
international obligations''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dalphond-Guiral:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sorry to have to ask 
once again for a quorum. We might make it into the Guinness book 
of records.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> We do not have a quorum 
at this point.
<P>
	Call in the members.
<P>
	<I>And the bells having stopped:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> There is now a quorum. 
The hon. member for Parry Sound-Muskoka has the floor.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is quite apparent the Bloc is trying 
to stretch this 50 year effort to finally update this bill to protect 
Canadians' health and safety with a few shenanigans, but I shall 
continue. Hopefully, we will get the concerns of Canadians through 
the House despite that.
<P>
<B>(1630 )</B>
<P>
	As I was saying, there are a number of important objectives in 
this legislation. We have talked about the need to update the 
regulatory regime. We have talked about finding a balance.
<P>
	As well, this bill gives the government the legislative authority 
to carry out its international obligations. Those international 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8028"> 8028 </A></B>
<P>
obligations are very important. For  instance, it allows Canada to 
work toward the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear 
explosive devices. We have undertaken important international 
agreements to try to stop the spread of nuclear weapons in the 
world. This legislation provides the government the tools it will 
need to carry out those international agreements. That is another 
important objective of the bill.
<P>
	Fourth, all government departments have worked on 
streamlining the regulatory regime under which Canadians must 
operate. This bill works toward that end. It works toward ensuring 
that the carrying out of regulations will be done in an efficient and 
cost effective manner. That is another important objective of the 
bill.
<P>
	There are a number of specific provisions in the bill. I would like 
to speak to a couple of the provisions which will work toward 
achieving the objectives of the legislation.
<P>
	First, the bill will expand the size of the commission from five 
members to seven members. That will allow more expertise, more 
representation on the commission, so that when decisions are being 
made there will be a broader group of individuals with a broader 
range of expertise. They will be able to make better and more 
effective decisions.
<P>
	Second, the bill has increased the level of fines for individuals or 
corporations which contravene their licences. That is very 
important. By doing that we will get away from the situation where 
a company might consider a very minor fine to be simply the cost 
of doing business and will continue to not follow the rules and 
regulations. The bill will introduce fines which have real teeth in 
them. The increased fines will be an incentive to companies to 
adhere to the rules and regulations of their licences. I am very 
pleased that the legislation gives the government the power to 
establish fines at a level which will serve as a deterrent.
<P>
	Third, in dealing with the regulatory regime, the bill will give 
the federal government the power to delegate administrative 
functions to the provinces where they are best able to carry them 
out. We will be able to get away from the situation where one day a 
provincial inspector shows up to do one part of the job and the next 
day a federal inspectors shows up to do another part. That system is 
very inefficient. This bill will allow the provinces to delegate 
administrative responsibilities.
<P>
	Fourth and very important is the whole idea of having public 
hearings. One of the concerns that we heard during the committee 
meetings was that there would not be sufficient public input for 
some of the very important decisions which the commission will 
have to undertake. Through what was originally in the legislation 
and through the amendments that were made, based in part on the 
information we received at committee, the legislation has been 
changed so that there will be  mandatory public hearings where 
people will be able to review decisions. There will also be an 
appeal process.
<P>
	I believe this is a good piece of legislation. It demonstrates 
clearly that the Minister of Natural Resources, in coming into 
office and seeing a difficult problem, was able to act. She acted on 
a legislative regime that had not been updated for 50 years. The 
Minister of Natural Resources stepped up to the challenge and put 
before the House good, solid legislation.
<P>
	This bill was not quickly put together. The committee held six 
weeks of hearings to gather opinions from a broad range of 
individuals and groups. We were able to obtain a large amount of 
input which was used to make the bill better than it was when it was 
debated in the House at second reading.
<P>
<B>(1635 )</B>
<P>
	This bill is about protecting the health and safety of Canadians. 
It is not about favouring one part of the country over another, about 
saying that Quebec gets all of this or Ontario gets all of this or the 
west gets all of this. That is not what this bill is all about, not what 
we in this House are about today.
<P>
	It is about protecting Canadians' health and safety, about 
ensuring that we have a proper regulatory regime over the nuclear 
industry in this country, about making sure we protect the health 
and safety of Canadians.
<P>
	I become quite fatigued when I hear on a bill that is as important 
as this, about the health and safety of Canadians, on a bill that deals 
with moving forward the agenda of protecting Canadians no matter 
where they live, comments about this part of the country getting 
more and that part of the country getting more. That has no place in 
this debate.
<P>
	What this is about is a good piece of legislation, about protecting 
Canadians and making sure that the system works.

	<B>Mrs. Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this afternoon there is a kind of comedy taking place in this House. 
Across the floor, there are 177 seats held by elected government 
members, but we cannot get enough of them to have a quorum. In 
the last hour, we have had to ask for a quorum five times. I am 
again asking for a quorum.

Please ring the bells.
<P>
	<I>And the bells having rung:</I>
<P>

and comments, the hon. member for Abitibi.

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have an 
interesting question for the Liberal member, who is also the 
chairman of the Standing Committee on Natural Resources. The 
hon. member said this is a very important bill for the health and 
safety of Canadians.
<P>
	I asked the natural resources committee to amend clause 3, 
which reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The purpose of this Act is to provide for</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>a</I>) the limitation, to a reasonable level- of the risks- associated with the 
development, production and use of nuclear energy and the production, 
possession and use of nuclear substances, prescribed equipment, etc.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I would like the hon. member to tell me why he did not accept 
the amendment I proposed in committee. My amendment provided 
that the limitation should be not to a reasonable level, but to a 
minimum level. It is important for Canadians to understand that, 
when it comes to nuclear energy, the acceptable threshold should 
not really be the acceptable level, but that we should work to arrive 
at a minimum level. Given the current technology, this should be 
possible.
<P>
	Could the hon. member tell me why he did not agree with this 
amendment, which sought to protect the well-being of Canadians?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member worked very hard 
on this piece of legislation. We need to talk about finding a balance. 
I do not think that we can legislate every specific possibility that 
may come up at some time. If we look back to when the legislation 
was originally enacted in 1946 we will find things in the legislation 
which were not even imagined for 1996. That bill has had to serve 
over the last 50 years.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	One integral part of the bill and of our regulatory regime is that 
we have a licensing board which stipulates on a case by case basis 
specific licenses established for each person to operate. The public 
should know that nobody handles this material in any form unless a 
licence has been issued to do so. Each situation is different. There 
is a big difference between a nuclear reactor and dealing with 
isotopes for medical research. Therefore there has to be some 
flexibility in the licensing regime.
<P>
	When giving instructions to the commission to use the word 
reasonable, I believe that by using the word reasonable we are 
allowing the commission to deal with each situation given the 
events and the facts and the evolution of technology over the years 
and to give the flexibility necessary in the licensing process to deal 
with the health and safety of Canadians.
<P>
	When trying to define a minimum standard when doing 
experimentation with isotopes it is going to be a whole lot different 
than a minimum standard for dealing with nuclear reactors or other 
types of licensees.
<P>
	I believe that using the word reasonable and combining it with a 
strong board of seven members with some strong licensing powers 
and with some strong regulatory regimes with the ability to fine 
companies or individuals who ignore their licensing requirements 
will protect the health and safety of Canadians, which is the intent 
of the bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Ontario, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, given the 
atmosphere this afternoon, I must say that I find it a bit unfortunate 
that, as soon as the Bloc Quebecois members, the member for 
Berthier-Montcalm and the member for 
Rimouski-Témiscouata, raised their point of order, they left the 
House.
<P>
	I find it a bit unfortunate that these members did not stay for a 
speech that is very important, on a topic that is also very important, 
not just for Quebecers but for all Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am well aware of this bill. I think it is an important bill and it 
certainly affects me as a member of Parliament whose riding has 
one of the largest nuclear facilities in the country.
<P>
	I want to commend the hon. member for Parry Sound-Muskoka 
on the excellent job done in committee and getting the bill to third 
reading. I also want to take the opportunity to thank the 
parliamentary secretary, the member for Dauphin-Swan River, 
and the minister on their excellent effort on a bill that I think 
modernizes our need for legislation and gets a brings a piece of 
legislation that has been around for a long time up to speed.
<P>
	As hon. members are aware, the purpose of Bill C-23 is to 
establish a more effective and efficient regulatory framework for 
Canada's nuclear industry. The nuclear industry provides many 
benefits to Canadians but if Canadians are to realize those benefits 
the risk associated with nuclear energy must be minimized.
<P>
	In addition, Canadians must be confident that a nuclear regulator 
is fully able to ensure those risks are controlled. Their legislation 
will establish a modern regulatory regime for Canada's nuclear 
industry so that Canadians can have that confidence.
<P>
<B>(1645 )</B>
<P>
	There are costs to regulation, both in financial terms and in terms 
of constraints placed upon industry and individuals who work or 
deal with the industry. But there are benefits as well. To put this 
legislation into perspective I would like to remind hon. members of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8030"> 8030 </A></B>
<P>
this House of the nuclear sector's contribution to economic  
growth, job creation and a healthy environment for all Canadians.
<P>
	Canada is a fortunate nation in the sense that it has a variety of 
electricity sources. Hydroelectric power is the major source, 
producing 60 per cent of our supply. Thermal electricity, generated 
mostly by burning natural gas and coal, produces about 20 per cent 
of the supply. Nearly 20 per cent is provided by nuclear power.
<P>
	Nuclear power is certainly important in Ontario not only for the 
sake of my riding, but for the entire province where it produces 
more than 60 per cent of the electrical supply. It is probably not 
news to this House but nuclear power produced in Canada uses 
Candu nuclear reactors. In Canada we have 22 reactors of which 
eight are in my riding; one finds itself in the province of Quebec, 
and there is one in New Brunswick. They are all licensed and 
regulated by the AECB, the Atomic Energy Control Board of 
Canada.
<P>
	The Candu reactor is a Canadian high technology success story. 
In 1987 the Engineering Centennial Council listed the Candu as 
one of the ten most outstanding engineering achievements of the 
preceding century.
<P>
	One of the most attractive features of the Candu reactor is that it 
uses natural uranium as fuel. Other types of reactors use enriched 
uranium. Producing enriched uranium is an expensive process and 
the technology is a secret very closely guarded by a handful of 
countries. Therefore the Candu design allows us to capitalize on 
our abundant uranium resources.
<P>
	Yet another attractive feature of the Candu reactor is that it can 
be refuelled on line. This has helped to make Candu reactors 
among the most reliable in the world. Canadians can take great 
pride in the fact that in terms of lifetime capacity utilization, three 
of the world's top ten reactors and seven of the world's top 
twenty-five reactors are Candu.
<P>
	It is equally important to Canadian industry that the Candu 
design does not require large high pressure reactor vessels. This 
gives Canadian firms a great share in the manufacturing and 
construction of these reactors.
<P>
	The technical excellence of the Candu has made it a desirable 
product for export. Four have been sold to South Korea, one to 
Argentina and one to Romania. On November 26 Atomic Energy of 
Canada Ltd. signed a contract to sell two Candu reactors to China. 
The nuclear industry is one of the few high tech industries that are 
actually net exporters of goods and services.
<P>
	Nuclear energy and nuclear power are economical. The 
economies of scale associated with using nuclear power to generate 
electricity make it one of the lowest cost alternatives for meeting 
large base load demands.
<P>
	During the 1970s and 1980s the cost of electricity from nuclear 
power plants in Ontario was on average about 30  per cent less than 
the cost of electricity from the more traditional conventional coal 
fired power plants. Electricity provided by natural gas and coal 
fired generating plants has become more economically attractive in 
the past 10 years but the cost of nuclear power remains competitive 
for large scale base load generation under a number of scenarios. 
Canada's nuclear power plants will continue to provide clean 
economical power for the foreseeable future, and we hope that will 
be a long one.
<P>
	Canada is a pioneer in the use of nuclear technology to support 
material science. Nuclear technologies also have applications in 
the oil and gas, metals inspection and agricultural industries, to 
name a few. Canada is the world's leading producer and exporter of 
uranium, but for peaceful purposes.
<P>
	Canada's nuclear technology is literally saving lives here and 
around the world. This may come as a surprise to those who are 
usually quick to discredit it. For the past 50 years, Canada has been 
an international leader in medical applications of nuclear 
technology. In particular, our nation has become the world's 
leading producer of radioisotopes, which my hon. colleague from 
Parry Sound-Muskoka spoke so eloquently on.
<P>
	In particular Canada has become the world's leading producer of 
such isotopes as cobalt 60 which is used to treat cancer and 
technetium 99 which is essential to many diagnostic procedures. 
Many people are amazed to learn that about 25 per cent of patients 
admitted to hospital in Canada today undergo a diagnostic process 
that involves nuclear technology.
<P>
<B>(1650 )</B>
<P>
	In considering Bill C-23, hon. members must not overlook the 
fact that the Canadian nuclear industry is also a major employer. In 
1993, the last year for which figures are available, the industry 
directly employed about 26,000 people. At least 10,000 jobs in 
other sectors depended indirectly on the nuclear industry. Many of 
these highly skilled scientific, engineering and manufacturing jobs 
can be seen right across this country, including the benefits which 
arise in my own riding.
<P>
	Nuclear power represents more than just jobs, industrial growth 
and export potential. It is also one of the most important means by 
which Canada can achieve its sustainable development goals. Quite 
simply, the sustainable development of Canada's resources is 
essential to our international competitiveness and the long term 
health of our economy and of course the maintenance of our higher 
standard of living.
<P>
	A key element of the sustainable development challenge is 
Canada's commitment to control its emissions of greenhouse and 
acid gases. Along with hydro power, nuclear energy is essential to 
this effort. Neither of these electricity sources produces greenhouse 
or acid gases. As a result of Canada's strong reliance on  hydro and 
nuclear power, which by the way is uncommon among OECD 
countries, our electricity sector produces a smaller proportion of 
the country's total greenhouse gas emissions compared with other 
countries that depend on traditional fossil fuels. In fact if we decide 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8031"> 8031 </A></B>
<P>
not to have nuclear reactors, our electricity sector would emit about 
twice as much as it does now.
<P>
	I would like to emphasize that all the activities I have described 
today are regulated by the Atomic Energy Control Board to ensure 
that workers, the public and the environment are not exposed to 
unnecessary risks. The AECB has ensured that these risks are very 
low indeed. The benefits associated with nuclear technology far 
outweigh its risks.
<P>
	The bill before us today addresses several concerns relating to 
the regulation of the industry. I draw the attention of hon. members 
to two key points. First, the industry has standards of regulation 
which it must meet. It needs to know what powers the regulator's 
inspectors have and it needs to have access to a legal appeal 
mechanism. Second, the Canadian public has a legitimate interest 
in nuclear safety. Bill C-23 gives Canadians an opportunity to 
express concerns whenever major facilities are being licensed.
<P>
	It is for those reasons that Bill C-23 in my view is a bill well 
worth supporting. It is a bill whose time has come. For the residents 
of Pickering I think this makes absolute sense. I commend the 
government and the minister of energy in pursuing this.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise in this House to speak to Bill C-23 at third reading.
<P>
	As my Liberal colleague mentioned, I have done considerable 
work on this bill. I thought that nuclear energy was a very serious 
matter, and that, since the old act had been around for 50 years, a 
great deal of attention would have to be given to improving it.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to explain my point of view, 
which is that Bill C-23 will have to be transparent so things can be 
put in context.
<P>
	While the existing act encompasses both the regulatory and 
developmental aspects of nuclear activities, this enactment 
disconnects the two functions, provides a distinct identity to the 
regulatory agency. It replaces the Atomic Energy Control Board 
with the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission, underlining its 
separate role from that of Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd. The role 
of the latter agency is to promote the sale of CANDU reactors, 
among other things. It also oversees the federal research, 
development and marketing organization for nuclear and atomic 
energy.
<P>
	Since the act was first adopted in 1946, the mandate of the 
regulatory agency has evolved from one chiefly concerned with 
national security to one which focuses primarily on the control of 
the health and environmental safety consequences of nuclear 
activities.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	This enactment provides the Canadian Nuclear Safety 
Commission with a mandate to establish and enforce national 
standards in
<P>
this area. It also establishes a basis for implementing Canada's 
policy of fulfilling its obligations with respect to the 
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.
<P>
	This new philosophy underlying Bill C-23 establishes a very 
reasonable basis for attaining objectives, but perhaps not enough 
time has been allowed to take a 50-year-old enactment and turn it 
into a modern piece of legislation. It must be remembered that the 
bill replaces a 50-year-old enactment dealing primarily with 
national security. It must be kept in mind that in 1950, after World 
War II, there was more interest in linking nuclear energy with 
bombs for war time use. Gradually the desire developed to show 
Canadians that this energy could also be a safe, easily produced, 
low cost, clean energy source.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, there are not many of us here, and the House is not 
really paying much attention. In light of the events that have taken 
place, and in order to continue this debate in a more serious 
manner, I therefore move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the House do now adjourn.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should consider the 
advisability of establishing a public safety officers compensation fund to receive 
gifts and bequests for the benefit of spouses and children of police officers and 
firefighters who lose their lives in the line of duty.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to the House today 
on Motion No. 306.
<P>
	As members know, I have been quite active in the area of private 
members' bills and motions. In part of the activities that I have 
undertaken the issue of alcohol was one that caught my attention 
the most. As a result of some of the work I did on Bill C-222, which 
concerned putting health warning labels on the containers of 
alcoholic beverages, a personal initiative came out of this called 
Drink Smart Canada.
<P>
	Drink Smart Canada is a public awareness and education 
campaign to make Canadians aware of the consequences of the 
misuse of alcohol. When I started this program and did the research 
and developed the statistics to deal with the consequences of 
alcohol misuse, I needed some help. I received a lot of support 
from my colleagues in the House, but I needed some external 
support.
<P>
	I would like to read into the record the statistics dealing with 
alcohol misuse: 19,000 deaths each year, 45 per cent of all motor 
vehicle collisions, 30 per cent of fires, 30 per cent of all suicides, 
60 per cent of all homicides, 50 per cent of incidents of family 
violence, 65 per cent of snowmobile collisions, one in six family 
breakdowns, 30 per cent of all drownings, 5 per cent of birth 
defects, 65 per cent of cases of child abuse, 40 per cent of all falls 
and 50 per cent of all hospital emergencies. The cost of this to 
Canadians in additional health care costs and social program costs 
is some $15 billion a year which is all directly or indirectly due to 
alcohol misuse.
<P>
	When I look down the list at the tragedies associated with the 
misuse of alcohol, it became very clear to me that our police 
officers and firefighters are the ones who are acting on behalf of all 
Canadians to deal with the consequences of many of these 
tragedies. Whether they be fires, motor vehicle collisions, 
homicides or family violence, it is our police officers and 
firefighters who are there for Canadians during those times of 
emergency.
<P>
	I needed that support and went outside and spoke with the police 
and firefighters. I am pleased to let everyone know that the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8034"> 8034 </A></B>
<P>
Association of Fire Chiefs representing the  firefighters of Canada 
came forward and lent their support to Drink Smart Canada.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	In its supporting statement on Drink Smart the The Canadian 
Police Association stated it was pleased to join the Canadian 
Association of Fire Chiefs in supporting Drink Smart Canada.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Canadian Police Association welcomes any initiative that will curb alcohol 
abuse and make our communities and roads safer for all Canadians. Police officers 
know too well the carnage and grief that is caused by alcohol abuse. We recognize 
that alcohol will not be eradicated from society but that it can be used responsibly 
and this type of program will be effective in reducing family violence and needless 
traffic deaths and injuries.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In its statement the Canadian Association of Fire Chiefs said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We are indeed honoured to be named as one of the honorary patrons of ``Drink 
Smart Canada'' and to work along with the Canadian Police Association and 
Members of Parliament on this educational project.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The fire departments across Canada are involved daily in incidents such as house 
fires and motor vehicle accidents whose cause can be attributed either directly or 
indirectly to alcohol abuse. The consumption of alcohol can impair judgment and 
cause drowsiness, which when combined with routine domestic activities, cigarette 
smoking or driving a motor vehicle can have serious if not tragic consequences.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Those are just two extracts from these two organizations.
<P>
	When I needed help the police and firefighters of Canada came 
forward to offer their support and encouragement in an area that 
was important to me. As a consequence I have no hesitation 
whatsoever in bringing forward Motion No. 306 which proposes:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should consider the 
advisability of establishing a Public Safety Officers compensation fund to receive 
gifts and bequests for the benefit of spouses and children of police officers and 
firefighters who lose their lives in the line of duty.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I submitted that private member's motion. In addition, on June 
17, 1996 I also submitted Bill C-314 which is a bill to bring to 
fruition the public safety officers compensation fund. That bill has 
not yet been chosen under the rules of the House but I am confident 
that today will start the debate on this issue and that with the 
support of all members of the House we will achieve the objectives 
of Bill C-314.
<P>
	I want to say a couple of words about the memorial site on the 
Hill. The murder of a police officer triggered a nationally 
recognized ceremony. On July 11, 1977 a rookie constable, David 
Kirkwood, was killed in the line of duty. He had been with the force 
for some 11 months and was 21 years old. Following that senseless 
killing Ottawa police officers vowed to keep not only his memory 
alive but as well to ensure that the magnitude of  his sacrifice and 
the sacrifice of others like him would never be forgotten by 
Canadians.
<P>
	Accordingly, on September 24, 1978 a special service and tribute 
were held on Parliament Hill. The site selected was Parliament, the 
place where the laws are made that directly have an impact on 
police officer safety and on the quality of life of us all.
<P>
	On March 22, 1994 the Prime Minister gathered with more than 
700 police officers and relatives of slain officers at the site behind 
the Parliament buildings. The Canadian Police Association and the 
CACP dedicated the new Canadian Police Memorial Pavilion and a 
granite stone at the base of the pavilion that contains the names of 
officers killed in the line of duty.
<P>
	During the last 30 years some 96 Canadian police officers have 
been the victims of homicide while on duty. All but eight of these 
were shot. On duty homicide rates, however, have declined 
somewhat during this period but it still is a large number.
<P>
<B>(1755 )</B>
<P>
	At the time of the writing of the article I am reading here, 14 
officers had been killed during the 1990s. A research study has 
been done of four large police forces which represent one-third of 
all sworn officers in the country. It found that during the period 
1970 through 1990 two-thirds of police officer homicides occurred 
after police were dispatched to incidents or responded to calls for 
assistance while the remaining homicides arose out of police 
initiated contact. The majority of these were in responding to 
emergent needs.
<P>
	I have read many of the stories associated with the deaths of 
courageous firefighters. I will not repeat them on the record 
because I think it is important to remember the positives and not 
the tragic stories. We should not forget those stories but remember 
the positives.
<P>
	Firefighters have made a significant contribution to public 
safety. Over the last 10 years approximately 40 firefighters have 
lost their lives in the line of duty on behalf of Canadians. These 
include not only the firefighters we are all familiar with but in 
many communities across Canada there is a volunteer firefighter 
base that is very important to the safety of all Canadians.
<P>
	To give an idea of the magnitude of the contribution made there 
as well in terms of risk, over the same period some 12,500 
firefighters have been injured. I have looked at the statistics and 
found that firefighters and police officers were four times more 
likely to be the victims of homicide and 11 times more likely to be 
the victims of violence. That tells us that our police officers, our 
public safety officers, prison guards, jail guards and firefighters are 
in a high risk, dangerous situation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8035"> 8035 </A></B>
<P>
	This motion asks parliamentarians to consider what they feel 
when they see incidents in our country when public safety officers 
lose their lives in the line of duty. I can recall many times seeing 
news stories of police officers or firefighters from right across the 
country, hundreds if not thousands, coming together to mourn a 
loss. It is a loss that Canadians feel as well.
<P>
	Public safety officers are police officers, firefighters, peace 
officers. Under the Criminal Code peace officers include jail and 
prison guards. The intent here is to include those who are in the 
public service.
<P>
	Motion No. 306 and Bill C-314 proposes that a registered 
charitable foundation be established with a board of directors 
appointed by the Government of Canada. The board would receive 
applications for assistance and would assess need on a case by case 
basis.
<P>
	On September 29, 1976 a public safety officers benefit program 
was established in the United States. It is now under the auspices of 
the U.S. department of justice. It provides a substantial benefit to 
the survivors of firefighters and police officers killed in the line of 
duty. In fact, the amount currently paid is about $135,000 U.S. 
dollars. It is also an indexed fund. That gives an idea of the value 
and the level of concern that the United States has for those who 
provide these services to the citizens of the United States.
<P>
	When a program begins it is not possible to fund it at that level. 
However, it is reflective of the level of concern.
<P>
	A fund is being proposed which would be a registered charity to 
receive gifts and bequests from Canadians who want a tangible way 
to show their support for our police officers, firefighters and peace 
officers who lose their lives in the line of duty. The board of 
directors would assess each case on a case by case basis and would 
determine on the basis of need.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	I found an interesting statistic. The average age of police officers 
killed in the line of duty is about 35. I do not have statistics on what 
their family composition was but I can reflect on what my family 
composition was some 14 years ago when I was 35 years of age.
<P>
	I had an eight-year old, a six-year old and a one-year old. My 
wife was at home managing the family home and caring for our 
children and our family. We had a large mortgage. We had an old 
car. I had a job that offered group life insurance which would pay 
twice my salary if I should die. It was certainly not enough to 
discharge my debts. I had some additional insurance which was 
expensive but I carried it because of my family responsibilities.
<P>
	If I am reflective of the kind of situations, and I am sure I am, 
that police officers and firefighters who are in the prime of their 
lives find themselves in, their families  are probably filled but very 
young, their financial obligations are probably at their peak and 
they are probably getting into their highest income earning years 
when their lives come to an end.
<P>
	The money would come from gifts or bequests from Canadians 
or from their estates in gratitude for the service provided, and that 
would be a major source of funds, and the unions and the 
associations of the police officers and firefighters across this 
country have let me know by literally hundreds of letters and 
petitions that they support this issue and that they are also prepared 
to support it financially.
<P>
	The motion does not call for funding from other levels of 
government. However, as a registered charity it can receive any 
appropriations from any level of government should that happen, 
and I hope that would happen.
<P>
	The last question I would rhetorically pose is why is the fund 
being proposed. Canadians are well aware of the daily risks that 
face our police and firefighters as they serve our needs. When one 
of them loses their life in the line of duty, we all mourn that loss. 
This fund would be a tangible way for Canadians to honour their 
courageous service and to assist their loved ones in their time of 
need.
<P>
	The International Association of Firefighters comes annually to 
visit the Hill. I want to thank firefighter Marty Goodkey who came 
to my office last year to propose this public safety officers 
compensation fund on behalf of all public safety officers, including 
police, prison guards, firefighters and volunteers across this 
country. They made a tremendous impression on me. I was very 
grateful for the support they gave me when I asked them for 
support for Drink Smart Canada. It is the least I can do to rise in 
this House and to ask for the support of all colleagues to see if we 
can find a way to help establish a public safety officers 
compensation fund so that we can give all Canadians an 
opportunity to show how much we care and appreciate the 
contribution made by those public safety officers.

	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to speak to Motion M-306, presented by the hon. member 
for Mississauga South.
<P>
	Although the hon. member already mentioned the following, we 
must give credit where credit is due. As far as the business of 
Parliament is concerned, which includes bills and motions, the hon. 
member for Mississauga South has, in the course of this 
Parliament, introduced a number of bills. He has done an 
outstanding job, whether or not we agree with the motions and bills 
he drafted and so valiantly defended before the Subcommittee on 
Private Members' Business of the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs.

<P>
	It is always reassuring to see a member who works so hard at 
the business of Parliament, something we were all elected to do.
<P>
	The debate on the motion of the hon. member for Mississauga 
South is right on time, since next Monday in Ottawa there will be a 
meeting of the Canadian Police Association, whose members will 
take advantage of this opportunity next week to meet 
parliamentarians, make them aware of their problems and try to 
determine certain priorities for dealing with matters of public 
safety.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	This contribution by the Canadian Police Association is much 
appreciated, for instance, by the Standing Committee on Justice 
and Legal Affairs on which I have had the honour to sit since the 
beginning of the 35th Parliament. Every time we had bills 
concerning the Criminal Code and public safety, the Canadian 
Police Association usually appeared with thorough and informed 
studies and shared its expertise acquired in the field.
<P>
	For that reason alone, we as legislators owe a debt of gratitude to 
the Canadian Police Association. They helped us improve certain 
bills and in many cases prompted the tabling of bills aimed at 
increasing public safety.
<P>
	As parliamentarians we are, of course, concerned about public 
safety, and we pass legislation accordingly. However, we too often 
forget those who are on the front line, and to take a leaf from the 
book of the hon. member for Mississauga South, I will talk about 
those who are on the firing line and mention a few figures. It is said 
dozens of police officers have been shot. These are not traffic 
accidents, this is murder, sordid crimes, in most cases.
<P>
	It is always a shock to a community to see police officers die in 
the line of duty, specially when it is the result of a criminal act. 
Those who are supposed to protect us also deserve to be protected 
by a legislative framework that shows respect for the work done by 
the men and women who serve society and provides adequate 
compensation for their families in case of death.
<P>
	The hon. member for Mississauga South was right when he said 
that when a person dies in the prime of life, that person is usually 
not in a position to provide his family with the same standard of 
living he was able to provide during his lifetime.
<P>
	Motion M-306 suggests establishing a fund that would not be a 
government fund but would collect donations from all parts of 
Canada and even outside the country. When tragedies occur, or 
even when a police officer dies, some people want to make a 
contribution to charity. This would be an excellent way to 
encourage Canadians to make contributions in the name of police 
officers and, of course, firefighters. They could do so for peace 
officers in general, even for crossing guards, who often  more 
anonymously put their lives on the line to protect society's 
youngest members, our children.
<P>
	So, we will certainly not oppose a central fund such as this. I see 
it as a progressive measure that will make more money available 
for victims.
<P>
	Our society too often tends to forget the victims, not only the 
murder victims, but the survivors who must mourn a loss and live 
with the financial consequences of a criminal act.
<P>
	I think a central fund for contributions would be a modest 
gesture on our part. It would of course be given the tax protection 
afforded by the Income Tax Act for registered charities. We would 
have not only a basic instrument, but the means to provide 
economic security to the bereaved families of public safety 
officers, too many of whom lose their lives in the line of duty, 
because obviously we cannot bring back the person.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	Finally, since it is a sort of collective bereavement, where 
society mourns the death of those representing public order, I think 
everyone would feel the better for it.
<P>
	So, on behalf of the official opposition, I am pleased to support 
Motion No. 306 tabled by the hon. member for Mississauga South.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise on Motion No. 306.
<P>
	Prior to coming to this House I had the occasion to work closely 
with police officers in my work with Youth in Conflict with the 
Law. As well, when I was on Waterloo city council I had the 
occasion to work with firefighters in my community in Waterloo. 
Now, as a member of Parliament, I have in my constituency 
firefighters from the city of Kitchener as well as volunteer 
firefighters from Woolwich Township. They are one of the finest 
groups I have the honour and privilege of knowing.
<P>
	As well, these people are on duty 24 hours a day. Be it 
Christmas, New Year or any other holiday, we know that 
firefighters, the police officers and other emergency workers are at 
work while the rest of us are enjoying festivities.
<P>
	In many cases police officers are the only social workers, if you 
will, available after hours. It is quite humourous because the old 
line police officers did not see themselves as social workers. That 
is what they are and that is what they have done. These people 
represent a very real safety net in the case of emergency in our 
community.
<P>
	When I was on city council I used to joke with the firefighters. I 
told them that they were one group of people who worked for the 
city whom I did not want to see work and I hoped they had no work 
to do. The fact is  when that alarm bell rings and the call comes in, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8037"> 8037 </A></B>
<P>
firefighters are quickly on the move to make their way to a fire or 
to respond to a three tier response, where any emergency might 
take place where life is threatened. That might be at the scene of an 
accident where they will go with the jaws of life, saving lives.
<P>
	What impresses me about them is every time they go on one of 
those calls they put their life at risk. It was about four years ago that 
Captain Kieswetter went to a house fire in Kitchener and lost his 
life when he was overcome by smoke. He gave his life in terms of 
service to his community.
<P>
<B>(1815 )</B>
<P>
	Back in the mid-eighties there was a fire at Horticultural 
Technologies. Many dangerous chemicals were part of the fire. The 
final decision has not yet come down, since it is before the courts, 
as to why six firefighters a few years later died of cancer or why the 
first police officer at the scene died of cancer. There is an inquiry 
investigating the circumstances of that fire.
<P>
	We know that when those individuals respond they respond to 
very dangerous situations.
<P>
	Oftentimes I walk to the back of the Parliament Buildings to 
look over the Ottawa River and Hull. Sometimes I stop by the 
monument which is dedicated to police officers and peace officers. 
There are hundreds of names of individuals on the monument who 
gave their lives in the line of duty, serving their fellow citizens and 
their communities.
<P>
	What this motion addresses is the need for financial 
compensation to take care of the families and loved ones of the 
people who are on the front lines and who in the line of duty give 
their lives.
<P>
	I applaud my colleague for introducing this motion. It is 
something which Canadians will support from coast to coast to 
coast.
<P>
	I would like to read something into the record which I hear every 
time I attend a professional firefighters function in my community. 
This is the firefighters' prayer all across Canada:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When I am called to duty God,<BR>
Whenever flames may rage, <BR>
Give me the strength to save some life,<BR>
Whatever be its age.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Help me embrace a little child,<BR>
Before it is too late,<BR>
Or to save an older person from<BR>
The horror of that fate.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Enable me to be alert,<BR>
And hear the weakest shout,<BR>
And quickly and efficiently<BR>
To put the fire out.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I want to fill my calling and<BR>

Protect his property.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And if according to Your will,<BR>
It is time to end my life,<BR>
Please bless with Your protecting hand<BR>
My children and my wife.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In a very real way that is what this motion is meant to 
accomplish. I strongly endorse it and urge that we work toward 
making it a reality.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too would like to speak 
this afternoon to the motion by the member for Mississauga South 
and state the official position of the government.
<P>
	The member is proposing, as has been done before, that the 
government consider the advisability of establishing a 
compensation fund to receive gifts and bequests for the benefit of 
spouses and children of police officers and firefighters who lose 
their lives in the line of duty.
<P>
	I have no doubt that the member moved the motion out of 
concern for the welfare of men and women who, as he said, protect 
and ensure the safety of all Canadians every day. I can ensure him 
that the government shares his concerns.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	We are very aware of the vital role played by public safety 
officers in Canada as the first line of support and protection in 
crisis situations, such as fires, accidents and crimes. They perform 
these remarkable duties on behalf of each one of us, leaving 
Canadians with the calm certainty that there will always be 
assistance in case of difficulty.
<P>
	At the federal level, as you are probably aware, we have 
recognized the importance of this issue within our federal police 
force, the RCMP, which reports to the federal government. As the 
member has also pointed out, the RCMP has a death benefit plan 
for the survivors of RCMP officers who lose their lives in the line 
of duty.
<P>
	This is an example of the sort of concrete and relevant action this 
government has taken on behalf of the men and women in the 
RCMP.
<P>
	In addition, the collective agreement of federal correctional 
services officers, who are also peace officers and who come under 
federal jurisdiction, provides a death benefit.
<P>
	As well, there is a pension paid to the families of correctional 
officers who lose their lives in the line of duty, as there is for the 
RCMP. This also applies to customs officers, game wardens, and 
all other public servants who are federal peace officers.
<P>
	What is more, every year, the government supports and 
contributes to the memorial service, organized by police officers 
for the most part and held on Parliament Hill, in honour of peace 
officers who have lost their lives in the line of duty. Last year was 
the 19th such commemoration. This shows, I feel, the importance 
Canadians attach to this annual event and their recognition of those 
who have served them as peace officers and have lost their lives 
while doing so. Initially organized in memory of police officers 
who lost their lives while on duty, this service, held every 
September, is  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8038"> 8038 </A></B>
<P>
now intended to honour the memory of all peace officers who have 
lost their lives in this way.
<P>
	A memorial book containing the names of the deceased peace 
officers is generally on display in the East Block, but it is placed in 
the rotunda of the Centre Block on the day of the service.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Also in this regard, the government supported the construction 
of a memorial pavilion on Parliament Hill which symbolizes the 
appreciation of all Canadians for the sacrifices made by our peace 
officers from all jurisdictions who have been killed in the line of 
duty.
<P>
	The Police Memorial Pavilion was dedicated by the Prime 
Minister on January 22, 1994, as was already stated, and is a 
permanent recognition of all police, corrections officers and peace 
officers in Canada who died, unfortunately, in the line of duty.
<P>
	This commemoration in our capital city, next to one of our 
country's greatest symbols, is further testimony of the importance 
Canadians place on their safety and those who protect it.
<P>
	At the heart of this issue is a matter of compensation for 
provincial and municipal police officers and for firefighters, which 
I understand varies greatly throughout the country.
<P>
	Some jurisdictions have assistance for survivors but many do 
not. Public safety officers are high risk potential liabilities for 
insurance companies and affordable policies are often hard to find.
<P>
	Many families of public safety officers suffer hardship when 
their family member dies doing his or her job. This is obviously a 
concern to these families, to our communities and to our 
government.
<P>
	This motion is a laudable attempt to provide fair redress to 
families of public safety officers who died while attempting to keep 
Canada safe and secure. However, a review of the issue 
surrounding the motion indicates that there are several 
considerations that would have to be taken into account.
<P>
	The basic premise on which the hon. member's motion is 
founded is a sound one. It appeals directly to our sense of wanting 
to do what is right and just in such circumstances for the families of 
those men and women who have dedicated their lives.
<P>
	There are important questions surrounding the issues that must 
be asked and fully explored. While we all nod our heads in 
agreement about the worthiness of the hon. member's intentions, 
we need to address some fundamental issues that have a direct 
impact on this motion.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to address the question of jurisdiction. In this 
connection, members of police forces other than the RCMP, and 
firefighters covered by the definition ``public safety officer'' also 
come under the jurisdiction of the provinces or municipalities. 
Consequently, the federal government cannot assume all 
responsibilities toward these officers on its own.
<P>
	As I have said, the federal government already provides 
survivors benefits to the families of RCMP staff members who 
have lost their lives in the line of duty. We fully realize we have a 
moral obligation to ensure that all those who put their lives on the 
line, as well as their families, are not penalized as a result.
<P>
	However, as we all know, in Canada there is a division of 
jurisdictions and responsibilities between municipalities, the 
provinces and the federal government. Many of the jurisdictions 
and responsibilities covered by the definition ``public safety 
officer'' are either provincial or municipal.
<P>
	It is reasonable to expect the fund to be used to compensate the 
spouses and families of the deceased, and it is also very important 
to ensure that fair compensation is given where compensation is 
due. I would also like to say that the way the proposed fund is 
managed is something that would require further study.
<P>
	As far as these questions are concerned: jurisdiction, 
management, financing and the advisability of establishing a 
public safety officers compensation fund, I would like to stress the 
need for prior consultations with firefighters, police officers and 
their local and provincial administrations. This would not only be 
prudent but also essential in determining the best way to deal with 
this question.
<P>
	As these issues are discussed, perhaps other options could be 
considered as well. Here are a few examples: Is there a way to give 
peace officers better insurance coverage by going to the private 
sector? Should we take this opportunity to ask a private foundation 
to sponsor the fund or establish a new fund for this purpose? These 
are questions that could be further discussed with the private sector.
<P>
	I repeat that the motion before the House today is a very 
praiseworthy attempt to make just amends. I know you will agree 
when I say that all of us, in fact all Canadians, are grateful to public 
safety officers for the services they provide every day in so many 
communities across the country.
<P>
	However, the motion raises a number of questions that merit 
further study. In my capacity of Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Solicitor General, I recommend that the motion not be adopted 
until there has been further discussion, especially at the provincial 
level.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am delighted and honoured to join in the debate this 
evening on this very important Motion No. 306, brought forward 
by my hon. colleague from Mississauga South. I want to 
congratulate the member for bringing this motion forward. As we 
heard from the parliamentary secretary, it is important to debate 
these issues, to discuss them, to bring them forward and to study if 
necessary but at the same time to take an action. That is what this 
motion is all about.
<P>
	What does Motion No. 306 do and what would it accomplish? 
Those are important questions that we might all ask ourselves.
<P>
	First of all, it is intended to set up a registered charitable 
foundation to be established with a board of directors, possibly 
appointed by the Government of Canada. Subsequently the board 
would receive applications for assistance and assess the need case 
by case.
<P>
	Who would it involve? It would certainly involve the 
opportunity for various peace officers, those employed or involved 
in voluntary firefighting. Under the Criminal Code peace officer 
includes police officers and jail and prison guards.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	Having been involved for over 15 years in municipal 
government, I had the occasion to work with the police and fire 
departments on an ongoing basis. In my constituency which is 
more rural with a number of municipalities, we have a number of 
volunteer fire departments. Fires occur in those smaller towns, 
villages, communities and rural areas.
<P>
	Each time the firefighters are called out there is a risk to them. 
Does that stop them from volunteering their time, talent and 
energy? No, it does not. They are still prepared to be volunteers 
because they see the need in the community for helping their fellow 
human beings. Whether it be a life and death situation or property 
damage, they are prepared to go and do their part.
<P>
	Anyone who has personally experienced a fire in their home will 
agree it is quite a scare to be called from a meeting to be told: 
``Your house is on fire. You had better follow the fire truck because 
it is going to your home''. It is a terrible feeling. I experienced that 
once.
<P>
	I was the mayor of my municipality at the time, which the 
parliamentary secretary can appreciate. I was chairing a meeting 
when I was called and told: ``There is a fire at your home. We just 
got the call''. The furnace had blown up. By the time I had arrived, 
the fire truck was there and the firemen were doing their jobs. It is 
scary to see a red hot furnace chimney with the sparks literally 
coming from it.
<P>
	I have a great deal of respect for firemen, especially those who 
volunteer their time and energy. Just to finish the story so I will not 
leave members in suspense, my home was saved. There was a 
tremendous amount of smoke damage but there were no injuries. 
The point I am trying to make is that it was due to the prompt and 
efficient attention of those firefighters who were there and I will 
never forget it.
<P>
	Most of us would be lost and would not know the right thing to 
do in those situations. We would not have the coolness under the 
stress of those situations. But those firefighters just took it in hand 
as if it were an ordinary everyday thing. Of course for them and 
with their training and dedication, it was.
<P>
	I have a great deal of respect for Motion No. 306 which has been 
brought forward. What might it do for those who would have lost 
their lives or what might it do for their families that are left behind, 
their children and their spouses?
<P>
	We all know that the cost of education has increased over the 
years. In those situations where the lives of firefighters, police 
officers, jail guards and prison guards have been snuffed out just 
like that, the intent is to have a fund set up to receive bequests and 
donations.
<P>
	It is not something the taxpayer would be burdened with but 
would be a fund to receive donations from those who have received 
assistance, like myself. For example, because of the tremendous 
service I received, I might want to donate to such a fund, not as a 
taxpayer but as a person who would like to make a donation or 
bequest. After receiving applications the board would decide the 
needs and the merits on a case by case basis.
<P>
<B>(1835)</B>
<P>
	That is what the motion is about. There will be no cost to the 
taxpayers, but there will be an opportunity to make bequests, 
donations or gifts which could assist the families of those dedicated 
persons who put their lives on the line day in and day out, night in 
and night out for Canadians. For us. It is an opportunity for us to set 
up a fund and a foundation so that we in turn may assist them.
<P>
	I congratulate my colleague from Mississauga South for 
bringing this motion forward. I hope in the future the studies 
mentioned by the parliamentary secretary will be carried out. Then 
we might one day see the fund set up so that we can provide 
assistance when it is needed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to say a few words in support of MotionNo. 306 from the member for Mississauga South. The motion calls 
upon the government to participate in establishing a foundation 
which would be self-funded, not funded by government, in a way 
that would provide some compensation at the time of death of a 
peace officer or firefighter.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8040"> 8040 </A></B>
<P>
	The concept is one whose time has come. Beyond all doubt, 
Canadians realize that we have a moral obligation to recognize 
the extremely valuable and sometimes very risky work done by 
police officers and firefighters on our behalf 24 hours a day. It 
is beyond debate. All parties have recognized that adequately in 
the House.
<P>
	Some places in the country do have adequate compensation for 
widows and orphans, the survivors of the deceased, but some 
places do not. We have a spotty non-comprehensive system to 
provide this type of compensation.
<P>
	The proposal would create a vehicle which would be the trustee 
of funds provided by gifts or legacies whereby compensation 
would be made. It does not require government management. The 
fund will be managed with its own resources by people selected by 
the foundation.
<P>
	Is there a jurisdiction problem? Some members seem to think so, 
but I do not think so. I think jurisdiction is being used as a reason 
for further study. I do not think jurisdiction is a problem here any 
more than it was a problem when Parliament set up the Canadian 
Race Relations Foundation. In that case an arms length foundation 
was set up. We gave it $10 million of taxpayers' money and said: 
``Here. You are on your own. Go do your job. Here is what you do. 
Report to us annually. Do a good job for Canadians''.
<P>
	In this case there will not be a nickel of taxpayers' money. We 
are simply providing the vehicle. I do not quite understand how this 
could be a jurisdictional problem. Maybe someday we will see 
through the fog.
<P>
	This particular initiative signals a need for leadership to put in 
place a vehicle which is necessary. It is a need which has been 
recognized by groups and organizations that represent our peace 
officers and firefighters. For those who choose to serve the public 
in the way that peace officers and firefighters do in accepting the 
risks that are there, we can do no less than to encourage and 
participate in the effort.
<P>
<B>(1840)</B>
<P>
	Although something concrete may not follow from this 
particular effort in the House this evening and the valuable 
contribution by the member for Mississauga South, I am hopeful 
that creative ways can be found, that the leadership can be found in 
and around this capital. I am sure there are ways to do this with or 
without the participation of the government.
<P>
	I am fairly certain that no matter what happens, any initiative 
that evolves will have the support and encouragement of the 
government. I intend to work with those who will continue to look 
to find a way to make this happen.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guy H. Arseneault (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I know that time is running  out but I would like to also 
lend my support to the motion of the hon. member today.
<P>
	To all of the firefighters, police officers and peace officers who 
have active duty in my region of Restigouche-Chaleur and the 
region of the Madawaska, I would like to lend my support. I would 
like to reiterate why the fund is being proposed.
<P>
	Canadians are well aware of the daily risks that face our police 
and firefighters as they serve our emergency needs. When one of 
them loses their life in the line of duty, all of us mourn their loss. 
This fund will be a tangible way for Canadians and 
parliamentarians to honour their courageous service and assist their 
love ones in their time of need.
<P>
	Likewise, like other members, I do not foresee that this would be 
a burden on the taxpayer. This would be a voluntary fund that 
would be set up and administered outside of government. It would 
be voluntary and it would not be a cost to the taxpayer.
<P>
	I would also like to lend my support to this motion. The time has 
come.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The proposer of the motion is entitled to 
sum up. He has two minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is 
not a votable motion. I want the police officers, firefighters, the 
police association and fire chiefs to know that in talking to my 
colleagues in the House I would say there is virtually unanimous 
support for pursuing this concept of a fund to assist the families of 
those public safety officers who lose their lives in the line of duty. 
It is going to take a bit of work but I think very slowly and even 
tonight I have heard of some opportunities and we may be able to 
move this forward even further.
<P>
	Members here have been very kind. I know they are sincere in 
the gratitude on behalf of their constituents and indeed on behalf of 
all Canadians that we extend not only to those police officers, 
firefighters and peace officers, but also to their families. I am sure 
it is very difficult for all of us to appreciate what it must mean to a 
family knowing that their loved one is out there at a high risk 
scenario and that one day tragedy may occur because it is part of 
the job.
<P>
	It is a unique situation. We know tragic circumstances occur. We 
want to say now to all of them, thank you for your courageous 
service. We will not forget those who have lost their lives in the 
line of duty on behalf of the Canadian people. Thank you very 
much.
<P>
	I hope that one day soon this matter will come back before the 
House with the specifics and we can have that public safety officers 
compensation fund established in Canada by the Parliament of 
Canada for the people of Canada on behalf of public safety officers.

<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="NUCLEARENERGY">NUCLEAR ENERGY</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, further to my question, the issue of nuclear safety in 
Canada comes up again and again.
<P>
	In her response, the Minister of Natural Resources reminded us 
that Canada has a lengthy history in terms of advocating the 
destruction of nuclear weapons and that all nuclear activity in 
Canada is conducted only after the most stringent safety and 
security measures are put into place.
<P>
	As Chair of the natural resources committee, I studied clause by 
clause the nuclear legislation that is currently before the House. As 
a result, I have a true appreciation for the complex issues that 
surround nuclear safety in this country.
<P>
	Moreover, I have a true appreciation for the concerns of my 
constituents and other Canadians who, while acknowledging the 
contribution of nuclear power to meet our energy needs, insist, and 
rightly so, that nuclear activity in Canada be undertaken only while 
adhering to the strictest environmental standards.
<P>
	I recently met with several concerned individuals in my riding 
who were members of an organization devoted to maintaining high 
standards in nuclear safety.
<P>
	Like these individuals and others like them, I am committed to 
protecting Canada's environment and natural resources. Our 
federal government has an ongoing commitment to environmental 
protection in Canada and has advanced this cause considerably 
since the original Canadian Environmental Protection Act took 
effect in 1988.
<P>
	We know that some toxic substances do not break down naturally 
but stay in our food, water and soil and accumulate over time. To 
better protect the environment and the health of Canadians from 
these toxins, we introduced a new act in December 1996 to manage 
toxic substances more effectively, improve the application of 
regulation and encourage public participation and co-operation 
between governments.
<P>
	The bottom line is that it is better to prevent pollution than to try 
to manage it after it has been created. It is this  same principle that 
guides the nuclear safety legislation which establishes the 
Canadian nuclear safety commission and contains measures that 
protect the environment.
<P>
	This nuclear safety legislation replaces the Atomic Energy 
Control Act with a modern statute to provide for more explicit and 
effective regulations of nuclear energy.
<P>
	Formulation of the Canadian nuclear safety commission 
underlies its separate role from research, development and 
marketing, and recognizes that since the original act was first 
adopted in 1946 the mandate of the regulatory agency has evolved 
from one of primarily national security to one primarily focused on 
the control of health, safety and environmental consequences of 
nuclear activities.
<P>
	This legislation provides the Canadian nuclear safety 
commission with a mandate to establish and enforce national 
standards in these areas. It also establishes a basis for 
implementing Canadian policy and fulfilling Canada's obligation 
with respect to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.
<P>
	The legislation brings the enforcement powers of compliance 
and penalties for infractions into line with current legislative 
practices. The commission is empowered to require financial 
guarantees to order remedial action in hazardous situations and to 
require responsible parties to bear the cost of decontamination, all 
measures that will help protect the environment.
<P>
	The constituents in my riding care about their environment. 
Canadians care and so does this Liberal government. On behalf of 
my constituents, I would appreciate that the parliamentary 
secretary further address these issues.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Cowling (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to reassure the 
hon. member and all Canadians that before any full scale project 
involving the Bruce reactors could proceed, it would be subject to a 
full assessment and licensing approval of relevant federal and 
provincial safety, health and environmental regulatory authorities.
<P>
	The approval process would include provisions for public input. 
If the requirements for public health and safety could not be met a 
MOX fuel project involving Canadian based CANDU reactors 
would not proceed.
<P>
	Let me emphasize why Canada supports in principle the MOX 
fuel initiative. Weapons usable plutonium in Russia and the United 
States could present a clear danger because it can be remade into 
nuclear weapons.
<P>
<B>(1850 )</B>
<P>
	The use of MOX fuel in power reactors for the generation of 
electricity would represent a tangible contribution to world peace 
and security.
<P>
	Some may ask why the U.S. does not use MOX fuel in its own 
reactors. The U.S. has included its own light  water reactors as well 
as Canadian based CANDU reactors in its final list of options. It 
has included CANDU reactors in its final list because it offers the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="8042"> 8042 </A></B>
<P>
possibility of the disposing of both Russian and U.S. plutonium in 
symmetry in a trusted third country.
<P>
	AECL has tested fuel at its labs over the last 30 years. The MOX 
fuel performance test at Chalk River laboratories' NRU reactor is 
required in order to ensure that the MOX fuel is suitable for use in 
CANDU reactors.
<P>
	The AECB will be assessing the details of the test program and it 
will proceed only if the AECB confirms that plutonium will remain 
secure and that there will be no health risks to the workers at the 
Chalk River laboratories, to the public or to the environment.
<P>
	In conclusion, I reiterate that Canada has a role to play in 
enhancing world peace and security. This could include playing a 
role, as a trusted third party, in helping to ensure that weapons 
usable plutonium in Russia and the U.S.-

	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, last Friday I 
rose in my place to ask a question concerning the results of the 
labour force statistics which showed that there was an appalling 
lack of employment opportunities for the youth of this country and 
that the appalling situation has existed throughout the mandate of 
this government.
<P>
	The data were quite clear. The participation rate for most 
Canadians runs between 63 per cent and 64.8 per cent, but for 
young people the participation rate dropped from 62.7 per cent 
back in 1989, which made it fairly close to the average for all 
Canadians, to an abysmal 48.8 per cent at the end of 1996.
<P>
	It seemed to me that the loss of these 25,000 or 30,000 jobs 
among the youth group alone last year was reason enough for 
Canadians to begin to ask their government why this situation has 
resulted.
<P>
	I know that in the answer the government is going to talk about 
the youth employment strategy which it unveiled today, but I would 
remind it that when the electors made it government they were 
assured in the red book that there would be apprenticeship training 
programs and programs where the government and employers 
would join together to provide the experience needed for young 
people to become acceptable full time workers. None of that has 
happened.
<P>
	What is being proposed is basically a subsidy for private 
business and government departments to hire university students. 
The strategy is almost exclusively in that direction.
<P>
	The opportunities for young people under 25 and even under 30 
are so abysmal in this country that we are beginning to look like 
some of the less developed countries across the world.
<P>
	Young people are not lazy. They are not stupid. They are well 
educated. They just have not had the chance to work in a job.
<P>
	In the less developed countries young people have begun to 
invent jobs for themselves. They are street musicians. They are 
buskers. They are entertainers on the streets. They are squeegee 
kids who dart in and out at stoplights to clean windshields. That is 
the kind of stuff which ten years ago we saw only in less developed 
countries. Now we are seeing it in Canada. Right here, close to 
Parliament Hill in Ottawa, at the corner of Colonel By and 
Wellington we see it every day.
<P>
	This is the only way these people have of making any kind of a 
living. It is time the government took more responsibility and lived 
up to the promises it made to the people when it took over the 
responsibility of running the federal government. It should be more 
attuned to the special needs of the very young, to make certain that 
the jobs program as promised is worked on.
<P>
	After three and a half years all we have is program that is 
basically a repeat of most of the old programs that were tried years 
ago before expenditure became something government was 
extremely worried about and so those programs were cut.
<P>
	There should be programs that encourage or force large 
employers to take on young people as apprentices. Instead what we 
have is a non-policy, and what has resulted is young people are 
volunteering for jobs, working in restaurants as waiters and 
waitresses for nothing hoping to get some tips. They are 
volunteering in offices for nothing-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member's time has expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guy H. Arseneault (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, investing in our young people is an investment in 
Canada's future. The youth employment strategy announced today 
by the Minister of Human Resources Development provides us 
with the tools we need to help thousands of young Canadians enter 
today's complex and demanding labour market.
<P>
	The strategy aims to reach more young Canadians and give them 
better access to the information services and resources they need to 
acquire the skills and experience for today's workforce. The 
strategy builds on what works, strengthening existing programs 
that help young Canadians bridge the gap between school and 
work.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="8043"> 8043 </A></B>
<P>
	For example, Youth Service Canada and Youth Internship 
Canada will focus on the needs of youth who face serious 
disadvantages entering the job market.  Student Summer Job 
Action will receive increased funding in 1997 to help more than 
60,000 young people get career related summer jobs.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The strategy will also give participants work experience in 
sectors that could provide long term employment. In partnership 
with the private sector, non profit agencies and community 
organizations, new internships will be created for the more than 
110,000 young people in sectors like science and technology, the 
environment, international trade and international development.
<P>
	Internship programs for the first nations and for the Inuit will be 
given new resources to enable young native people living on the 
reserve and in northern communities to acquire skills and work 
experience.
<P>
	Young people must have access to the information they need to 
find job opportunities. We have set up centralized services 
available on the Internet and by calling 1-800-935-5555, in 
publications and at youth information fairs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The youth employment strategy consolidates and builds-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry, the hon. parliamentary 
secretary's time has expired.
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been 
adopted. Accordingly, the House stands adjourned until tomorrow 
at 10 a.m.
