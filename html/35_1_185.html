<I>Hansard</I> yesterday. I had a wrong number and I want to correct 
the mistake on page 11553.
<P>
	I said that we are going to be spending $9 billion on interest 
payments for every dollar that is cut. What I meant to say was, 
for the $9 billion in cuts that were made, we will be spending 
about $9 billion in interest as well. For every dollar cut, there 
will be an extra dollar in interest payments on the deficit.

was based on information that I had received. In fact, the charge 
has not been laid at this stage. It would be inappropriate for me 
to indicate if and when the RCMP is laying the charge. That 
information would better come from the RCMP itself.

	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 36, I am pleased to present two 
petitions from constituents in my riding of Comox-Alberni.
<P>
	The first petition contains 607 signatures and deals with 
section 241 of the Criminal Code. Section 241 makes aiding, 
abetting or counselling a person to commit suicide an indictable

offence. The petitioners request that Parliament not repeal or 
amend section 241 of the Criminal Code in any way and to 
uphold the Supreme  Court of Canada decision of September 30, 
1993 to disallow assisted suicide euthanasia.

	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in

	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, pursuant 
to Standing Order 36 I have the honour on behalf of some 
constituents of the Vegreville constituency to table a petition in 
the House today. The 26 petitioners are requesting Parliament to 
continue to give the Canadian Wheat Board monopoly powers in 
marketing wheat and barley for export.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="THEDEFICIT">THE DEFICIT</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Jag Bhaduria (Markham-Whitchurch-Stouffville, 
Ind. Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 36 I am 
presenting a petition signed by petitioners in the 
Markham-Whitchurch-Stouffville area. These petitioners 
call on Parliament to reduce the deficit by cutting wastage and 
reducing the overall expense of every government department 
by at least 5 per cent.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="UNEMPLOYMENTINSURANCE">UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Charles Hubbard (Miramichi, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 36 I have a petition signed by more 
than 400 constituents in a very rural and remote area on the 
westerly side of Miramichi. They feel they are being 
discriminated against by the Unemployment Insurance Act.
<P>
<B>(1015 ) </B>
<P>
	They petition Parliament to reform the UI boundaries, which 
affect their remote and isolated communities in a negative way. 
They believe they are not being treated fairly under that 
commission.

	<B>Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand-Norfolk, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I also rise, pursuant to Standing Order 36, to present a number of 
petitions from constituents in my riding who have concerns 
about the present firearms legislation.
<P>
	These constituents call on the government to support laws that 
will severely punish violent criminals, which of course the 
minister has, but to also support legislation that will repeal and 
modify existing gun control laws, which have not improved 
public safety or have not proven to be cost effective.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SEXUALORIENTATION">SEXUAL ORIENTATION</A></H4>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 36, I too would like to present 
petitions. One is from the constituents of Beaver River, 
Redwater, Thorhild, Radway, and the Waskatenau area, who are 
calling upon Parliament to be very careful about the Canadian 
Human Rights Act, to make sure there is not the inclusion of 
sexual orientation.
<P>
	They are saying that because the inclusion of sexual 
orientation in the Canadian Human Rights Act would provide 
certain groups with special status, rights and privileges and that 
they would be granted solely on the basis of sexual behaviour, 
that inclusion would infringe on the historic rights of Canadians, 
such as the freedom of religion, conscience, expression and 
association.
<P>
	These people are humbly calling upon Parliament to oppose 
any amendments to the Canadian Human Rights Act or the 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms that provide for the inclusion of 
the phrase ``sexual orientation''.
<P>
	I present those with pride as the member for Beaver River.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 36, I am pleased to present in the 
House today four petitions from my riding.
<P>
	The first petition deals with a request for the Government of 
Canada not to amend the Human Rights Act to include the 
undefined phrase ``sexual orientation''. Refusing to define this 
statement leaves interpretation open to the courts, a very 
dangerous precedent to set. Parliament has a responsibility to 
Canadians to ensure that legislation cannot be misinterpreted.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="GUNCONTROL">GUN CONTROL</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
second petition is on the subject of Bill C-68, the gun control 
bill. The petitioners believe the target for all gun control laws in 
the Criminal Code of Canada must be the criminals who are a 
danger to the public safety, not law-abiding, responsible 
firearm owners.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CHILDCARE">CHILD CARE</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
third petition is on the subject of child care. The petitioners 
believe current federal government child care policies are 
intrusive and discriminate against many families. They believe 
parents should have the freedom to make the choices about what 
type of child care is best for their families.
<P>
	The petitioners request Parliament to oppose any legislation 
that will increase child care expenditures.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="JUSTICE">JUSTICE</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the final 
petition is on the subject of drinking and violence. The 
petitioners were shocked by the recent Supreme Court decision, 
and 
<P>

<B><A NAME="11573"> 11573 </A></B>
<P>
they believe all individuals must be held fully responsible for 
their actions, even while under the influence of alcohol.
<P>
	I concur with these petitions.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="GOVERNMENTSPENDING">GOVERNMENT SPENDING</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to present a petition signed by over 800 people in my 
riding of Red Deer. The citizens express their concern that they 
are already overburdened with taxation due to high government 
spending. Therefore, the petitioners humbly pray and request 
that Parliament reduce government spending instead of 
increasing taxes and implement a taxpayer protection act to 
limit federal spending.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="YOUNGOFFENDERS">YOUNG OFFENDERS</A></H4>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I did 
not want to take too much time. We do have 15 minutes. I have a 
couple of other petitions. One is on the Young Offenders Act, 
signed by a number of people from St. Paul, Saddle Lake, St. 
Vincent, and a number of other places across Beaver River. They 
want an act that is serious enough to deter young people from 
committing crimes and tough enough to provide real justice.
<P>
	The Young Offenders Act in its current form is not meeting 
the objectives. These people are calling upon Parliament to 
make sure we have a really forceful Young Offenders Act, in 
addition to the Criminal Code.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADIANBROADCASTINGCORPORATION">CANADIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION</A></H4>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
also have a petition on CBC programming. The petitioners are 
concerned about Canadian broadcasting, that the CBC is playing 
programs like ``Kids in the Hall''. They do not fulfil CBC's 
mandate. These people are concerned about this particular 
program, as well as others. They are saying that these kinds of 
incidents in programs are becoming more and more frequent.
<P>
	They are asking Parliament to enact legislation that would 
provide very specific standards of acceptable conduct and 
content for CBC television programs.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="JUSTICE">JUSTICE</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my 
honour to present a petition, pursuant to Standing Order 36. The 
petitioners point out that many violent offenders and sex 
offenders are being paroled prematurely or are being released 
without proper treatment and rehabilitation. They believe that 
those people convicted of dangerous and sexual offences ought 
to remain incarcerated until they have successfully undergone 
treatment and can demonstrate unequivocally that they have 
been completely rehabilitated. They are asking that the 
government take whatever steps are necessary to assure this.

	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
morning, in addressing the issue of the budget, I would like to 
address it with specific reference to fish. I know  that hon. 
members will be relieved to hear that the issue of fish in the 
budget will be addressed this morning.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11575"> 11575 </A></B>
<P>
	Spending on fish will decline appreciably over the next three 
years. In fact, it will decline by $211 million in the next budget.
<P>
	Our party believes that government spending is out of control 
and that serious cuts should be made. That being said, our party 
recognizes that there are certain responsibilities the government 
has, including a constitutional responsibility to manage 
Canada's fisheries resource in a responsible and reasonable 
manner.
<P>
	We should not simply go into the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans and willy-nilly cut the budget. We have to do it with 
great care and caution to ensure that this valuable resource, a 
resource that could in fact be the engine of the economy on both 
coasts of our country, is protected.
<P>
	To begin with, I would like to look at a couple of points in the 
budget and discuss the impact they will have on the fisheries.
<P>
	The budget indicates that the government will negotiate with 
the provinces to transfer authorities for freshwater habitat 
management and other related inland responsibilities. In other 
words, the government's objective is to transfer its 
constitutional responsibility for the inland fisheries resource to 
the provinces. At the outset, that may seem like a reasonable 
objective. The fact of the matter is, it denies a very critical 
problem in the country, that is, the difficulty that is faced by 
many resource-based communities in our country, communities 
where the resource extraction may be seasonal, where 
populations are growing, and where transportation routes are 
very difficult. That is a problem that we must address as a 
nation. It is a problem that exists not only in the more remote 
northern regions of the prairie provinces, but it is also a problem 
that is becoming more and more evident in the province of 
Newfoundland, for example.
<P>
	Last spring, in the standing committee hearings on problems 
in Newfoundland, the same types of social problems that we 
have heard about for years, which are occurring and have 
occurred in the northern communities, in prairie provinces and 
in the territories, are appearing now in Newfoundland because 
of the loss of a very valuable fisheries resource.
<P>
<B>(1025 ) </B>
<P>
	The federal government, in trying to sidestep its 
responsibilities in this area, will help no one.
<P>
	Another issue in the budget states: ``to integrate the 
operations and fleet of the Canadian Coast Guard with the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans in order to increase 
efficiency''. We are all for increasing efficiency. The issue that 
must be determined is if we downsize both fleets and use one 
smaller fleet to cover both objectives, what will be the priority 
of that fleet? If the priority is maintaining navigation aids when 
there is an ongoing fishery, what happens to the enforcement in 
the fisheries  resource? By the same token, if the coast guard 
vessels are going to be diverted to the fishery, what happens to 
the aids to navigation?
<P>
	We have to look at combining these two operations, but we 
must make sure that our priorities and responsibilities are 
maintained. Simply cutting back on the number of vessels and 
personnel available is not going to do the job.
<P>
	This government fell down badly on this point in this past 
salmon season. In the past the coast guard was given the 
authority on the west coast to enforce fishery law. This did not 
happen in the 1994 season.
<P>
	One instance was reported to me where a coast guard vessel 
was returning from an operational patrol of Vancouver Island. It 
was called to the Tsawwassen ferry terminal by the B.C. Ferry 
Corporation because of illegal fishing activity by Americans in 
Canadian waters. When the coast guard vessel arrived it did not 
have the authority to arrest those vessels. All it could do was 
advise them to leave Canadian waters. They tried to contact the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans, but no one was available. 
At that hour of the day the offices were closed and the only 
contact they had was with a fisheries officer far up river who 
said: ``I'm monitoring a fishery up here, there is nothing I can 
do''.
<P>
	We must make sure that our priorities are clearly established 
if we are going to follow the route the government proposes.
<P>
	There is a proposal to rationalize commercial fishing 
harbours, including implementing higher fees for use. I have 
nothing against paying our own way. My party strongly supports 
that principle. The last thing we want to do is impose fees on 
people when they are on their knees. That is the case on both 
coasts. It is an inappropriate time to increase taxes on the fishing 
industry when it is hardly able to make a living.
<P>
	Much of the responsibility for that falls not only on this 
government, of course, but on previous governments.
<P>
	The government also seeks to enter into partnerships with the 
fishing industry and others in the management of capacity, 
licensing and compliance, and it says it looks to industry to pay 
more for access privileges, contribute toward the cost of 
managing the fishery and pay higher fees for services. Again, 
this comes at a time when mismanagement by the federal 
government has seriously weakened the ability of the fishing 
industry to pay, not only on the east coast but also on the west 
coast.
<P>
	The collapse of the fishery in 1994 was the direct 
responsibility and directly attributable to the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans. It was a devastation, the effect of which 
will take probably 12 years from which to recover on the west 
coast for that cycle of fish. Yet we are expecting fishermen to 
pay higher licensing fees when it will be very difficult for them 
to maintain payments on their boats, let alone absorb higher 
licensing fees. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11576"> 11576 </A></B>
<P>
The same can be said, of course, for the problems on the east 
coast.
<P>
	The cut of $211 million from the budget of the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans is something that must be done very 
carefully, as I suggested earlier.
<P>
<B>(1030 ) </B>
<P>
	The Department of Fisheries and Oceans has experienced 
serious budget cuts over the last two or three years. The effects 
of those cuts, particularly on the west coast, have been dramatic.
<P>
	I want to quote the concerns expressed by fisheries officers to 
the minister on November 2, 1994. The fisheries officers were 
pointing out the difficulties they have experienced because of 
budget cuts. They suggested that budget allocations did not 
provide for the successful delivery of programs and untrained 
staff members were not able to carry out enforcement controls. 
The monitoring of the catch was affected and so on.
<P>
	Three months before the opening of the 1994 fishery season, 
senior fisheries officials on the west coast were warning of a 
disaster if the level of enforcement was further downgraded. I 
will quote from a report by R.K. Carson, area manager, Fraser 
River division. He says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The impact of a further-cut will have significant ramifications on the 
success of the implementation of the AFS agreements along the Fraser River. 
The reduced level of fishery officers and fishery guardians-will result in 
non-compliance with terms and conditions of agreements, licences, 
regulations and loss of control of this fishery. The resource will suffer and we 
could have another repeat of the `missing sockeye' problems that occurred in 
the 1992 season.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is exactly what happened.
<P>
	In a report by D. Aurel, chief, conservation and protection, 
New Westminster, it was noted as well that budget cuts would 
reduce the free trade officer's allotment in the fisheries. He 
points out that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-a 1993 investigation into the illegal export of two million pounds of 
chum salmon has resulted in 15 charges pending against one fish processing 
company. These types of serious FTA violations cannot be investigated by one 
officer alone.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The list goes on. However, when we cut in a department like 
fisheries we must do it with care.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I welcome this opportunity to speak this morning to the 
amendment proposed by the hon. member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot. This debate on Bill C-76, on 
provisions to implement certain changes in the 1995-96 Budget 
that will affect transfers to the provinces, concerns all 
Canadians and Quebecers.
<P>
	I would like to start with a short summary of the major 
changes introduced by the 1995-96 Budget, after which, as the 
official opposition's representative for seniors organizations, I 
will try to show what the federal government has in mind with its 
plan to reduce old age pensions in 1997.
<P>
	Transfers to the provinces are not changed by the 1995-96 
budget. Today, there are three main transfer programs: 
Established Programs Financing, $21.73 billion; equalization, 
$8.87 billion; and the Canada Assistance Plan, $7.95 billion. 
The federal budget did not make any changes in the equalization 
program but it has extended the ceiling provision for 
equalization for a period of five years.
<P>
	Section 48 in Bill C-76 will deprive Quebec of $650 million 
in 1996-97. Bill C-76 proposes new national standards for 
health care and provides for establishing new national standards 
for social assistance and post-secondary education. This new 
federalism does not decentralize at all. These national standards 
will restrict the autonomy of the provinces in their own 
jurisdictions.
<P>
	The government is trying to minimize the significance of 
these cuts, although they are in fact devastating for the 
provincial governments, especially for Quebec. The 
government includes tax point transfers in its figures on cuts in 
transfer payments to the provinces. The federal government has 
no control over tax transfers paid to the provinces under its main 
transfer programs.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	In fact, all financial transfers, cash transfers paid to the 
Government of Quebec, will be reduced by 32 per cent between 
1994-95 and 1997-98, as a result of cuts in transfers to the 
provinces.
<P>
	A sovereign Quebec would lose federal transfer payments but 
recover the $30 billion in taxes Quebecers are now paying to the 
federal government.
<P>
	The latest budget cuts implemented by Bill C-76 will hit the 
most vulnerable in our society. The Quebec Minister of Finance 
estimates that these cuts and transfers to the provinces will 
reduce the federal contribution to social programs funding from 
37.8 per cent to 28.5 per cent between 1994-95 and 1997-98. 
The federal government is intervening in areas that are under 
provincial jurisdiction and may make additional cuts in the cash 
portion of transfers to the provinces.
<P>
	As the official opposition's representative for seniors 
organizations, I am very concerned about the old age pension 
reform announced by the government, which will become 
effective in 1997. In 1994, they said a document would be tabled 
very shortly, but the government has delayed production of this 
document, preferring to wait until after the referendum in 
Quebec.
<P>
	In fact the government announced that the most 
disadvantaged seniors will not lose any protection. This means 
that the pensions of those defined as having high incomes will be 
reduced and that the reductions in their pensions will not go to 
raising the pensions of low income seniors, who have only the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11577"> 11577 </A></B>
<P>
assurance that their pensions will not be cut. So, some will have 
their benefits reduced and no one will receive an increase.
<P>
	Another important point has to do with family income 
determining pension eligibility. This measure is unacceptable, 
since women have fought for financial independence for 
decades.
<P>
	It is not a new measure. The government was preparing 
similar changes to the unemployment insurance plan as part of 
the social program reform. Given women's general opposition 
to the idea, the Liberal majority on the Standing Committee on 
Human Resources Development did not recommend linking 
benefit levels to family income levels. This is in the report by 
the committee on social program reform.
<P>
	It is noteworthy that old age pensions have already been 
reduced for seniors with an income over $53,000. The Liberals 
decided, in the last budget, to reduce the tax credit for seniors 
with an income over $25,000. The federal government is 
continuing to go after the incomes of seniors, particularly those 
in the middle class.
<P>
	Old age pensions are a major source of revenue for seniors. 
Federal government documents indicate that old age security 
and guaranteed income supplements accounted for 28.9 per cent 
of the income of single men; 41.3 per cent of the income of 
single women and 25.9 per cent of the income of couples, in 
1989.
<P>
	The government announced a review of the Canada pension 
plan, the CPP, for the fall. The federal and provincial finance 
ministers are scheduled to meet as part of the five-year review 
of the Canada pension plan. They will use this opportunity to 
claim that a review of old age pensions is mandatory.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	The federal government does not have to change the old age 
pension system unless, that is, it wants to cut the budget at the 
expense of seniors.
<P>
	Quebec seniors had the opportunity to state their opinions on 
their future at hearings of the seniors' commission on the future 
of Quebec. The chairperson of the committee was a minister in 
the former Conservative government, Monique Vézina. This 
consultation has shown that seniors across the country have 
similar concerns, mostly about their social and economic 
situation.
<P>
	Quebec is going through a difficult economic period. Some of 
the witnesses at the hearings told of the problems they are 
having with unemployment or poverty because of the constant 
threat of cuts to social programs and the health care system.
<P>
	Representatives of the Quebec Federation of Senior Citizens 
(QFSC) told the commission that their organizations were 
fighting the four main problems affecting seniors: the feeling of 
uselessness, inactivity, insecurity and isolation. Almost 
everywhere people are lobbying for society to guarantee seniors 
their rightful place. Seniors want nothing more than to use their 
experience for the good of the society they will leave behind for 
their grandchildren. It is clear that the  universality of old age 
pensions should not be tampered with.
<P>
	Lucien Bouchard, the Leader of the Official Opposition, 
recently shared with Quebecers his party's reaction to the 
federal government's position on pensioners. He said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>After hitting pensioners with annual incomes of more than $26,000 with a 
tax last year, the federal government has continued to go after them. The 
Minister of Finance has made it very clear that the universality of old age 
pensions is definitely a thing of the past, since in the future, pension benefits 
will be based on combined family income, and this will result in the loss of 
financial independence for thousands of women. By waiting until after the 
referendum to cut into social security, the federal Liberals are hiding the 
negative ramifications of their cuts from Quebecers. Be assured, Mr. Speaker, 
that the Bloc Quebecois will do its utmost to prevent the government from 
making the needed spending cuts at the expense of seniors, the unemployed 
and people who are most in need of health care, post-secondary education and 
social assistance.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The federal government should cut $2.85 billion more from 
the Department of National Defence's budget for the next three 
years instead of looking to seniors' programs next autumn to 
reduce its deficit.
<P>
	You can be sure, Mr. Speaker, that, as the official opposition 
critic for seniors' issues, I pledge to fight any proposal the 
federal government might make to reduce its deficit at the 
expense of seniors.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot tabled in this House an 
amendment that I am happy to support.
<P>
	Bill C-76 is inconsistent and the Minister of Finance should 
go back to the drawing board and introduce in this Chamber a 
bill that truly reflects what Canadians want, which is to see more 
fairness in the government's handling of its fiscal 
responsibilities.
<P>
	The absence, or in some cases, the weakness of certain 
measures in this bill are of particular concern to me. I would like 
to speak about two of them. First of all, there is the 
government's science and technology strategy. In his last report, 
the auditor general deplored the lack of a government strategy 
with respect to science and technology. He stressed the 
importance of such a strategy, in light of the liberalization of 
trade and the new technological era we would be entering in the 
21st century.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	The government must demonstrate strong leadership in this 
area, so that Canada can continue to develop technologically and 
to maintain its competitiveness on international markets. The 
standard of living of Canadians and Quebecers depends on it. 
There must be some sign of this leadership in the government's 
budget. It is the cornerstone of any strategy to put Canadians 
back to work. Unfortunately, there is not a trace in this budget of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11578"> 11578 </A></B>
<P>
any strategic planning with regard to research, science and 
technology. Worse yet, the cuts are in the areas of highest 
performance.
<P>
	I will give some examples of cuts in the funds made available 
to granting councils. The minister told us in his 1994 budget that 
he would not touch the money set aside for granting councils, 
because of the importance the federal government attached to 
research and development activities. But now, in a complete 
about-face, the Minister of Finance is cutting the councils' 
funding by more than 10 per cent, despite what he announced in 
the 1994 budget.
<P>
	In order to better understand the impact of such a decision, let 
us look at Canada's situation with respect to science and 
technology. Canada ranks sixth among the G-7 countries, just 
above Italy, when the size of its budget is considered as a 
percentage of the gross domestic product. On the other hand, 
according to the relevant trade journals, given the quality and 
use of research and the size of its population, Canada ranks 
second among the G-7 countries, after the United States.
<P>
	This situation is primarily due to the fact that granting 
councils award funds to our universities and industries on the 
basis of merit. And yet, in his report, the auditor general has 
pointed out the sorry state of our science and technology 
strategy for the last thirty years. This is not a recent 
development. For thirty years now the auditor general has 
criticized this lack of strategy. He recommends that the 
government focus mainly on the most successful research 
activities which, in our case, are those financed by granting 
councils.
<P>
	It is important to point out that most of the stakeholders 
consulted by the government, that is, the experts who testified 
during the consultations held on this issue, stressed that the 
budgets of granting councils should be maintained. These highly 
qualified consultants said that if research budgets had to be cut, 
the government should at least keep at the same level the funds 
allocated to the granting councils, given the effectiveness and 
quality of the research projects they accept, and cut elsewhere in 
the budget.
<P>
	The government ignored these consultants' 
recommendations. Not only did it cut the budgets of granting 
councils and the research budgets of all government 
departments and agencies, but it has the nerve to continue giving 
$1 billion in R&amp;D tax incentives to business, arguing that the 
consultation process is still under way. This clearly shows, once 
again, that government is holding consultations just for show 
and to smooth the way for the blind cuts it intends to implement 
in its budget.
<P>
	This is not a consultation process, my dear colleagues across 
the way. This is a case of manipulating public opinion, which 
really shows this government's deep contempt for the Canadian 
population. I also want to talk about the inequities in federal 
spending. The Bloc Quebecois has always deplored the federal 
government's flagrant inequity in its R&amp;D spending.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	In 1990-91, Ontario received a 53 per cent share of federal 
spending, while Quebec received only a 19.5 per cent share.
<P>
	The government figures I received this morning show that, 
since 1985-86, if we exclude the National Capital Region, 
Ontario has received about 22 per cent or 23 per cent of all 
federal science and technology research funds every year, while 
Quebec receives only 17 per cent. If we include the National 
Capital Region, we realize that Ontario has received 27.9 per 
cent, almost 30 per cent, every year since 1985-86, while 
Quebec receives only 3.1 per cent. That is government equity for 
you.
<P>
	If we compare what the federal government spends on natural 
sciences in Ontario and Quebec, we see that Ontario gets 
between 24 per cent and 26 per cent of federal spending each and 
every year, while Quebec's share, if we exclude the National 
Capital Region, is 19.9 per cent. There is still a 6 per cent 
difference.
<P>
	Now, if we look at what has been done in the National Capital 
Region in terms of natural sciences research, the Ontario side of 
the NCR gets 26.6 per cent while the Quebec side receives 1 per 
cent.
<P>
	It does not take a PhD to figure out that 26 less 1 equals a 25 
per cent difference. That is what the government calls budget 
equity.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunez:</B> It is inequitable.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> The quality of Quebec's industrial structure 
cannot justify the low level of federal investment in research 
and development. Especially since Quebec runs off with more 
than 30 per cent of grants awarded on merit, which clearly shows 
Quebec's competitiveness. When our projects are assessed on 
their merits, we qualify for 30 per cent of the grants, but when 
the award is motivated by favouritism, Quebec is always 
outpointed by Ontario, the other most powerful province.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Patronage.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Such an imbalance maintains provincial 
disparity in research and development funding. And the 
statistics are not mine, but the government's own. This 
imbalance has a direct impact on the provinces' rate of growth. 
In other words, this harmful policy has been operating for years. 
With this policy, some provinces get R and D funding, while 
others, like Quebec, get UI funds.
<P>
	And it goes on and on, year after year, and the government 
keeps doing nothing about it. We have been denouncing this 
kind of thing for 15 years now.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11579"> 11579 </A></B>
<P>
	Certainly cuts could have been made in other areas. Let me set 
aside my prepared speech to give you statistics I just received 
this morning.
<P>
	Where could more cuts have been made? We, Bloc members, 
often suggested National Defence. In DND estimates, 
astronomical amounts could have been saved in forecasting 
errors alone. For example, $2.8 billion are supposed to be cut 
over the next three years. Our estimation was that $5 billion 
could be cut, but DND said this was impossible. The fact is that 
these forecasts were wrong, and here is why.
<P>
	Take the closure of the base in Portage la Prairie for example. 
Savings of $411 million were expected, when in actual fact only 
$170 million was saved. A $241 million shortfall.
<P>
	With respect to space training, we were told that the cost of 
basic training was $200,000 per student, when the actual cost is 
$700,000, or $500,000 more per student. They make this kind of 
forecasting errors and come and tell us that they will be able to 
save $2.8 billion. We cannot be sure of that, Mr. Speaker. There 
will be more unforeseen deficits.
<P>
	Improving housekeeping in DND and several other 
departments would be one way of making funds available for 
research, research being the seed of successful new products 
that would promote rapid growth.
<P>
	We will have a chance to pursue this at a later time.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	For now, I suggest that these new statistics should give both 
the department and the government food for thought. The 
minister should go back to his drawing board, his operation 
table, his computations and come back with another set of 
estimates. This way, perhaps we will be able to see more eye to 
eye with the government in a few months.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am glad 
to have the opportunity to speak to Bill C-76, the budget 
implementation act.
<P>
	My Reform colleagues have already addressed the various 
components of the bill. I would like to broaden the focus and 
look at the budget as a whole. I want to go through the Liberal 
government's what I call smoke and mirrors show or budget and 
show Canadians exactly what was cut in the budget and where it 
was cut.
<P>
	Members of the government are misleading the people of 
Canada in several very important aspects. They are being 
dishonest in selling the budget. To date they have got away with 
it. Unfortunately Canadians have not recognized what has 
happened.
<P>
	Today I will expose two blatant mistruths I believe are in the 
Liberal budget and have not been clearly defined to Canadians.
<P>
	Canadians have been led to believe this was a tough budget 
which cut spending some $25 billion and that provinces got off 
easy relative to the cuts the government made in its own 
backyard.
<P>
	Reform announced its plan to balance the budget by 1998. We 
told Canadians in order to do this we would have to reduce 
spending by some $25 billion, $15 billion of which would come 
from social program spending.
<P>
	What was the Liberal reaction to this? The Prime Minister 
said such a plan would throw Canadians into a deep recession or 
perhaps a depression. The finance minister called it fiscal 
savagery and said our plan would gut the nation's social 
programs. The Minister of Human Resources Development said 
we would be blow torching the poor.
<P>
	One week later the Liberals released their budget. On page 65 
it says expenditure reductions due specifically to the actions in 
the budget total $4.1 billion in 1995-96, $9.3 billion in 1996-97 
and $11.9 billion in 1997-98. In other words, $25.3 billion 
would be in spending cuts.
<P>
	Clearly there is some double talk. When Reform proposes $25 
billion in fiscal spending cuts it is fiscal savagery which will 
hurl the country into depression and throw widows and orphans 
out on the streets. When the government makes the same 
proposal it is acting in the best interest of Canadians. It is acting 
in the best interest of the country. It is being tough but it is being 
fair. Cutting the deficit is said to increase economic growth in 
the long run.
<P>
	The government is not completely hypocritical when it is 
doing this. It does not actually cut $25.3 billion. It wants the 
financial markets to believe this, especially Moody's which is 
still trying to decide whether to downgrade Canada's credit 
rating.
<P>
	The truth is these are $25 billion in what I call make believe 
cuts. They are cuts to money that was never spent and will not be 
spent. The Liberal budget makes real spending cuts of only $15 
billion. This explains why Reform Party's $25 billion in cuts in 
the taxpayers' budget will eliminate the deficit in three years 
and why the Liberal budget will leave us with $24 billion of 
deficit. Clearly the budget was not as tough as the government 
would have us believe it was.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	The second mistruth is that government cuts in its own 
backyard first and does not offload its deficit problems on to the 
provinces. Is that true or not? Let us look at it.
<P>
	It says this on page 65 of the Budget Plan:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The expenditure cuts fall primarily on federal government operations, 
rather than transfers to provinces or to households-demonstrating that the 
government's priority has been to get its own house in order first.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Let us look at that statement. Is this true? Do the provinces get 
off lightly in comparison to other cuts in the budget? The answer 
<P>

is no and I would like to explain  why. Let us look at how much 
was really cut from the provincial transfers.
<P>
	On page 51 of the Budget Plan, it shows total transfers falling 
from $37 billion in 1994-95 to some $34 billion in 19997-98, 
for a reduction of approximately 4 per cent. This is less than cuts 
to other areas of spending, which are reduced by some 7 or 8 per 
cent.
<P>
	What is hidden in these numbers is the fact that tax point 
transfers were included in the calculation of the value of the 
transfer. This is completely misleading to Canadians and is a 
misleading statement in the budget.
<P>
	These tax points were given to provinces in 1977. In that year, 
the measure affected the budgetary position by creating a 
one-time reduction in revenues. Since that time, these tax points 
have not added one cent to the annual deficit. They ceased being 
a budgetary item.
<P>
	If one looks at the 1994 budget, one will not see any mention 
of tax points. Indeed, one will not see them in any other budget 
since 1977. They were included this year solely to confuse 
Canadians so that they would not realize the magnitude of the 
cuts that were being made.
<P>
	Since we have peeled off this tax point veneer, what lies 
underneath? What is the real truth? Total cash transfers to 
provinces, which include payments for equalization, health, 
post-secondary education and welfare will be reduced from $25 
billion in 1994-95 to $20 billion in 1997-98.
<P>
	This is a reduction of $5 billion or 20 per cent. Compare this 
to cuts being made in two other major areas of spending. The 
$38 billion in transfers to persons were virtually untouched 
being reduced by only $500 million, a minor amount.
<P>
	The $52 billion in departmental spending, which fell under 
what is called government's program review, will be reduced by 
a little less than $10 billion or 18 per cent. Clearly the provinces 
did not get off easy in the budget. They were the biggest victims 
of the budgetary cuts. They took the major hit.
<P>
	What is even more amazing is how much was cut specifically 
from health, education and welfare, the three programs that have 
been folded into what is now called Canada health and social 
transfer. Cash transfers for these three programs will fall from 
$17 billion this year to $10 billion in 1997-98. There will be a 
reduction of some $7 billion. This represents a major reduction, 
a 40 per cent reduction in federal cash transfers for health, 
education and welfare.
<P>
	Can members imagine what the Liberal opposition would say 
about a Reform government if it attempted to slash medicare by 
40 per cent? This is what the Liberals have done and nobody has 
picked up on it. The Liberals will still paint the Reformers as 
fiscal savages. They should look at the brush themselves.
<P>
<B>(1105 ) </B>
<P>
	In closing, let me clarify the purpose of my remarks. My 
intention is not to say that deep spending cuts were 
inappropriate. To the contrary, the government's budget did not 
go far enough. There will still be a $25 billion deficit when this 
party leaves office. In other words, more remains to be done.
<P>
	It is my sincere hope that once Canadians get beyond the 
government's smoke and mirrors, we will be able to begin a very 
serious dialogue with regard to fiscal policy. I hope over the next 
two to three years people will look at our taxpayers' budget and 
at the Liberal's budget and debate the strengths and weaknesses 
of both.
<P>
	If that can be accomplished, if we can elevate the national 
debate, the country will be much better off.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
discuss Bill C-76, which seeks to implement the 1995-96 
budget, as well as the amendment tabled on March 30 by the 
hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, an amendment 
which I support.
<P>
	The amendment proposes that the bill be read a second time 
only in six months. In other words, it asks the Minister of 
Finance to go back to the drawing board, because this is the 
worse possible budget for poor and ordinary people. However, it 
is an excellent budget for rich people, banks and major 
corporations.
<P>
	I already had the opportunity to denounce this budget, which 
is tough for the provinces, particularly Quebec, as well as for 
workers, immigrants and refugees, public servants and poor 
people.
<P>
	This budget provides no measures to stimulate employment or 
economic growth. Its main objective is to cut everywhere, 
particularly in social programs, unemployment insurance and 
international assistance. It only targets the poor. This so-called 
Liberal government is in fact the most conservative government 
in Canada's history.
<P>
	Both the government and the Liberal Party are making a sharp 
turn to the right. This is incredible. For example, over the next 
three years, the government will reduce by $307 million the 
money allocated to the Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation. Yet, social housing is in great need, both in Quebec 
and in Canada, and particularly in my riding of Bourassa, in 
Montréal-Nord, where many welfare recipients live and where 
there is a shortage of such units for them.
<P>
	I want to briefly comment on the report which was just 
released by the National Council of Welfare. According to that 
document, 20.7 per cent of Quebecers live in poverty. Between 
1992 and 1993, the number of people living in poverty increased 
everywhere in Canada. At the national level, the percentage of 
those living in poverty went up from 16.1 per cent, in 1992, to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11581"> 11581 </A></B>
<P>
17.4 per cent, in 1993. This is a dramatic increase in just one 
year.
<P>
	More importantly, child poverty reached a 14-year high by 
climbing up to 20.8 per cent. In 1993, there were 1,415,000 poor 
children in Canada. These children are poor because their 
parents are poor. And the parents are poor because there are not 
enough jobs in this country. Generally speaking, women are 
poorer than men. This is shameful.
<P>
<B>(1110 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Nearly half a million more Canadians became poor in 1993. 
The number of poor grew to nearly 4.8 million Canadians, from 
4.3 million the previous year. Half a million more poor people in 
Canada. It is a tragic situation.
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	This is shocking. The government should analyse this report 
carefully and act on it. I ask the government to table a plan to 
fight poverty in Canada, and I hope more members will express 
their outrage about this situation: one half million new poor.
<P>
	Significantly, 50 per cent of these people are working poor. In 
other words, they are forced to accept unusually low wages. In 
fact, the minimum wage is a scandal, both federally and 
provincially.
<P>
	Although Alberta is one of the richest provinces, it has one of 
the lowest minimum wages in Canada: $5 an hour. Our 
colleagues opposite often say we live in Canada, the best 
country in the world. I think that with these figures, Canada is 
hardly the wonderful country they say it is.
<P>
	I said that this government and the Liberal Party are leaning 
increasingly to the right. A few days ago, we saw the passage of 
back-to-work legislation in the form of Bill C-77, introduced 
by the new Minister of Labour, legislation that is a direct attack 
on the unions and denies them the right to strike, just because the 
government wants to privatize CN and get even more money for 
the Treasury.
<P>
	With this legislation, the government is trying to break the 
unions and federal employees as well, who are very disturbed 
about the loss of 45,000 jobs. The government is attacking 
social programs and the unemployed, instead of attacking 
unemployment.
<P>
	On the other hand, the government refuses to pass anti-scab 
legislation as requested by the unions. Especially in Quebec, 
where Ogilvie, for instance, whose employees have been on 
strike for months and months, continues to operate because it 
hires scabs. Once again, I want to ask the government to 
introduce anti-scab legislation.
<P>
	At the Department of Citizenship and Immigration, and I 
happen to be the official opposition critic on this matter, in 
1995-96, according to the budget, spending will total $592.7 
million and the department will have the equivalent of 4,645 
full-time employees, including 260 in Canadian missions 
abroad.
<P>
	It is outrageous, and I mentioned this before in the House, that 
more than 50 per cent of the department's budget will be 
self-financing, in other words, about $300 million will come 
from user fees, especially the new tax on immigration. I think 
the minister is trying to run his department like a private 
company. Today it is self-financing, and later he will probably 
want to make a profit as well.
<P>
	There have been cuts at the IRB, cuts totalling around $500.7 
million. From now on, cases will be heard by only one 
commissioner, not two. The number of commissioners will be 
reduced from 175 to 112.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	I would like to use the two minutes I have left to say a few 
words about international aid.
<P>
	I condemn most vigorously the cuts made in international 
assistance. This country, which used to have a genuine concern 
for the problems and well-being of poor countries is no longer 
the Canada I knew a number of years ago. There have been 
horrendous cuts in Montreal alone, and in the rest of Quebec and 
Canada. More than 80 organizations dedicated to promoting 
public awareness of international assistance will see their 
funding cut by 100 per cent and will disappear. Cuts totalling 
$1.3 billion in three years-that is a lot of money. The UN has 
asked all industrialized countries to spend 0.7 per cent of GDP 
on international assistance. Canada will be left with a rate of 0.3 
per cent.
<P>
	Finally, I would urge the government not to reduce the 
programs for older worker adjustment. The unions are very 
concerned, and the provinces as well. These agreements must be 
renewed, and I hope the government will try to do something for 
these workers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to speak in the House on behalf of my constituents 
about the federal budget.
<P>
	My constituents tell me time and time again that they are sick 
and tired of paying for federal government programs that they 
do not want, they did not ask for and they certainly do not want 
to pay for. My constituents stop me and ask about Canada's 
official languages policy. Why do we have this program? Why 
do we have to pay for it? Today I will confine my budget remarks 
to bring forward the concerns of my constituents about official 
languages.
<P>
	I will start by asking the government on behalf of the people 
of Yellowhead: Why do we have a Department of Canadian 
Heritage? Of all the departments in government, the Department 
of Canadian Heritage is one  of the most controversial and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11582"> 11582 </A></B>
<P>
disruptive to the people of Canada. It is in this department that 
we find huge public funding for highly contentious areas, 
including the CBC, multiculturalism and of course, official 
bilingualism. I will be direct. The people of Yellowhead have no 
use for the Department of Canadian Heritage and its destructive, 
divisive programs.
<P>
	They do not know what possible good can result from the 
funding of the bilingual bonus which cost them and their fellow 
taxpayers $50 million last year. They do not know what good can 
result from funding the language police, the Commissioner of 
Official languages, $11.1 million. They do not know what good 
can come from funding the Edmonton region of the Alberta 
Francophone Association to the tune of $103,000 annually plus 
a grant of $12 million to be spent in a riding containing 945 
francophones.
<P>
	The people of Yellowhead are not sure why they are helping to 
pay for official languages support, which is projected to cost 
$253 million this year, a cool quarter of a billion dollars.
<P>
	It is not my intention to fan the flames of resentment, only to 
question a policy which has done much to tear the social and 
linguistic fabric of our nation.
<P>
	Official bilingualism in Canada is not about promoting the 
equality of the French and English languages. It is about the 
promotion of minority language rights to the majority of the 
population. In fact the Official Languages Act, which 
entrenched the notion of coast to coast bilingualism in 1969, has 
been abused by federal governments which operated behind the 
smoke-screen of keeping Canada together.
<P>
	The OLA was about appeasement right from the beginning. 
There are questions as to how this forced language program was 
to be funded, to be paid for. English Canada protested this 
imposition and of course it is paying for it.
<P>
<B>(1120 ) </B>
<P>
	Pierre Trudeau knew the mathematics involved. He needed to 
retain power. He needed to retain his stranglehold on Quebec. 
After all, he had no support from the west. Therefore, the OLA 
was imposed on all of Canada. Ever since, the Official 
Languages Act has been used to put out anti-nationalistic fires 
in Quebec but to no avail. The effects of this firefighting have 
been severe.
<P>
	I draw attention to how the Official Languages Act was used 
in 1976, at a time when great dissension in the province of 
Quebec was reaching its apex, to put out a fire that threatened 
national unity. On the eve of the Quebec election, 30,000 federal 
employees in Quebec threatened to refuse to serve people in 
English unless they received their bonuses for being bilingual, 
just like the bonuses bilingual secretaries, stenographers and 
typists received.
<P>
	To pacify the civil servants and keep the separatist Parti 
Quebecois from claiming unfair treatment of francophones, 
Trudeau caved in and passed the order to pay the bilingual 
bonus. To top things off and to add insult to injury, the PQ won 
the election.
<P>
	Ever since, the bilingual bonus has stuck and has even been 
extended to bilingual RCMP officers under this Liberal 
government. I have little doubt this decision was made to cool 
disparaging attacks from the Bloc.
<P>
	This policy is discriminatory against unilingual anglophones 
and francophones. It has created division instead of unity. It is 
the opposite of what the OLA intended for Canada. The 
disruption of the merit system has a negative impact on morale.
<P>
	That was not the only time the master social engineer used the 
contentious issue of Canada's official languages as an 
instrument of appeasement at the expense of the majority of 
Canadians. Trudeau implemented affirmative action in the 
hiring of public servants.
<P>
	I draw my colleagues' attention to the Royal Commission on 
Bilingualism and Biculturalism. It recommended dividing the 
public service into French language units in which all work 
would be performed in French, and English language units in 
which all work would be performed in English. Under this 
system almost all jobs would be open to unilingual speakers.
<P>
	It is true that at first there might be a swell of unilingual 
English jobs, but as anglophone employees retired and 
francophones joined the public service French language units 
would expand to eventually include a proportion of jobs 
equivalent to the French speaking share of the Canadian 
population. In essence, there would be equitable representation 
without resorting to affirmative action and without claims of 
discrimination against either anglophones or francophones. I 
think all members would agree that such a scenario seems 
reasonable and fair.
<P>
	Trudeau, because of political considerations, did not adopt 
this fair solution. He apparently felt the French language unit 
would take too long to implement while the separatist threat was 
an immediate problem. As Trudeau said: ``We cannot tell 
Quebec: Cool it, fellows, in 40 years we will be able to talk to 
you. We might save some money but we would not save the 
country''. Well we sure have saved the country.
<P>
	Today it is the unity of the country which is threatened, 
something that should not be happening if the sacred cow known 
as official bilingualism had worked, but of course it could not 
work. This policy has cost billions of dollars to enforce since its 
inception. We see what Canadian taxpayers are getting in return: 
among other things, a separatist party as the Official Opposition 
in the House of Commons.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11583"> 11583 </A></B>
<P>
	If policies of the past do not work, perhaps it is time that we 
stopped them and developed a new framework with which we 
can all work toward a unified Canada. Canadians resent official 
bilingualism as it stands now.
<P>
	I will close by relating an instance which occurred last 
October. The Commissioner of Official Languages, the 
language police, visited Jasper National Park to award park 
officials for their outstanding promotion of French language in 
the park. A closer examination of the demographics shows just 
how wasteful the commissioner's junket was. It is illogical to 
have bilingual services available in Jasper National Park or any 
other place where there is not sufficient demand.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	Last year over 2.4 million people visited the park. The visitors 
to the campgrounds came from the following regions: Alberta, 
35 per cent; British Columbia, 15 per cent; California, Ontario, 
Washington, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. The origin of people 
visiting by country was: Canada, 60 per cent; United States, 20 
per cent; Germany, 5 per cent; and then England and 
Switzerland.
<P>
	Curiously enough, signs in the campgrounds are in French and 
English and most of the campground staff are required to be 
bilingual in both official languages. If anything, services should 
be offered in English and German according to the statistics. Of 
course that would be ludicrous because the majority of Germans 
visiting Canada speak English.
<P>
	Common sense must dictate all government policies. It is 
time to end tired, old divisive and expensive policies which not 
only add to our debt but which create problems instead of 
solving them. The time to end those is now.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, with 
your permission, I will ignore the preceding incendiary remarks 
of my colleague. It is certainly not out of pleasure, but rather out 
of a sense of duty as an MP, that I rise today to debate Bill C-76, 
which concerns certain provisions of the budget tabled on 
February 27 and which implements some of the announced 
changes in transfers to the provinces.
<P>
	In fact, this bill is nothing more than the bitter fruit of certain 
decisions in the latest federal budget. Bill C-76 clearly 
illustrates the federal government's conspiracy against the 
provinces. With this bill, the federal government intends 
literally to offload $7 billion of its debt onto the provinces. To 
this end, it has already made a mockery of one of its three main 
programs of transfers to the provinces-the equalization 
program. Under this program, the provinces will receive $8.87 
billion this fiscal year.
<P>
	The aim of the program is to redistribute wealth within 
Canada by transferring some of the income of the wealthier 
provinces to the poorer ones. Since 1982, however, the federal 
government has imposed a maximum on transfer payments to 
provinces under the equalization program, tying total payments 
to growth in Canada's nominal GNP. This capping was renewed 
in January 1994 for five years under Bill C-3. With this 
measure, the federal government, be it Liberal or Conservative, 
has deprived and continues to deprive the provinces of revenues 
they would normally be entitled to.
<P>
	As Quebec is one of the provinces, along with the Atlantic 
provinces, Manitoba and Saskatchewan, receiving federal 
money through the equalization program, its public finances 
will suffer enormously as the result of this measure. In fact, 
Quebec's public finances are already suffering because of this 
measure. The situation is more difficult for Quebec, because, of 
all the provinces benefiting from this program, it benefits the 
least per capita.
<P>
	By tying maximum total payments to growth in the nominal 
GNP, the federal government is changing the very nature of the 
equalization payments, which serve primarily to redistribute 
wealth among the provinces. There is more. Bill C-76, as 
announced in the last budget, also provides for the replacement, 
in 1996-97, of the two other provincial transfer programs-the 
Canada assistance plan, known as the CAP, and established 
programs financing-by a new program, the Canada social 
transfer.
<P>
	So far, we might consider this combining of two programs 
into a single one, thus streamlining operations, simplifying 
structures and so on, to be good news. However, that is the end of 
the good news. Because, instead of maintaining or increasing 
the level of transfer payments to the provinces, Ottawa is 
preparing to cut $2.5 billion in 1996-97 from the budget usually 
reserved for these payments.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	The 1997-98 fiscal year will be even worse, because the 
federal government plans to cut transfers to the provinces by 
another $4.5 billion. This is yet another face of the flexible 
federalism the government is always trying to sell us in this 
House.
<P>
	The problem is that the only thing that the government has 
successfully decentralized is its deficit. Obviously, Quebec will 
not be spared in the federal government's deficit 
decentralization operation. In the 1996-97 fiscal year, Quebec's 
transfer payment will be cut by $650 million, thanks to clause 48 
of Bill C-76.
<P>
	For the 1997-98 fiscal year, we are still unsure of how the 
federal government intends to determine by how much it will cut 
transfer payments to the provinces. If it decides to continue 
using the same formula, Quebec's transfer payment will be cut 
by $1.2 billion.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11584"> 11584 </A></B>
<P>
	Because of the pressure that the richest provinces, like 
Ontario, are exerting, it looks like the federal  government may 
use a new formula based on the proportion of Canada's 
population living in each of the provinces.
<P>
	If the federal government decides to use this formula, Quebec 
will lose $1.9 billion instead of $1.2 billion, an additional 
shortfall of $700 million. Unfortunately, chances are that it will 
use the new formula, because the federal government is not in 
the habit of calling into question an established formula if it 
does not intend to change it and especially because of the 
pressure it is currently getting from the provinces that are better 
off.
<P>
	Therefore, all told, Bill C-76 will probably cost the 
Government of Quebec at least $1.85 billion and at the most, 
$2.55 billion. As I said before, is this not a fine example of 
flexible federalism, cost-effective federalism?
<P>
	After reading the provisions of Bill C-76, one can only 
wonder how competent and responsible the members of the 
government really are: they are shirking their responsibility to 
manage the public purse wisely. In fact, can anyone in the House 
think of anything easier or more convenient than passing the 
buck to the provinces, as the Liberal government is currently 
doing, especially to Quebec?
<P>
	This sad chapter in the life of the federal government's 
economic and budgetary policy, if indeed it does have one, 
shows undeniably just how much of a mess the country's 
finances are in. Therefore, not only has the federal government 
either put off until later or offloaded onto the provinces the main 
deficit reducing measures it announced in the last budget, it also 
is doing nothing about the thorny issue of Canada's debt.
<P>
	We must realize that every deficit incurred by the federal 
government simply adds to Canada's humongous debt. The 
deficit forecast for 1995-96 is $32.7 billion. Even if the 
government brought its deficit down to zero this year, at the cost 
of difficult and harrowing sacrifices, the Canadian debt would 
continue to grown just the same, inexorably, on account of the 
applicable interest charges.
<P>
	Because the federal debt is growing almost exponentially, the 
portion of the budget going to interest payments alone continues 
to grow, automatically. This year, the government is facing a 
substantial increase in the interests to be paid on the debt, with 
interest charges rising from $42 to $50 billion. This means that, 
if the government were to simply freeze its spending at the 
current level, its deficit would increase substantially anyway, 
also adding to the debt.
<P>
	A government bent on reducing its deficit would therefore 
have to cut mercilessly in both spending and programs, if only to 
offset the rise in the deficit attributable to interest charges. In 
other words, the debt problem would not remain unresolved in 
spite of the government's efforts.
<P>
	As we were able to see earlier, the federal government did not 
have the courage to tackle its own deficit, simply shifting the 
problem on to the provinces by gradually cutting transfers. To 
offset this loss of revenue, the provinces will have to cut 
services, rise taxes or pass the buck themselves to the 
municipalities.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	But finally, it is always the same people footing the bill: the 
taxpayers.
<P>
	It was suggested that the Government of Quebec should put its 
own fiscal house in order before inviting the people of Quebec to 
give a decision on sovereignty. But one must realize that it will 
become increasingly difficult for the Quebec government to 
make ends meet as tax transfers to the provinces shrink. Let us 
also keep in mind that, at the time of the first referendum on 
sovereignty, in 1980, the federal debt was $90 billion. It has now 
grown to nearly $550 billion and should have passed the $800 
billion mark by the year 2000.
<P>
	In 1980, the federalists doomed Quebecers to Gehenna of hell 
if they dared venture onto the road to sovereignty-association. 
If Quebec were to become sovereign, these doomwatchers 
predicted the dollar would be worth 70 cents, interest rates 
would skyrocket and the debt would reach several hundred 
billion. But we got all of that while we were within the Canadian 
federal system. To top it off, the Canadian Constitution was 
patriated without Quebec's consent, and we have the current 
Prime Minister of Canada to thank for that.
<P>
	To conclude, Quebec will not be spared in the federal 
government's scheme to shovel the Canadian deficit in the 
provinces' backyards or the other sneaky measures contained in 
the budget. Today and in the months to come, the people of 
Quebec will bear the brunt of this budget, at least until they 
decide to pull out from this unfair and inefficient system, which 
is moving ever closer to financial disaster, until they decide to 
assume responsibility for their own future by going the way of 
sovereignty.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, ``there are times in the progress of a people when 
fundamental changes must be faced, fundamental choices made 
and a new course charted''. With these words the finance 
minister tabled what has been called the most important budget 
in Canadian history. He says it is a budget with one objective, to 
break the back of the deficit and bring our finances under 
control.
<P>
	Canadians will have to judge by the minister's own criteria. 
They will have to judge whether the fundamental challenge of a 
deficit elimination been faced. Have fundamental choices been 
made to meet that challenge? Has the new course really been 
charted toward federal fiscal responsibility? These are 
questions I will deal with.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11585"> 11585 </A></B>
<P>
	First is the question of whether the deficit elimination 
challenge has been faced. In the dying days of the Trudeau 
government a budget was tabled with a then unheard of deficit of 
over $38 billion.
<P>
	Michael Wilson six years ago said: ``We have a serious 
problem, our large and growing public debt''. The Tories had 
nine years to balance the books but failed to do so at each and 
every attempt. The closest they came to a balanced budget was 
$19 billion.
<P>
	Now the Liberals are back. The finance minister, as his 
predecessors before him, says the time has come to deal with 
this deficit crisis. When one looks at his three-year plan, the 
final goal is not deficit elimination, it is only modest reduction. 
If the challenge is a balanced budget, and it must be, given 
today's economic climate, this challenge has not been met.
<P>
	Second is the question of whether fundamental choices have 
been made to meet the deficit challenge. There were clear 
decisions to be made: the status quo or new direction, continued 
deficit or no deficit, tax hikes or spending cuts.
<P>
	The bottom line said it all. Program spending has decreased a 
mere $5.1 billion out of a total of $163.5 billion. That works out 
to only 4 per cent of program spending or a mere 3 per cent of 
total spending. These so-called cuts are a drop in the bucket 
compared with what must be done to bring our finances under 
control.
<P>
	At the same time, there are new business taxes, gasoline taxes 
and new user fees. Clearly the government has not taken 
decisive action and has not made the fundamental choices 
Canadians have been demanding.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	Third, regarding the question of whether a new course in 
government spending has been charted in the budget, clearly for 
the past 20 years federal governments have followed a course 
leading from one deficit to the next at an accumulative cost of 
over $548 billion.
<P>
	Since the government came to power it has followed that 
exact pattern, predicting deficits past 1997. No new course has 
been plotted. It is still business as usual with deficits, deficits, 
deficits.
<P>
	Several months ago I asked Cariboo-Chilcotin constituents 
in a householder survey for their thoughts on cutting the deficit. 
I placed before them the list of cuts the Reform Party presented 
to the finance committee and asked whether they agreed with 
this list.
<P>
	There was overwhelming support for ending regional 
development programs, privatizing the CBC, stopping the 
funding for crown corporations, ending multiculturalism and 
bilingualism funding, immediately stopping support for special 
interest groups and downsizing the ministries of agriculture, 
industry, natural resources, and fisheries and oceans. These are 
the recommendations of my constituents.
<P>
	Is the budget fair? The finance minister has been quick to 
stress the budget spreads the burden. No one escaped the pain, 
he stressed, and the burden has been borne equally.
<P>
	Is it fair to Canadians? Is it fair to our families? Is it fair to our 
children? Is it fair to our grandchildren and great grandchildren 
and future generations to come? The answer on all counts is 
firmly no, it is not. It is not fair to thousands of civil servants 
who could lose their jobs based on their race or sex.
<P>
	According to the minister of intergovernmental affairs cuts 
will focus on white males in the civil service despite the fact this 
violates the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Families will be 
strained, careers destroyed and the principles of merit ignored, 
all for the sake of pacifying radical special interest groups.
<P>
	It is not fair to the grassroots which will continue to be 
shouted down on the national scene. Funding for special 
interests, the political fringes of our society, lives on. The 
radical agendas will continue to be pushed to centre stage while 
views and opinions of ordinary Canadians will once again be 
pushed out the exit doors.
<P>
	It is not fair to young Canadians, our future workers, our 
future leaders. For the first time in Canadian history young 
Canadians are facing a future that will bring them less 
prosperity than their parents or grandparents. It is these young 
people and not their parents or grandparents who will eventually 
have to begin paying off a debt that now totals $548 billion.
<P>
	The finance minister has put off any major cuts for some time 
in the distant future. It is our children who will have to deal with 
his indecisiveness with even higher taxes and fewer social 
programs.
<P>
	I have often said I did not enter politics for myself but for my 
children and for their peers across the country. When I graduated 
from school the opportunities were virtually limitless. When I 
wanted a job, I picked my field. When I wanted more schooling, 
admission was both easy and affordable.
<P>
	I could count on having a good salary to meet my needs and 
the needs of my wife and family. All that has changed. Young 
people no longer have their pick of jobs. They have to take what 
they can get, often piecing together two or three part time jobs to 
make ends meet.
<P>
	Tuitions are rapidly rising, enrolment falling and 
opportunities becoming fewer and farther apart. There are many 
reasons for these changes such as high payroll taxes, decreasing 
funding and economic restructuring but it all comes down to one 
thing, the debt.
<P>
	As our debt increases over the next three years, our economy 
will be even more strained to pay ever more interest on our 
growing debt, meaning our young people will have even fewer 
opportunities in the years to come. For their sake we have to 
tackle the deficit now.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11586"> 11586 </A></B>
<P>
	The budget has failed on all counts.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	The challenge of deficit elimination has not been faced. The 
fundamental choices Canadians demanded have not been made. 
A new course towards fiscal responsibility has not been charted, 
and this budget has not been fair, as the minister claimed.
<P>
	Canadians are not looking for another Michael Wilson or Don 
Mazankowski, both of whom drifted from deficit to deficit. 
They are looking for decisive action to bring our nation's 
finances back into balance. I hope this finance minister will 
show more decisiveness next year than he has this year. The 
window for opportunity is quickly closing.
<P>
	I am very pleased that the Reform Party has presented an 
alternative budget, which the Liberal Party has been invited to 
review, to copy and to use.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the months before this budget was brought 
down, the Minister of Finance appeared before the finance 
committee and made a number of statements, some of which 
were reported on television. One of them was the following, and 
I quote: ``The total debt of Canada's public sector has now 
reached 100 per cent of the gross domestic product. The interest 
alone on this debt exceeded $56 billion last year, close to $39 
billion of which were paid by the federal government. This 
amount may well top $44 billion this year. We have reached the 
point where the interest on the debt is growing faster than the 
economy. We are in debt over our heads and this cannot go on. 
The situation is untenable from the point of view of the laws of 
the financial market and equally untenable under the laws of 
compound interest''.
<P>
	To conclude in the words of the minister: ``It is as if our 
country were trying to go up the down escalator''. We have all 
seen young boys trying to do this in the subway. They manage 
quite nicely, but for the average person, it is not easy. I again 
quote the minister: ``The problem is so monumental that we can 
no longer rely on economic growth for a solution. Why not? 
Because the deficit itself is dragging down growth. As long as it 
goes unchecked, too many investments will be stalled at the 
planning stage, interest rates will remain high, the rate of 
employment will go down, and future generations will pay the 
price''.
<P>
	Canada's debt has become so large that the Canadian 
government is now in the position of having to borrow billions 
of dollars annually to pay the interest on it. It is no different than 
the average person who owes the bank money and who, every 
year, has to go deeper into debt just to pay the interest charges. 
Clearly, it is a vicious circle.
<P>
	Canada's debt, which was $90 billion in 1980, will be $548 
billion as at March 31, 1995, and it will keep climbing. In 15 
years there has been a 509 per cent increase. We know perfectly 
well that no ordinary citizen would be able to handle an increase 
in debt of this magnitude, just as we know that there is no 
company that could either, without soon falling into bankruptcy, 
and we are equally well aware that countries are no different. In 
January 1995, the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>, one of the most 
prestigious newspapers in New York, mentioned that Canada 
had now gained third-world-country status in terms of its debt, 
and even indicated that there was a real possibility that it might 
go bankrupt.
<P>
	The minister gave us an idea of what that meant, in a 
document entitled <I>Creating a Healthy Fiscal Climate</I>, which he 
released in October 1994. In his presentation, the minister said 
that a powerful thrust of the debt is firmly anchored in the 
Canadian economy and is hard to correct. As deficits keep 
accumulating, interest costs also increase, thus perpetuating the 
vicious circle. The deficits which result from the interest 
charges on the current debt contribute to increasing that debt, 
which continues to grow. For several years now, the Canadian 
economy has not been strong enough to make revenues grow 
quickly enough to compensate for the rapid increase in interest 
charges and, as the minister said, it is not expected that this trend 
will change in the predictable future.
<P>
	Following this analysis, the minister tabled a budget which 
seeks to bring the deficit back to 3 per cent of the gross domestic 
product, by 1996-97, which means that the deficit would go 
down from 39.7 to 25 billion dollars. In order to reach that 
target, the minister intends to make cuts of about $13.4 billion, 
over the next two years.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	What does a budget such as this one tell us? First, it tells 
ordinary Canadians that the national debt increased, but in an 
abstract manner.
<P>
	Indeed, for ordinary citizens, a debt of 200, 300 or 500 billion 
dollars is something abstract if they do not feel it in their pocket 
book. However, the major change with this budget is that things 
will now become very concrete. Canadians will start paying off 
that debt. Massive cuts are anticipated, including in the UI, 
welfare and health care programs, and students will have to get 
into debt to go to school.
<P>
	This morning the hon. member sitting next to me even 
mentioned that old age pensions are now in jeopardy, this just 
after the government announced-and this is no laughing 
matter-a substantial increase of $0.78 per month, which is not 
even enough to buy a coffee.
<P>
	The second conclusion to be drawn from this budget is that, 
regardless of what we do, as the minister himself told us, the 
debt will continue to rise. Consequently, the budget cuts which 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11587"> 11587 </A></B>
<P>
will affect social services in a few months can only increase in 
the years to come.
<P>
	The third conclusion essentially applies to Quebec. For the 
first time in history, Quebecers will realize just how much it 
costs to be part of Canada. This will be costly and painful.
<P>
	As you will recall, the Prime Minister's advisor himself 
recently went to Toronto to tell the Canadian intelligentsia that, 
the more Quebec would suffer, the more Quebecers would be 
tempted to stay in the Canadian Confederation. I will not 
comment on the morality of this statement. I think that it denotes 
stupidity more than anything else and that it will have exactly 
the opposite effect.
<P>
	Of course, the argument is still the same: it is Quebec's fault. 
If things are going badly in Canada, it is Quebec's fault. The 
Prime Minister himself, who did not denounce his special 
adviser's remarks, thereby agreeing that Quebec should be made 
to suffer, was quoted in the newspapers yesterday or the day 
before as saying that if Quebecers rejected sovereignty, interest 
rates would drop by a few points. He was immediately 
challenged by the real economists in Canada, who found his 
comments extremely naive.
<P>
	I wish to remind the Prime Minister of two little events that 
clearly show that there is no relation whatsoever between the 
disastrous state of Canadian public finance and Quebec's 
political role. At a time of great political stability, in the years 
that followed the rejection of Quebec sovereignty in 1980, 
Canada experienced the highest interest rates ever, which rose 
well beyond 20 per cent. Yet, Quebecers had just said Yes to 
Canada.
<P>
	Hon. members will also remember 1986. Who was in power at 
that time? The Quebec Premier was Mr. Bourassa and the 
Canadian Prime Minister was Mr. Mulroney. This was, of 
course, a few years before the Meech Lake and Charlottetown 
failures. The Parti Quebecois was keeping very quiet in its little 
corner. Some people were even saying that the PQ was dead. The 
Bloc Quebecois did not exist. The dollar fell to 69 cents US. And 
it will probably return to that level very soon. I remind hon. 
members that there was then no link between the very quiet 
political situation in Quebec and the economic problems.
<P>
	Of course, they have always said that it was Quebec's fault 
and they will continue to do so. They are repeating the same 
arguments they used in 1980. We remember very clearly what 
Mr. Trudeau told us: ``We are putting our seats on the line in 
Canada. We are putting our seats on the line at the political level 
so that changes can be made''. There was the patriation in 1982, 
which was never accepted by Quebecers, followed by the Meech 
Lake and Charlottetown failures.
<P>
	They also tried to scare Quebecers-now they want to hurt us, 
but back then they wanted to scare us-by telling them that if 
they chose sovereignty, they would be up to their necks in debt, 
unemployment and taxes. We said Yes to Canada at that time and 
since then the debt has risen from $90 billion to $548 billion, the  
unemployment rate has gone from 7.5 per cent to almost 10 per 
cent, the number of welfare recipients has nearly doubled, and 
taxes have never been so high. And that is only the beginning.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	In the end, by staying in the Canadian Confederation, we have 
experienced all the problems we were afraid would occur if we 
became a country. And things will get worse. Let me remind the 
House that the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> said that Canada was heading 
toward bankruptcy.
<P>
	We recently held regional commissions on sovereignty, which 
attracted a large number of participants throughout Quebec. 
Quebecers submitted numerous briefs saying that they had two 
options: staying in the Canadian Confederation or making 
Quebec a country. They mostly said that they wanted more 
information.
<P>
	In closing, I think that we should give Quebecers much more 
information on sovereignty issues, let the Canadian budget 
produce its effect and reveal exactly how much it costs to be part 
of Canada. I sincerely believe that when the right time comes, 
Quebecers will end up choosing the only possible option: 
making Quebec a country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand-Norfolk, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to take a few moments to talk about the impact of 
the budget on my riding of Haldimand-Norfolk, and I would 
also like to talk a bit about agriculture.
<P>
	We have heard over the last few days statements made by 
members of Her Majesty's loyal opposition and members of the 
Reform Party in terms of fairness in the budget. They are trying 
to suggest that in agriculture the cuts seem to be either in 
Quebec or in western Canada and that they are not spread fairly 
across the country.
<P>
	When the Minister of Finance set out his budget proposals, 
and when the debates, negotiations and discussions with various 
groups were occurring beforehand, within this caucus and in 
talking to constituents in my riding, understanding the 
significance of the debt and the deficit and the problems we have 
there, what has been emphasized is the fact that there needs to be 
fairness. People across the country are prepared to do whatever 
is necessary to deal with the government's finances, as long as it 
is shown that what the government does, it does fairly across the 
country.
<P>
	Let us take a look at agriculture. There were three significant 
areas that were cut in agriculture. The dairy subsidy was reduced 
by 30 per cent over a two-year period, the WGTA was cut, but, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11588"> 11588 </A></B>
<P>
significantly, there was the centralization of research and 
development projects.
<P>
	In terms of the dairy subsidy, obviously, given what is 
happening with the GATT and given the changes within supply 
management that are required, all dairy farmers realize that 
there will be changes and that within the next 20 years they will 
have to develop ways to compete internationally and not only 
within the Canadian market. This dairy subsidy reduction of 30 
per cent is going to be a hit on dairy farmers. Certainly, dairy 
farmers will have to do their share in bringing down the deficit.
<P>
	When I talk to the farmers in my riding, and in fact across 
Canada, most of them are willing to make that sacrifice to help 
reduce the debt and the deficit. However, they want to make sure 
that the sacrifice is also being made by other Canadians.
<P>
	They speak particularly about social policy reform. They 
want to ensure that our social policy programs are doing what 
they need to be doing, that they are doing it efficiently, and that 
they are not just leaving a whole class of people relying on 
government handouts. They also talk in terms of trying to cut 
back on some of the spending we do in that area. I think if they 
see a firm commitment from the minister and the government, 
they will be more than willing to take a cut in what they are 
receiving.
<P>
<B>(1200 ) </B>
<P>
	We have seen somewhat of a hiatus there. The minister has 
indicated we will probably come back sometime in the fall when 
some of the necessary changes will be made.
<P>
	I had a very big meeting in my riding with a number of 
concerned people on the whole question of social policy reform. 
I received a lot of good ideas. I am sure many members on all 
sides of the House also held these forums. I know my colleague 
across the way always likes to hold these open public forums. 
They are a good thing for members of Parliament to do because 
they give us an opportunity to hear from our constituents on very 
important subjects with a wide range of diverse ideas.
<P>
	A lot of dairy farmers who were in attendance were telling me 
they understood what the government did. They were not 
particularly happy that it came out of their pockets but they were 
prepared to take it as long as they saw the government making 
firm commitments in other areas.
<P>
	The Reform Party throughout our earlier discussions on the 
WGTA gave us an indication it wanted us to scrap it. We wanted 
to make sure, given some of our GATT commitments, there was 
adjustment available for those farmers and that the system 
would still work.
<P>
	I have a number of concerns in that area as chair of the 
standing committee on agriculture. We got together with all 
parties. We decided there should be a subcommittee on 
transportation to look at these issues. Farmers in western 
Canada and people who rely on the St. Lawrence seaway have a 
number of concerns. Hopefully the members of Parliament on 
the subcommittee, chaired by the hon. member for Malpeque, 
will be able to do something in that area to  make sure the 
concerns of these farmers are taken into consideration and that 
the minister of agriculture and the Prime Minister hear first 
hand some of these concerns.
<P>
	The $1.6 billion payment, essentially a payment over a two or 
three-year period, is an adjustment period. The farmers I have 
been talking to are not very happy it is coming out of their area 
but they are prepared, as are farmers in other parts of the country 
and all Canadians, to do their share in terms of bringing down 
the debt and deficit.
<P>
	That theme was pretty much what I heard in my riding of 
Haldimand-Norfolk after I went back after the budget and 
talked to my constituents. Normally after a budget, even as an 
opposition member, one should receive about 20 or 30 calls. 
After this budget I received three calls from constituents. I felt 
this was an acceptance of the fairness of the budget.
<P>
	After the budget, as I went around to the different events in 
my riding I began to learn people accepted the budget, 
grudgingly granted, but they understood the need to deal with 
the debt and deficit and the need for cuts. They were prepared to 
go along with it as long as they felt there was to be more and 
there was a commitment of fiscal responsibility by the 
government.
<P>
	I have talked to the Minister of Finance in caucus and know 
the commitment is there. We have to deal with the fact that 43 
per cent or 44 per cent of our debt is controlled outside of the 
country and our current account deficit is a problem.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance indicated he will take the tough steps 
necessary to deal with that problem. It is a problem for all 
Canadians. It is a problem for my children and children all 
across the country. It is something they do not look forward to. 
We will deal with that problem. We will deal with the question of 
fairness not only in future budgetary expenditures in terms of 
the country but also in agriculture as we move along with the 
co-operation of the opposition and the third party to help 
Canadian farmers in the future deal with the uncertainties of the 
new reality in world economic trade.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as we are all aware, on February 27 the finance minister 
brought down his second budget. That document showed how 
spending is to be reduced by $4 billion, taxes are up by $1.5 
billion and the annual projected deficit will be only $32.7 
billion; that is, $32 billion deeper in debt.
<P>
	The document did not show how the government will spend 
$50 billion to service the debt this year and how our overall debt 
will climb by more than $100 billion over the term of the Liberal 
government. Think of it. We are spending $50 billion to service 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11589"> 11589 </A></B>
<P>
the debt. How much could we buy in the way of social services 
or anything else for $50 billion in a year?
<P>
	The surprisingly mild public reaction toward the budget 
seems to indicate Canadians do not fully understand the full 
extent of our financial situation. Do they realize we are $550 
billion in debt and by the time the government ends its mandate 
we will be $650 billion in debt? I do not think it has quite struck 
home yet.
<P>
	It is therefore our job as a responsible opposition to tell 
Canadians all is not well. We must do much more to tackle our 
crippling debt and deficit situation. The fact our hon. colleague 
across the way from Haldimand-Norfolk only received two 
phone calls on this well illustrates this fact. The public is not 
aware of the severity of the problem.
<P>
	What can be done? According to the government it is moving 
as fast as it possibly can to solve the problem. However, if we 
look closely at this baby step budget we find that is not the case. 
More can be done.
<P>
	Look at my area of responsibility, official languages. I can 
very easily demonstrate how we can save money without 
sacrificing service to the public. We will look at my little area 
but this could be multiplied one dozen or two dozen times by 
other areas, thus illustrating we can find the money.
<P>
	To be fair to the government, it has moved quietly even in the 
area of official languages to trim some of the excess spending, 
but not enough. The estimates show how approximately $50 
million has been taken from official languages spending in the 
Department of Canadian Heritage. Likewise, there is a small 
reduction in the budget for the commissioner of official 
languages.
<P>
	Again, these are only baby steps in the right direction. There 
are many more areas that can be reduced or eliminated. Funding 
of special interest groups is a classic example. We are looking at 
one little area of detail within overall official languages. This 
year Canadian heritage alone will spend $28.5 million. Where 
does this money go? About $1 million will go again this year to 
Alliance Quebec, a so-called English language rights group in 
Quebec. I say so-called because it is difficult to truly believe 
this group is doing any meaningful work to preserve English 
rights in Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1210 ) </B>
<P>
	Earlier this week I stood in the House and asked the 
government why it would give Alliance Quebec $1.2 million 
when it has been learned $837,000 of that is being spent on 
wages, while another $95,000 goes to pay for luxury offices in 
downtown Montreal. At the same time its membership has sunk 
to an all time low of about 2,500. This figure was disputed on 
radio this week by Mr. Hamelin, head of Alliance Quebec, who 
said its numbers have risen to 3,700. Even if they have, this is 
down from a membership strength of 15,000 or 20,000 some 
years ago. What is going on?
<P>
	The government response to my question on the donation to 
Alliance Quebec was: ``It is important the Canadian government 
supports minority language groups outside and inside Quebec. 
That is what we are doing. That is what we will continue to do''.
<P>
	If we examine that answer we will quickly discover it does not 
make any sense. How can anyone claim that lining the pockets of 
a few well heeled Liberal friends in the Montreal area does 
anything to support the anglophone community within Quebec? 
This group spends 75 per cent of its taxpayer supported budget 
on wages and rent. What can it actually be doing to support the 
community it purports to represent?
<P>
	Worse yet, when my office requested this type of financial 
information from Alliance Quebec and other similar language 
groups throughout Canada, we were told that information was 
not public knowledge and therefore was not available to us. We 
were told to contact Treasury Board if we wanted information. 
Treasury Board then told us it could only provide the overall 
grant information which is readily available in public accounts 
and therefore of little value. For detailed information we were 
told to contact Canadian heritage. It in turn told us in most cases 
it did not not have the information and what it had was not 
available to us.
<P>
	I have been fighting this situation for a year and a half in the 
House trying to get some facts on spending of the government 
and all I get is sandbagging. This is taxpayers money supposedly 
being spent for the benefit of all Canadians. The people who 
provide the funds are not allowed to know how they are spent.
<P>
	It is only through the persistence of a reporter at <I>La Presse</I> 
that the information on Alliance Quebec was brought to the 
attention of the public. It takes a reporter to get it out. This is 
unacceptable.
<P>
	It is also interesting to note that official languages may well 
be the only federal program to have totally escaped the scrutiny 
of the Auditor General. This program has been in place for a 
quarter of a century and has never been fully audited. What is 
going on here? Where is this money being spent? What can we 
eliminate?
<P>
	Part V of the 1993-94 public accounts which detail funds for 
professional special services shows almost $9 million spent in 
the name of official languages. For example, Privy Council, 
$900,000; communications, $4 million; transport, $340,000; 
energy, mines and resources, $500,000; external affairs, 
$255,000; national defence, $1.6 million, to name a few. How 
these moneys were spent and for what purpose is a mystery.
<P>
	Similarly, part VIII of the 1993-94 public accounts shows 
$273 million for official languages transfer payments; over 
$270 million of that by communications and $2.5 million by 
employment and immigration. Again, for what purpose? Only 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11590"> 11590 </A></B>
<P>
the people who receive the money know for sure and they are not 
willing to say.
<P>
	Surely it makes sense to do a comprehensive audit to find out 
if all these moneys are being spent wisely. The government 
lacks the will to do so. It is a sacred cow and it will hang on to it.
<P>
	If we look closely at the budget we find it simply does not do 
the job. We cannot afford to stroll toward a zero deficit target. 
The time for serious action is running out. It may be this year.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	In conclusion, I urge the government to take a serious look at 
spending just in my little area alone on official languages in an 
effort to get on with the job of deficit elimination, which 
Canadians will support.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to be able to participate in the debate on the budget. 
I am certain 10 minutes will not be enough to cover all the 
ground I would like to cover. I will outline in point form some of 
the major concerns I have with it.
<P>
	I have concerns about the fairness of the budget. I would like 
to debate at greater length the question of fairness with the 
member for Haldimand-Norfolk but I will not have the time to 
do that.
<P>
	One of the reasons the budget has been received as well as it 
has is the fact that the government has given the impression 
there have been no tax increases. In many respects there were 
not the kind of tax increases that had been flagged prior to the 
budget. The trick, which is as old as the hills, is to get people 
worried about a bunch of measures and then when the measures 
are not included in the budget, people are relieved.
<P>
	The fact is that Canadians will have to fork over more out of 
their own pockets in a variety of ways. It may not come through 
taxes but it will certainly come from having to spend more 
money on services that were previously provided by the 
government, whether it is in the form of user fees for national 
parks, decreased health care availability or whatever the case 
may be. We ought not to be under any illusion that Canadians got 
a free lunch out of the budget. Hardly.
<P>
	I am concerned about a number of things in the budget. First 
and foremost in my mind and in the minds of my constituents is 
the privatization of the Canadian National Railway. This is 
something, given the location of the main repair shops of CNR 
in Transcona, in the riding of Winnipeg Transcona, that is of 
obvious concern.
<P>
	It is a measure of how far to the ideological right this 
Parliament and the Liberal Party in particular have swung. We 
see the Liberal Party bringing in a measure to privatize the CNR 
which is something that previously would not only have been 
thought out of character for them but which goes against the 
promises many Liberal MPs and Liberal candidates made to 
railroaders in Winnipeg, and to Manitoba as a province, during 
the election of 1993.
<P>
	Many people were under the illusion-I was not-in 1993, 
given some of the things that have been said by the hon. member 
for Winnipeg South Centre, the Minister of Human Resources 
Development, that if the Liberals were elected the bleeding of 
rail jobs away from Winnipeg toward Edmonton and other 
places would stop and that Winnipeg would be restored as a 
transportation hub.
<P>
	The very opposite has happened. The Minister of Transport 
makes former Tory ministers of transport almost look like 
friends of railroaders with some of the things that he has said 
about railroaders and certainly the policies that he seems to be 
following.
<P>
	The privatization of CN in the budget is just the final icing on 
the cake of the things that have been done to rail by the previous 
Tory government and now by this government. It is a betrayal of 
Liberal promises and Liberal policy. It shows just how 
ideologically bent the Liberals are and how, in spite of 
everything they said in opposition, once they got in government 
picked up where the Tories left off and accelerated what used to 
be known as the Mulroney agenda.
<P>
	With respect to the Canada social transfer and the block 
funding of all social spending, again it is a total betrayal of the 
things the Liberal Party has stood for in opposition and 
previously in government.
<P>
<B>(1220 ) </B>
<P>
	Perhaps the Minister of Finance should have waited until May 
8 to have given his budget. Then we could have celebrated the 
50th anniversary of the end of the second world war and the end 
of post-war Canada the same day.
<P>
	That is basically what the budget did. It declared an end to the 
kind of society we have been able to build up over the last five 
decades. It is no coincidence that the end to that era comes at a 
time when the NDP is severely weakened in Parliament.
<P>
	The government has no pressure from the left, no criticism 
from the left, no opposition from the left, at least not the kind it 
used to have. It gets pushed to the right by my Reform 
colleagues here. The Bloc Quebecois is preoccupied with its 
own agenda.
<P>
	The government and the right wing business Liberals who for 
so long have had to contend with a left wing contingent in their 
own party, and with the NDP on their left flank, now are having a 
heyday. The Minister of Finance is one of those right wing 
Liberals. He is having his heyday.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11591"> 11591 </A></B>
<P>
	I do not know what the Prime Minister is doing. He is letting 
the Minister of Finance do whatever he likes. It does not matter 
how much it contravenes what the Liberals have said before.
<P>
	I am particularly concerned about the effect this is going to 
have on health care. When does it end? When will the Minister 
of Health and the Prime Minister get up and say to Ralph Klein 
in Alberta that enough is enough, that the Canada Health Act is 
going to be enforced, that we are going to have national 
standards in the country, and that all this talk about enforcing the 
Canada Health Act flexibly and the other kinds of things that 
have been spoken about will come to an end.
<P>
	It is not going to come to an end. It seems to me that the 
Liberals have decided that the Canada Health Act is passe and 
that in various ways they are going to allow it to fade away. They 
are going to permit provinces to experiment with the 
dismantling of medicare.
<P>
	This is something I predicted in 1984 in my final speech on 
the Canada Health Act. I said that if the federal government was 
not going to sufficiently fund medicare, sooner or later there 
would be pressures both from the public, from provincial 
governments and then in turn from the federal government to 
dismantle medicare.
<P>
	Medicare has to be adequately funded if it is going to succeed. 
That is an insight which in some ways others have brought to 
bear on this debate. It is not just a question of having national 
standards. One has to have national standards and appropriate 
funding. If there is not the appropriate funding, for one thing the 
federal government cannot withdraw that funding in order to 
enforce standards, and for another people become disillusioned 
about the health care system if they feel that in spite of the 
standards it is not the kind of health care system they expect.
<P>
	With respect to the Crow benefit and its elimination, again it 
is another blow not just to railways, farmers and railroaders, it is 
another capitulation on the part of the government to the global 
opposition to anything that comes in the form of a subsidy. This 
ideology against subsidies and against taking into account the 
realities of a country like Canada is something that is very 
dangerous for us. In many respects, Canada was built along 
east-west lines against natural north-south forces. If we are 
going to cut all the things that bind us together east and west and 
if we are not going to take them into account any more, we are 
going to end up with an entirely different country.
<P>
	Maybe that is what the government wants but that is certainly 
not what its members said in opposition. It is something that 
they should be held to account for by the Canadian public.
<P>
	Even in the administration of the elimination of the Crow 
benefit, I hope the government will soon tell us how it intends to 
make absolutely sure that it is the producers who receive the 
money that is going out as  compensation for the elimination of 
the Crow benefit and not landholders, as may well be the case 
given the current state of the legislation.
<P>
	It is not enough for the government to say that the Farm Credit 
Corporation will make sure that producers get it. The 
government has to make sure that producers get it, no matter 
who they are, no matter who owns the land that they rent.
<P>
<B>(1225 ) </B>
<P>
	My final point is with respect to the deficit. I listened to my 
Reform colleague talk about the need to get a grip on the deficit 
and to take the deficit a lot more seriously than the government 
is doing.
<P>
	What I would like to see both the Reform Party and the Liberal 
government take more seriously is the need to address the real 
causes of the deficit. In the judgment of NDP members, the real 
causes of the deficit go back to the tax loopholes which were 
created in the mid-1970s by a Liberal government and to the 
high real interest rate policy which has been followed in the 
country for the last 15 years. It is a combination of those tax 
loopholes and the high interest rate policy that has created the 
deficit.
<P>
	It is not social spending. Social spending has not grown in the 
way which some have suggested. It has not been the cause of the 
deficit. It may well be that it will have to be part of the solution, 
in the sense that it is an obvious area to look at, how we spend the 
money and whether we could spend it more wisely. However, 
unless we deal with the high real interest rate policy, unless we 
deal with monetary policy, unless we deal with how we finance 
the debt, we are going to continue to have the problem. We will 
continue to pay out $50 billion in interest every year.
<P>
	If the interest is the problem, let us look at the interest rate 
policy which creates the interest we have to pay. Let us look at 
the role of the Bank of Canada and ask if there are not ways in 
which it could finance a greater portion of the national debt than 
it does now in the way that it used to. Let us look at the way 
private banks have been allowed to print and lend money to the 
government, at a great profit to them and at a great expense to 
Canadians, without having to put up the appropriate deposits.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry, the hon. member's time has 
expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Blaikie:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. There are many other 
things I could have talked about, but ten minutes only permits so 
much.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Godfrey (Don Valley West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this debate is about the implementation of the federal budget. 
However I would like to take advantage of the occasion to pick 
up on a point made by the hon. member in the closing passage of 
his speech and look beyond the budget to examine the whole 
question of Canada's national debt; that constantly growing 
monster which requires $44 billion annually simply to feed. As  
the finance minister stated in the budget, service charges on the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11592"> 11592 </A></B>
<P>
debt will eventually reach $50 billion before the ratio of debt to 
gross domestic product starts to improve.
<P>
	This is a good time, as everyone knows, to talk about the debt 
because officials from the Department of Finance have been 
meeting with Moody's, the bond rating agency in New York, to 
discuss a possible downgrading in Canada's rating. If the talks 
go badly and if Moody's ultimately downgrades our credit 
worthiness, the cost of borrowing money to service the debt will 
be even higher.
<P>
	As has often been pointed out, the Liberal red book is silent on 
two questions: when will we eliminate the deficit and how will 
we then deal with the accumulated stock of Canada's debt?
<P>
	A constituent of Don Valley West, financial analyst Ross 
Healy of Strategic Analysis Corporation in Toronto, has 
proposed a radical, elegant solution to Canada's debt problem 
called the Phoenix Rising Solution. At the heart of his proposal 
is an approach which is often used in corporate restructuring, 
cleaning up the balance sheet by converting excessive debt to 
equity. In this regard the Phoenix solution is conventional and 
even commonplace in the private sector, but for government the 
solution is unique, daring in the proposed scale of the financial 
offering and radical in its drastic alteration of government 
finances.
<P>
	What is proposed is, in Healy's words:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-an equity underwriting of up to $780 billion which will be used to pay 
down the indebtedness of the federal and provincial governments. The 
`equity' used is a 30 year stream of tax revenues `bundled up' such that there 
is sufficient present value to replace the indebtedness of the government. The 
new instrument we shall call the Canadian Phoenix Trust. Shares in the 
Canadian Phoenix Trust will be exchanged for current government 
indebtedness on a dollar for dollar basis. It is therefore a replacement of the 
existing debt with equity, as no `new' capital is required for its success.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1230 ) </B>
<P>
	Here are the details of the proposal. The federal and 
provincial governments sell the rights to a future stream of tax 
revenue to a tax free trust, the stream being large enough to 
create a present value of up to $780 billion, the total of all direct 
government federal and provincial indebtedness. Units of the 
trust would be swapped for existing debt obligations.
<P>
	Using a 3.5 per cent nominal growth rate in gross domestic 
product and a 4.5 per cent tax free discount rate, it would require 
about 4.2 per cent of gross domestic product annually over 30 
years to service and retire the $780 billion of equity so created. 
The moneys would come from existing tax revenues.
<P>
	The cost of servicing current and provincial debts is about $60 
billion annually and rising. As a result there would be an 
immediate saving of roughly 50 per cent in debt service costs. 
The moneys paid not only cover service costs but also amortize 
the full amount of the debt.
<P>
	Like a mortgage, the blended annual payments of dividends 
and principal are paid every year, and trust income is a flat 4.2 
per cent of Canadian gross domestic product for 30 years, the 
annual amounts growing in direct relation to the growth of GDP.
<P>
	Two questions arise immediately. If such a scheme worked, 
what would be its advantage? Of course, most importantly, 
would such a scheme work?
<P>
	First the advantages. Economists have calculated that the 
current high levels of Canadian government indebtedness 
constitute an enormous drag on the Canadian economy by 
crowding out private sector borrowers. These economists 
estimate Canada's gross domestic product would be between 
$110 billion and $140 billion greater per year without the debt.
<P>
	Eliminating government debt would permanently lower 
Canada's interest rates, thereby improving the climate for 
innovation, investment and long-term growth.
<P>
	With the government reducing costs of servicing the debt by 
50 per cent, coupled with the existing budgetary measures 
proposed in February, Canada's federal deficit would be 
eliminated in two years, not simply reduced to 3 per cent of 
gross domestic product. The combination of stronger economic 
growth and future budgetary surpluses would allow 
governments to lower tax rates, thereby encouraging even 
stronger economic growth. The Phoenix solution would create a 
virtuous economic circle indeed.
<P>
	The biggest question, of course, is can such a scheme work? 
More precisely, will investors buy? Why would investors swap 
their holdings of government bonds for Phoenix Trust units on a 
sufficient scale to make it worthwhile? In the words of Ross 
Healy and his associate, Enrico Sgromo: ``Investors will swap if 
they feel that the Phoenix Trust units represent a good 
investment and the current Government of Canada bonds 
represent increasing risk because of the financial crises that the 
government finds itself in''. Well, given the last and recent 
gloomy conversations with Moody's, at least the latter half of 
this proposition seems reasonable.
<P>
	The major attraction for foreign investors in the short term is 
the very positive impact on the Canadian dollar, which would 
gain value immediately. Over the long term the participation in a 
growing economy with low interest rates would offer both 
foreign and Canadian investors the opportunity for major capital 
gains. The beauty of the Phoenix solution is that the better 
Canada does economically, the better investors do financially. 
When we succeed, they succeed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11593"> 11593 </A></B>
<P>
	I have only sketched the outline of a concept that has been 
more fully elaborated elsewhere. My purpose is to test a new 
idea and ask for constructive responses from my parliamentary 
colleagues and indeed from citizens who may be watching this 
program.
<P>
	I do not claim that the Phoenix solution is perfect, only that it 
is better than all other solutions I have heard proposed to date for 
solving our debt crisis.
<P>
	In the end it will be up to members of the international 
investment community to decide whether they are interested in 
exploring a new investment vehicle. Over the years that 
financial community has shown a remarkable capacity for 
innovation, sometimes to their cost, as Barings Bank recently 
discovered. But I suspect that the prospect of charging even a 
modest commission on the conversion of $780 billion from debt 
to equity might intrigue even the most jaded spirits on Bay 
Street and on Wall Street.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I welcome this opportunity today to speak to Bill 
C-76 which proposes to implement certain provisions of the 
federal budget tabled by the Minister of Finance in February.
<P>
	Unfortunately, this bill confirms what the official opposition 
suspected when the budget was tabled. And how does it confirm 
these suspicions?
<P>
	Since the Liberal government cannot go on adding to the debt, 
it has decided to reduce the federal deficit by offloading the 
deficit to the provinces. Our Liberal big brother suddenly turned 
into an unwilling partner, a most unwilling partner, who decided 
unilaterally to reduce transfer payments to the provinces by 
more than $7 billion over the next three years.
<P>
	These cuts will not take effect until 1996, to maintain the 
illusion that federalism pays, especially for Quebec. An illusion 
that will be particularly useful during the referendum campaign.
<P>
	But the official opposition is keeping a close watch. This 
camouflage operation is despicable. Starting in 1996, Quebec 
stands to lose more than $700 million, and in 1997, more than $1 
billion. This is intolerable.
<P>
	What we have here is an irresponsible government that is 
trying to make the provinces take care of a situation the 
government created. The provinces are stuck with the bill, but 
they are not being given new powers. Only the federal debt is 
being decentralized, not government.
<P>
	In the social sector, the long-awaited transfer of jurisdiction 
did not take place. Appearances to the contrary, the federal 
government insists on interfering in areas over which the 
provinces have exclusive jurisdiction. It withdraws but refuses 
to allocate an equivalent share of tax points to the provinces. Is 
this the much vaunted flexible federalism?
<P>
	What is so flexible about letting one's so-called partners in 
this wonderful federation pay the bill, while imposing 
increasingly restrictive national standards in several areas?
<P>
	Section 48 of this bill confirms that in addition to national 
standards for health care, there will be new standards for social 
assistance and post-secondary education. And provinces that do 
not play by the rules will see their funding cut.
<P>
	The federal government's response is that these standards will 
not come into force before a consensus is reached among the 
provinces. Then why this attempt to introduce so-called 
national standards before there have been negotiations between 
the parties?
<P>
	I will not dwell on the fact that the provinces were ordered to 
mention the Canada Social Transfer in all advertising and 
documentation referring to health care services offered by the 
provinces. Flexible federalism is dead in the water, long live 
imperial federalism.
<P>
	But the empire is crumbling under its tax burden. In spite of 
cuts in social programs and transfer payments, the federal giant 
will need even more money to survive during the next three 
years.
<P>
	The Canadian government's revenues will increase from $125 
billion in 1994-95 to $137.4 billion in 1996-97. Taxes will 
increase by more than $3.5 billion over a period of three years. 
In fact, we will be paying more for less.
<P>
	Need I remind the House that since 1980, the ratio of 
government revenues to GDP has increased by 18 per cent? 
Since the 1980 referendum in Quebec, taxes in Canada have 
increased at twice the average rate for G-7 countries.
<P>
	It is shocking to see that as it prepares to cut payments to the 
provinces and increase taxes, this government refuses to do 
anything to stop duplication and the outrageous waste of public 
funds.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	Where are the real measures to eliminate waste and overlap 
between levels of government? The answer is obvious. With the 
federal system, there will always be two departments of the 
environment, two departments of health and two departments of 
justice. By nature, the federal system extends its grasp ever 
further. The negative effects of the federal budget, renewed in 
Bill C-76, will hit all the provinces hard, particularly Quebec.
<P>
	According to a recent study by Wood Gundy the expenditure 
control plan proposed by the federal government to reduce 
transfer payments to the provinces and the many changes over 
the past decade to established programs financing have 
increased provincial deficits.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11594"> 11594 </A></B>
<P>
	The Government of Quebec has estimated that the cumulative 
effect of these measures from 1982 to 1994 meant a shortfall for 
it of $14.3 billion. The federal government's latest budget 
confirms that this trend will increase.
<P>
	Federal money transfers in fact represent an increasingly 
smaller portion of Quebec's revenues. I will give you just one 
example. In 1983, federal transfers represented almost 29 per 
cent of Quebec's revenues. In 1994, they represented 20 per 
cent.
<P>
	Wood Gundy believes that the cost of the federal 
government's withdrawal from established programs financing 
alone, responsible for 28 per cent of provincial deficits in 
1993-94, will grow to 60 per cent of them in 1996-97. 
February's budget simply announced a worsening of the 
situation.
<P>
	On the other hand, needs in the areas of post-secondary 
education and health care are on the rise. The provincial 
governments are faced with an existential dilemma: cut services 
or increase their deficit.
<P>
	The official opposition has no choice but to criticize the 
government's lack of vision in reducing the deficit accumulated 
over the years. The government should have put its energies into 
eliminating useless duplication and overlapping jurisdictions 
with the provinces.
<P>
	It should have trimmed the fat off its still cumbersome and 
ever costly structure. The Liberal government could have cut 
nearly $3 billion more over three years at the Department of 
National Defence alone. It failed to do so.
<P>
	If it had gotten out of areas of provincial jurisdiction, in 
exchange for equivalent compensation in the form of tax point 
transfers, it would have created significant savings for both 
itself and the provinces. It would have meant savings for the 
federal government of nearly $3 billion in health care, 
professional training, post-secondary education and all 
programs relating to human resources development.
<P>
	If the federal government withdrew from these areas of 
jurisdication, the Government of Quebec could, among other 
things, establish a real job creation strategy by tailoring human 
resources development and job training programs to key sectors 
of the province's economy.
<P>
	But the federal government's actions tell a different story. The 
official opposition feels that this bill will actually impede job 
creation, because, instead of withdrawing from labour and 
education, which would permit the provinces to get to the heart 
of the problem, the federal government's role in these areas is 
actually reinforced by this bill.
<P>
	As for Canada's tax system, the federal government still has 
given no real indication that it was serious about thoroughly 
revamping it. Some people still have the joy of exploiting tax 
havens!
<P>
	Quebecers will soon have to decide which path to take. On the 
one hand, they have the option of taking their own matters in 
hand, of being masters of their destiny by founding a country 
they can call their own, and investing the imagination, creativity 
and constant quest for excellence that they are well known for in 
that country.
<P>
	On the other, they have the option of remaining in a political 
and economic system that distinctly refuses to acknowledge 
their existence, of sticking with the status quo, which 
undoubtedly will lead them nowhere as a people. A stale 
political and economic regime crumbling under its own debt, 
deficit and taxes, unable to guarantee its citizens an acceptable 
standard of living. A political and economic regime which, 
without a doubt, is doomed to failure.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	Sovereignty, admittedly, is not the miracle cure for all of 
Quebec's woes, but it will give Quebecers the power to pull the 
political and economic levers which will promote Quebec's 
growth.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, why is the opposition, through its amendment, 
asking the government to redo its homework? Because spending 
cuts are often made in the wrong places or simply mishandled. 
Let me give you an example. It was decided to eliminate 
transportation subsidies in eastern Canada. It is understandable 
that, after several years, this program had to be reviewed.
<P>
	However, according to Transport Canada documents, the 
transition fund that will replace these subsidies cannot be used 
to help shippers or to invest in roads and other transportation 
infrastructures on a cost-shared basis. There may be interesting 
projects in the two options offered but what is important in the 
region affected is to ensure that the money will be used to 
achieve what should be the real objectives: to direct industrial 
development and to ensure that the new industrial structure can 
handle the challenges of the 21st century.
<P>
	That is why the opposition is submitting a very constructive 
proposal to the government. The opposition is proposing that 
this fund-which amounts to $78 million in Quebec, $121 
million in New Brunswick, and so on in the other Maritime 
Provinces-be used not only for the road infrastructure but also 
to establish a business assistance fund that will help develop the 
second and third stage processing sector or simply help business 
adjust to technological changes. It is important to invest in roads 
but they are only one aspect of industrial development.
<P>
	If we put all our eggs in the same basket, we will end up with a 
road network that will have to be maintained over a certain 
number of years. The government is experiencing difficulties 
that do not augur well for the future but by investing in business, 
by establishing a fund from which companies could borrow 
money that they would have to repay later, the fund could last for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11595"> 11595 </A></B>
<P>
5, 10,  15 or 20 years and have a permanent impact on economic 
restructuring in eastern Canada, especially in eastern Quebec.
<P>
	Suggestions like this lead us to call on the government to redo 
its homework and take a few more months to work through the 
bill aimed at making the changes needed to implement the 
budget.
<P>
	Let me give you another example of this type of situation. In 
the next few months, we will see what I would call the 
automation of Canada Employment Centres. It is rather 
paradoxical that, next year, the so-called Human Resources 
Development Department will be focusing in a major way on 
replacing workers with machines. Computers will be made 
available to the jobless in some places. I can clearly detect in 
that the approach taken with seniors and voice boxes. But the 
people who deal with unemployment centres may not know how 
to work automated systems.
<P>
	Citizens will be further removed from civil servants, 
aggravating the problem of individuals becoming file numbers 
and having a tendency to abuse the system. So, instead of 
striving for realistic goals, this measure will be 
counterproductive because machines are replacing people. The 
human resources sector differs from the car manufacturing 
sector in that robots can be used to build cars but, if you want to 
help individuals find work and reenter the workforce, it is 
essential that they establish good contacts in terms of 
professional counselling and feel that the people they deal with 
at the employment centre are able to help them with their 
personal circumstances.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	As I recall, when I was touring with the committee on the 
Axworthy reform, someone came to me with a proposal that I 
think would have been much more appropriate than these 
changes. What of it was now up to the users, the UI recipients, to 
evaluate or assess the services they receive? Perhaps that, based 
of the information provided by the users, the government would 
abandon this reform, or at least make sure that the human 
element is not removed, and plans for adding new technologies.
<P>
	I would also like to list a few areas where we urge the 
government to go back to the drawing board. It was decided to 
reduce to nil-that is no small cut-funding for agencies 
involved with public participation in and awareness of 
international development. Every organization with a mandate 
to make Quebecers and Canadians aware of the importance of 
international co-operation will not be getting a penny more. 
This was done in a very cavalier fashion. The organizations were 
informed by phone and, in my riding, the CREECQ received 
written confirmation after it had taken effect.
<P>
	It is rather insulting and appalling for organizations dedicated 
to ensuring that there is a future for co-operation. On the 
downside of this decision is the fact that these organizations also 
drew a parallel between  poverty in our part of the world and in 
the South. It made it clear that everything is interconnected and 
that choices made in Northern countries create poverty in the 
South. We often have the same attitude towards our 
underprivileged as we do towards third world nations.
<P>
	These organizations made sure people were aware of the 
reality. Given the government's current tendency to copy the 
American model, which entails the disintegration of the middle 
class, it is easy to figure out that it wants to get rid of those who 
question its social measures.
<P>
	This appears to be a very bad decision which will result in 
Quebecers and Canadians being less aware of the need to 
provide international assistance.
<P>
	I also want to mention the abolition of the Canadian Advisory 
Council on the Status of Women. This is another example of an 
unacceptable announcement. No ministerial statement was 
made. It was during a debate that we were informed that the 
Canadian Advisory Council on the Status of Women would 
disappear. This is another case of getting rid of those who 
question the government's actions regarding those who are in 
difficulty and who need a more flexible society.
<P>
	The last example which I want to give relates to agriculture. 
The subsidy for industrial milk is reduced by 30 per cent. This 
means that either producers or consumers will be affected. And 
which consumers will be most affected if the price of butter goes 
up? It is those who have less disposable income. When the price 
of a pound of butter goes up 10 or 15 cents, that increase is not 
felt by those who earn $60,000, $70,000 or $80,000, but it has a 
direct impact on the budget of the poor, who have no choice but 
to reduce their spending even more.
<P>
	All this is to tell you that we kind of wonder why the reaction 
to this budget is relatively positive in English-speaking 
provinces, while it is negative in Quebec. The media gave us the 
answer yesterday. Thanks to the federal system, Quebec is the 
province with the highest proportion of poor in the country. 
After 125 years, that finding alone would be enough to convince 
me that we must change systems and have control over our 
development as a whole. This is essential.
<P>
	Whether in the context of an annual budget such as this one, or 
in the context of a more fundamental decision, Quebecers have a 
very different vision of development. This is why we want the 
federal government to do its job properly, while we are still part 
of that system. We are asking it to go back to the drawing board 
and to reconsider a number of legislative provisions which will 
have to be passed to implement this budget. We also hope that, 
when the time comes for Quebecers to make their fundamental 
decision, they will realize that a new system is essential for their 
development and also to change things which can no longer be 
tolerated in Quebec.

	The House resumed from March 28 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-69, an act to provide for the establishment of 
electoral boundaries commissions and the readjustment of 
electoral boundaries, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, Bill C-69 being debated today deals with the 
establishment of electoral boundaries commissions and the 
readjustment of electoral boundaries.
<P>
	This bill would certainly improve the current situation. For 
one thing, the provincial commissions will now have to hold 
hearings before starting their work and will have to produce 
three maps for every region covered, that is, three redistribution 
proposals. If there is sufficient public demand, the commissions 
will have to hold new hearings. We must admit that the process 
has been improved compared to the current situation.
<P>
	The bill also requires the commissions to consider certain 
elements in setting satisfactory electoral boundaries. Clause 
19(<I>b</I>) of the bill outlines the criteria to be considered: first, 
community of interest; second, a manageable geographic size 
for districts in sparsely populated, rural or northern regions of 
the province, and; third, the probability that there will be a 
substantial increase in the population of an electoral district in 
the province in the next five years.
<P>
	Finally, clause 19(<I>c</I>) stipulates that the commission shall 
recommend changes to existing electoral district boundaries 
only where the factors considered above are sufficiently 
significant to warrant such a recommendation.
<P>
	It is interesting to note that the first criterion refers to 
community of interest. However, another provision of the bill 
specifies that an electoral district cannot vary by more than 25 
per cent from the provincial quota. For example, if the electoral 
quota for Quebec is 100,000 voters, the commission can 
establish ridings that have between 75,000 and 125,000 voters.
<P>
	The commission can agree that there is a community of 
interest but that the number of voters does not meet standards.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	Take, for instance, the riding of 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine which is now below the 
provincial quota but has a vast territory.
<P>
	The bill does, however, provide that under certain 
circumstances, the commissions are not obliged to apply the 
25-per cent rule. However, these circumstances are so 
restrictive that one wonders in what cases they would actually 
apply.
<P>
	In accordance with subsection 19(3), a commission may 
depart from the 25 per cent rule if an electoral district or 
territory is geographically isolated from the rest of the province 
or is not readily accessible from the rest of the province.
<P>
	What does geographically isolated mean? Who is going to 
define this? The provincial commission? The courts? The bill 
gives no indication. To get back to the case of the Magdalen 
Islands, they are, of course, geographically isolated. Should the 
population rule apply? Residents had their own federal electoral 
district until 1968, and to this day, Quebec law has guaranteed 
them their own provincial riding. With all due respect for the 
work being done by the hon. member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, we think it would make 
very good sense for the Magdalen Islands, located in the middle 
of the ocean, 210 kilometres from the Gaspé coast, to have a 
member exclusively for the islands.
<P>
	It will therefore be up to the residents to make a case that the 
islands are geographically isolated. That should not be difficult. 
Complying with this initial rule should not be a problem. 
Subsequently, they will have to show  that the population of the 
islands would justify establishing a new riding. Of course, this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11597"> 11597 </A></B>
<P>
would have certain consequences. If the Magdalen Islands are 
entitled to have their own member, the riding of Bonaventure 
will lose the constituency that would form the new riding on the 
islands. So there is still a problem for the Gaspé peninsula.
<P>
	What happens to the ridings of Gaspé, Matapédia-Matane, 
Rimouski-Témiscouata and Bonaventure? What about them? 
Does subsection 19(3) provide a way to deal with the problem of 
the Gaspé peninsula? Unfortunately, the subsection is not 
sufficiently detailed. The Gaspé peninsula is a region with a 
decreasing population, where members must cover considerable 
territory. They must deal with problems that do not exist, or at 
least not in the same way, in the more central areas of the 
country or province represented. Members are concerned about 
representation in the Gaspé peninsula.
<P>
	Subsection 19(3) is far too restrictive to be acceptable to us. 
We had suggested maintaining in the bill before the House today 
the rules now in effect. What are these rules?
<P>
	At the present time, a provincial commission may depart from 
the 25-per cent rule in any case where any special community or 
diversity of interests of the inhabitants of various regions of the 
province appears to render such a departure necessary or 
desirable. So in fact, provincial commissions have far more 
leeway when they have to deal with specific cases. They have far 
more flexibility than they have under this bill.
<P>
	So a region, like the lower St. Lawrence, the Gaspé or the 
Islands, would have benefitted more under current legislation 
than they will under the extremely restrictive legislation they 
want us to adopt today.
<P>
	Clause 19 is for the official opposition a major reason for not 
supporting this bill.
<P>
	Clause 16 is unacceptable as well, both for what it says and for 
what it does not say. Its silence speaks volumes. The 
government is turning a deaf ear to the traditional request by 
Quebecers and their successive governments for minimum 
representation in the House of Commons, as enjoyed by some of 
the Atlantic provinces.
<P>
	Representation of the Atlantic provinces is guaranteed, as you 
know, by the senatorial clause which dates back to 1915. We 
have no argument with this provision.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	It enables Prince Edward Island, with a population of 
120,000, to have four members in this House, because the 
senatorial provision specifies that a province may not have 
fewer representatives in the House of Commons than it has in 
the Senate. Prince Edward Island is guaranteed four seats in the 
Senate. The same rule applies to New Brunswick. It has a 
guarantee of ten seats in the Senate.
<P>
	Although its population does not warrant its having ten seats 
in the House, New Brunswick is entitled to ten seats. We have no 
problem with that. The Terms of Union of Newfoundland with 
Canada of 1949 also covered this point and could be used to 
guarantee proper representation of Newfoundland in both the 
House of Commons and the Senate. This is just what it did; it 
guaranteed Newfoundland six seats in the Senate.
<P>
	If we accept the senatorial clause that guarantees are to be 
given to Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, 
why is there such an impediment to giving guarantees to Quebec 
on the subject of minimum representation?
<P>
	Quebec is one of the two founding nations of this country. The 
collective memory of Quebecers has not forgotten that, in 1867, 
we were one of the two founding peoples. Allow me to remind 
you that on June 30, 1867, on the eve of the day the British North 
America Act was to come into force, Quebec, then called Lower 
Canada, had 65 of the 130 seats in the Parliament of the Province 
of Canada, that is half the seats, 50 per cent of the members.
<P>
	Through its representatives, that is to say those elected to 
represent us, Quebec accepted at the time of the British North 
America Act to be limited to 65 seats out of 181 in the 
Parliament of Canada. This was the agreement reached by the 
Fathers of Confederation which was to come into force on July 
1, 1867.
<P>
	There was no referendum at the time. There was no 
consultation of the people of Quebec before the decision was 
made. It is also important to note that women were not 
consulted, since they did not have the right to vote at that time. 
There was no constitutional provision for a minimum 
representation for Quebec. The only guarantee we got was that 
Quebec would have 65 seats, although it did not say out of how 
many. On that point, there was nothing in the act.
<P>
	Then, with the expansion of the Canadian territory and the 
inclusion of new provinces in the Confederation, the proportion 
of seats held by Quebec in the House of Commons constantly 
diminished until, in the last few decades, it stabilized at 
somewhere slightly above 25 per cent. Clearly the Fathers of 
Confederation erred when they failed to include a clause 
guaranteeing Quebec a minimum representation and, at that 
time, it should have been 50 per cent.
<P>
	It is rather difficult to rewrite history and to claim 50 per cent 
today. What we are asking for is a guarantee of at least 25 per 
cent of the seats in the House of Commons. Should Quebec 
participate in the elections for the thirty-sixth Parliament, for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11598"> 11598 </A></B>
<P>
the first time in its history, its representation would fall below 
25 per cent, since it would have only 75 seats out of 301.
<P>
	This explains our proposal which, basically, is the same as the 
Liberal proposal of 1992, when they were in opposition. Let us 
see what the hon. member for Papineau-Saint-Michel and 
present Minister of Foreign Affairs was saying at the time. He 
was happy to seek for Quebec a guarantee of at least 25 per cent 
of the seats, saying that it would be a major gain for Quebec.
<P>
	Yet, none of the Liberal members who were in this House in 
1992 and are still here today supported our motion for a 
minimum of 25 per cent. How is it that these members changed 
their minds in so short a time? Why do they refuse Quebec 
something which is really minimal? Why do they refuse to make 
a move in the right direction? Why do they refuse a simple 
overture to Quebec? Why do they refuse a small sign of 
attachment to Quebec?
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	Why is this government refusing to show that it cares about 
Quebec, that it wants it to remain in Canada? Canada has no 
interest in having Quebec under-represented or diminished in 
the House of Commons. Quebec must keep its representation 
because it is a nation. It is one of the founding peoples. As a 
founding nation, francophones occupied all of Canada and went 
even a little farther, since our territory went as far as Louisiana.
<P>
	It goes without saying that this request from Quebec must be 
supported since the large majority of Quebec members in this 
House voted in favour of guaranteeing Quebec a 25 per cent 
minimum representation. Daniel Johnson, Leader of the Official 
Opposition in the Quebec National Assembly, presented the 
following motion: ``That the National Assembly of Quebec 
reiterate the goal of maintaining a representation of at least 25 
per cent for Quebec in the House of Commons of Canada and 
request the Government of Quebec to make representations to 
that effect''.
<P>
	Thus we know that there is a large consensus in Quebec, going 
beyond party lines, to claim this minimum guarantee of 25 per 
cent. When we see the Progressive Conservative Party, the 
official opposition that is the Bloc Quebecois, and the 
independent member for Beauce support such a motion to 
include in Bill C-69 a guarantee of a 25 per cent representation, 
it is obvious that this issue achieves a large consensus in 
Quebec.
<P>
	Needless to say that Senator Rivest also supported this 
provision. Even the governments of Quebec which requested 
that such a provision be included in our legislation have given it 
their unwavering support, and as far as I know, the current 
government had never retracted what had previously been 
agreed to.
<P>
	How strange it is indeed to see the government finally recant 
on something that it supported in September 1992. This 
government reneged on what our Canadian partners had 
unanimously accepted. Of course, it was in the context of the 
Charlottetown accord. But should  Quebec be punished because 
the rest of Canada decided that this accord was not to their 
advantage?
<P>
	You will therefore concede that the bill before us today for 
third reading is incomplete. Especially when it comes to the 
criteria used to determine whether there can be a departure from 
the boundaries of a riding or those used to designate special 
ridings. It is also incomplete because it fails to deal with the 
issue of the representation of one of the country's two founding 
peoples. The vote on the amendment proposed by the official 
opposition demonstrates without a doubt that the federal 
government's failure to guarantee in this bill fair representation 
in this House for Quebec was not an innocent oversight: it was 
deliberate.
<P>
	Would Canadians have been against the government finally 
recognizing Quebec's distinct society status, status as a 
founding people, as a nation on which this country was built? I 
am convinced the answer is no. This is the smallest request 
Quebec has made over the past 50 years.
<P>
	I would be helpful to go back to the beginning and to 
remember that Canada's history all started with the arrival of 
Jacques Cartier in Gaspé, in 1534. Then comes the founding of 
Quebec City by Samuel de Champlain in 1608; the founding of 
Trois-Rivières and Montreal in the decades that followed and 
afterwards, the establishment of the first public government in 
New France, as Canada was called then.
<P>
	Our first public institutions were created in 1663, when the 
King of France established the Sovereign Council of New 
France. We slowly stopped being French, became Canadians, 
then French Canadians and, ultimately, Quebecers.
<P>
	Meanwhile, in 1774, the Quebec Act restored civil law in 
Quebec and allowed us to have an unelected legislative council. 
They were afraid to give francophones, who were so peaceful, 
democratic institutions, institutions to which Quebecers could 
elect their own representatives. And yet, Quebecers, Canadians 
of the time, had shown great pacifism and open-mindedness.
<P>
	Finally, in 1791, thanks to the Constitutional Act, we were 
granted the right to elect our own representatives to our very 
first national assembly, in Quebec City. In 1791, we gained 
partial control over our institutions. Things went fairly fast after 
that, except that Canada was divided into Upper and Lower 
Canada. The assembly elected by Lower Canada has no 
extraterritorial power and cannot legislate on matters 
concerning Upper Canada and vice versa.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	In 1867, the institutions we still have today were created. It 
may seem somewhat paradoxical for a sovereignist to rise in this 
House to ask for a 25 per cent representation. We have not left 
yet. We are still part of Canada. It is our duty and our 
responsibility, in accordance with our commitment to defend 
Quebec's 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11599"> 11599 </A></B>
<P>
interests, to ask all parliamentarians in this House to grant us 25 
per cent of the seats.
<P>
	We were here first, we joined the union in 1840, we decided to 
live together. You will lose nothing in giving us 25 per cent of 
the seats. It would be a nice gesture toward a nation, a people 
you claim you want to keep within your ranks. It seems to me 
that if the government wants to give an obvious sign of its love 
for Quebec and is serious about keeping us in Canada, it must 
guarantee us a 25 per cent representation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I have had 
a question on the Order Paper for 348 days now and I am starting 
to wonder if I will have to wait-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member is quite entitled to 
raise that point, but he should raise it at a different time. Since 
the hon. member will not get a response at this time, I would ask 
him to raise that point the next time Questions on the Order 
Paper are discussed in the House.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to speak on the electoral boundaries issue 
because it relates to representation by population and, more 
importantly, to responsible government.
<P>
	I would like to point out that the House of Commons is built 
on the principle of representation by population. This great 
country of Canada came to be not by chance, but rather by strong 
convictions that all people could work together for the 
betterment of all. Perhaps it was the right man in the right 
position in the 1850s and 1860s, or perhaps it was a strong 
determination that a dream of federalism could work, but I know 
that compromise played an important role in the final decision. 
To make responsible government work in the 1850s, before 
Confederation, it took a lot of people working together, in 
particular the compromise for trade by George Brown, a man 
who put his country before himself when he proposed the great 
coalition in 1864.
<P>
	My hon. friend from Chambly spoke the other day of the 
French influence and what he felt was a lack of support by 
Reform members of this House for the French cause or French 
history. I want to assure my friend that Reformers are not so 
ignorant as to deny the history of their own country, nor to be 
unaware of those who shaped it from its beginnings.
<P>
	To be honest, I would first have to acknowledge our aboriginal 
people, whose beginnings we can trace well back to before 
Christ. On the west coast of Canada the use of cedar gives us 
many of our time clues. We can actually trace cedar growing on 
the west coast of B.C. to at least 3500 B.C.
<P>
	Later, as Europeans came to our country's shores, they 
claimed the land as theirs. Does that not seem odd? So many 
others were already in occupation of this land. True, the first 
European settlements were French settlements, after Cartier's 
visits of 1534 and 1535. Those settlements were along the coast 
of Nova Scotia. In the 1604-05 settlements there was severe 
hardship. The hardship was due to very cold winters, the lack of 
fresh water, and sickness. Those settlements did not remain at 
that time.
<P>
	Later came settlement in Quebec in 1608, as my colleagues 
from the Bloc have stated. That, of course, was Champlain's 
settlement in Quebec. As I recall, Champlain was very 
concerned about those in his small settlement. He wondered how 
to keep the morale up. His order of good cheer was to increase 
the morale and bring some relief and entertainment to those 
inhabitants who were so far from home. It is interesting to 
remember that many years later, Voltaire referred to New France 
as those few acres of snow.
<P>
<B>(1320 ) </B>
<P>
	Meanwhile, some French settlers had returned to the Acadian 
shores, and by 1613 these Acadians, peaceful farmers who tilled 
and looked after the land, really bothered no one. Yet that did not 
prevent the expulsion of the Acadians in 1755. Of course, they 
did not swear allegiance to the British crown. When they were 
expelled from Grand Pré, it was an injustice; it was cruel.
<P>
	Does it matter now that the English at the time feared the 
unrest to the south in the 13 colonies, which they thought was 
about to explode because they knew the Americans in the 1760s 
protested against the unjust taxation by the English? I think they 
called them the ``intolerable acts''. We are all aware of the 
Boston Tea Party. Well, does it matter now? I do not think so.
<P>
	Reformers are also aware of Longfellow's epic poem, 
``Evangeline'', the immortalized young Acadian woman who 
spent her life in search of her lost love, only to find him as he lay 
dying. Let me assure the Bloc, it is part of our tragic history as 
well.
<P>
	I watched the Anne Murray show last Friday night, dedicated 
to the fine music and musicians of Nova Scotia. She spoke with 
pride of her Acadian ancestry.
<P>
	What of the 30 years following 1755? Many English, later 
nicknamed loyalists, fled to the 13 colonies, often to escape 
being tarred and feathered-peaceful, law-abiding citizens-all 
because they wanted to remain obedient to the English crown. Is 
that not odd? A few years earlier cruelties had taken place 
because Acadians did not want to swear allegiance to the British 
crown. Wrongs on both sides.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11600"> 11600 </A></B>
<P>
	Many fled persecution by the Americans with only the clothes 
on their backs. They trekked for miles through unknown forests, 
hostile Indian lands, the same as the Acadians. So many came 
here in those years that in 1784 the colony of New Brunswick 
was created.
<P>
	We in this House are well aware that we are talking about over 
100,000 loyalists. They came to all parts of Canada, to Nova 
Scotia and Quebec-so many came to Quebec that Upper 
Canada was created-to P.E.I., to areas of Newfoundland.
<P>
	By 1791 the Constitution Act became a reality. The Quebec 
colony split into Upper and Lower Canada. Upper Canada 
contained many of the loyalists. The Constitution Act created 
elected assemblies with limited powers. Here again, we have 
England in control, so concerned dare she give much authority 
to these colonies. She has just seen what happened far to the 
south. At least she thought that was the lesson she should take 
from all of this. Was she wrong? I think history proves that she 
was.
<P>
	To go back, following the downfall of New France in 1759 and 
1760 with Montreal's capitulation, decisions had to be made. 
The first two governors, following military rule from 1760 to 
1763, were Murray and Carleton. Both these governors tried to 
protect the Canadien way of life: Catholic religion, French civil 
law, the language, the culture; English criminal law, though.
<P>
	Hesitation came when Murray did not introduce the elected 
assembly. Why did he not introduce the elected assembly? He 
had a minority of English people in Montreal scrambling for it. 
He was under constant attack. Why did he not do it? He was 
trying to protect the majority of French Canadians who at that 
time could not be elected to serve. Murray did not introduce it 
and the rest is history.
<P>
	Due to our diverse history our country has many tragedies. 
Perhaps there are those who feel they should be divided into 
nationalities. I do not. These are the tragedies of our country. 
They are our tragedies.
<P>
	To my friend from Chambly, I acknowledge that there was a 
British-French rivalry in the 1600s and 1700s. Of course there 
was. The wars continued at that time. Each nation wanted to 
control the rich resources of North America. What were those 
rich resources? The cod fishing grounds of Newfoundland and 
Acadia, the fur trade of the St. Lawrence. But where are they 
now? The cod are gone. Do we blame each other?
<P>
	Does it matter that in the last 20 years our Liberal and 
Conservative governments did not care for this vast resource 
wisely? In the fur trade, the animals pushed further and further 
into the remaining forests and hinterlands.
<P>
	Have we kept the mighty St. Lawrence free from pollution? 
Are the Belugas not being slowly poisoned? What about the 
Beluga who pushed her baby toward a boat so scientists could 
see her baby's open sores? The scientists in that documentary 
honestly felt that the Beluga wanted them to see that. Do the 
animals know what we are doing?
<P>
<B>(1325 ) </B>
<P>
	The Bloc is arguing for a 25 per cent guarantee. When the city 
of Quebec fell in 1759 to the British General Wolfe and later 
when Montreal fell in 1760, New France as it had been was gone.
<P>
	Under the Treaty of Paris in 1763, the proclamation promised 
protection for the Canadian way of life, including its traditional 
laws and the Roman Catholic religion. That does not mean we 
destroy representation by population.
<P>
	However, I would like to assure the member for Chambly that 
Reformers do not think Canadian history began with Reformers, 
but rather we are very much aware of the contribution made by 
the early French settlers. Representation by population, won by 
the population, fairness for all, equality for all-that is where 
we are coming from.
<P>
	However, if we are talking about Reformers, which Reformers 
was my hon. friend referring to? The 1800s or the 1900s? I see 
my friend over there is laughing again. This always gets a laugh 
from him. Well, if he will listen for a little while, I will see if I 
can get him to be serious for a moment.
<P>
	In the 1800s in Upper Canada we had Bidwell, Ryerson, 
Mackenzie and Baldwin. Why? We had the hated family 
compact, a small group of English gentry, for want of a better 
word, who wanted to keep the control in their own hands. The 
truth was the majority of Upper Canada's inhabitants were very 
poor. Immigrants were encouraged to come to Canada in the 
great migration.
<P>
	I want to share briefly with the House an article I read many, 
many times to my students, just to put them in the picture, not of 
the French Canadians' plight but in this case the Europeans' 
plight when they came to Canada in 1815.
<P>
	``Most immigrants who came to Canada during the great 
migration were very poor, but they could get cheap 
transportation to Canada. Passage to Montreal or Quebec by 
sailing ship in the 1820s was seven pounds, about two month's 
wages for a farm labourer, with meals included. Children 
travelled for half fare. These immigrants faced extreme 
hardships, both on board ship and in the colonies to which they 
travelled. Sicknesses such as cholera were common aboard ship. 
Tens of thousands died on their way to North America. The 
survivors faced great problems as they tried to find work or to 
clear the land for pioneer farms.''
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11601"> 11601 </A></B>
<P>
	The following description of a plight of an immigrant family 
living in a cave in Upper Canada was written in 1821.
<P>
	``The mother, who continued to shed tears, told me that she 
and her family were Irish immigrants. They had been induced by 
a series of misfortunes to set sail for Canada, with the intention 
of obtaining land, and had, after many difficulties, got thus far in 
their voyage. But, being now destitute of money, they were 
unable to procure a lodging and knew not where to apply for 
work, assistance or information. `A husband and these two 
boys', said the woman, `are all who remain to me. My little girl 
died on the ship and they threw her into the sea. Aye, sure, that 
was the worst of all', continued she in an agony of grief, `poor 
babe, she had neither prayers nor a wake'.''
<P>
	We do not often hear these stories, but let me remind the 
House that there are many of them. As a teacher for 30 years, I 
have books full of them.
<P>
	Often, after years of working the land, instead of the promised 
land deeds, these new Canadians received a bill for the total 
price of the land and of course they did not have the money. The 
promises that were made to them were all lies, and many of them 
lost their land. They were promised roads, schools and help that 
never materialized.
<P>
	Who were those first Reformers? They were the new Upper 
Canadians, who were lied to and could see no way of changing or 
of change coming under the existing system. Hardships? Oh yes.
<P>
	So we had moderate and radical Reformers from 1824 to 
1837. I choose those years because that is when it seemed to rise 
to a crescendo.
<P>
	Finally, when peaceful constitutional means did not bring 
relief or results, William Lyon Mackenzie King became a 
radical Reformer. How many times was he elected to the 
legislative assembly? How many times did Bond Head throw 
him out? He was re-elected again. Frustration? I guess he was 
frustrated.
<P>
	We are talking here about fair representation; the result, the 
rebellion of 1837. What am I saying? Rebellion did not just 
happen; it took many years of injustices created by a few at the 
top who tried to control others. Reformers came about because 
of necessity. Necessity is the mother of invention.
<P>
	I am well aware that the rebellion in Lower Canada happened 
again because of oppression by a small group in control. In this 
case again, English Governor Sir Francis Bond Head, in my 
opinion, should never have been in the position of power he was 
in. In history we often find people who are in positions they 
should never be in. He appointed who he wanted to be his 
executive and legal counsellors.
<P>
	In Upper Canada the Anglican Church dominated the scene. 
John Strachan, of course, the first Anglican Bishop of Toronto, 
wore many hats.
<P>
	How did the family compact get its name? Well, they 
inter-married, many of them, and gave jobs to friends and 
relatives. I think we call it patronage, do we not? Is it happening 
again today?
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	We are talking here of a privileged class of judges and 
magistrates, again family compact connections in a colonial 
society, all leaders of Upper Canada, members of the dreaded 
family compact and in Lower Canada the Chateau Clique, the 
same composition appointed by one governor, Bond Head. He 
chose his executive and legislative council from a group of 
British merchants. The mandate, what was it in Lower Canada? 
It appeared to be to force the Canadian population to adopt the 
British way of life.
<P>
	Louis Papineau emerged as a brilliant orator of the reform 
movement in Lower Canada. The frustrations of the Canadiens 
were rooted in both of the following: a cultural division between 
the French and English in Lower Canada; and the undemocratic 
nature of the colonial government. Power was abused. There is 
the saying: Absolute power corrupts; power corrupts absolutely. 
That is certainly true.
<P>
	Last night I briefly watched part of a documentary on J. Edgar 
Hoover. It was frightening. I think perhaps he epitomizes the 
master of civil servant control and how dangerous it can be if it 
gets out of hand. Why? It must be that the people who are elected 
and can be removed, must be accountable.
<P>
	What happened to Hoover? We saw people who lost their 
lives. Was it justified that they lost their lives? We saw a 
president killed. Who killed him? We saw some terrible things 
happen and all because power was not placed properly.
<P>
	Wrongs have happened in our country's history. Reformers 
arose in the 1800s out of necessity. In Upper and Lower Canada 
again Ryerson, Bidwell, Mackenzie, Papineau, Baldwin, La 
Fontaine were all reformers. On the east lawn there are statues 
of two reformers: La Fontaine and Baldwin. My friend from 
Chambly, these reformers were good men. They were all good 
men. Unfortunately when people want change and nothing 
happens they become frustrated. Rebellions happen.
<P>
	What happened to these reformers? Some in positions of 
power referred to them as Yankee loving traitors. Does it sound 
familiar? How often have we heard this in this House? 
Reformers try to talk about reforming health care. We try to talk 
about serious things that need to change and are going to have to 
change if we retain them. Yet we get accused of being American, 
of trying to force American doctrines in this House. I am really 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11602"> 11602 </A></B>
<P>
sorry to see debate reduced to these attacks and 
misrepresentations. Usually it is to avoid answering a question.
<P>
	Responsible government. Baldwin and La Fontaine worked 
hard for it. How important was it to address the rights of fair 
representation, the rights for responsible government? Finally 
England faced its responsibilities. When a rebellion happens 
you have to see the writing on the wall.
<P>
	Unfortunately though the colonial secretary, Lord John 
Russell, was in no way committed to responsible government. It 
was totally unacceptable to him. Although both rebellions 
failed, they succeeded. They succeeded because Britain became 
alarmed. Sixty years earlier it had lost its 13 colonies. Someone 
saw sense.
<P>
	Lord Durham was sent to Canada. He was nicknamed Radical 
Jack, probably because he was a powerful advocate for political 
reform in the 1830s in England. He was instrumental in getting 
votes on the secret ballot and was also instrumental in getting 
the vote for all men. I believe he was probably chosen because of 
this. He certainly was a man who would look at the other side of 
things. He was a sick man; he was a dying man when he came to 
Canada.
<P>
	Durham's appointment was seen as a welcome change on both 
sides of the Atlantic by those wishing for political change. He 
arrived in 1838. He was not well, as I said, but he was 
determined to do his duty.
<P>
	Responsible government was suggested to Lord Durham, the 
new Governor General, by Robert Baldwin, a reformer for all of 
the six British colonies remaining in eastern North America: 
Upper Canada, Lower Canada, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, 
P.E.I. and Newfoundland.
<P>
	Many similarities existed in the injustices in all six, injustices 
which led to the American revolution. Robert Baldwin was a 
moderate reformer. His proposal for responsible government 
appealed to Lord Durham. It was similar to Britain's form of 
government.
<P>
	After the rebellion, Durham had to deal with political 
prisoners. His leniency toward the rebels, especially in Lower 
Canada angered the English minority in Montreal. Because of 
the constant antagonism against him, after five months he 
resigned and went back to Britain. He still wrote the Durham 
report and the result of that, as we know, was the Act of Union in 
1840.
<P>
<B>(1335 ) </B>
<P>
	Favouring responsible government, the reaction in the 
Canadas for this favour it was now going to receive in Upper 
Canada was pretty positive. The Reformers knew political 
leaders were to emerge, like Francis Hincks who had been a 
newspaper man with the Toronto <I>Examiner</I>, and the Baldwins 
again, the people who had waited years for change. In Lower 
Canada, Étienne Parent and Louis La Fontaine were also anxious 
to see these changes.
<P>
	Lord Elgin was actually going to be the man who was 
instrumental in putting responsible government forward. He 
was actually the son-in-law of Lord Durham. He was married to 
Mary, Lord Durham's daughter. When he came the instrument 
was going to be the rebellion losses bill to make amends to those 
people who had lost valuable property.
<P>
	We know what happened. We received responsible 
government. Lord Elgin listened to the people. He gave royal 
assent. In 1848, Nova Scotia had it because the Reform 
government was in power. In 1849, New Brunswick and the 
Canadas had it. In 1851, P.E.I. had it and Newfoundland had it in 
1855.
<P>
	What about the native people in Canada? What about the 
genocide committed on the Beothuk Nation in Newfoundland? 
We have made so many errors. What about the Japanese? During 
the war maybe we had to have security restraints but we did not 
have to give away all their property.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I wonder if there would be unanimous 
consent to give the member a few more minutes to finish her 
talk?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jennings:</B> Thank you. What of our errors in the way we 
treated our Japanese Canadians? They had a lot of valuable real 
estate, especially in British Columbia, which ended up in the 
hands of a lot of suspect people. I did not like what happened in 
British Columbia. It was wrong.
<P>
	We have a lot to be ashamed of, but it is all of our shame. It is 
our history. It is us. We have to be equal. We have to care 
together. To remove and sell off people's possessions is wrong.
<P>
	Should we visit the sins of the fathers on the sons? I think not. 
In my classroom we would often say: ``Yesterday was another 
time; tomorrow is the first day of the rest of my life''. That is 
where we should be going in Canada today. We had two mothers 
in Ireland, one Protestant, one Catholic, who tried to go for 
peace, who also used that idea. We have to make it a better 
world.
<P>
	Any electoral changes must be to protect all Canadians 
equally, as equally as our Constitution at present will allow. I 
hope my friend from Chambly will concede that Reformers 
know their history. Perhaps it is with a little different emphasis, 
but I hope I respect all cultures in our country: no special 
privileges, no special interest groups, all of us working together 
in a federal union.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
comment and a question. We are currently debating the motion 
that Quebec should keep at least 25 per cent of the seats in this 
House.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11603"> 11603 </A></B>
<P>
	I listened carefully to my colleague. After going over 200 to 
300 years of history, she said we should forget all that. But she 
did not mention the events that have occurred in the last 20 
years.
<P>
	I would like to remind her of the reasons why Quebec is so 
distrustful and why it is asking for this protection. As recently as 
1980, the federal government defeated the Yes side in the 
Quebec referendum after spending hundreds of millions of 
dollars. In 1971, for instance-why was it not 
mentioned?-Parliament passed the Official Languages Act, 
which since then has become the perfect instrument of 
assimilation.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	In 1970, the Canadian government invoked the War Measures 
Act in the middle of the night in order to send in the army and 
stifle the separatist, the sovereignist movement. They arrested 
500 people without warrants. Do you think we will forget this 
overnight? No way. One cannot forget those events.
<P>
	More recently, there was Meech Lake. I will not spend too 
much time on this, since a member of this House sitting across 
the way, who was then a member of the Manitoba legislature, 
prevented debate on this matter, thus killing the accord. No one 
seemed to be sorry about the Meech Lake failure, except 
Quebecers of course.
<P>
	Today, the hon. member, who claims to be a good teacher, 
would like to wipe the slate clean and forget about those events.
<P>
	My question is this, Mr. Speaker: Do you think Quebecers can 
trust this government to set the record straight regarding those 
events?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jennings:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. 
member for his comments.
<P>
	First, his history professor feels very strongly, as does he, 
about the pain people experience. I understand his pain. I do not 
think it can be forgotten. I do not know if anyone could forget the 
pain. I do not know if my father could forget everything he saw 
in the four wars in which he fought. I do not know if my 
grandmother could forget that she lost four sons, 17, 18 and 19 
years old. I do not know if people can forget those things. I know 
that we had better start looking at making a change. I know that 
they are still trying to get reparation.
<P>
	No one can say that our friends in Quebec have been 
assimilated. I do not think that would ever happen. They are very 
proud of their culture. They have done a wonderful job in 
maintaining their culture. Every year in my classroom I had six 
students who came from Quebec. It was a wonderful experience. 
There is no danger of our friends in Quebec ever being 
assimilated.
<P>
	However, I am asking them to do something for all Canadians, 
as well as for the people of Quebec. We are all one country. It is a 
rich country. We can set an example for the world if we are 
willing to work together. Please help us make that change.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to my hon. colleague from the Reform Party. I heard 
him say, referring to the Loyalists, that: ``There were so many in 
Quebec that Upper Canada had to be created-To be created out 
of what exactly?''
<P>
	Does this mean that we were confined to a smaller territory; 
by ``we'', I mean francophones?
<P>
	We are reminded of the massive influx of immigrants in 1815. 
The hon. member from the Reform Party said: ``Those people 
were lied at. They could see no chance, no change coming into 
the system''. Have we not been seeing the same thing happen 
over and over again for years.
<P>
	She also said: ``Reformers arose in the 1800s out of 
necessity''. Does this statement not also apply to the 
sovereignists who have been pursuing their action for 30 years 
already and perhaps more?
<P>
	I would like to leave you with this thought and I would like the 
thoughts of my hon. colleague from the Reform Party on this. 
``History tends to keep repeating itself mainly because we do not 
listen to it''. And that is a question I would like an answer to.
<P>
<B>(1345 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jennings:</B> Mr. Speaker, yes, I would agree with the hon. 
member, history does keep repeating itself.
<P>
	What happened when the Loyalists came there? We know that 
in the 1850s there were 400,000 people in Upper Canada. After 
the division in Lower Canada there were about 150,000 English 
compared to 450,000 French. When we look at that balance it is 
a lot of people to govern.
<P>
	In the wisdom of the people at that time, I would assume it 
would only make sense to make a geographic division, the 
Ottawa River being the dividing line. That is all I can give the 
member in that answer.
<P>
	Yes, there were reformers in Canada in the 1800s. The 
member said that history keeps repeating itself. I must tell the 
member that Upper and Lower Canada both had their reformers. 
Lafontaine and Baldwin were both recognized by the Canadian 
government. History keeps repeating itself. That is why there 
are reformers today. If we do not pay attention to history, then 
necessity comes again.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of 
all, I must denounce Bill C-69, which, in my view, is a farce. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11604"> 11604 </A></B>
<P>
The only purpose of this bill is to take away from Quebec its 
vested rights as a founding nation. Allow me to explain.
<P>
	It is essential that the historical number of members 
representing Quebec be maintained. Needless to say that, in a 
few months, after Quebec has become sovereign, the 
Government of Canada will be free to do as it pleases. But for 
the time being, we are still here and our job is to look after the 
interests of the people of Quebec.
<P>
	Obviously, the members opposite, the Liberal government, 
have a short memory. I will try to connect them to reality by 
stating a few historical facts.
<P>
	Representation and the description of the electoral boundaries 
are both calculated according to the rules provided in sections 
51 and 51(<I>a</I>) of the Constitution Act, 1867 and sections 14 and 
15 of the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act.
<P>
	The federal legislation on the readjustment of electoral 
boundaries established an electoral boundaries commission for 
each province. These commissions are responsible for drawing a 
new electoral map, in which the population of each electoral 
district will correspond to the electoral quota for the province. 
This quota is obtained by dividing the population of the province 
by the number of members of the House of commons assigned to 
the province.
<P>
	There is a section of the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment 
Act that I find fascinating, namely section 15, which states: 
``Community of interest, or the specificity of an electoral 
district in the province or the historical development thereof, 
and a manageable geographic size for districts in sparsely 
populated, rural or northern regions of the province''.
<P>
	Last year, when this commission came to Chicoutimi, changes 
were proposed. Five of the seven municipalities in the riding of 
Chicoutimi were to be assigned to the riding of Jonquière. The 
problem with this change is well defined in the section I just 
read.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	First, there is the community of interests. The municipalities 
of the Lower Saguenay which would find themselves separated 
have always had economic and social ties with La Baie, which is 
another major centre of the riding of Chicoutimi. Indeed, 
several services located in La Baie are provided to Lower 
Saguenay residents, including the Canada employment centre 
and the small business development centre.
<P>
	Second, the area covered by a riding must be taken into 
consideration. In order to have access to services in the riding of 
Jonquière, residents of Ferland-Boileau-the municipality 
closest to the one which was going to be included in the riding of 
Jonquière-would have had to travel 45 kilometres. This is a 
good example of what the Liberal government planned to do in 
my riding last year.
<P>
	I am convinced that this kind of nonsense would also have 
occurred elsewhere than in the Saguenay region. It would be 
interesting to check this out for the province as a whole. 
However, given the decisions taken every day by this 
government, there is no point in doing that. Indeed, the daily 
actions of the Liberals speak for themselves, which is more than 
enough.
<P>
	A few days ago, the hon. member for Bellechasse pointed out 
that the 1985 legislation on electoral representation was very 
clear as regards the number of seats to be allocated to Quebec, 
since it stated that, before any new distribution, the chief 
returning officer had to ensure that Quebec would get 25 per cent 
of the seats.
<P>
	This is not the first time that Quebec gets taken. This 
unfortunate reality is prevalent throughout the history of our 
province, which is one of the two founding provinces of Canada. 
I could mention the Royal Proclamation of 1763, which imposed 
laws written in English, and which prescribed for public office 
holders an oath administered under the Test Act, whereby they 
gave up their Catholic faith and pledged loyalty to the British 
Crown.
<P>
	I can also think of the Quebec Act of 1774 and the 
Constitutional Act of 1791. In a newspaper of the time, it was 
said that Lower Canada was much too French to be anglicized by 
English-speaking settlers. Referring to Lower Canada, it said: 
``This colony is much too French. It must be degallicised. Since 
Quebec has fallen, it is time for this province to become 
English.'' We simply do not forget episodes like that.
<P>
	Then came Confederation, which finalized a process which 
had started with the Union Act of 1840. After Confederation, 
French-Canadians thought they had a treaty between two 
peoples, between two distinct societies, between the two 
founding nations, but English-Canadians considered the treaty 
mostly as a piece of legislation giving the English majority the 
right to dominate the minority made up of French-Canadians. 
And why not try to make them suffer, to use a fashionable 
expression these days. With this bill, the government is trying to 
remove our vested right, which is the right for Quebec to elect 25 
per cent of the hon. members in this House.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	As I said earlier, as a matter of good conscience if not of 
respect, this bill should not be used to penalize Quebec once 
more. Have Quebec and Quebecers not suffered enough from 
this domination? As far as I know, Quebecers still account for 
more than 25 per cent of the Canadian population. So, do you not 
think it is normal that at least 25 per cent of the members in this 
House represent Quebec? What is the rest of Canada so afraid of 
that it feels it has to try so hard to remove our most legitimate 
right to fair representation?
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="11605"> 11605 </A></B>
<P>
	As I said, Quebec has the legitimate and historical right to 
preserve a minimal political weight within the Canadian 
federation, even more so since we are not getting our fair share 
of federal transfers to provinces, whether it is for defence, for 
research and development or especially, as everyone knows, for 
job creation. Now Quebec could have its representation in the 
Canadian Parliament reduced.
<P>
	Where was the Prime Minister, where was the hon. member 
for Papineau-Saint-Michel, where was the hon. member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, three outstanding 
Quebec citizens, when on a vote on March 28 the House rejected 
a motion put forward by my colleague from Bellechasse, which 
would have protected, once and for all, Quebec's political 
weight within this federation? They were away from the House 
at a time when they should have been here to vote with us on this 
issue.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleague, usually we refrain from 
referring to the fact that an hon. member is in the House or not. 
The hon. member may wish to rephrase his statement after 
question period.
<P>
	It being 2 p.m., the House will now proceed to statements by 
members.

Measha Gosman on winning the YTV Young Achievers Award 
for 1995 in the vocal category.
<P>
	Measha is a grade 12 student in my riding of

	Competition is fierce for the YTV award since only 15 are

dance to entrepreneurship, and more than 1,000 young 
Canadians are nominated each year.

	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Human Resources Development has 
once again shown a lack of consistency and vision when 
developing government policies that are supposed to protect 
citizens who are treated unfairly.
<P>
	Last February, he tabled amendments to the Employment 
Equity Act. The commission's new responsibilities include 
enforcement of the Employment Equity Act, establishing an 
employment equity review tribunal and, last but not least, 
auditing reports submitted by private sector employers. 
According to the Human Rights Commissioner, the commission 
would need 15 new officers to carry out these new 
responsibilities.

	The minister has probably forgotten that he himself closed the

Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the constituents of 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt to salute the residents of 
Salmo, British Columbia. These fine Canadians have decided to 
take action on the national debt. They have to because the 
Liberals have done nothing to reduce it, in fact they are 
increasing it.
<P>
	The people of Salmo are collecting pennies to send to the debt 
reduction fund. While these good Canadians are scraping the 
bottom of the barrel, desk drawers and every nook and cranny, 
the Grits continue their spending binge.
<P>
	The Canada Council handed out $88 million in grants last 
year. One of the latest handouts is $10,000 for a gay and lesbian 
film festival to be staged in Saskatoon this weekend by the 
Positively Queer group.
<P>
	My heart goes out to the residents of Salmo. What will they do 
when they realize that they will have to collect one million 
pennies to pay for the Liberal government's financial support of 
the Positively Queer film festival? That is almost three tonnes of 
pennies. The Liberals should be ashamed.

people in Canada has increased dramatically and child poverty 
has reached a 14-year high.
<P>
	For many years, successive Canadian governments have 
followed policies designed to reduce the wages of working 
Canadians and fatten incentives for wealthy Canadians. The rich 
get richer and the poor get poorer, and there are more of both of 
them. Middle income Canadians are being driven to extinction.
<P>
	Deregulation, free trade, privatization, contracting out, and 
union busting are driving down the private incomes of working 
Canadians. At the same time, their social benefits are being 
reduced by cuts in health care and education, justified as a 
means to pay off a deficit caused by a high real interest rate 
policy and tax loopholes that favoured the rich in the first place.
<P>
	Children are poor because their parents have no money. Case 
in point. Famous Players Theatres, owned by Viacom 
Blockbuster, wants its projectionists to take a 60 per cent wage 
cut and is using scabs to enforce its will. Government should act

	<B>Mrs. Jane Stewart (Brant, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this past 
Christmas, residents of Brant, led by Sheila Enslev and the 
Dunsdon Legion organized Operation Home Front to send 
support packages to our peacekeepers overseas. This idea was 
inspired by a study trip to Bosnia during which Ms. Enslev saw 
firsthand the valuable contributions made by our peacekeepers.
<P>
	The response from the community was overwhelming and 172 
packages were sent to Canadian troops stationed in Bosnia. One 
soldier wrote back and said: ``You showed me that there are 
people who care and know we exist''.

	As the Easter season approaches, Operation Home Front will 
be extending its services to include our troops in the Golan 
Heights and in Haiti.

	In light of the negative media that has recently accompanied 
our military operations abroad, it is important that Canadians 
everywhere recognize and appreciate the good work our 
peacekeepers have done and continue to do.

keep the centre open on a reduced budget.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	In a report released yesterday, the National Council on 
Welfare reveals that, in 1993, poverty kept on increasing in 
Canada, especially in Quebec where 20.7 per cent of the 
population live below the poverty line.
<P>
	In view of this worsening problem of poverty, how can the 
government explain that it has not implemented any job creating 
measure and that it has reduced its participation in the 
infrastructure program, its only initiative to create jobs since it 
came to office?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is very important for all 
members of the House to recognize the seriousness of the 
situation as underlined by the National Council of Welfare 
report.
<P>
	The continuing incidence of poverty is something which 
requires all of us to make a very serious response. The most 
important is to ensure we can create the right climate, the right 
framework in which jobs can be created. That is still one of the 
most effective ways of alleviating poverty, to get people back to 
work.
<P>
	In this past year we have created over 450,000 jobs. We have 
had the highest job growth rate of any industrial country. The 
figures used by the National Council of Welfare stop at 1993. We 
would certainly hope the very substantial job creation of this 
past year would tend to alleviate that problem. However that 
certainly is no cause for any kind of complacency.
<P>
	We must redouble our efforts to get people back to work, to 
invest more in the kind of programs and initiatives that will give 
people some real opportunity to improve their status. I would 
welcome the co-operation of the hon. member and his party as 
we go about trying to reform our social system to enable that to 
happen.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
numerous occasions, we offered to co-operate with the 
government to create jobs. It brushed aside all our suggestions.
<P>
	How can the government claim that it is working to create 
jobs when it refuses to implement a real defence conversion 
strategy, to come to the rescue of the MIL Davie shipyard, and 
decides to stick to a monetary policy obsessed by inflation 
control instead of job creation?
<P>
	Will the minister dare say that the laissez-faire attitude of this 
government will contribute to job creation?
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member knows 
very well that most of the jobs in the country must be created 
through the activities of the private sector.
<P>
	If we are in a situation in which interest rates rise at an 
unacceptable rate or international capital flows become volatile 
and we are vulnerable to them, we pay the price by not being 
able to create incentives for job creation.
<P>
	That is one of the reasons why in the budget we undertook to 
stabilize the fiscal situation in the country, to make ourselves 
less vulnerable to those international flows of capital, to be able 
to stabilize our interest rates and to provide a very effective 
framework within which the private sector can go about creating 
jobs.
<P>
	At the same time, we also believe to parallel that we must 
invest very seriously in what we call the human deficit, the issue 
of making sure people have more choices about improving their 
skills and being able to get beyond simply benefit programs and 
into active employment programs.
<P>
	That has been the whole indication and thrust of the reformed 
proposals the House of Commons committee considered and the 
recommendations we are now considering for action which we 
intend to bring in this year.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, could it 
be that the minister's passionate plea in favour of job creation by 
the private sector hides the government's inability to help the 
unemployed?
<P>
	Will the minister recognize that the sad picture in Quebec, 
where 21 per cent of the population now live below the poverty 
line, the highest rate in Canada, might I add, is the result of 
federalism and irrefutable proof of the failure of a system totally 
unable to promote economic development in Quebec and 
powerless in the face of deepening poverty in Quebec?

member has taken what I think we all see to be a very serious 
situation and tried to turn it into some kind of attack against 
federalism.
<P>
	The issue of poverty, especially among our young children 
and our families, will require the collaboration and 
co-operation of all levels of government, not one party 
continually insisting on separation, on breaking the country 
apart and fragmenting our efforts at a time when what we need is 
collaboration, co-operation and a coming together.
<P>
	The real issue of attacking poverty is having all Canadians, all 
provinces and all regions working ensemble.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	In the same report, the National Council of Welfare pointed 
out that poverty among young families, mostly among single 
parent families headed by a woman, is on the rise. The report 
says that children are poor because their parents are poor. And 
one of the main causes of this poverty is the shortage of good 
jobs.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Human Resources Development admit 
that, far from reducing poverty, the unemployment insurance 
cuts for which his government is responsible will actually cause 
it to increase because they force tens of thousands of 
unemployed on to the welfare rolls each month?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the changes to the 
unemployment insurance bill introduced last year in Bill C-17 
we introduced a special measure that provided a two tier benefit 
support so that we would provide a higher level of benefits for 
individuals of very low income who have dependent children so 
they would be able to receive 60 per cent of a replaceable 
income compared with 55 per cent, the national standard.
<P>
<B>(1425 ) </B>
<P>
	Since that time close to 200,000 Canadian families have been 
able to take benefit from that second tier of benefits, which 
means they have been able to add close to $1,000 of income to 
their family resources during the year.
<P>
	That indicates we took into account, in making changes to the 
unemployment insurance program, that there is a special need, 
especially for those families which have children. I can assure 
the hon. member that as we begin to look at a broader reform of 
unemployment insurance the same principle of targeting our 
help to  those most in need will continue to be our basic 
philosophy.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister's own budgetary plan says that, as a result of legislative 
amendments contained in Bill C-17 which reduced the 
maximum number of weeks of entitlement, there has been a 16.2 
per cent decrease in the number of recipients.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Human Resources Development 
acknowledge that this situation will only continue to deteriorate 
in the next three years because of the cuts in transfer payments 
and the implementation of the Canada social transfer, which is 
nothing less than a veiled attempt to cut federal funding for 
social programs even more?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on the contrary, I think that 
the new framework for transfers being hammered out between 
the federal and provincial governments will be an opportunity 
for the governments to develop a co-operative and effective 
approach to combatting family and child poverty. I think that it 
is an effort to develop a national strategy, a co-operative 
strategy which both levels of government will use to solve the 
problem, and I hope that the hon. member and her colleagues 
will join us in this national effort to fight poverty in Canada.

	The questions referred to the panel were of great importance 
both to the information highway initiative and to the satellite 
broadcasting system. We announced the review would be 
completed in an open way and it was done so. The panellists 
were named and received written submissions from all 
Canadians interested in the matter. Those submissions were 
made public. The public was then given an opportunity to 
provide written responses to submissions. Those responses were 
made public.
<P>
	This afternoon the panel will make its recommendation 
public. I suggest to the hon. member she might wish to read it 
and perhaps then she will have some suggestions of her own.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my supplementary question is for the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage.
<P>
	The politics of this review has tainted its outcome. The review 
was ordered because the original decision went against Power 
Corp., a company headed by the Prime Minister's son-in-law. 
The review panel included Robert Rabinovitch, who has 
personal ties to Power Corp. and the Claridge Group, and Roger 
Tassé, a partner in Eddie Goldenberg's former law firm. If that 
was not bad enough, the government tried to slip the decision by 
the House to avoid public discussion.
<P>
	Why was the DTH review not conducted as part of the 
industry department's information highway hearing or the 
CRTC convergence hearings?
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, once again we have an example of a shamelessly 
irresponsible member of Parliament making unsubstantiated 
allegations.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I appeal to members to be very judicious in 
your comments when referring to members of Parliament. I ask 
you to keep this in mind in your questions and in your answers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manley:</B> Mr. Speaker, there is a reason this process was 
followed. Very simply, as the hon. member knows, the satellite 
broadcasting system, the direct to home system, is one we are 
concerned about with regard to the very rapid growth of what is 
called the grey market.
<P>
	It was important the government establish its policy in a very 
clear way as quickly as possible and yet attempt to make it as 
open as possible. We decided we would appoint a panel. It would 
hold the process as I described it in the previous question.
<P>
	I want to make it clear to the hon. member that the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage and I received the report only this morning 
directly from the chairman of the panel. We will be reviewing it 
very carefully. I suggest to her perhaps she might like to. We 
have not taken a decision as to whether the recommendations 
will be followed.
<P>
	I would like to hear whether the Reform Party has a position 
on this important issue. I would be happy to take it into account 
before recommendations are made to cabinet.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I appeal to members to make both the questions 
and answers more concise.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is again for the Minister of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	The Reform Party has always favoured a review of Canada's 
direct to home satellite policy. We do favour competition but it 
should be done in a very public forum.
<P>
	Instead, the government's review was a backroom, closed 
door deal to favour a bunch of Liberal bagmen. It is yet another 
example of the government's lack of cultural policy.
<P>
	One day it is restricting competition in favour of Canadian 
industries, the next it is swinging the door-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The question please.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Does the government 
have a cultural policy or will decisions continue to be made in an 
ad hoc way to the benefit of Liberal insiders?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I do not know what part of the universe the hon. 
member comes from. I do not know whether she knows anything 
about satellites at all. She is clearly accustomed to flying in 
spacecrafts, though.
<P>
	In endeavouring to deal with this policy in as rapid a way as 
possible we have conducted a process using people whose 
reputation is really beyond being impugned, certainly by the 
member.
<P>
	We have appointed a panel of three former deputy ministers, 
all of whom served under other governments. These people's 
reputations have not been questioned by anyone else, certainly 
not by this member outside the House where she might be 
subject to legal action. She comes in here and tries to smear 
three people who are offering their services to the government.
<P>
	Perhaps if the member would read the report she would find 
her allegations false.

	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my

<B><A NAME="11612"> 11612 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1435) </B>
<P>
	Under the terms of the contract, this firm had to advise the 
minister on the gun control strategy he should adopt in dealing 
with his caucus.
<P>
	How can the minister justify spending $22,500 in public funds 
to develop a communication strategy aimed at convincing his 
Liberal colleagues to meet their electoral commitment?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the contract referred to 
was entered into in the ordinary course of business in order to 
provide advice of practical assistance in discharging every day 
responsibilities. It is perfectly proper. It is money well spent.
<P>
	I offer the events of yesterday as the most cogent proof of that 
investment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
supplementary question is for the Acting Prime Minister.
<P>
	Can the Acting Prime Minister tell us if the practice of using 
public funds to develop a communication strategy for the 
Liberal caucus is widespread among his cabinet colleagues, and 
if it is consistent with government ethics?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has 
some facts, only some. The balance of her question is a 
combination of either invention or wishful thinking.
<P>
	The funds were spent for the legitimate purpose of seeking the 
advice of others as to how best to serve the public interest. This 
was not advice on how to deal with caucus. This was advice on 
how to deal with issues that confront the Minister of Justice in 
relation to performing public responsibilities in the public 
interest. That is exactly why the money was spent.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
morning the justice minister said Liberal MPs who express their 
opinion and opposition to gun control legislation would not be 
punished. That was cool comfort. Already these MPs have been 
turfed from their committees.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> As I explained earlier, we have a tradition in 
the House of not referring to any votes taken in the House or how 
members have voted. I ask hon. members to please be cognizant 
of this in framing their questions and also in giving their 
answers.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Could the government House leader explain to 
the House and to the Canadian public what has happened to the 
red book promise of allowing more free votes in the House of 
Commons?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, free votes are those designated as such by the 
government. We did not designate the vote on second reading of 
the gun control bill a free vote.
<P>
	However, we are keeping our promise each day the House sits 
because we treat all private members' business as free votes. 
This is certainly a lot more than was done by the previous 
government. At the same time, in the way the House voted on the 
gun control legislation we are responding freely to the 
consensus of the Canadian people.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, MPs 
must be allowed to represent their constituents without threats 
from the party whip. MPs should be praised for that, not 
punished.
<P>
	Could the justice minister or the government House leader 
explain to the House why some Liberal members have been 
immediately turfed from their committee duties?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is not a matter involving the government as such 
but the internal workings of our caucus.
<P>
<B>(1440 ) </B>
<P>
	We would be happy when the time comes to go to the 
Canadian people as a party, as a caucus and ask for their support 
on the basis of the good work we have been doing for the 
Canadian people. This is exemplified by our support of the 
Minister of Justice's very positive, necessary and constructive 
gun control legislation.

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage.
<P>
	Last November, the federal government, unhappy with a 
CRTC ruling on direct satellite broadcasting, formed a 
committee made up of friends of the government so that it could 
bypass the CRTC ruling in order to benefit other friends of the 
government, including Power Broadcasting.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Canadian Heritage give credence to 
the report by a panel of so-called experts, when they only met 
with the Power Broadcasting project representatives and refused 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11613"> 11613 </A></B>
<P>
to meet with their competitors under the pretext that they did not 
have enough time?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, these allegations are false. I suggest to the hon. 
member that she could perhaps take the time to read the report; 
she may even agree with the recommendations made by this 
panel of experts.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in response to my colleague earlier, the Minister of 
Industry said that the government had set up its own committee 
in order to get the opinion of experts.
<P>
	Are we to understand that the minister formed his own 
committee because he felt that the CRTC was not able to make 
what he sees as an appropriate recommendation and that his own 
committee would make a recommendation that would suit him?
<P>
[English] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, no. In fact, the government has not indicated it wants a 
particular decision at all. The government has the responsibility 
to establish policy in an important area which affects not just the 
delivery of program services but indeed has quite a broad effect 
on the information highway initiative in general.
<P>
	The responsibility for making policy is that of the 
government. That is why governments are elected. We will 
consider the views of the panel of experts which will be 
reporting today and we will indicate what policy we believe 
should be followed.
<P>
	The issue of who wins and who loses in these things 
frequently is a result of decisions of a regulatory panel, a 
tribunal, as in this case the CRTC. Nobody has suggested those 
decisions should be made elsewhere.

	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr.

petulance and obfuscation which has forced him this morning-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would ask the hon. member to be very 
judicious in the words he is going to use from here on in.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Mr. Speaker, this morning the minister of 
Indian affairs clarified his conflicting answers on the series of 
events on the Stoney Reserve. It is now evident the minister did 
not seriously investigate this ongoing situation until after 
yesterday's question period.
<P>
	I have now heard reports that there are five other locations in 
Alberta where logging may be exceeding DIAND permits: 
Gerard, Sturgeon, Hart Lake, Boyer and Eden Valley. What is 
the minister doing about this?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday was enlightening 
if for no other reason than the member for Kootenay East told 
the Vancouver <I>Sun</I> that all the companies were from his riding 
and would not name them.
<P>
	In case the hon. member wants to know where the member for 
Kootenay East is, he is about three down and sits in the Reform 
Party. If he wants to be helpful, he obviously knows the names of 
the companies and he could quietly provide the RCMP with the 
information so that charges can be laid.
<P>
<B>(1445) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it would be refreshing to have the minister stop 
attacking the Reform Party every time he is asked a question. He 
could start being a professional manager.
<P>
	The minister has given conflicting reports as to when he knew 
about the overcutting at Stoney Reserve. Did he know when the 
department knew one year ago? If not, why not? If he did, why 
did he not do something?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would categorize this as 
more of a confession than an attack. I am glad the hon. member 
has raised that question because I think it is time to get positive.
<P>
	What are we going to do about it? I think we could use the help 
of the Reform because the National Aboriginal Forestry 
Association has proposals for legislation. It represents 120 First 
Nations who are involved in forestry, 50 forestry companies, 
educational institutes and the Meadow Lake Integrated 
Management Program which does training. They have five goals 
all of which presumably the Reform will endorse.
<P>
	If they work through a consultation process, which I think 
they will, and if we have legislation-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Useless.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Irwin:</B> Just relax. I know I get you every time.

question is for the Secretary of State for the Status of Women.
<P>
	This morning, women representing literally hundreds of 
Quebec and Canadian organizations came to Ottawa to protest 
against cuts in the Equal Opportunities for Women Program. 
They denounced the gradual erosion of federal grants to 
<P>
<HR>

<P>
women's groups, which have shrunk by over $4 million over the 
past six years and are getting smaller every year.
<P>
	How can the Secretary of State for the Status of Women 
justify these new cuts to organizations working with 
disadvantaged women when pride and dignity is all her Prime 
Minister ever talked about during the last election campaign?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Secretary of State 
(Multiculturalism) (Status of Women), Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I 
am proud and confident of our government's unequivocal 
commitment to equality for women, period.
<P>
	I must remind my hon. colleague that we have restored the 
Court Challenges Program, are setting up health centers of 
excellence for women and are working on sentencing reform, 
firearms control, employment equity and small business issues, 
all with women in mind. I think this clearly shows our concern 
for equality for women.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> I have a 
supplementary, Mr. Speaker. The Secretary of State for the 
Status of Women is said to have informed women's groups 
before the budget was tabled that the criteria for grants would be 
reviewed by next fall.
<P>
	Does the hon. secretary of state intend to hold consultations 
with these groups in developing these new criteria? If so, how 
much weight will she give to the results of these consultations in 
making her final decision?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Secretary of State 
(Multiculturalism) (Status of Women), Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I 
greatly appreciate the Bloc's concern for the status of Canadian 
women. I think this suggests it recognizes that equity and unity 
are going strong in Canada.
<P>
	In this regard, she must recognize that our February budget 
did not contain any cuts in grants or contributions to women's 
groups. And I told women just that: ``No cuts in grants or 
contributions''. I told women and I repeat that the opinion of 
women from all regions of Canada will be taken into 
consideration when budget adjustments are made. I hope that the 
Bloc Quebecois is interested in the well-being of all women in 
Canada.

	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the west 
island of Montreal, indeed the whole region, was shocked to 
learn of the brutal murder of Reverend Frank Toope and his wife, 
Jocelyn. Three youths have been charged with the first degree 
murder of the retired couple. The victims were battered to death 
with a baseball bat.
<P>
	Can the Minister of Justice assure this House that with the 
amendments to the Young Offenders Act currently before the 
Senate, young violent offenders will no longer be able to hide 
behind the law? Will justice be served for the victims, their 
families, the offenders and most of all for society?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the tragic deaths of 
Reverend and Mrs. Toope have shocked and saddened the 
community of Beaconsfield. All Canadians have been touched 
by the senselessness of this brutal crime. As the hon. member 
has said, people have been charged and the case is now before 
the courts. I will be careful not to comment on the facts of that 
case. Let me speak more broadly to the issues the member has 
raised.
<P>
	The government cannot say that merely changing words in a 
statute, in a book, is going to prevent tragedies like this from 
happening. We know that is not so. A number of things are 
required to prevent crime and to get at its causes.
<P>
	To the extent to which changes in the criminal law and the 
Young Offenders Act can deter and properly punish such 
misconduct, this government has acted. Bill C-37, which is 
through the House, is now before the Senate and I hope it will 
receive its prompt attention. As the House knows, that bill 
increases penalties for murder. It provides for the transfer to 
adult court of certain youths charged with serious violent 
crimes. It provides for the sharing of information.
<P>
	I have also asked for the justice committee to tour the country, 
to listen to Canadians, to examine our juvenile justice system 
and determine whether other changes are needed. This 
government will be responsive to those recommendations. We 
are committed to a system that is fair and tough. We will act on 
that conviction.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is in regard to the aforementioned horror which took 
place in Montreal. Two citizens were brutally, coldly and with 
extreme calculation bludgeoned to death by three young 
offenders. These murders were coldly planned homicides 
without remorse.
<P>
	Will the justice minister assure the people of Canada by 
insisting that the 14 and 15-year old psychopath young 
offenders be tried in adult court?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I fully understand how 
Canadians, including members of the House, react to the horror 
and tragedy of events such as these.
<P>
	I do urge the hon. member to bear in mind that the judicial 
process must run its course. There are people charged who are 
presumed innocent. There will be a trial. The crown will proffer 
evidence and a court will decide who is responsible. We must 
not prejudice that process.
<P>
	Let me say in response to the point raised by the hon. member 
that any decision on whether or not to seek a transfer to adult 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11615"> 11615 </A></B>
<P>
court is for the prosecuting lawyer to  make. That person takes 
direction from the Attorney General of the province of Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have received nearly 50,000 letters and I know the minister has 
received the same amount regarding the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	We have continually heard from this minister that crime 
prevention, assistance for troubled youth at risk will stop these 
horrible crimes. It is too late for these two elderly people.
<P>
	We have been told by provincial agencies that this 
government talks about assistance for youth at risk but does 
nothing. I ask the minister: When will he become a minister of 
action instead of an acting minister?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
</B><B>General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the record will show 
that I have never claimed we are going to be able to stop all 
crime. That is not going to happen.
<P>
	What I have said is that while there is a role for toughening up 
the laws and providing better responses and enforcement, that is 
not all that is required. A great deal of other things are required 
as well and we have to focus on all of them.
<P>
<B>(1455) </B>
<P>
	I respond to the hon. member by saying that we have taken 
action by passing Bill C-37. We have taken action by asking the 
committee to recommend further changes. We have created the 
National Crime Prevention Council. My colleagues in cabinet 
are working in a variety of ways to address the underlying social 
causes of crime in this country.

question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs. The UN special 
envoy to Burundi accused the international community of 
pushing that country toward a genocide. Yesterday, in 
Bujumbura, that official denounced the international 
community's inconsistency and irresponsibility regarding the 
crisis in Burundi, where two million people may have to leave 
their homes, thus creating the world's largest concentration of 
refugees, according to the British Red Cross.
<P>
	Will the minister once again remain insensitive to the 
increasing number of calls for help in Burundi?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, let me simply remind the hon. member what 
Canada has done in recent weeks and months to avoid a crisis 
which could reach proportions similar to the one which occurred 
in Rwanda.
<P>
	First, the Secretary of State responsible for Latin America and 
Africa personally travelled to Bujumbura to participate in a 
meeting to find solutions to the refugee problem.
<P>
	Second, Canada tabled a resolution which was supported by 
all the ministers attending a conference of the Francophonie, 
which was held in France, and where it was decided to send a 
ministerial delegation to Burundi to try to work out a solution 
with local authorities.
<P>
	Third, the Canadian government is subsidizing NGO's, 
particularly the International Red Cross, in their efforts to help 
the civilian populations affected by the conflict.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister already told us about his information, his concerns, his 
representations and his hopes. However, my question is: How 
can Canada remain unconcerned by the plea for help made 
yesterday by the UN special envoy in Burundi? What is Canada 
waiting for to act, to show some leadership and to help a fellow 
member of the Francophonie? After all, Canada has displayed 
such leadership in the past.
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for recognizing that the 
government is already involved. It is not fair to say that we are 
unconcerned. On the contrary, the initiatives which I just 
mentioned reflect our will to find a solution.
<P>
	The hon. member would like Canada to be a leader regarding 
that issue. We are prepared to take on the role which the parties 
involved would like us to assume. Canada cannot impose itself. 
However, we have clearly shown that we are willing and

Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, seven weeks ago the 14-year old daughter of 
two constituents of mine moved in with a 26-year old convicted 
sex offender. Neither the parents nor the police can do anything 
about this because the law states that the age of consent is 14 
years.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Justice see this as a case of child

continue?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Department of 
Justice has under review the whole question of the age of 
consent to sexual activity precisely because of our concern for 
the young people who might otherwise be victimized.
<P>
	I do however emphasize that the criminal law is not entirely 
silent in this respect. For example, as provided in section 273.1 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11616"> 11616 </A></B>
<P>
of the code, there is no consent if the participation of someone 
of that age is induced by breach of trust or authority, threat or 
fear.

provisions in the code which would deal with this situation.

attention another instance where for two years 46-year-old 
Henry Halm has been in Canada to avoid facing a prison 
sentence in New York for sexually abusing four young males, 
aged 15 and 16.

exploitation? Is he prepared to change the law for the age of 
consent to see that this is stopped?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the issue in the case 
referred to by the hon. member is just the opposite. It was 
alleged in that case that the prohibition of homosexual activity 
by those who are under 18 years of age is unconstitutional 
because it is inconsistent with the rule otherwise for 
heterosexual activity. I believe that case is still before the courts 
and I will be careful not to comment further.
<P>
	I am meeting this afternoon with a group called Citizens 
Against Child Exploitation led by a courageous and energetic 
woman, Monica Rainey from British Columbia. I am looking 
forward to that meeting. I have met with her in the past and I 
always learn from my encounters with her. This very subject is 
on the agenda. I will express my interest to Ms. Rainey and I will 
discuss it with her.
<P>
	I can assure the hon. member that it is something that we will 
consider very carefully.

	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Saskatoon-Dundurn, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last fall a group of western MPs consulted with western 
Canadians on regional development. Important matters were 
recommended to the minister in charge of western 
diversification, including export promotion and helping high 
growth sectors.

Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the 
hon. member, and especially members of his committee, who 
made some very important recommendations.
<P>
	I am pleased to report to the House that as a result of those 
representations and the guidelines set out in the budget that as of 
April 1 the Department of Western Economic Diversification 
has changed its fundamental approach to funding. We are now 
out of the direct lending or contribution business to individual 
enterprises. Instead we are now working with financial 
institutions to set up a network of investment capital pools 
across western Canada.
<P>
	I can report that the Royal Bank, as it indicated last week 
before committee, is now prepared to join with us in setting up a 
very large investment capital system for the agriculture 
biotechnology industry. We have several other investment pools 
ready to be initiated that will provide a whole new system of 
investment capital for western Canada which will be the spur for 
real growth and real jobs.

	Nowhere in my member's statement did I specifically refer to 
a vote in the House nor was I about to.
<P>
	By cutting me off halfway through my statement, I ask, with 
respect, for you to please tell me how my privileges as a member 
of this House have not been breached.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. There are times in the House, when we 
are making statements and asking and answering questions, in 
the heat of the debate, sometimes words are used that I interpret 
as indications of where a member is going.
<P>
<B>(1505 ) </B>
<P>
	In the particular case today, as members know, the Speaker 
does not explain his decision. I would be happy to speak to the 
hon. member for Crowfoot.
<P>
	With all respect the hon. member, I would say this. It seemed 
to me at the time that the member was going in this direction and 
I thought I heard inference to the vote.

	I am perfectly willing to review the blues. If, indeed, I made a

indeed, I was in error then I will come back to the House.
<P>
	Will the hon. member at least give me the time to review the

the hon. member in my chambers if he wishes to pursue this.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
the same point of order. I would ask that when you review the 
blues and this question, that you give us a little more guidance 
on the interpretation of this rule. It seems to me there have been 
numerous references during question period to votes that have 
taken place in the House.
<P>
	For instance, the minister of immigration regularly refers to 
the vote on Bill C-44. Perhaps you could clarify your 
interpretation of that rule.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
incredible as it may sound, I rise to ask the traditional question 
for a Thursday, even though today is the last time we meet for 
two weeks. I still wish to ask the hon. Leader of the Government 
in the House to tell us what is on the agenda for that period of 
time.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member wants to know what we are going to 
do during the next two weeks. I do not think that comes under the 
purview of the House.
<P>
	However, I will make a statement about what will happen 
when the House returns on April 24. As I have said, I will leave 
what is to be done by hon. members in the intervening period to 
them and their own good judgment, if not their good taste.
<P>
	When the House returns on April 24, we will be entering the 
most intensive part of the parliamentary calendar. I believe, 
therefore, it would be useful if I outlined briefly, not only the 
business for the next few days we are back but also priorities for 
the period between our resumption of sittings and the break in 
the month of May.
<P>
	The business of supply requires many opposition days in this 
period, one or two a week. I should like to designate Thursday, 
April 27 as one of those opposition days.
<P>
	Our first priorities when we come back from the Easter break 
will be to complete the third reading of Bill C-69 regarding 
electoral boundaries, and second reading of Bill C-76 
implementing the budget, if these bills have not been completed, 
of course, before we adjourn today.
<P>
	We will then return to report stage of Bill C-43, respecting 
lobbyists and to a motion to set up a special joint committee to 
develop a code of conduct for members of both Houses of 
Parliament.
<P>
	Our next priority will be second readings of other important 
and pressing bills, namely Bill C-75 regarding farm loans; Bill 
C-70 regarding income tax; the bill respecting the Mint which 
was introduced this morning, and a very limited number of 
measures to be introduced later this month on which there are 
some time constraints.
<P>
	We will also give priority to the bills that have already been 
considered by parliamentary committees and which have been 
reported back to the House and which, therefore, are now in their 
final stages of debate in the Chamber. These are Bill C-54 
regarding old age security; Bill C-67 respecting veterans 
pensions and Bill C-65 concerning government organization.
<P>
<B>(1510 ) </B>
<P>
	There is also Bill C-41 regarding sentencing; Bill C-45 
respecting conditional release; Bill C-58 regarding the Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police; and Bill C-52 respecting the 
Department of Public Works and Government Services.
<P>
	We will then consider other items reported from committee 
and any other items on which there is a consensus to move along.
<P>
	By way of conclusion, I want to say I am providing this 
information now so the House leaders of the other parties are 
able to assess their positions in order to enable them to join with 
me, when the House resumes, in planning a reasonable schedule 
for the House in late April and early May which will in turn 
make it possible for us to do similar planning for what will be a 
very crowded agenda in June.
<P>
	Having said all that, I wish all members of the House and their 
families a happy Easter and a happy Passover.

	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, on March 31, the member for 
Crowfoot raised a point of order concerning answers given by 
the Minister of Justice in response to questions posed during 
question periods on March 27 and March 29. I would like to 
thank the hon. member for Crowfoot, the hon. Minister of 
Justice, the chief government whip and the hon. member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster for their contributions to the 
discussion.
<P>
	The hon. member for Crowfoot contended the Minister of 
Justice had contravened the sub judice convention by 
commenting on a case under appeal in the Alberta courts, and in 
so doing could have compromised the outcome of the case. 
Making reference to several citations from Beauchesne's sixth 
edition and to the case of Regina v. the Atlantic Sugar Refineries 
Co. to support his arguments, the hon. member requested that 
the Chair review the matter and determine whether or not the 
minister had contravened the sub judice convention.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. Minister of Justice responded that nothing he had 
said in relation to the case offended the convention, and 
maintained that there was a difference between commenting on 
the facts of a case while the case was before a court, and stating 
the government's opinion about the ruling which had been 
rendered by a court.
<P>
	Under the <I>sub judice</I> convention, it is accepted practice that, 
in the interests of justice and fair play, certain restrictions be 
placed on the freedom of members of Parliament to make 
reference in the course of debate to matters awaiting judicial 
decisions. Similarly, it is understood that such matters should 
not be the subject of motions or questions in the House.
<P>
	As I commented last Friday, we use the word ``convention'' 
when referring to matters which are <I>sub judice</I> (that is, under the 
consideration of a judge or court), as no ``rule'' exists to prevent 
Parliament from discussing such matters.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In Canada, the First Report to the House of the Special 
Committee on Rights and Immunities of Members, presented on 
April 29, 1977, remains the definitive study of the sub judice 
convention. This special committee was chaired by Mr. Speaker 
James Jerome. In its report, the committee gave a lengthy 
explanation of the purpose of the convention. With the 
indulgence of the House I would like to quote from the 
committee's report, issue No. 1, at page 1:4:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The freedom of speech accorded to Members of Parliament is a 
fundamental right without which they would be hampered in the performance 
of their duties. It permits them to speak in the House without inhibition, to 
refer to any matter or express any opinion as they see fit, and to say what they 
feel needs to be said in the furtherance of the national interest and the 
aspirations of their constituents. This basic parliamentary freedom is to some  
extent limited by the sub judice convention. Under the convention as it has 
developed over the years Members are expected to refrain from discussing 
matters that are before the courts. No distinction has ever been made in 
Canada between criminal courts and civil courts for the purpose of applying 
the convention. It has also had application to certain tribunals other than 
courts of law. The purpose of the convention is to protect the parties in a case 
awaiting or undergoing trial and persons who stand to be affected by the 
outcome of a judicial inquiry. It exists to guarantee everyone a fair trial and to 
prevent any undue influence prejudicing a judicial decision or a report of a 
tribunal of inquiry.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The <I>sub judice</I> convention itself is poorly defined and its 
interpretaton is usually left to the Speaker. The difficulty that I 
face as Speaker is that any attempt to determine when a 
comment might have a tendency to influence something can be 
at best speculative rather than preventative, that is, I cannot 
make such a determination until after the comments have been 
made. Hence, it has been the approach of most Chair occupants 
to discourage all comments on <I>sub judice</I> matters, rather than 
allow members to experiment within the limits of the 
convention and test the Speaker's discretion.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As stated in the special committee's report, Issue No. 1, at 
page 1:12:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Your Committee is of the opinion that precise regulations concerning the 
application of the sub judice convention cannot be evolved and that it would 
be unwise to attempt to do so. Your committee recommends that the Speaker 
should remain the final arbiter in the matter, that he should retain the 
authority to prevent discussion of matters in the House on the ground of sub 
judice, but that he should only exercise his discretion in exceptional cases 
where it is clear to him that to do otherwise could be harmful to specific 
individuals. In exercising this discretion your committee recommends that 
when there is a doubt in the mind of the Chair, a presumption should exist in 
favour of allowing debate and against the application of the convention.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	As to the matter raised by the hon. member for Crowfoot, I 
have reviewed the question period exchanges. I have reviewed 
them many times and the points raised by hon. members during 
the discussion on the point of order. I cannot conclude the 
Minister of Justice contravened the sub judice convention by 
stating the federal government disagreed with the decision of a 
court and planned to challenge the decision.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Let me make one additional comment. While the ultimate 
authority to judge on these matters rests with the Chair, I must 
emphasize that All members of the House must share the 
responsibility in exercising restraint when it seems called for. 
Again, I quote from the special committee's report, issue No. 1, 
at page 1:12: ``It is the view of your committee that the 
responsibility of the Chair during the question period should be 
minimal as regards the <I>sub judice</I> convention, and that the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="11619"> 11619 </A></B>
<P>
responsibility should principally rest upon the member who asks 
the question and the minister to whom it is addressed.''
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In conclusion, I urge all members and ministers to be prudent 
and exercise caution in their choice of words when dealing with 
matters that could fall into the difficult area of sub judice.
<P>
	I want to thank all hon. members for their contributions.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<b>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> When we interrupted 
debate to go on to question period, the hon. member for 
Chicoutimi had about ten minutes left.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
just telling this House that we should at least confirm that 
Quebec must be represented by 25 per cent of the members of 
the House. I was also wondering why the rest of Canada was so 
afraid, why some people are trying to deprive us of the perfectly 
legitimate right to equitable representation. Furthermore, on 
April 4, the leader of the opposition in the National Assembly of 
Quebec, the kid brother of the federal Liberals, presented 
exactly the same motion as my colleague from Bellechasse.
<P>
	I repeat that Quebec has a legitimate and, above all, an 
historic right to a minimum of political power in the Canadian 
federation. As things stand right now, we do not get our fair 
share of federal transfer payments and defence spending and we 
have showed this on a number of occasions in this House. Just 
this morning, one of my colleagues pointed out that we do not 
get our fair share in R&amp;D, nor do we get it in job creation, and 
that is hardly all.
<P>
	Besides this reduction in its representation, Quebec will be 
facing other similar inequities in the next few months. I was 
wondering: What does the Prime Minister think of that? What do 
the hon. members for Gatineau and 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine think of that?
<P>
	In the last vote on this issue, on March 28, I did not sense 
much support on the other side of the House. I can hardly 
understand what is going on. Is it not true that, in the political 
history of Canada and Quebec, the legislator has often expressed 
the will to assure regions, especially remote and rural regions, 
of a fair representation in the House of Commons? As long as the 
current formula for seat distribution between the territories and 
the provinces set out in the Constitution Act, 1867, as amended 
in 1915 and in 1976, is not changed and that this Electoral 
Boundaries Readjustment Act remains relatively unchanged, is 
it not obvious that the same principles of representation for 
remote and rural regions should apply, especially to Quebec?
<P>
	All members know that until Quebecers make a decision in 
favour of Quebec's sovereignty, it is very important that this 
province maintain a minimum representation of 25 per cent in 
all federal institutions.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	As surprising as it may seem and in spite of all the 
constitutional mechanisms aimed at protecting provinces that 
are experiencing a relative population decline, one province has 
always had fewer seats than its share of the population ever 
since Canada was born 128 years ago. And, of course, some 
people will say that the fact that it happens to be Quebec is just a 
coincidence.
<P>
	Even the most densely populated province, Ontario, was 
given several extra members at the beginning of the century and 
eight extra members after the 1941 census because it was 
considered to be experiencing a relative population decline due 
to the rapid growth in the western provinces. I will say 
however-and this should not come as a surprise to 
anyone-that Quebec which, at that time, accounted for 33 per 
cent of Canada's total population did not hold 33 per cent of the 
seats in this House. And, today, we have trouble holding on to 25 
per cent. From 1867 to 1995, we never had extra seats, even 
when we could have demanded it. Is this double standard really 
acceptable? I submit that it is not and that it should not be.
<P>
	I strongly believe that the constitution and the elections acts 
must reflect the Canadian duality and thus guarantee that 
Quebec retain a quarter of the members in the House of 
Commons until the people of Quebec decide otherwise. Beyond 
party or partisan considerations, this proposal, once again, is 
true to the traditional demands of Quebec. I remind you that this 
proposal got the support of the Liberal Party of Canada in the 
last round of constitutional negotiations. The hon. member for 
Papineau-Saint-Michel surely recalls it unless he has a very 
short memory.
<P>
	It would be a lot wiser for the government to wait a few 
months before putting this legislation forward or, better still, put 
it off indefinitely. Let the government deal with this country's 
real problems. Does it not know that Bill C-69 is going to cost 
taxpayers an awful lot with its commissions that will have to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11621"> 11621 </A></B>
<P>
travel across Canada?  Would that money not be put to a better 
use or spent more wisely if it were to go for job creation, for 
example, or for a family policy?
<P>
	As for the Reform Party, it would like to see a decrease in the 
number of seats in the House of Commons. The day after the 
referendum, their wish will be fulfilled. The Liberal government 
claims that this country needs a readjustment of electoral 
boundaries. The day after the referendum, their wish will be 
fulfilled too. In a few months from now, both the Reformers and 
the Liberals will get satisfaction. After the referendum that we 
are going to win, do not forget.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	As a result, there will be fewer members sitting in this House 
and Canada will really need a readjustment of electoral 
boundaries, since Quebec will be sovereign and will no longer 
be part of a country that, historically-and I dealt with the 
historical background before question period-has not wanted 
it. I stated the relevant facts earlier.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened very closely to the comments made by the 
hon. member and his proposition for 25 per cent of the members 
of this great House.
<P>
	I wonder if he is seriously looking at the possibility of 
forgetting the proposal for separation and instead having a 
future as part of this great country of Canada. There is no 
question in my mind that Quebec complements and plays a very 
important role in the make-up of this whole country.
<P>
	Is the member now suggesting that the referendum should be 
put on the back burner and that in the future Quebec should 
continue to be part of this nation and this House of Commons? Is 
that why he is putting forward this proposal of 25 per cent? If 
that is the case, I think it is wonderful the hon. member is 
prepared to come forward with that. It suggests to me that he and 
other Bloc members are changing their minds and now realize 
what a privilege it is to be part of this great country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fillion:</B> Mr. Speaker, historical facts from a more recent 
past will give us the answer to that question.
<P>
	In 1965, the War Measures Act was proclaimed in Quebec. In 
the middle of the night, the government of Canada invoked the 
act. The army, used certain pretexts, supposedly to stop a 
separatist movement. Five hundred people were arrested 
without warrant. That is the first fact. The second one is even 
more recent. It happened in 1981, when the premiers of Canada, 
once again in the middle of the night, in Quebec's absence, went 
against what they had signed and accepted the unilateral 
patriation of the Constitution.
<P>
	I could also remind the hon. members of the very recent 
Meech Lake accord in 1987. Everybody knows that one member 
of this House prevented his legislature from discussing the 
Meech Lake accord, with the result that everything that had been 
provided for in that accord was rejected. That member now sits 
on the government benches.
<P>
	We could also recall the Charlottetown round of discussions 
and the way it all ended. It is too bad, but Quebecers will not 
forget these facts. Bloc Quebecois members will not abandon 
their option, which is to pave the way to Quebec's sovereignty. 
Through our efforts here, we will reach that goal.
<P>
	The only thing we are asking for now, because we are still in 
this federation, is the preservation of our rights. It is that simple. 
When Quebecers make a decision on Quebec sovereignty, you 
will do as you please. When that moment comes, both founding 
nations will gain something, in my opinion.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as I was listening to my colleague's speech, I 
remembered the mandate we received from the electorate, 
which is to defend the interests of Quebecers and at the same 
time to promote sovereignty.
<P>
	Would he not agree that we have before us a very clear 
opportunity to fulfil both objectives? By rejecting the 
amendment which aims to maintain at 25 per cent the 
representation of Quebec in the House of Commons, the 
government shows that the Constitution cannot possibly be 
renewed. The government has not even given us this basic right.
<P>
	By negating our status as a people, as one of the founding 
nations of this country, is it not the federal government, and 
particularly the Liberal members who voted against this 
amendment or simply abstained from voting, who will be 
blamed for not protecting the interests of Quebec? Will they not 
bear the brunt of this decision by the present government, a 
decision which is in keeping with the thinking of previous 
governments as well as with the logic of the unilateral patriation 
of the Constitution in 1982? Is the member not more 
comfortable with his position than Liberal members in general 
can be?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fillion:</B> Mr. Speaker, the comment made by my colleague 
allows me to demonstrate that despite the past hundred years, 
the people of Quebec have matured and are not about to gamble 
with their future. They will make a decision based on events 
they have witnessed throughout history.
<P>
	The people of Quebec have reached a point where they will 
have to make a decision. Of course, that decision will be to hand 
the government of Quebec all political and economic powers to 
allow Quebec to govern itself without having to constantly wait 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11622"> 11622 </A></B>
<P>
for actions from this Parliament that never materialize, for 
instance  responsibility transfers that do not come with the 
required funds.
<P>
	There is no doubt that we are now at a crossroad. The decision 
will be made. I am convinced that with the debate to be held in 
the coming months, a majority of Quebecers will say no to these 
fruitless battles we have been involved in for too long.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill C-69, an act to 
provide for the establishment of electoral boundaries 
commissions and the readjustment of electoral boundaries, at 
third and final reading today.
<P>
	I am pleased to have this opportunity because, although I am 
opposed to the way the Liberal government has handled the 
issue, the debate which has taken place around the issue of 
electoral boundary readjustment has produced some very good 
suggestions for change. This debate today gives me a chance to 
comment in more detail than I did earlier this year when I spoke 
on the concurrence motion that was presented before the House.
<P>
	Bill C-69 was first tabled in the House of Commons on 
February 16, 1995. It has been dealt with in committee and is 
now back in the House for third reading. Bill C-69 repeals the 
existing Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act which has been 
in place since 1964.
<P>
	In early 1994 the commissions established under the 1964 
rules and appointed in more recent years began issuing their 
proposals for the new electoral boundaries, which they had been 
working on for months previous. The proposals generated 
considerable concern and debate, especially since the federal 
election had just been held and concluded.
<P>
<B>(1545 ) </B>
<P>
	In March 1994 the government introduced Bill C-18 to 
suspend the operation of the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment 
Act. As originally drafted, Bill C-18 would have abolished the 
11 electoral boundaries commissions and suspended the act 
itself for up to two years. Because of concern that this would 
unduly delay redistribution-and the Liberal majority in the 
House of Commons refused to acknowledge this-the other 
place proposed amendments to suspend the act only until June 
22, 1995 unless new legislation was put in place before then and 
rather than abolish the committees to suspend them until that 
time.
<P>
	The bill in front of us today is meant to address those matters. 
The government is doing what it can to ensure it has full passage 
before June 22. At the outset, let me say that I will be opposing 
the bill when the vote occurs at the conclusion of the debate. I 
will do this because I believe the government is interfering with 
the independence of what should be a completely non-partisan 
arm's length relationship between the people of Canada and its 
politicians.
<P>
	There is a place for politicians to debate process and 
procedure and to set rules that will apply in the future. However, 
in this case the independent process had begun its course and 
was acting according to its existing mandate when the 
government unilaterally shut it down and began setting new 
rules that would be applied retroactively.
<P>
	With the passage of this bill the new rules will be in place and 
the work of the many existing boundary commissions, much of 
it completed after numerous public hearings were held, will be 
put on the shelf to gather dust. I expect such will be the case of 
the Saskatchewan Boundaries Commission which for all intents 
and purposes has completed the work of readjusting the federal 
boundaries within my province. Because of the provisions of 
this bill, that commission will likely not be reappointed and 
Saskatchewan residents will vote within the same boundaries 
that were originally set for the 1988 general election when the 
next general election is called.
<P>
	Political constituency boundaries are like provincial and 
national boundaries. Despite the fact they are often arbitrarily 
drawn, they help to recognize economic, social and geographic 
patterns. They are most easily accepted by the public when they 
recognize those patterns.
<P>
	We in Canada have developed a system that is based on a 
reference to population and changes in these constituency 
boundaries take place when populations shift. I realize that in a 
system of representation by population this is an important 
consideration. I agree with those who, inside and outside this 
Chamber, argue that it makes no sense for one member of 
Parliament to represent a constituency populated by 110,000 
and another MP to represent a population of 55,000 or less.
<P>
	Even though each citizen of Canada has one vote in a general 
election, the votes when counted are not equal. In the case I just 
outlined, those smaller constituencies require only half as many 
votes to elect their representative as do those in the larger 
constituencies. Those representatives in turn vote on matters of 
concern to all the people of Canada in this House on their behalf.
<P>
	The boundaries commissioners who are appointed to redraw 
boundaries when populations change are also charged with 
taking into account local trading patterns, communities of 
interest, geographical barriers to movement and local economic 
conditions. Past experience has shown this has not always been 
the case. Therefore, changes in the way we do this stuff is 
important.
<P>
	To a certain extent this bill addresses a few of the problems we 
should be looking at for the future. I will address some of those 
changes in just a moment. First, I think it is important that we do 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11623"> 11623 </A></B>
<P>
not overlook the fact that the system is in much more need of an 
overhaul than this bill provides.
<P>
	There is talk about the need to reduce the number of members 
of Parliament. This is a matter I support and one which I think 
this Parliament should examine in greater detail. There has been 
much talk about building an electoral system around a couple of 
different concepts, like proportional representation, or perhaps 
a preferential ballot. This is another matter I support, the 
discussion of these different systems of elections. We would be 
doing ourselves an injustice if we did not pursue that debate as 
well.
<P>
<B>(1550 ) </B>
<P>
	The House of Commons is only one part of what we call 
Parliament. It is impossible and I think irresponsible to reform 
one part of this picture without addressing the other. I talked 
about the other place in my remarks on the concurrence motion.
<P>
	I want to stress again that as long as we are hitching our horse 
to an electoral system based completely on representation by 
population, we must address the problems this creates in 
regional fairness. We can best address this by reforming the 
second chamber of Parliament. I support the idea of abolishing 
the currently unelected and unaccountable Senate and replacing 
it with a new elected, accountable and certainly more useful 
second chamber that can address more equitably the grievances 
of the regions.
<P>
	These matters are all important to addressing the real 
economic and social issues facing all Canadians. The 
government should be prepared to take the next step in this 
matter as soon as the debate on this bill is complete.
<P>
	In presenting his report to Parliament the chair of the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs which by 
and large drafted this bill, the member for Kingston and the 
Islands suggested that there were a number of problems with the 
process of looking at boundary changes. For the most part I 
agree with him. Those problems have to be addressed.
<P>
	The member for Kingston and the Islands said there was a 
problem with the beginning of the process. Newly drafted 
boundaries maps often appeared to the general public as if by 
magic. For most ordinary Canadians the first they knew there 
was a boundary change in process was when they saw a redrawn 
map published in a local newspaper. The new boundaries 
appeared as if they were a fait accompli, a done deal. The work 
had been completed. Although public input was sought at this 
point, to many Canadians this seemed like a futile gesture. Most 
of the work had already been done.
<P>
	Changes considered and brought forward in this bill now 
make the consultation process start earlier. The public will be 
notified before the boundaries commissions begin the process of 
redrawing the maps. Public input will be considered at that 
stage. This is very important and I am pleased to see it included. 
So much of the work goes on in that early decision making that 
the role of the public must be considered.
<P>
	At the same time we know today that the existing 
commissions are not required to justify their rationale for 
making the early decisions, those decisions which determine the 
basis for readjusting the boundaries. The new rules will require 
the commissions to justify themselves. This is also most 
supportable.
<P>
	In our own case in Saskatchewan, the most recent commission 
made its early decision to give our two largest cities, Saskatoon 
and Regina, four instead of three seats each. That decision 
subsequently affected every other seat in the province since 
there were no additional seats to be had in Saskatchewan.
<P>
	There were 14 seats before redistribution and there were 14 
seats after redistribution. When the commission decided to 
move two additional seats into the urban environment it meant 
that two rural seats would basically disappear. On that point 
there was no public input prior to the decision being made. 
Subsequently the commission was not asked to justify why the 
two urban seats needed more MPs and the rural areas needed 
fewer.
<P>
	In a historical aside, I think it is worth noting that I found in 
the history of federal representation in Saskatchewan a very 
interesting circumstance. If we look at the historical record we 
note that the first federal election in which the newly formed 
province of Saskatchewan participated was back in 1907. Ten 
federal constituencies were contested. In 1907 Saskatchewan 
had 10 seats out of a total of 221 in the House of Commons. That 
number fluctuated considerably over the years to a high of 21 
seats in the elections of 1924 and 1933 when the House total was 
245 seats. Today in a House of Commons of 295 members, 
Saskatchewan residents are represented by 14 MPs.
<P>
	If the House of Commons expands to 301 seats, we will 
continue to have the 14 seats for a while but then we will begin to 
lose seats, eventually ending up with just 10 again sometime in 
the early part of the next century. After 100 years of history we 
will be right back to where we started: 10 seats in 1907, 10 seats 
in 2003.
<P>
<B>(1555 ) </B>
<P>
	I might add that according to Canada's Chief Electoral 
Officer, if the government ever addresses the question of a 
smaller Parliament, Saskatchewan will again lose more seats. It 
will likely end up with no more than eight members of 
Parliament representing every citizen within its provincial 
borders. This is more than enough reason for Saskatchewan 
residents to say that we should make sure that we look beyond 
representation by population in the second chamber and develop 
a system that will ensure there is fairness in regional 
representation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11624"> 11624 </A></B>
<P>
	Going back to the bill, another problem in this mix of existing 
rules left any sort of national standards for the basis of decision 
making as non-existent. Every boundaries commission made 
their own set of rules and set guidelines for how they would 
adjust the boundaries within their area of jurisdiction.
<P>
	As a result, there was no consistency across Canada. Some 
constituencies were created under guidelines which took into 
account normal local trading, economics, social and even 
religious patterns. Others were created for population or even 
for political purposes.
<P>
	This meant that some commissions made changes that were 
completely unnecessary. They only did so because they were 
given the opportunity to make changes on rules they established 
for themselves. The whole matter of unnecessary changes is 
crazy. I think the committee has recognized that in proposing 
changes in this bill.
<P>
	The changes proposed in this legislation will now make public 
input more useful, consultation more widespread and boundary 
changes necessary only when warranted by dramatic population 
shifts. These are definitely changes that have to be made.
<P>
	I agree that the role of the public must be strengthened 
because this exercise is ultimately for them. The boundaries on 
which MPs are elected have an effect on the type of 
representation the people within those boundaries can expect or 
should expect. In drawing up those boundaries the needs of 
those who will be directly affected must be respected.
<P>
	I also like the principle of ``least amount of change'' which 
this bill proposes, although I do not support its retroactivity. The 
principle of least amount of change means that no boundaries 
readjustment commission would be appointed when the 
population does not warrant it. If there is no substantial 
population change, then there is no new commission, no new 
work done to adjust boundaries, no public hearings, no new 
maps or advertising and with that no new expenditure of public 
money to create something that does not need to be changed. 
This is a positive element.
<P>
	For the benefit of my constituents back home in 
Saskatchewan, as I mentioned earlier, this likely means that 
there will be no new map for Saskatchewan's federal 
boundaries. The Battlefords-Meadow Lake constituency 
created for the 1988 election and which was in place for the 1993 
election will likely remain in place for the next federal election 
whenever that may be.
<P>
	In conclusion, let me simply say that the changes presented by 
Bill C-69 do not justify the suspension of the current process 
and the discarding of the work of so many commissions that was 
virtually complete. However, the debate has been worthwhile. 
The changes will improve the process for the future. At the same 
time, let us not forget there is that bigger picture to look at, a 
picture that should include a review of the total number of seats 
in the House, the concept of proportional representation or 
preferential ballot and the concept of a  second chamber of 
Parliament that is accountable to the people of Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with interest to the presentation of our colleague from The 
Battlefords-Meadow Lake. I think that his position was clear 
and well put.
<P>
	I would like to ask him a few questions, perhaps two, 
particularly on the issue of an elected Senate. But before I get 
into the subject, I would like to justify, just a little, my 
participation in the debate.
<P>
	As a sovereignist member of Parliament from Quebec, it 
might seem strange that I would want to get involved in the 
representation of Canadians in the House of Commons, but it 
should be well understood that constituents gave us the mandate 
to be the official opposition in the House. I think that it would 
have been inappropriate for us not to deal with this issue 
claiming that it does not concern us.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	It concerns us, first, because of the mandate which we 
received, as I just mentioned, and also because, in view of the 
association with Canada that we want to promote, it is in our best 
interests, as Quebecers, to ensure that Canadian Parliament 
works in the best way possible.
<P>
	I would like to remind my colleague, whom I was interested to 
hear mention that the representation of Saskatchewan's 
members in Parliament would be reduced in the future, why we, 
in the Bloc Quebecois, were moved to present an amendment 
which was defeated by the House. The aim of this amendment 
was to ensure that, should Quebec remain in Canada, its 
representation would never drop below 25 per cent.
<P>
	Why are we insisting on that figure? I think that this 25 per 
cent is very small if we consider what we have been. When you 
come into the lobby of the House of Commons, there is the 
opposition door and the government door. If you look above the 
opposition door, you can see two medallions. In one of them, 
there is Louis XIV and in the other, François I.
<P>
	Above the government door, you notice two English kings. 
What does that mean? It means that you can see, carved in stone, 
what Canada was when we entered Confederation. By the way, 
we entered Confederation on a vote by the Parliament of what 
was then Lower Canada. There was no referendum. At the time, 
Canada was a duality, what people used to call the French 
Canadian people and the English Canadian people. That is how 
people saw Canada.
<P>
	In 1982, Canada changed. Canada was a country with ten 
equal provinces, and in those provinces there were citizens who 
were all equal, irrespective of their origins, but that is not really 
my point. My point is that the nature of the country in which we 
live was changed and it was done forcibly, and, I may recall, by 
means of a law passed by the Parliament of England. So this is 
not  exactly conducive to good relations between peoples, and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11625"> 11625 </A></B>
<P>
when I say peoples, I am referring to the people of Quebec and 
the people of Canada.
<P>
	The hon. member for The Battlefords-Meadow Lake rose to 
complain that Saskatchewan would have fewer members. As 
members from Quebec, we also rose to complain about this 
eventuality, and the House of Commons ignored our complaint. 
We protested on the basis of our historic responsibility as the 
homeland of French Canadians. Today, French Canadians call 
themselves Quebecers, possibly to the dismay of some people in 
English Canada.
<P>
	And now my question is about the Senate. The hon. member 
for The Battlefords-Meadow Lake suggested, to compensate 
for the decrease in representation of the provinces, an appointed 
or elected Senate that would act as a kind of counterweight to the 
fact that the House of Commons would then perhaps represent 
more ridings and the Senate would then represent the provinces 
and play a kind of protective role.
<P>
	Considering his experience in the House of Commons-the 
hon. member is an experienced member of Parliament who was 
here throughout the Mulroney era-does he really believe that 
in the present situation, Canada will ever achieve the kind of 
constitutional reform that would allow for making changes in its 
institutions?
<P>
<B>(1605 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> Mr. Speaker, there are a number of comments 
within the member's question to which I would like to respond.
<P>
	I will start by addressing the question because the answer is 
quite simple. I am a great optimist. I believe that people can 
work together and reach compromises that will be acceptable to 
most Canadians.
<P>
	We have built an entire heritage of doing that. We are in the 
process of reaching agreements with aboriginal people that I 
wish were further along in process than they are today. We are 
reaching that point and I know we will do so with the province of 
Quebec, its people and its leaders as well.
<P>
	I have no hesitation in saying that when we share the will we 
will share also the dream of developing a political system that 
we can all work with and live under.
<P>
	At the same time, in approaching his question the member 
made the comment that the Bloc Quebecois is playing a role as 
the official opposition in the House of Commons. He talked 
about the Bloc Quebecois ensuring that Parliament is as 
effective as possible as the official opposition. He implied that 
the Bloc Quebecois therefore was able to represent the interests 
of Saskatchewan people because they are the official opposition. 
I do not think anything can be further from the truth.
<P>
	After 18 months in office, the present government enjoys 
unprecedented popularity among the Canadian people. It is not 
for anything that the government has done. It is because the 
ineffective opposition is not communicating to the Canadian 
people the devastation that the policies of the government are 
creating on the people of our country.
<P>
	Nothing could be more clear than the policies that are 
affecting the people of Saskatchewan. The elimination of the 
Crow rate in any other Parliament in our history would have 
been a raucous debate in this Chamber. There would have been 
members yelling and screaming from their chairs. They would 
have done everything within the rules, within their power, to 
prevent the government from changing the Crow rate, which 
devastates the rail transportation system and the agriculture 
system in Saskatchewan.
<P>
	We have completed, over the last couple of days, debate that 
implements the changes to the Crow benefit. There were 23 Bloc 
speakers on the bill that changes the government's relationship 
with Saskatchewan farmers. Of those 23 Bloc speakers, not one 
defended Saskatchewan's interests on the Crow rate. In between 
these debates, the Bloc even introduced a motion stating that 
because of the minuscule payout to the Saskatchewan farmers in 
compensation for this huge program they have lost, Quebec was 
somehow discriminated against in the process.
<P>
	That is not an official opposition representing the interests of 
Saskatchewan people. That is not an opposition that is going to 
bring the people in any part of the country to the conclusion that 
the policies of the government are wrong for all Canadians.
<P>
	Until we have an effective opposition in the country 
composed of people who care about all of Canada, the 
government is going to continue to have undeserved popularity.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
my pleasure to rise to address Bill C-69.
<P>
	Bill C-69 really has not received much news coverage. On the 
face of it, it is a technical piece of legislation completely lacking 
in sex appeal.
<P>
	At its essence, it can be an important bill for a couple of 
reasons. First, it points beyond itself to the desperate need to 
bring about some reform of the Canadian parliamentary system. 
It points to some of the flaws that we have in our system today. It 
should be scrutinized, regarded and debated in the context of 
overall reform of the Canadian parliamentary system.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11626"> 11626 </A></B>
<P>
	The bill will find opposition among three different groups of 
people. It will find opposition among people who believe in real 
representation by population. It will find opposition among 
people who feel that we are already over-governed to a great 
degree. It will find opposition among people who disapprove of 
the idea of granting power to unelected and unaccountable 
bodies like a boundaries commission.
<P>
<B>(1610 ) </B>
<P>
	First, let me talk about representation by population in the 
context of the reform of the whole parliamentary system. 
Reformers believe in the idea of absolute representation by 
population. In other words, to the greatest degree possible 
constituencies should have the same population.
<P>
	However, as a counterpoise to that, to balance the idea of 
constituencies which perhaps would congregate in heavily 
populated areas, we have to have a triple-E Senate. It should 
have an equal number of senators from each province; it should 
be an elected Senate and it should be an effective Senate. It is 
something that our party has been fighting for since its inception 
in 1987.
<P>
	We are proud of the fact that we are the only party that has 
ever elected a senator. The late Stan Waters was elected in the 
Senate election of 1991 in Alberta and was subsequently 
appointed to the other place. That could have been a very 
valuable way to start the trend toward a triple-E Senate.
<P>
	That system would probably give some regions, such as 
Alberta and Saskatchewan, as my hon. friend from The 
Battlefords-Meadow Lake has just talked about, and other 
regions of the country some representation and protection from 
the tyranny of the majority that we have found when we have a 
pure representation by population system in a country that is as 
geographically large as Canada.
<P>
	Reformers believe in the idea of representation by population 
because it underscores a commitment to the idea of equality 
before the law. It is a very important concept which, to some 
degree, has been forgotten in the past several years. It has been 
superseded by a different type of equality which governments 
have come to believe in, that is, the equality of outcome. All 
Canadians want is equality of opportunity, and they would find 
that, to a large degree, in a system that had absolute 
representation by population, along with a triple-E Senate. It is 
is a very pragmatic concept, a concept familiar to countries 
which have large geographical areas, such as the United States 
and Australia.
<P>
	It is a pragmatic idea because it prevents countries which are 
big and sparsely populated in some areas from falling apart. In a 
country as large as Canada, we have very disparate points of 
view and divergent interests. Sometimes, certainly under a pure 
representation by population system, those ideas that we find in 
different areas of the country would not be adequately addressed 
in a House of Commons, for instance. We need a  counterpoise to 
that and that is why Reformers are big supporters of a triple-E 
Senate.
<P>
	Bill C-69 gives us neither of those concepts; certainly not 
representation by population and definitely not any kind of 
change that would give us a triple-E Senate. In fact, it offends 
the principles that underlie both of them.
<P>
	One of the things that Reformers find hard to deal with is the 
25 per cent variance regulation in Bill C-69. It means that 
constituencies can vary in size by 25 per cent from the mean. 
That could lead to discrepancies of as much as 67 per cent in 
population size between constituencies. That is a huge 
difference in population size. It permanently dispels the idea 
that we can have equal influence for our votes in a Canadian 
system.
<P>
	That may be a quaint notion to a lot of people in this place, but 
I would argue that people back home very firmly believe in the 
idea that each vote should carry the same weight. We would 
argue strongly that the government has to begin to move that 
way. That is why the Reform Party has suggested, at least, to 
amend the variance to 15 per cent between constituencies. If we 
did that, it would mean that, at most, we would have a variance 
of 35 per cent in populations between constituencies. That is not 
perfect, but it certainly brings us closer to the idea of 
representation by population until such time as we can have 
constitutional reform that can address some of the real problems 
that affect the Canadian parliamentary system.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	As I mentioned a minute ago, I think people feel we are 
already over governed. I remind members of an article in that 
ubiquitous journal that sits on just about everybody's night 
stand, <I>Readers Digest</I>. About a year ago there was an article 
about how much money is spent on governing Canadians, how 
much it costs to run Parliament. When I think of that article I 
cannot help but think of our unelected Senate and the people 
over there who sadly do not enjoy the confidence of Canadians, 
and how at times they have not displayed the type of conduct we 
would like to see from all parliamentarians. I specifically think 
of the GST debate.
<P>
	It is necessary to make those people accountable. If we had a 
triple-E senate it is entirely possible that we could trim the size. 
Reform has called at various times for Senate reform that could 
possibly leave us with six senators from each province. Some 
people have suggested we only need two from each province. We 
look to the American example and we can see they can get by 
with two senators from states as large as California, which has a 
population almost as large as Canada's. Somehow they manage 
to make that system work. One thing that could be done is trim 
the number of senators.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11627"> 11627 </A></B>
<P>
	A lot of people would agree with me if I said there are a lot of 
backbenchers in the House we probably could do without 
because there is not always enough meaningful work to go 
around. I mean no disrespect to any particular backbencher. 
However, in a private moment if they were true to their heart of 
hearts, many backbenchers would acknowledge we could 
probably get by with fewer members of Parliament and still do 
the essential work required to make the government run.
<P>
	The article mentioned it costs somewhere in the order of $770 
million to run Parliament. If we could get the number of 
members of Parliament to about 265, as Reform suggested, it 
would still leave constituencies of a size allowing members to 
deal with the concerns.
<P>
	If we could get the size of the Senate down, make it effective, 
elected and equal, it would have the confidence of the people 
and could serve a necessary purpose and perhaps go a long way 
to healing some of the wounds that divide the country.
<P>
	Concerning boundary commissions being given a lot of power 
to make changes, I am concerned about that and Canadians 
should be concerned about it as well. It is conceivable that 
power could reside simply in the statues for the government to 
administer.
<P>
	The boundary commissions people are unelected and 
unaccountable. They have the power to set boundaries. I would 
not suggest they have this in mind but if they wished they could 
do a tremendous amount of mischief with the boundaries. It has 
been suggested by other members that has happened in the past, 
that boundaries were drawn somewhat arbitrarily because of 
political and other reasons that really do not have anything to do 
with the proper function and the proper way representatives and 
their areas should be chosen. That bothers me.
<P>
	We need to move away from that to the greatest degree 
possible and enshrine in statutes more precisely how rules 
should work so there would be less latitude for unelected, 
unaccountable bodies to change the boundaries to suit either 
their own needs or perhaps the needs of their political masters.
<P>
	In Bill C-69 we see the tremendous latitude boundaries 
commissions have to make exceptions to the 25 per cent 
variance rule by allowing them to exempt certain 
constituencies. In the past this has applied to very large 
constituencies. There is nothing in the rules preventing 
boundary commissions from making exemptions for 
constituencies that are not as large.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	Reform would like to propose bigger changes which would 
require a different forum and a different debate. In the context of 
this bill we would like to see a rule that would put a limit on the 
minimum size of a constituency that could be exempted on the 
schedule. We are suggesting somewhere in the range of 200,000 
or 250,000 kilometres. We are concerned that as long as it is left 
open, we will see MPs from various areas of the country coming 
forward, lobbying to have their boundaries  exempted, not for 
any good reason, but because they want to keep their boundaries 
for very political reasons.
<P>
	I point to the reason we are here discussing Bill C-69. There 
was a very unseemly scene not too long ago when the boundaries 
came out under the current bill. MPs from the government and 
the Bloc were running to the government saying: ``Please do not 
change my boundaries. It will ruin my chances for re-election''. 
It stopped a situation in which we already had a process 
underway to draw new boundaries.
<P>
	Reform constituencies were very much affected by this. The 
member for Beaver River, the deputy leader of the Reform Party, 
was to lose her riding altogether. Nevertheless, Reform did not 
squawk about this. Members across the way and in the Bloc 
squawked, made a big deal about this, made sure their own 
interests were protected at the expense of Canadian taxpayers 
and at the expense of slowing the entire process down, forcing it 
back into the House under new legislation, tying up members' 
time to deal with this once again. That is entirely inappropriate.
<P>
	The government has made a grave error. It has gone to great 
lengths to protect its own interests as it has done with other 
issues like MP pensions. For once it would be nice to see the 
government put the interests of its constituents and of the people 
of Canada ahead of its own interests. That is all Canadians want.
<P>
	That whole unseemly situation gave birth to Bill C-69. It is 
why we are here today. What Canadians really want ultimately is 
a complete change to the underpinnings of the Canadian system. 
They want representation by population. They also want a 
triple-E Senate which would go a long way to giving the regions 
representation and in healing some of the wounds as a result of a 
faulty system today.
<P>
	A fair and transparent democratic set of institutions is all 
Canadians want. The government and Bill C-69 have failed to 
give them that. For that reason I will not be supporting this 
legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am a little curious as to something the member 
said. He referred to the schedules in the bill whereby members 
could apply to have their ridings exempted from redistribution 
because it would be included in the schedule.
<P>
	Is he aware that in committee that section of the bill was 
removed?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, I cannot speak directly to what the 
hon. member has referred to, but my concern is that we will have 
members and their delegates arguing before boundary 
commissions for exemption and that will tie up the whole 
process.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11628"> 11628 </A></B>
<P>
	We have already seen how members have run to the 
government to have the whole system changed at great expense 
to the Canadian taxpayers. I am concerned there might be 
loopholes that would allow government members and other 
members, from the Bloc for instance, to continue that.
<P>
<B>(1625 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, with respect, the member has not 
answered the question.
<P>
	Is he not aware the section to which he refers whereby Bloc 
members, Liberal members or any member could ask to have 
their riding put in a schedule either because it is too large or for 
any other consideration is not there? The last section of this bill 
is entitled coming into force, section 40. The previous section to 
add to this schedule was removed at the committee by 
unanimous vote, including the Reform members who sit on the 
committee.
<P>
	Given that is the case, surely the member will understand the 
whole premise of his speech today is wrong. Given that all of 
that was wrong, should we now conclude he is now in favour of 
the bill because the whole premise by which he thought the bill 
was wrong is not there? It was removed several weeks ago in the 
committee on a motion by a committee member and approved by 
all other committee members.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, I reject the hon. member's 
premise. Obviously I addressed many points in my speech. The 
hon. member across the way has not addressed the concern I 
raised that there be a minimum level at which exemptions would 
not be permitted, 200,000 to 250,000, somewhere in that range. 
That is what we are calling for.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I want to comment on a regrettable aspect of the 
Reform member's speech, namely the denigrating of an MP's 
work.
<P>
	The member started by saying that the choices made by 
Canadians were not all good ones. This is tantamount to 
insulting voters. Then, he criticized the number of members. 
These are facile comments. Indeed, regardless of which side 
members sit in this House, regardless of their option, the fact is 
that, as with any group, some people are more efficient than 
others. However, the overwhelming majority of members put all 
their energy into their work and try to do a good job.
<P>
	The member also indicated that we try to protect the interests 
of our individual ridings. I categorically object to that 
statement. When representations are made, at any stage, it is 
always with the public interest in mind, to ensure that voters are 
adequately represented and to also ensure that certain criteria 
are taken into account.
<P>
	I will end with a question which expresses my astonishment. 
The Reform member, as well as the NDP member who preceded 
him, both feel that a constitutional reform is essential. Do 
members not realize that, since the failure of the Charlottetown 
accord, it is no longer possible to reform the existing structure?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, I reject the idea there is no 
possibility of constitutional reform. Canadians by and large 
want to ultimately change the system and there will be a day in 
the not too distant future when they will be ready to discuss that. 
Perhaps that is a little wishful thinking on behalf of the member 
from the Bloc Quebecois who would like to separate. Sadly for 
him that will be denied in an upcoming referendum which they 
surely will lose due in no small part to the ineffectiveness of the 
Bloc Quebecois to represent the constituents of Quebec.
<P>
	Perhaps he has made an argument for me that certain 
backbenchers have not been effective in putting across the views 
of their constituents very effectively.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I simply 
want to ask a question to the hon. member, but first I would like 
to make a short comment.
<P>
	After hearing the hon. member's speech, I think I can see the 
difference between Reform and Bloc members. I feel that 
Reform members represent taxpayers, while we, Bloc members, 
represent citizens.
<P>
	It is often said that citizens do not want their riding to change, 
or that their member makes representations on their behalf to 
preserve the boundaries of the riding. That is because the 
member recognizes that these people feel a sense of belonging to 
their riding.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	People get attached to their riding, which is represented by a 
member of Parliament. Often, they will have created a sense of 
community in that riding.
<P>
	To think strictly in terms of numbers when establishing the 
boundaries of a riding would be to make the same mistake as in 
1982, when the Canadian constitution was changed and when the 
country's ten provinces, whose populations are far from being 
equal, were said to be equal. That created an artificial country.
<P>
	I believe that, given the attitude which frequently prevails 
when setting electoral boundaries, we create artificial ridings 
which do not mean anything special. It is as though Canada was 
a big cake cut into pieces, with the hope that these pieces will 
somehow be equal. You simply cannot do that with a country. 
You cannot overlook the sense of belonging.
<P>
	I ask the hon. member: Does he not think it is important to 
take into account the voters' sense of belonging when redefining 
electoral boundaries?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11629"> 11629 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, certainly I recognize there are 
differences from community to community. To the greatest 
degree possible boundaries should recognize this and try to 
embrace communities where there have been traditional 
boundaries.
<P>
	However the first principle, the driving principle in my 
judgment, has to be representation by population. At the end of 
the 20th century we do not yet have a political system that either 
serves people on the basis of representation by population or 
contrarily has a counterpoise through a triple-E Senate. It is 
time that we started to move toward that.
<P>
	In our amendments to Bill C-69, the one that called for a 15 
per cent variance would have given us a closer system. That has 
to be the first principle that drives any changes to the 
boundaries. The second principle should respect trading areas 
and things like that. We agree with that absolutely. Let us not 
make that the first principle.
<P>
	Canadians are democrats first and foremost. I think they 
would like to see a system that is based on a more democratic 
type of system.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. 
member for Burnaby-Kingsway-Turkey; the hon. member 
for Bourassa-Immigration.
<P>
	Resuming debate. The hon. member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, at the start of this the last statement on this bill, I 
would like to identify my reasons for opposing it.
<P>
	First, the Bloc Quebecois was elected to defend Quebec's 
interests and to promote sovereignty. Personally, as a member, I 
said, obviously, that I wanted to protect the interests of the 
people in my part of the country.
<P>
	When the electoral map is to be redrawn resulting in the 
disappearance of one of the five ridings of eastern Quebec-be 
it Gaspé, Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine or 
Matane-Matapédia-or a change to the riding of 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup or Rimouski-Témiscouata, I 
believe it is important that all members of this House understand 
the need for legislation permitting true representation of the 
people, one that would not be simply based on a mathematical 
computation.
<P>
	To this end, while we have been in this House, we have made 
representations to the electoral boundaries commission, we 
have spoken during second reading, we appeared before the 
standing committee. After all that, I would once again ask 
people to make sure that consideration is given to a region's 
natural configuration in the make-up of federal ridings, if the 
federal map is to be used again.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	I gave as an example my riding of 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup. If the electoral map were ever 
changed, I would like the people in the RCMs concerned to be 
asked what riding they would like to be in in order to be sure that 
people are where they want to be and not stuck somewhere as the 
result of mathematical or geographical calculations that have 
nothing to do with reality.
<P>
	When changing electoral boundaries, we are reminded of the 
past a bit-very large ridings across Canada with a scattered 
population that is difficult to reach. In the past, there have even 
been protected ridings in Quebec to ensure better representation 
for anglophones in the Eastern Townships. However, when we 
consider the electoral map as one of the tools of democracy for 
the future, we must ensure it provides for better representation 
and that it is an effective tool for the exercise of democracy.
<P>
	I have been a member for a year and a half. I think all 
members of this House think the same way. The work here is 
apportioned fairly well. Whether we come from a large or a 
small riding, area-wise, our work is quite similar. However, it is 
another matter when we are talking about our work in our 
ridings. Some ridings are located right downtown, a few streets 
away from each other, whereas the one I represent encompasses 
a total of 55 municipalities. There are even ridings with 80 
municipalities. This all affects the work of MPs and the way 
they will go about doing it.
<P>
	The number of municipalities is not the only issue. We should 
also consider the extent to which government services are 
spread out in a riding. MPs must try to compensate, particularly 
in rural areas. In major centres, all of the government services 
can be found; people in those ridings can always find the office 
which can provide them such and such a service. But for people 
in rural areas, the MP's office is often the only resource they 
have to help them locate the government services they need. The 
workload, therefore, is heavier and when a riding is particularly 
large, this obviously has an impact on the amount of work to be 
done.
<P>
	Therefore, it is very important that we take into consideration 
the size of the territory covered if we want to ensure that MPs 
will be able to represent their electorate well. They must also be 
able to see their constituents regularly.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11630"> 11630 </A></B>
<P>
	Other important factors which must be taken into account are 
activity and industrial sectors. For example, this week, we had 
an opposition day on agriculture. If we move closer to basing 
representation purely on demographic considerations, the 
impact of the agricultural sector will be reduced, the impact of 
MPs representing such ridings will also be reduced, and even 
society as a whole will be negatively affected because 
agriculture has an impact on the population as a whole.
<P>
	Therefore, we must ensure that we continue to be able to take 
into account this kind of sector. That is why it seems to me that 
the current bill lacks nuance and subtlety in the way that the 
boundaries of ridings can be determined. That was one aspect 
that I wanted to discuss, but there is another-and it was perhaps 
the greatest disappointment during the entire consideration of 
the bill-the Liberal majority's refusal to grant Quebec a 
minimum of 25 per cent of all of the seats in the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	I equated this behaviour with someone slamming the door on 
another person, an egotistical act committed by the majority and 
a sort of negation of the fact that Canada has two founding 
peoples. Initially, in this House, two founding peoples created 
this country. Through immigration policies and the way that the 
provinces were created, Quebecers, the first explorers of this 
vast continent, will become a smaller and smaller minority as 
time goes by if they choose to stay in Canada, a choice which 
will mean that they will be a minority without any real impact 
compared to the position they have had in North America for 
centuries.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	I believe that this tendency to reduce Quebec to a minority 
reflects the same attitude that gave us the unilateral patriation of 
the Constitution. There is some consistency there. In the same 
way as Quebec Liberal members were not very proud of 
patriation in 1982-and were reminded of that during the 1984 
election-the Quebec people told them that they were not very 
pleased with their vote on this amendment. We were very 
surprised to see Quebec Liberal members vote against our 
amendment which, basically, was to guarantee a minimum 
representation in the House.
<P>
	I believe that it is something that all Quebecers will remember 
for a long time. They will remember it, in particular, when they 
have to decide whether they want to become a country or not, 
and one of the reasons for their choice will be that they have no 
hope of regaining the place they had in this country, given that 
they are refused even this small guarantee of survival.
<P>
	The refusal to make the Magdalen Islands a special case, and 
consider it a separate riding, is another disappointment, even if 
it does not have the same national significance. This shows a 
lack of sensitivity and in that regard I should mention that the 
Quebec Electoral Law considers the Magdalen Islands as a 
separate riding, outside the norm for other ridings. At the  
federal level, this riding has existed in the past, but later the 
islands were joined with either Gaspé or Bonaventure.
<P>
	This puts the member who represents this area in a very 
awkward position, since there are very distinct interests. This is 
clear when you consider the territory to be covered and the 
isolation of the place, and also when you consider its 
relationship with other Canadian communities surrounding the 
Gulf. I find the decision not to recognize the islands as a 
separate riding regrettable, because a member representing 
solely the islands could have made a very interesting 
contribution. This does not mean that there could not be in 
Canada some other exceptions of that kind, which could be 
given special recognition.
<P>
	The reason I am against this bill is that the provincial 
commissions which will be established to readjust the electoral 
boundaries will have to apply the three following criteria: 
community of interest, reasonable size, and significant 
population increase over the next five years. This is the exact 
opposite of the argument I presented to the committee when I 
said: ``Would it not make sense, when considering eliminating a 
riding, to give it the opportunity to continue being represented 
in the House of Commons until the next census and, if it shows 
that the population is still dropping, to eliminate it then but only 
then?''
<P>
	The situation is reversed; for a riding to be exempt, one must 
forecast a significant increase in the population of the area over 
the next five years. This flies in the face of regional 
development. For instance, eastern Quebec has seen its 
population drop for the last 10 to 15 years as a result of 
deliberate policies on the part of centralizing governments 
which have pushed people to leave the area in search of a job.
<P>
	For the past few years, all the economic stakeholders have 
been working hard to reverse this trend. It will take a few years. 
Demographers say that it will take another 10 years, if the 
measures being implemented are successful. But, if in the 
meantime, you take away their ability to be represented, you are 
thwarting the efforts of the people who want to develop that 
particular part of the country.
<P>
	Therefore, I believe that electoral boundaries commissions 
should have to consider other criteria over and above the three I 
already mentioned, namely: community of interest, reasonable 
size, and significant population increase over the next five 
years.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	I have already listed them, but the main ones are the economic 
profile of a region, its size, the number of municipalities of 
which it is comprised and geographic unifying factors. These 
are all factors that should be considered and would, in my 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11631"> 11631 </A></B>
<P>
opinion, make for a more balanced definition of electoral 
boundaries.
<P>
	So, if you apply to the five electoral districts in Eastern 
Quebec the rules contained in the bill as it stands, you inevitably 
end up with a higher rate of depopulation and conditions 
unfavourable to building a new rurality. This situation is not 
unique to us. Every region in Canada is similarly affected, and I 
think the government should really be responsive to this.
<P>
	In conclusion, after following this bill as it went through 
several stages, I think that it should be defeated because the 
government did not fulfil the mandate it should have given 
itself, that is to ensure that all citizens of this country are 
adequately represented on the electoral map and that this map 
will promote a more participating democracy.
<P>
	One more thing, and I will conclude on this. I think it is very 
important to make sure that the cost of our democratic 
mechanisms are well within reasonable limits and that this is 
probably the least expensive system allowing us to achieve 
interesting results. Under the present circumstances, the 
government could have come up with a better mechanism and I 
think that it would have gained from listening to representations 
in that regard.
<P>
	I hope that the people of Quebec will be able to clearly see 
that, in that regard, the Bloc fully carried out its mandate to 
protect the interests of Quebecers and respect the choice they 
will make in the referendum. Either way, they will have been 
represented in this place by members who will have done their 
utmost to ensure adequate representation.
<P>
	As we examine electoral boundaries, we also notice 
duplication in the representation provided by members of 
Parliament. In the day-to-day work of members, there is clearly 
duplication resulting in additional costs to the government. 
There is also, in a way, unhealthy competition between 
provincial and federal members of Parliament, which does not 
promote efficiency in the system. I think this is one of the main 
reasons why a majority, the vast majority of Quebecers condemn 
the federal system in its present form and have been trying for 30 
years to change it and make it better, but the actions taken in 
recent years have shown that this is impossible and that the only 
way to get things moving again is to vote ``yes'' in the 
referendum to make sure they are in control of their future.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened very carefully to the comments of my hon. 
colleague across the way.
<P>
	``Slamming the door in our face'' I think was the terminology 
he used for not immediately agreeing to providing 25 per cent of 
the seats in this House for the province of Quebec. I suppose 
many Quebecers, and indeed many other Canadians, consider 
that the separatists from Quebec who propose separating from 
Canada are slamming the door in other Canadians' faces.
<P>
	We are adults and should resolve our problems as individuals 
and as a country through serious discussion, through caring and 
sharing our thoughts and ideas with all areas of this great 
country. It would certainly be childish to suggest that one needs 
four or five strikes and then, like children, take the ball and bat 
and go home.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	In this particular case, my hon. colleague across the way 
noted some of the concerns he and perhaps others have had. We 
could sit down and cite, back and forth, historic concerns 
probably for several days and weeks. However, we have to take a 
point from where we are today and move forward. We cannot 
move forward and accomplish our goals when we have such 
things as a referendum and separatists and separation hanging 
over our heads. What we really need is an opportunity to sit 
down and, with serious discussion, negotiate where this country 
is going in the future.
<P>
	I compliment my hon. colleague across the way for even 
suggesting that. The fact that they are talking about whatever 
percentage of seats in this House indicates to me that indeed 
deep down they are looking to stay in Canada and to stay in this 
House of Commons.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not know where the hon. 
member heard that I chose to stay here. I think that it is quite 
obvious from our approach and our desire to stay until the end of 
our mandate. I think that it is quite obvious given the number of 
times we showed that we favoured sovereignty and that we want 
Quebecers to make that choice in a democratic fashion.
<P>
	However, on the issue of the bill before the House, it is 
interesting to note that it is not the official opposition in Ottawa 
that asked for the 25 per cent. The Leader of the Opposition in 
the Quebec National Assembly, who is the leader of the Quebec 
Liberal Party, proposed that the Quebec National Assembly 
reiterate its objective of keeping at least 25 per cent of the seats 
in the Canadian House of Commons for Quebec and call on the 
Quebec government to make representations to that effect.
<P>
	This reminds me a little of the type of consensus we see on the 
issue of jurisdiction over manpower. It is the kind of unanimous 
opposition we in Quebec can summon against this. It is the 
Liberal majority in this place that voted against giving Quebec 
25 per cent of the seats in the House of Commons. It is the kind 
of results we will keep in mind.
<P>
	The official opposition in Quebec agrees with the official 
opposition in the House of Commons in this regard. The Quebec 
government wants to assume that responsibility, to ensure that 
minimum level of protection. I think that there is a consensus 
the Liberal majority must face.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11632"> 11632 </A></B>
<P>
	We must be able to hold serious discussions in an effort to 
address the problems. My father told me that, long before I was 
born, electoral boundaries were imposed on Quebecers even 
though 80 per cent of them voted against them.
<P>
	Later, the Constitution was patriated unilaterally without the 
agreement of the Quebec government under Mr. Lévesque or of 
the federalist governments that followed. We are still living 
with this Constitution today but the Liberal majority does not 
have a problem with it just because one of the provinces did not 
sign the agreement, and that is very difficult for us to accept.
<P>
	However, I did like one element of the presentation by the 
hon. member across the way. He said that we should sit down 
and negotiate. I think he should speak with his leader and all 
Liberal members because it is obvious that the leader of the 
government has repeatedly denied the need to amend the 
Constitution.
<P>
	It is clear that the current Prime Minister is trying to make 
Quebecers forget their own reality by providing good 
government for both Canadians and Quebecers. According to 
the figures we got earlier today, we are for the first time in 125 
years the province with the largest number of poor people in 
Canada. This kind of situation calls for fundamental changes. If 
the system has produced such results for 125 years, the only 
solution, in my opinion, is to get out.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> As no other speaker wishes to ask a 
question or make a comment, we will resume debate. The hon. 
deputy government whip.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
most Quebecers do not agree with the position of the last speaker 
and obviously do not want to leave Canada. This is why Quebec 
separatists have postponed the referendum.
<P>
	I would also like to remind the Bloc member that Quebecers 
rejected the constitutional amendments that would have 
guaranteed them a percentage of the seats in the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, before I continue, I want to point out that I will 
be sharing my time with the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak on this bill. It 
really is an extremely important bill, which deals with how we 
as Canadians determine how we will be represented in our 
House of Commons.
<P>
	While I have had the privilege of being a member of the 
committee on procedure and House affairs, which dealt with this 
bill, I joined the committee only part-way through the process. I 
am aware that the members of that committee spent a great deal 
of time on it. It was an innovative process in that it was the first 
time a committee fulfilled a mandate that we as a government  
promised to give members of the House of Commons, as 
members of committee, to actually initiate legislation, to bring 
legislation forward to the House from the members of this 
House as opposed to from the government.
<P>
	I want to compliment those members of the committee who 
have been on this project since the beginning for the excellent 
work they have done and the detailed consideration they have 
given to all aspects of this bill.
<P>
	I said it was an important bill and it is. It deals with how we 
are represented democratically as Canadians. That is a very 
difficult issue in a country like ours, which is so disperse, so 
disparate, so diverse geographically and demographically.
<P>
	We have huge concentrations of people in urban centres such 
as Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver, and yet we have huge and vast 
expanses of the country with very little population, with very 
little opportunity for people to have direct contact with their 
elected representatives.
<P>
	One dilemma the committee faced was how to deal with equal 
representation by population for people in very concentrated 
areas and in very dispersed areas.
<P>
	It is not an easy challenge. One has to recognize that 
representation by one's elected representative is more difficult 
when the member of Parliament has to travel perhaps thousands 
of miles even to see the parts of his or her constituency. One may 
have a very small population in a vast northern riding or in a 
riding such as Labrador and still have less contact with one's 
constituents than with a much larger population in an urban area 
that is much more compact.
<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
	The committee has proposed some innovative ways of 
ensuring when riding boundaries are decided upon. Of course 
they will not be decided by us but by independent commissions. 
However those factors will be taken into consideration. The very 
unique nature of this country will be taken into consideration. 
Ridings will be constructed so that people are equally well 
represented regardless of geography, dispersion of the 
population, sparsity of the population, or concentration of the 
population.
<P>
	I did want to speak about the whole concept of community of 
interest. That very clearly is a factor many of us felt was not 
adequately respected in the previous report of the electoral 
boundaries commissions, a factor that I feel has been 
tremendously strengthened in the legislation now before the 
House.
<P>
	One must not only look at numbers when deciding on ridings, 
how large they are and what their boundaries are. One must look 
at the commonality of interests in the people to be represented 
by the same member of Parliament. Do they identify themselves 
as a community? This is probably nowhere more important than 
in deciding what groups of people are going to be represented by 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11633"> 11633 </A></B>
<P>
the same individual. Of course, there will always be diversity 
and differences within any community no matter the size.
<P>
	It is extremely important that when members of Parliament 
walks into this Chamber to represent their constituents, they do 
so for a group of people who feel they have something in 
common. They identify themselves as a community historically 
or by virtue of common interests.
<P>
	I also want to respond to some comments that have been made 
about the 25 per cent representation. Members from the Bloc 
know very well that what they have talked about this week 
cannot be achieved except by constitutional change. To pretend 
anything else is simply not being straightforward with people.
<P>
	I do not think we could identify a handful of people in this 
country who want to go through the turmoil of talking about 
constitutional change again. There are so many bigger and much 
more important issues which touch the lives of people daily.
<P>
	People have contacted me asking why we cannot have a much 
smaller House of Commons. That is certainly an option. Again, 
it would require a constitutional change because of minimum 
representation which is guaranteed to some of our smaller 
provinces.
<P>
	I also tell people it is entirely possible to have a very much 
smaller House of Commons but we would lose something in 
doing that. Canadians would lose much closer and more 
personal contact with their members of Parliament.
<P>
	The people I have talked to value the ability to be in personal 
contact and have a personal response from their members of 
Parliament, when they want to discuss an issue with them or 
have a problem resolved or have recommendations for 
government action. This is extremely important to Canadians. 
Coming back to the first point, it is extremely important given 
the diversity of this country. Therefore, people should be 
cautious when they suggest we have fewer elected 
representatives. They would also then have more remote 
representation.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I only have a few seconds left. Therefore, I move 
pursuant to Standing Order 26:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the House continue to sit beyond the ordinary hour of adjournment for 
the purpose of considering Bill C-69.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Would those members who object to 
the motion please rise in their places.
<P>
	<I>And more than 15 members having risen:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> More than 15 members have risen, 
pursuant to Standing Order 26(2), the motion is deemed to have 
been withdrawn.
<P>
	(Motion withdrawn.)
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
listening closely to the parliamentary assistant and I thought it 
was rather presumptuous of her to state without any doubt that 
Quebecers do not support the theory of Quebec's sovereigntists. 
Although it is true that Quebecers rejected the Charlottetown 
agreement which kind of guaranteed Quebec 25 per cent of the 
seats in the House of Commons, I want to point out to the hon. 
member that English-speaking Canadians and the residents of 
the rest of Canada also voted against the agreement.
<P>
	So, she should not blame us for the failure of the 
Charlottetown agreement. I would also remind the hon. member 
that her leader, the current Prime Minister of Canada, warmly 
welcomed in his party the man who torpedoed the Meech Lake 
accord. I also want to take this opportunity to say to the hon. 
member that it is not because the sovereignty option is currently 
down in the polls that one must conclude that Quebecers support 
the federalist option.
<P>
	I think that, for various reasons, but mostly because of 
everything that is going on, because of previous threats they 
have received, because of fear-mongering, Quebecers are 
reluctant to opt for this avenue, but remember that a marriage 
run by fear is not a happy one. The hon. member should 
remember this, because with the growing debt and the deficit 
they will never get rid of-although they will never admit to 
it-one day they will have to say to Quebecers: ``Please, leave. 
We are no longer able to afford to be so big, so fat. We can no 
longer afford all this splendour''.
<P>
	This will quickly put an end to the member's rejoicing. So, I 
would ask her to be a little less presumptuous and to tell us what 
is wrong with giving Quebecers 25 per cent of the seats in the 
House of Commons, when they used to have, at the very 
beginning of Confederation, almost 50 per cent of them?
<P>
	I want to remind the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell that Confucius said that the hen 
has no business ruling the farmyard.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Catterall:</B> Mr. Speaker, it would be easy to play on the 
word sovereignist and claim the support of a majority of 
Quebecers.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	But after yesterday's declaration it has become clear that 
there will not be a referendum before next fall and that 
separatists are afraid of what Quebecers might decide. It is very 
clear that they want a sovereignist interpretation which would 
please Quebecers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11634"> 11634 </A></B>
<P>
	But the truth is that they constantly avoid the real question, 
which is separation. They want to avoid a clear definition of 
their aim, which is separation, and they do not want people to 
know that they are separatists. It is a very clear question. I do not 
understand the problem with asking the question right now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am happy to have such a large audience and to see 
all the members of the Bloc who are eager to hear my speech, 
which will lead them to vote in favour of Bill C-69. They are all 
here in front of me.
<P>
	Let me begin with the member who has just taken us back to 
Confederation and talked to us about the representation in the 
House of Commons in 1867. One does not have to be a great 
historian to know that, in 1867-The member, who knows his 
history, knows perfectly well that the Union Act, 1840 and the 
British North America Act are not the same thing.
<P>
	Anyway, at the time of Confederation in 1867, there were in 
fact three regions. There were, of course, 24 seats for what was 
then Upper Canada, 24 seats for Lower Canada, and 24 seats for 
the three maritime provinces, that is ten for New Brunswick, ten 
for Nova Scotia and four for Prince Edward Island.
<P>
	We all know that Prince Edward Island chose not to enter 
Confederation at that time and joined a few years later. So, New 
Brunswick and Nova Scotia each had 12 seats; 12 and 12 are 24, 
right? Twenty-four for Quebec and 24 for Ontario. For a 
member to claim that Quebec had 50 per cent of the seats in 1867 
is the opposite of the truth, as Sir Winston Churchill and his 
parliamentarians said so well.
<P>
	Those are the facts. With all due respect, the hon. member 
opposite does not know what he is talking about. Twenty-four 
out of 72 is not 50 per cent. Our friend who wants to leave the 
room, no doubt on very urgent business, should know better.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Tremblay (Rosemont, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think 
there is some laxness in the negative turn of phrase used to avoid 
using unparliamentary language. There is a lot of laxness in the 
content of the hon. member's speech; I hope there will not be as 
much in his vocabulary.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I too heard language that came very 
close to being unparliamentary. I would ask all hon. members to 
respect the rules.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> I will go on, after being interrupted by a Bloc 
member. Another Bloc member claimed today in a speech, and 
again this was not what actually happened, that it was because of 
certain federalists here in Ottawa, and only because of them, he 
said, that the War Measures Act was invoked during the October 
crisis.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	I have here some excerpts from a letter I would like to quote to 
relate certain facts: ``Under the circumstances, on behalf of the 
Government of Quebec, I request that emergency powers be 
provided as soon as possible so that more effective steps may be 
taken. I request particularly that such powers encompass the 
authority to apprehend and keep in custody individuals who, the 
Attorney General of Quebec has valid reasons to believe, are 
determined to overthrow the government through violence and 
illegal means''. And it goes on.
<P>
	I read further on: ``The chief of the Montreal Police has 
informed us that the means available to him are proving 
inadequate and that the assistance of higher levels of 
government has become essential for the protection of society'', 
etc.
<P>
	Of course, I was reading from a letter the Quebec government 
of the day wrote to the Canadian government at the request of 
the Montreal chief of police. I do not mean here to defend or 
criticize the War Measures Act, but I want to tell members 
opposite that when they talk about the War Measures Act, they 
should tell the whole story instead of hiding half the truth the 
way they so often do.
<P>
	Earlier today, we heard members across the way say they 
reject this bill even if they unanimously endorsed it in 
committee. They changed their mind along the way because one 
of them saw fit to move this motion to ensure Quebec will never 
have less than 25 per cent of seats in the Commons. Those same 
members opposite keep whining, like one of them is doing now 
while I am speaking. They tend to forget that they opposed the 
Charlottetown accord that gave that kind of assurance.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> It was rejected 
everywhere.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> It is not true. I am sorry but in French-speaking 
areas outside Quebec, in my own riding, 70 per cent of my 
constituents supported the accord. The hon. member across the 
way says it was rejected everywhere, but it is not true. 
Obviously, the accord did not pass, though. But when I hear 
Reform members demanding an elected Senate, something they 
rejected in the Charlottetown accord, and when I hear Bloc 
members demanding 25 per cent of the seats, something they 
refused in that same accord, I am entitled to question their 
sincerity.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Some people across the way are remembering the truth in a 
selective manner. They are indeed remembering the truth in 
ways that pleases them.
<P>
	I for one am in favour of this bill. It is not to change the 
Constitution. It is nothing of the sort. It is just to modernize our 
electoral laws. Let us do it now. If we do not pass this bill, those 
same people across the way are going to accuse us in very short 
order that we did not  proceed with the bill and redistribution 
could not take place on time.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11635"> 11635 </A></B>
<P>
	I will say to them at that particular time, they know everything 
has to be installed by June; otherwise it will not proceed. I have 
here the timetable for the boundaries readjustment in front of 
me. Unless this bill clears the House by the end of June, unless 
Royal Assent is given by June 22, this whole thing will not be 
possible.
<P>
	I say to the members across the way, shame on them for 
having deliberately held this piece of legislation to give better, 
more effective representation to all Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Tremblay (Rosemont, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, a little 
while ago, I heard the member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell read a letter concerning the 
October crisis. He did not read it all and did not say who wrote it. 
We know that it can only have been signed by the Premier of 
Quebec at the time, Robert Bourassa. I am very sad to hear the 
member recall these events as if they were something Canada 
and the Canadian Parliament should be proud of.
<P>
	I believe that everything that has come out regarding the 
Cabinet discussions at the time clearly shows that if ever there 
was a dark time in Canada's recent history, it was then. I can 
assure him that now that we have a Premier with a backbone in 
Quebec, we will not see such a letter in the months to come.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I always like to hear the hon. 
member speak about the head office and his leader in Quebec, 
the head of the provincial government, whom he praises and 
says he has guts, courage, etc.
<P>
	I ask my colleagues to ponder over these few questions. Is that 
the same leader as the one who refuses to hold a referendum 
because he knows he will lose? Is that the provincial leader who 
postpones the referendum until next fall? Is that the leader who 
broke the formal promise he made to Quebecers during the 
election campaign? Is it another person? It must be. It certainly 
cannot be the same one.
<P>
	I know the hon. member from the other side is only a member 
of a local branch of the Parti Quebecois, the one they call the 
Bloc, and that the head office is far away. But I would suggest he 
makes a conference call to talk to other representatives of the 
head office. And when he gets his information from that head 
office, he will find out something we all know already, that is, 
the Parti Quebecois does not have the courage to call the 
referendum immediately. They say they must wait because 
people are not ready, but in fact it is because they do not want to 
lose.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there were several things in the speech of the  hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell that I agreed with and a few that I 
did not agree with. He said one thing, perhaps inadvertently, and 
I would like to give him a chance to elaborate on a particular 
comment he made that if we do not pass this bill we will not have 
a redistribution before the next election.
<P>
	Is it not in fact the case that the present electoral boundary 
redistribution process is under suspension and if we do not pass 
this bill we simply resume with the process as it is virtually now 
completed and could be completed fairly quickly? Is that not a 
more realistic option than restarting the process all over again at 
the cost of some $5 million to $6 million?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, that is an interesting question. 
This same electoral redistribution that he refers to, the bill we 
have put under suspension in order to get this better one, would 
not have the measure of providing quinquennial redistribution 
to increase the number of seats in British Columbia, which some 
of his colleagues have said was under-represented by not 
proceeding with a bill like this. This is the same party that 
advocates both positions.
<P>
	I say to the hon. member, he may be from the next province 
over, but he should discuss this issue with his friends from B.C. 
if he wants to go back to the bill that is under suspension as 
opposed to Bill C-69. Bill C-69 is far better in terms of 
providing more even redistributions in a quicker way and that 
are fairer to all Canadians. Surely he knows that, but if he does 
not, the people of British Columbia-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Resuming debate. The hon. member 
for Mercier.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of 
all I want to say that we have just heard a prime example of 
contempt for the Quebec people as they are known now, after 
having been for a long time the French Canadian nation.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	In this Parliament and the previous one, if other members had 
respected the people of Quebec, Quebec's history would have 
been different, and I would like to talk about that, because after 
all, we will have to live together in any case as neighbours.
<P>
	I may recall that Daniel Johnson senior was descended from 
Irish immigrants who spoke no French. In 1965, he gave his 
party a fresh start with his book, published under the title 
<I>Égalité ou Indépendance</I>, which became the slogan for his 
convention and his election campaign.
<P>
	Daniel Johnson wrote the following: ``Our English Canadian 
compatriots refer to a nation consisting of two peoples, while 
according to our French concept of the Canadian fact, we say 
there one people consisting of two nations. The confusion arises 
from the fact that English puts more emphasis on the political 
connotation of the word, while French uses the word in its 
sociological  context. If we go by the description I just gave, 
there is no doubt Canada has two nations. Canada has two 
communities that are distinct by reason of their language, 
religion, culture, traditions, history and finally, a common 
desire to live together. Even in provinces where they are a 
minority, they have a natural tendency to regroup on a regional 
or local basis so as to create an environment in which they can 
flourish''. As Daniel Johnson said in 1965: ``The fundamental 
<P>

<B><A NAME="11636"> 11636 </A></B>
<P>
characteristic of a nation is not race but culture. Whatever one's 
name or ethnic origin, one belongs to one of the two nations 
depending on whether one's roots, education, choices, lifestyle, 
and philosophy lead one to identify with one cultural 
community rather than another. And I am thinking'', he said, 
``of all the new Canadians who chose to become a part of French 
Canadian culture and to contribute to its development and 
growth''.
<P>
	He goes on to say that ``the French Canadian nation is trying 
with all its might and with every fibre of its being to realize its 
potential as a nation and that its aspirations are entirely normal 
and legitimate. Later on I will explain how and why French 
Canadians try to identify with the State of Quebec, the only one 
where they can claim to be masters of their own destiny and 
where they can develop the full potential of their community, 
while the English Canadian nation tends to make Ottawa the 
centre of its community life''.
<P>
	If Canada had recognized the French Canadian nation, we 
would not be where we are today. And we are there because after 
being denied equality, the French Canadian nation became the 
Quebec nation and now seeks its sovereignty, as Daniel Johnson 
explains here.
<P>
	I have very little time, Mr. Speaker, but I will go on. However, 
in this vote on the position of the Bloc Quebecois, Canada and 
the Liberals could have shown a minimum of respect for this 
people, this nation with whom, in any case, they will have to find 
a <I>modus vivendi</I>, as neighbours or otherwise.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The hon. member for 
Mercier will have 15 minutes, next time.
<P>
	It being 5.30 p.m., the House will now proceed to 
consideration of Private Members' Business as indicated on 
today's Order Paper.

	The matter is that this is simply a motion that was addressed 
by a committee of this House. To say that refusing this is 
somehow the fault of the government as opposed to the 
committee that unanimously did so is simply and factually 
incorrect.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> With respect, I do not think that is a 
point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, over the next 
hour this House will have the opportunity to discuss what some 
members will see as a politically incorrect motion.
<P>
	I made the decision to prepare this motion after receiving 
complaints from constituents that they may have missed out on 
being selected for taxpayer-funded training or job creation 
programs solely because they did not fit into a designated target 
group on an application form.
<P>
	It is appalling that the government of a democratic country 
has a policy condoning the selection of workers or trainees 
based on their gender or ethnic origins. It makes the government 
guilty of promoting sexism and racism, and it is particularly bad 
policy when there simply is no statistical evidence to support the 
claimed need for employment equity programs.
<P>
	For example, figures from Statistics Canada indicate that the 
unemployment rate for young males ranges between 20 per cent 
and 23 per cent, while the unemployment rate for young females 
ranges from 14 per cent to 15 per cent. While both figures are far 
too high, clearly it is the young men who are the disadvantaged 
group. Their unemployment rate is consistently twice the 
national average, and it probably is contributing to their higher 
suicide rate and an increase in youth crime.
<P>
	Some interesting material comes from a research paper by Dr. 
John T. Samuel of Carleton University, which cites statistics 
from the 1986 census, showing that 72.1  per cent of visible 
minorities over 15 years of age are in the workforce while only 
66.5 per cent of the general population over 15 is in the 
workforce. The same census shows that the average personal 
income is $17,500 for the general population and almost $1,500 
more for visible minorities. The REAL Women organization has 
also confirmed these figures in their own investigation of the 
representation of visible minorities and women in the Canadian 
workforce.
<P>
	Well-meaning people are chasing ghosts, because there is no 
evidence that employment equity programs are needed. This is 
not to say that every employer out there is a saint. But the best 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11637"> 11637 </A></B>
<P>
way to handle individual cases where there is improper 
treatment of employees is for those cases to be dealt with in the 
courts and the employers properly punished.
<P>
	Unfortunately, government-enforced provisions start with 
the assumption that all employers are guilty, even though 1993 
Nobel laureate and economist Gary Becker notes that 
discrimination poses internal as well as external costs on a 
company. In other words, discriminatory employment decisions 
cost firms money. If they do not select the best person for the 
job, that translates directly to a drop in productivity and a drop 
in the bottom line. Since the overriding objective of a company 
is to make money, discrimination will be short-lived and the 
marketplace will police discrimination. This theory is borne out 
by the statistics I have already given and the ones that will 
follow in the rest of this speech.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	In terms of public support for employment equity, a 
December 1993 Gallup poll showed 74 per cent of Canadians to 
be opposed to such programs. This high percentage is not a 
surprise to me because to this day I have never met a person who 
wanted to get a job or be promoted on the basis of their gender or 
their race rather than the skills or merits they have brought to the 
job.
<P>
	Sadly, this government, as usual, is not the slightest bit 
interested in what the majority of Canadians think and is bound 
and determined to stick to an agenda of social engineering that 
will unfortunately have the opposite effect to that which is 
intended.
<P>
	I correspond on a regular basis with a young lady in 
Vancouver named Kim Oliver. Kim has a disability called 
Fragile X Syndrome. Despite having this disability, Kim has a 
great sense of humour, she has great ambition and quite an 
artistic flair. Kim has indicated in her letters that she wants 
exactly what any other young person wants. She wants to be able 
to support herself through the skills that she can bring to the 
workplace.
<P>
	I would like to read from one of Kim's letters. I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The United Farm Women of the 20's and 30's were western women who 
withstood the hardships of life on the farm alongside their husbands. They 
were responsible for lobbying for the vote, universal social programs, and 
pensions for widows and orphans. They also helped their men form unions 
and collectives. I  identify with these women because, unlike today's 
feminists, they took matters into their own hands, using printing presses to 
spread the word via a women's newspaper, travelling to the Geneva 
Convention in the 40's and most impressive of all-got men to let us vote! 
Unlike NAC, Vancouver Status of Women and other special-interest groups, 
the UFW didn't have the media nor did they have millions in government 
funding-So why keep funding ethnic groups or women's groups? All they do 
is tell women, especially poor `visible' minority women with disabilities, that 
we are the victims of racism, sexism, white male imperialism-and that we 
will never be equally paid, heard, educated because of men and men's cultural 
symbols. Makes you want to scream, doesn't it?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Kim identifies with people who had to work hard for what 
they achieved. She also makes it clear that she does not want to 
be treated like a victim by special interest groups.
<P>
	Kim also writes that she has found that members of the 
Reform Party treat her like a fellow Canadian instead of putting 
her into a box labelled ``disabled'' or ``disadvantaged''.
<P>
	I wish I could hold up some of Kim's drawings to show to the 
House her artistic flair, but unfortunately we cannot use props in 
the House, so I would ask members to believe me when I say 
they are very good. I think Kim will eventually find a place in 
the workforce to utilize her artistic skills. I know she wants to 
achieve that not through employment equity but through her 
own hard work.
<P>
	This should not be interpreted as meaning that the disabled do 
not need any assistance to gain skills or that the government 
should not be involved in helping them gain access to the 
workplace. However, it does mean that we should not insult their 
intelligence and their abilities by artificially pushing them to the 
front of the line for employment. Like everyone else, they just 
want the chance to prove their worth and their true value through 
open and unbiased job interviews.
<P>
	Obviously, there are fewer opportunities in the job market for 
someone with Fragile X Syndrome, and that is where every one 
of us as caring Canadians can help. We must be aware of the 
problems and we have to do what we can to support them. For 
Kim, I would like other members of this House to give me some 
examples, or perhaps the public who become aware of this 
debate, of where there have been successes in Canada achieved 
by people with Fragile X Syndrome. What sort of jobs have they 
managed to fill? How have things worked out for them? I hope 
they will write to me so I can pass these successes on to Kim, to 
give her even more encouragement for the future.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	In wrapping up, I would like to read one more piece from a 
letter she wrote to me last September:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We have a ministry responsible for women's equality, plus multiple 
feminists groups who are government-funded. As well, `visible' minorities 
and natives have just as much government attention.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>So why does the Ministry of Social Services and Human Resources still 
classify women, minorities and natives as disadvantaged?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	She also mentions:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Why is it that our social services and human resources departments have no 
`Ministry of the Disabled'? If we are to be Foster Children, couldn't the 
Provincial/Federal governments acknowledge our special needs?''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I know that Kim is not alone in feeling this way. She 
represents a very large group of thoughtful people with 
disabilities who really feel that the government is not 
representing their needs.
<P>
	In their well-meaning attempts to promote the equality of 
opportunity that we all support, the government is actually 
fostering legislative racism and pitting identifiable groups 
against one another.
<P>
	In their pursuit of social engineering they are inadvertently 
sowing the seeds of racial conflict by forcing employers to 
emphasize differences in race and gender instead of the 
differences in skills and suitability that should be the basis for 
employment.
<P>
	I have here a letter and a questionnaire from the Chief of 
Defence Staff to all regular force and primary reserve members, 
announcing a survey of Canadian forces to identify the 
representation of aboriginals and visible minorities.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11638"> 11638 </A></B>
<P>
	Is it not racist to be carrying out a survey specifically 
designed to identify persons by race? Is it really appropriate for 
a government to have a database identifying its employees by 
racial background?
<P>
	Respondents have to identify themselves as black, Chinese, 
Filipino, Japanese, Korean, South Asian, East Indian, Southeast 
Asian, non-white Latin American, non-white West Asian, Inuit, 
Métis, First Nation, or mixed race and colour.
<P>
	If anyone except this Liberal government had asked for such a 
survey, they would be labelled as racist and accused of planning 
some sort of racial persecution. As it happens, all available 
statistics indicate that young Caucasian men are the ones who 
are in the disadvantaged group.
<P>
	When we take a look at the employee make-up of several 
prominent groups that promote employment equity, we find 
some very disturbing situations. The Ontario government's 
office of employment equity in 1994 had a workforce made up of 
90.5 per cent women, 52.9 per cent racial minorities, 5.6 per 
cent aboriginals, and zero able-bodied white males.
<P>
	The workforce of the Ontario Rights Commission is 67 per 
cent women, 38 per cent minorities, even though these 
minorities represent just 9 per cent of the general population; 
there are no white males in the senior management group or the 
policy branch of this commission.
<P>
	In an article she wrote for the August 26, 1994 edition of <I>The 
Toronto Sun</I>, Christie Blatchford said: ``It is quite clear that if 
the commission is a glimpse of the future for Ontario under 
employment equity, the face of the future is female and 
non-white''.
<P>
	The Employment Excellence Organization asks whether the 
only difference between the racist agendas of the Heritage Front 
and the Ontario Rights Commission is that the latter is funded 
with taxpayers' money. That is a pretty extreme statement, but 
that is the sort of thing these employment equity provisions are 
making people say.
<P>
	The government does not want to hear these things because 
their entire argument is based on emotion rather than facts. The 
fact is that one cannot fix discrimination by imposing a different 
type of discrimination.
<P>
	The Sri Lankan-born author and economist of a 1992 report 
from the Economic Council, Arnold deSilva, found no 
correlation between wage levels and a person's country of 
origin. He also concluded that there is no significant 
discrimination against immigrants in general and that there is no 
systematic employment discrimination on the basis of colour.
<P>
	Another study done for the Government of Canada in 1992 by 
Daniel Boothby involving a sample size of 115,000 people and 
entitled ``Job Changes, Wage Changes and Employment Equity 
Groups'', concluded that: ``Visible minority status had no 
significant effect on the probability of job loss and, all else 
being equal, women are less likely to lose jobs than men''.
<P>
<B>(1745 ) </B>
<P>
	In 1992 Statistics Canada reported that 56 per cent of all 
undergraduate degrees earned at Canadian universities go to 
women. In 1990 they took 45 per cent of the degrees in 
traditional male territories of business management and 
commerce. They accounted for 47 per cent of the law degrees, 
46 per cent of medical diplomas and 63 per cent of those in 
veterinary medicine. Fazil Mihlar, a senior policy analyst with 
the Fraser Institute says that evidence of discrimination in the 
workplace is scant and isolated.
<P>
	In my riding of North Vancouver I have been unable to 
confirm a single case, even though each time someone has called 
or written to me in support of employment equity, I have asked 
for any specific example of discrimination in North Vancouver 
so that I could make that situation public.
<P>
	I challenge other members of the House to do the same before 
they support the ongoing use of employment equity programs or 
the inclusion of those requirements on government employment 
and training forms.
<P>
	Bell Canada falls under the Federal Employment Equity Act 
of 1986. In 1989 Bell Canada had 61 more female employees 
than males. On a numbers basis that is pretty well balanced. Just 
two years later there were 2,058 more females than males 
employed by Bell Canada and the number of males employed 
had dropped by almost 2,000. No one could possibly argue that 
women are not adequately represented at Bell Canada but the 
trend in male employment with that company should be a cause 
for grave concern for believers in forced employment equity. 
They had better start insisting that Bell Canada place a special 
category on employment forms for the under-represented 
group, in this case males.
<P>
	While I am talking about job loss I should mention that a 
number of my constituents have been asking me whether there 
will be affirmative action firing practices during the downsizing 
of the civil service announced in the budget. Will this whole 
exercise end up distorting the civil service employee base with 
enforced equity quotas that fail to recognize individual skill 
levels and the value to the taxpayers that are picking up the cost?
<P>
	I already receive complaints from constituents who say that 
some employees at the front counters and on the phones at 
federal government departments hardly speak English and 
cannot be understood. Some of the members opposite will not 
like hearing that message but I have an obligation to pass on the 
concerns of my constituents to the House.
<P>
	The federal government in the United States is considering 
the introduction of legislation to end affirmative action and an 
initiative has been started in California to place affirmative 
action on the ballot at the next election.
<P>
	Polls indicate that affirmative action is going down to defeat 
in the United States in the interest of a fair and open 
marketplace. As one man put it on an interview on  CNN, 
employment equity is a bit like the Vietnam war. It seemed like a 
good idea when we started it, but it turned into a nightmare.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11639"> 11639 </A></B>
<P>
	Sadly, the government is still living in the past, trying to enact 
an agenda that is 20 years out of date, well-meaning and 
soft-hearted, but definitely soft-headed at the same time. On 
top of that it discriminates against skilled people who cannot 
label themselves as a visible minority.
<P>
	I wonder how many Liberal members would be prepared to 
step down from their seats today, right now, so that a member of 
a visible minority could step into their place. I see no volunteers, 
no doubt because each of them would take the position that he or 
she has earned the right to be here. Why should they give up 
their seat to someone else who has not been through the election 
process? That is exactly what it is like in the real world job 
marketplace too.
<P>
	People all across Canada oppose employment equity 
programs and every MP on the government side should admit 
that the programs are unfair and discriminatory. At the very 
least, they should admit that they would not like to see such 
programs applied to their own MP jobs. They should also agree 
to put an end to discrimination by refusing, as I do, to approve 
any grants or job creation programs which make employment 
equity a condition of the project.
<P>
	Finally they should show courage and give their constituents 
true representation in the House by voting against any future 
employment equity bill.
<P>
<B>(1750 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome the chance to debate 
this motion. I want to say this loudly for the Canadian public. I 
am sure those who are watching the debate today or who will be 
reading <I>Hansard</I> will mourn the occasion this member stood in 
the House to ask the government to immediately end 
employment equity programs and the inclusion of employment 
equity requirements on employment or training forms because 
such requirements encourage candidate selection, et cetera.
<P>
	What a sad opportunity it is to stand in the House to debunk 
some of the myths we heard a few minutes ago. The public 
record presents a completely different picture. It suggests hiring 
practices have very little to do with ability but a lot to do with 
discriminatory attitudes toward women, visible minorities, 
aboriginal people and people with disabilities.
<P>
	I frankly believe the focus of the debate is on the wrong side. 
Rather than questioning why we need the employment equity we 
should be asking: Why do visible minorities, women, aboriginal 
people and persons with disabilities experience significantly 
higher rates of unemployment, sometimes twice the national 
level, even when they prove themselves to be eminently 
qualified for jobs? That is the question.
<P>
	Documents and research tell us these individuals are 
frequently better educated and trained at proportionately higher 
levels than the general population to take on work opportunities. 
In addition to their advanced university degrees, they often 
come equipped with special knowledge or personal attributes 
that can also contribute to the job.
<P>
	Let us look at it from a strictly pragmatic, business 
perspective. Visible minority members, for example, may be 
immigrants from other parts of the world. They bring with them 
firsthand knowledge of foreign market conditions which may be 
invaluable to Canadian exporters.
<P>
	We heard quite a few businesses cited and we heard some 
misinformation given in terms of statistics. Women who make 
up more than half the population know better than anyone the 
needs of Canadian consumers, their families and themselves. 
Aboriginal people have a wealth of experience in traditional 
approaches to a multitude of disciplines, from the earth sciences 
to holistic healing to dispute resolution. With advanced 
education they are well positioned to marry traditions with the 
best of the contemporary economy.
<P>
	Who better than persons with disabilities to offer insights into 
the specialized needs of people who are physically or 
intellectually challenged, one of the growth markets of the next 
century.
<P>
	The member across the way threw out a case study. In that 
diatribe we were subjected to, the member mixed so many things 
together, the apples and the oranges and the myths. Too many 
employers continue to erect barriers to employment of these 
talented, work-ready people.
<P>
	We can take statistics from Max Yalden, the Canadian human 
rights commissioner. He has publicly stated his concern about a 
growing mean-spirited attitude in Canada. He has warned of a 
backlash against members of society's most vulnerable groups 
by critics that claim they enjoy special workplace and hiring 
advantages. The statistics clearly show nothing could be further 
from the truth.
<P>
	Mr. Yalden noted that while white male Canadians make up 
just 45 per cent of the workforce, they account for 55 per cent of 
all hirings. Men constitute nearly 95 per cent of corporate board 
members and more than 90 per cent of senior managers. They 
also earn an average of 20 per cent more than female workers. A 
study was recently done and published in the local media.
<P>
	A study recently completed by Statistics Canada also 
concluded systemic discrimination explains much of that wage 
gap. Many women consider themselves lucky just to be hired. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11640"> 11640 </A></B>
<P>
Women's share of all hiring declined from 1988 to 1992 and has 
improved only slightly since then.
<P>
<B>(1755 ) </B>
<P>
	Women are frequently members of more than one designated 
group, what we call the double disadvantaged and maybe in my 
case triple disadvantaged. Imagine how much more difficult it is 
for women to compete who are aboriginal, a visible minority or 
someone with a disability. People in these groups are 
particularly subject to prejudice in hiring.
<P>
	Bias is the only apparent explanation for the fact that the 
unemployment rate among visible minorities, aboriginal people 
and people with disabilities with university degrees is much 
higher than for white males with the same education. In fact, it 
can be more than double.
<P>
	Reports submitted by employers under the Employment 
Equity Act show some worrisome trends in the hiring rates of 
individuals in designated groups. The same reports show that 
the situation for persons with disabilities is even worse. I can go 
on and cite other instances, but I ask the House if these figures 
suggest that members of designated groups enjoy preferential 
treatment? The answer is self-evident.
<P>
	The hon. member cited the fact that in his riding he could not 
find one individual who was subjected to inequity. I would 
remind the hon. member that the Employment Equity Act is 
designed to ensure that an employer's hiring and promotion 
decisions are based solely on the bona fide requirements of an 
occupation and not on any other job related criteria.
<P>
	The Employment Equity Act ensures that only qualified 
individuals be considered for a job, but most important it 
requires employers to remove barriers to employment for 
capable candidates who are members of the designated groups 
so we can turn these unacceptable unemployment figures 
around, which is only fair.
<P>
	The Canadian human rights commissioner, Mr. Yalden, has 
reason to be concerned. The anachronistic thinking associated 
with this motion certainly will do nothing to advance us toward 
our goal of preparing Canada for the global economy of the 21st 
century.
<P>
	It ignores the reality that we will soon experience a severe 
skills shortage in the country that will demand that we put every 
capable Canadian to work. It disregards the fact that two-thirds 
of new entrants to the labour market will be members of the 
designated group by the year 2000, a large percentage of whom 
are more than qualified to meet the challenge. It overlooks the 
importance of capitalizing on these people's diversities in an 
increasingly specialized, interconnected and international 
economy.
<P>
	It is lucky for us that this is not a votable motion because it 
would have been voted down by members on this side of the 
House. The motion could have had the opportunity to, if, heaven 
forbid, there was an opportunity for it to be a votable motion, 
condone racism, sexism and other forms of discrimination, all 
of which we know exist in the workplace. It would permit  
prejudice to go unchecked and may even encourage outright acts 
of physical or sexual harassment of the most vulnerable.
<P>
	The Employment Equity Act is not about counting numbers as 
the member would have us believe. It is about instituting 
irritating rules and regulations that somehow stand in the way of 
individuals in this society from being contributing members and 
full participants in Canadian society.
<P>
	I ask every member of the House to stand firm the 
Employment Equity Act.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am both disappointed and disturbed that today 
members are asked to consider a motion which seems to be 
totally removed from reality and that, with all due respect for its 
author, appears to be based on a completely erroneous 
interpretation of the Employment Equity Act.
<P>
	I would like to point out that the hon. member seems to 
associate the existence of the Employment Equity act with a 
tendency on the part of some employers to hire incompetent 
people. To make this kind of connection encourages prejudice 
and is entirely absurd.
<P>
	Before going any further, I would like to recall for the benefit 
of our listeners and of our colleagues in this House that the sole 
purpose of the Employment Equity Act, which has existed since 
1986, is to ensure that our labour force is more representative of 
Quebec and Canadian society.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	To achieve this, we ask employers to try, as part of their hiring 
practices, to include four so-called designated groups, namely 
women, aboriginal people, visible minorities and disabled 
people, in view of the fact that in the labour market, people do 
not all have the same opportunities, and there are people who are 
discriminated against and who have trouble getting the jobs for 
which they are qualified. To think that because we have an 
Employment Equity Act like the one we have had since 1990 and 
which we are in the process of reviewing, there is some 
connection between the existence of this Act and the practice of 
some employers to hire incompetent people, is patently absurd.
<P>
	I may recall that section 6 of the old and the new Employment 
Equity Act clearly says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>the obligation to implement employment equity does not require an 
employer</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>a</I>) to take a particular measure to implement employment equity where the 
taking of that measure would cause undue hardship to the employer;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>b</I>) to hire or promote unqualified persons.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11641"> 11641 </A></B>
<P>
That is made very clear in the Act.
<P>
	We believe it is important to have an Employment Equity Act 
because we know perfectly well that the labour market alone is 
not likely to provide this equality between various groups. My 
proof is our colleague for North Vancouver, who began his 
remarks by saying that legislation on employment equity was no 
longer necessary. Let us have a look at the comments of groups 
that have studied the legislation, specifically, the Canadian 
Human Rights Commission. It is almost dishonest to say that 
Whites are victims of reverse discrimination. This prejudice 
must be stopped, fought from the start.
<P>
	I sit on the Standing Committee on Human Rights, and, since 
January, we have been trying to improve the Employment 
Equity Act, as we realize there are gaps in it. Let us remember 
what Commissioner Max Yalden, who is as critical as a person 
can be before the government, said. As you know, he is well 
versed in the workings of government, having been in 
government since 1956, even before I was born. He said that, in 
1993, able bodied caucasian males accounted for approximately 
55 per cent of all workers newly hired for permanent full time 
positions by employers covered under federal legislation on 
employment equity. This is significantly higher than the 
proportion of able bodied Whites on the labour market; the 
figure in this case is 45 per cent.
<P>
	So, people who try to convince us that Whites without 
disabilities are discriminated against are not aware of the 
statistics or of the reality of the labour market.
<P>
	The Employment Equity Act says that some people are 
systematically discriminated against. That means that, if 
corrective measures are not taken, some groups will continue to 
receive unequal treatment. What form does this inequality take? 
It works by forming the five following groups: groups with 
higher than average rates of unemployment; groups with lower 
than average incomes; groups which are over-represented in 
lower paying professions and groups with less opportunity for 
advancement.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	This is particularly true, as we will see, for aboriginal people 
and handicapped people. Lastly, there are also groups which are 
under-represented in higher paying professions, with good job 
prospects and which are in expansion. That is the general picture 
of discrimination that the designated categories face, groups 
like handicapped people, aboriginal people, members of visible 
minorities and women.
<P>
	Let us take a look to see whether discrimination against these 
groups has really ceased over the last few months, as the hon. 
member claims. Let us look at each category. Women make up 
52 per cent of the population of Canada, but in 1993-that is not 
very long ago-they accounted for only 45 per cent of the 
Canadian labour force. Last year, women continued to be paid 
about one third less than their male counterparts. This means 
that,  in the labour market of 1993, a woman doing a job of equal 
value, for which she was equally qualified, earned two thirds of 
what a man earned to do the same job. If that is not 
discrimination, I wonder what the hon. member for North 
Vancouver calls it.
<P>
	Second, 52 per cent of the time, women, who, as we know, 
make up 52 per cent of the population of Canada and 45 per cent 
of the Canadian labour force, end up in jobs in the lower service 
echelons, as office clerks or secretaries, jobs which are naturally 
lower paid.
<P>
	It should also be pointed out about career women with a 
university degree that 18 per cent of White females who 
graduated in commerce, business administration or industrial 
management and were hired in the past few months were 
assigned positions below their professional qualifications. That 
is 18 per cent of women university graduates whose positions 
are below their professional qualifications, as compared to only 
5 per cent of men, according to Statistics Canada.
<P>
	I think it is to refuse to recognize the reality of the target 
groups, i.e. the female population, to think and to tell us that 
labour market equilibrium has been reached and that we no 
longer need an act like the Employment Equity Act.
<P>
	Another situation is that of the aboriginal people. The 
Employment Equity Committee heard many witnesses on that 
issue. Our friend from the Reform Party certainly did not 
mention it, and I am sure you will be very surprised to learn 
about this, but the native people represent 3.8 per cent of the 
total population of Canada. Up until now however, they have 
succeeded in getting only 1.4 per cent of all the jobs available to 
the workforce. These are recent data and they show clearly that, 
not only do native people have a hard time entering the labour 
market, but their unemployment rate is exactly twice as high as 
the national average.
<P>
	These data also show, Mr. Speaker, that the income of native 
people is $10,000 below that of other Canadians. I will conclude 
by saying that these examples of discrimination are still very 
much current and that Parliament must pass a legislation as this 
one on employment equity to promote a better balance within 
the Canadian labour force.

	<B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is my pleasure to address this House regarding 
Motion No. M-372 proposed by the hon. member for North 
Vancouver. This motion advocates that employment equity 
programs and the inclusion of employment equity requirements 
on employment or training forms be terminated.

<P>
	In the recent past a backlash has occurred against employment 
equity. This is unfortunate because the principle behind 
employment equity is a noble and valid one. It aims to correct 
discrimination, both intentional and systemic, directed toward 
designated groups, in other words, persons with disabilities, 
aboriginal people, visible minorities and women.
<P>
	Critics of employment equity charge that it is reverse 
discrimination against white males. They argue that it lowers 
standards and promotes mediocrity. This is clearly a simplistic 
and unfair assessment of employment equity.
<P>
	This is not to say that employment equity programs are 
perfect and are not in need of some refinement and fine tuning. 
Presently there are some potential negative consequences which 
may result from employment equity policies. These concerns 
need to be taken into account and addressed.
<P>
	An example is the instilling of deep resentment among 
non-designated groups. Another one is the decrease of the 
workplace morale for employees from non-designated groups 
when the mistaken belief occurs that designated groups receive 
preferential treatment for promotions.
<P>
	The above are some factors which need to be overcome in 
order to ensure that employment equity is implemented in an 
equitable and fair manner. It is very clear that in order to correct 
these backlashes more public education and workforce 
education programs are absolutely essential. Also, we should 
attempt to implement enrichment programs for disadvantaged 
persons from designated groups at all levels of formal education 
so that they may obtain the tools to become more competitive.
<P>
	When implementing an employment equity plan, we need to 
keep in mind that the existing workforce did not create the 
discrimination that employment equity is attempting to 
eliminate. If the rights of the existing workforce are respected, 
one can avoid resentment upon the implementation of an 
employment equity policy.
<P>
	An alternative solution which could be employed to fine tune 
employment equity would involve instituting a program that 
would be representative of how qualified persons from 
designated groups are distributed in the local labour market.
<P>
	For example, if 5 per cent of the country consists of persons 
with disabilities and only 1 per cent of a local community 
consists of disabled people with engineering degrees, it is clear 
that only 1 per cent of the workforce in a local engineering 
company should consist of disabled engineers. Certainly, it 
would not be fair to non-designated groups if 5 per cent of the 
engineering company's workforce included disabled persons 
drawn from other communities, unless of course the very best 
people were available in this specific group 5 per cent of the 
time during hiring.
<P>
	By keeping the above in mind, it could be ensured that local 
communities are not prejudiced, that the most qualified are 
always chosen and that discriminatory hiring practices are 
eliminated.
<P>
	Despite some very minor fine tuning, the evidence clearly 
indicates that employment equity is beneficial to both 
employers and Canadian workers. Studies have demonstrated 
that substantial gains have been made by members of the 
designated groups since the introduction of the federal 
Employment Equity Act. We will continue to work toward full 
employment parity for these groups.
<P>
	The intent of the act is not to provide preferential treatment. It 
is designed to ensure equal access to opportunities for all 
qualified work ready Canadians, regardless of their race, 
physical attributes or gender. It is about removing, not erecting, 
barriers to employment.
<P>
	The act was not developed overnight. It was a product of a 
comprehensive review of the Canadian workplace in 1984 by the 
Royal Commission on Equality in Employment headed by Judge 
Rosalie Abella. In the course of its review the commission 
looked closely at affirmative action programs in the United 
States. Canadian commissioners wanted to learn from the 
American experience in order to avoid some of the problems 
associated with that legislation.
<P>
	Judge Abella quite correctly concluded that Canadians would 
resist the American approach, given its overly interventionist 
government policies and the imposition of quotas. She 
recommended instead that Canadians adopt the employment 
equity model which focuses on the elimination of 
discriminatory employment barriers.
<P>
<B>(1815 ) </B>
<P>
	In the United States, affirmative action targets particular 
groups for special treatment because of a previous history of 
discrimination. Employment equity, on the other hand, attempts 
to ensure in Canada that all qualified job applicants receive a 
fair shot at available jobs. The employment equity program in 
the United States, and rightly so, is to be destroyed simply 
because it is a destructive model, a model that has been 
introduced based on a former model that was introduced 
regarding the discrimination of certain classes of people, a 
model of desegregation that tore the very fabric of American 
society, a model that destroyed community after community, all 
because of a quota system.
<P>
	Our approach to achieve equality is far more progressive than 
the American model. It has led to greater partnerships among 
groups pursuing fair access to employment opportunities and 
has also led to far greater success.
<P>
	For example, often workers, union leaders and employers will 
work together in unison to establish a fair equity plan. In this 
way, employment equity works as much to the advantage of 
employers as it does for the members of the designated groups.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11643"> 11643 </A></B>
<P>
	Organizations that take advantage of and capitalize upon the 
rich composition of Canadian society will come out ahead. 
Organizations that are able to manage a diverse and dynamic 
workforce are bound to be more competitive in today's 
marketplace. Given demographic trends we cannot afford to 
overlook any under-utilized source of talent.
<P>
	By the year 2000, the very time when we will experience a 
severe skill shortage because of an aging workforce, two-thirds 
of the entrants to the Canadian labour market will be women, 
visible minorities, aboriginal peoples, and persons with 
disabilities. This is the face of the future workforce and we must 
integrate them, whether the Reform Party likes it or not.
<P>
	In conclusion, I do not believe that government should base 
their policies on the media coverage of the backlash against 
employment equity. In reality there are no losers under Canada's 
employment equity legislation. There are only winners when 
each and every citizen is given a fair chance for employment and 
then given equal opportunity to advance within the organization.
<P>
	Ensuring that qualified minorities are not discriminated 
against is a worthwhile and noble goal. As a nation of caring, 
compassionate people dedicated to dignity and justice, we are 
determined to build a country where all Canadians can take 
pride in employment and their contribution to the community.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure indeed today to rise to speak on the motion presented 
by my colleague from North Vancouver. I would like to 
congratulate my colleague for his speech, which outlined the 
purpose of his motion.
<P>
	The motion deals with a sensitive issue, the practice of 
employment equity. I am pleased to have seconded the motion 
and to support the motion, which calls for the immediate end to 
employment equity programs and the end to the inclusion of 
employment equity requirements on employment or training 
forms. Such requirements encourage candidate selection to be 
made on the basis of sex or ethnic origin rather than merit and as 
a result foster a sense of resentment among applicants. The 
whole concept of employment equity is flawed. As my colleague 
pointed out, it advocates the hiring of individuals based on 
designations, not merit.
<P>
	The hon. member for Fraser Valley West also expressed it 
quite well. He said the concept of employment equity will 
subordinate the principle of merit to the politics of race and of 
gender. This is made clear by a number of factors, one being the 
sense of dissatisfaction with employment equity by those it 
claims to help.
<P>
	Members of targeted groups who supposedly benefit from 
employment equity face two difficult questions, the first from 
themselves. Were they chosen for the position they now hold 
because of the target group they belong to, or was their hiring 
based on merit? It is a question that is always there.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	Second, there is a question from their colleagues. Do the 
individuals they work with have doubts about whether they were 
hired based on the fact that they are a member of a visible 
minority or a member of a disadvantaged group, or did they truly 
deserve the position?
<P>
	This brings me to my second point. When people in a 
workplace really do not know why they or their colleagues were 
hired, whether it was based on merit or because of a specific 
category to which they belong, it fosters a sense of inequality 
and divisiveness among co-workers. This sense of inequality, as 
a result of astute hiring practices and quota filling, can lead to a 
split in the workplace because they create an atmosphere of 
distrust and doubt. This does not make for a productive or a 
happy workplace.
<P>
	I would like to tell a story that was told to me by a staff 
member of a member of Parliament on the Hill. She had a friend 
at university, a very bright individual and a member of a visible 
minority group, who often spoke out very strongly against 
employment equity programs. Many people questioned his 
position. They asked why he, one who could obviously benefit 
from such programs, was so vocally and so strongly against 
these programs. His reasons were that he did not know, and was 
afraid that he would not know, if he was hired based on his skills 
or his skin colour. His co-workers would not know either. This 
individual said he wanted to be judged solely on the basis of 
merit and on nothing else.
<P>
	Indeed, even hon. members opposite have expressed similar 
views and have shared similar stories. The hon. member for 
Waterloo stated in committee, with regard to the government's 
employment equity legislation, that an individual from his own 
riding did not want people to think he got his job based on 
preferential treatment. This constituent was also speaking out 
against employment equity.
<P>
	Looking at this concern from another point of view, from a 
point of view based on productivity in the workplace and from 
the employer's point of view, I would like to tell another story. 
This story was told to me personally by a gentleman who owns a 
fairly large business that he built from scratch in my 
constituency.
<P>
	This gentleman's company bid on government contracts on a 
fairly regular basis. He had been very successful in winning 
these contracts over the years. He was expressing a deep concern 
to me that his company was no longer eligible to bid on these 
contracts. The reason was that he did not have the proper quota 
allocations within his company. More than 50 per cent of his 
employees were women. He had always hired a considerable 
number of women because they could do the job best. He had 
some members from visible minority groups. But his company 
could not successfully keep enough employees from the 
aborigi-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="11644"> 11644 </A></B>
<P>
nal group to be able to bid on this contract. Because of this, this 
business  person was disqualified from bidding on these 
contracts. Any way one looks at that, it is discrimination.
<P>
	Why does the government then feel that we need employment 
equity? I guess its reason is to correct perceived injustices in the 
workplace, an honourable motive. However, when we look at 
numbers we see that these injustices are often only perceived, 
and mostly perceived by government.
<P>
	I would like to present a few more stats to add to those 
presented by the hon. member for North Vancouver a little 
earlier.
<P>
	There are 570,000 people currently regulated by the present 
Employment Equity Act. Women make up 45.6 per cent of those 
covered. When looking at women in the overall Canadian 
workforce, we find that 45.9 per cent of the workforce is female. 
There is a difference of .03 per cent between those who work 
under the bodies that are covered by the Employment Equity 
Program and those in the greater workforce. That is .03 per cent. 
We have to ask ourselves if this .3 per cent is enough of a 
difference to warrant the cost and the damage done by these 
employment equity programs.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	According to StatsCan for example, in 1992 single women 
made about 99 per cent of the salaries of single men. Many 
salary differences between men and women can be explained by 
lifestyle choices, for example, the choice to stay at home and 
raise a family. Of course, that is a very honourable choice 
indeed.
<P>
	As well, the Economic Council of Canada released a study in 
1992 that found no correlation between wage levels and a 
person's country of origin. The same report also found that 
immigrants have a lower unemployment rate than 
Canadian-born workers. The conclusion reached in the 
council's report was that there is no significant discrimination 
against immigrants in general.
<P>
	In 1994 the employment equity report said that in total, 
women occupied 47 per cent of government jobs while 47.3 per 
cent were available to work. Jobs held by women increased by a 
full percentage point in 1993-94. They took a full per cent more 
of the top jobs despite the fact that the executive category 
declined by 6 per cent. Again, would government have us bring 
in costly programs to adjust for a difference of .3 per cent?
<P>
	I have a few more statistics. The civilian staff at the RCMP is 
82.6 per cent female. At Citizenship Canada, 74 per cent are 
female. However, in Transport Canada more than 75 per cent are 
male. Are we to assume that this under-representation of 
women in the transport department is caused by discrimination? 
I would say no. However, that is what the report wrongly 
assumed and this illustrates the fundamental flaw in the report. 
It is difficult to determine why there are differences, but we 
cannot automatically assume that it is due to rampant 
discrimination.
<P>
	Again I ask the question: Why do we need employment equity 
programs and legislation? The answer is: I do not think we do. 
Then why do we have them? I believe we have them because the 
Liberal government's agenda has been and in fact is set too 
much by special interest groups and these special interest groups 
support employment equity. They are not driven by public 
interest.
<P>
	We have had too much government based on the vocal input 
from a minority and too little government based on the less 
vocal input of the majority. We have had government by the 
minority instead of the majority. What we have with 
employment equity is a playing field that is tipped in favour of 
special interest groups. That is not what Canada is all about.
<P>
	The motion today calls for the immediate end to employment 
equity and I fully support the motion. In keeping with the 
Reform practice of proposing positive alternatives, I will 
explain the Reform Party's position on employment equity by 
making five short statements:
<P>
	One, all Canadians are equal before and under the law and all 
workers have the right to be free from discrimination in the 
workplace. Two, the market will provide solutions to a 
representative workplace in the private sector. Three, it is the 
role of government to ensure equality of opportunity rather than 
to determine equality of employment outcome in the public 
sector. Four, the workplace should be free from arbitrary 
obstructions to hiring or promotion. Merit must be the sole 
hiring criterion. Five, employment equity legislation is 
coercive, discriminatory, unnecessary and costly. It should be 
discontinued.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have very little time and I will use it as well as I can.
<P>
	To quote a longtime good friend: ``I will be happy that 
equality has arrived when an unqualified, incompetent woman 
has as good a chance of getting hired and promoted as an 
unqualified, incompetent man''. That is equality.
<P>
	Employment equity is not about special treatment; it is about 
equality of opportunity. History proves and the figures prove 
that in fact a minority in our population have had preference in 
hiring and promotion. How else does one explain that 84 per 
cent of clerks in the federal government are women, the lowest 
paid? Even within that category of clerks, men rise to the top 
more often than women.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<B><A NAME="11645"> 11645 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	Numerous statistics demonstrate clearly to us that the merit 
principle has not been applied in hiring and in employment in 
this country and, shamefully, in our own public service. The 
statistics make it very clear that women have been at a 
disadvantage and have been kept at low levels of employment. 
People with disabilities are totally under-represented in our 
workforce, notwithstanding their qualifications. Aboriginal 
people are shamefully under-represented in our workforce. 
People who are visible minorities are also shamefully 
under-represented and in fact have far less chances of getting 
hired, one-quarter of a chance just a couple of years ago, 
compared to a white applicant.
<P>
	These are not necessarily conscious discriminations. They are 
built into our system and our value judgments. I say to the white 
males of this country: ``You have nothing to lose but your 
privileges''. This Canada of ours is not about privileges. It is not 
about preferential treatment for a minority of the population 
which has existed for a long time. It is about using the full, 
rich-

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TURKEY">TURKEY</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last month I had the honour of leading a delegation to 
Turkey to look into the very serious situation of human rights 
violations in that country. In particular, I was looking at the 
appalling human rights violations affecting the Kurdish 
community in Turkey.
<P>
	Some 12 million Kurds live in Turkey. They have been denied 
any democratic rights whatsoever to express their fundamental 
cultural and linguistic heritage.
<P>
	Following my return from that delegation, I raised a question 
in the House last week. I asked the Prime Minister to explain 
why the Canadian government is seriously contemplating 
sending a delegation led by a minister of the government to 
celebrate 75 years of Turkish parliamentary democracy.
<P>
	It is absolutely appalling that the government would seriously 
consider sending a delegation of that nature when six members 
of the Turkish Parliament are locked up in the Ankara prison 
solely for have spoken out for human rights, democracy and 
justice.
<P>
	When I had the privilege of meeting with these members of 
Parliament, including a Kurdish woman, Leyla Zana, who has 
been sentenced to a term of 15 years, they were astonished and 
deeply concerned that our government would seriously 
contemplate sending that delegation.
<P>
	Second, I raised the issue of the possible sale of 39 CF-5 
fighter aircraft to Turkey. We know of the human rights abuses. 
We know of the burning and destruction of villages. We know of 
over two million Kurds who have been made homeless in 
southeastern Turkey. We know of the attacks on journalists. We 
know of the very profound attacks on many other minorities in 
Turkey.
<P>
	This arms deal is fundamentally immoral. I call on the 
Government of Canada to join with Norway and Germany, two 
of our strong NATO allies, in imposing an arms embargo on 
Turkey. Far from selling fighter aircraft, we should be imposing 
an arms embargo. Look at Turkey's record in Cyprus for 
example: the illegal invasion, as well as its current appalling 
human rights record.
<P>
	Canada's policy is supposedly not to sell weapons to areas of 
conflict and not to sell weapons to countries with questionable 
human rights records. The government says: ``No problem, we 
will get a promise from Turkey that they will not use this against 
civilians''. The Turkish government made a similar promise 
with respect to tanks sold to them by Germany. That promise 
was broken as well.
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	I call on the government to say now, categorically, that it will 
not participate in this charade of the celebration of Turkish 
democracy, that it will cancel the Canadian delegation, that it 
will not sell CF-5 fighter aircraft, that it will impose an arms 
embargo and call on the Turkish government to arrive at a 
peaceful solution through political dialogue and peaceful means 
instead of attacking the Kurdish community.
<P>
	Finally, the PKK has called on the government to recognize 
that the time has come for dialogue, not for separation but as 
General Secretary Ocalan said: ``The time has come to live side 
by side on free and equal terms''. The way to achieve this is to be 
open and honest.
<P>
	I hope the parliamentary secretary will take the opportunity to 
set the record straight on this issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to set the record 
straight. The hon. member has raised three important issues. 
One is the Canadian delegation participating in the 75th 
anniversary of the founding of the Turkish Parliament on April 
23. The other is the human rights violations against the Kurds in 
northern Iraq and against some parliamentarians, that he 
explained in detail. The third issue is the sale of the CF-5 
aircraft to Turkey.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="11646"> 11646 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to begin by addressing the first two issues. The 
hon. member received an excellent answer from the Prime 
Minister when he asked the question on March 28. The Prime 
Minister in his reply said: ``It might be a good occasion for the 
ministerial delegation to raise the issue of human rights with the 
government when it is there''. He also said: ``Perhaps one way is 
to cancel the delegation or the other way is to send the 
delegation with a mandate to talk about it''.
<P>
	It is interesting what the member does when he sees human 
rights violations. He hops a plane and gets out there, whether it 
is the Middle East, China, Africa. He makes the headlines. He is 
the champion of fighting human rights violations. I compliment 
him for it.
<P>
	In this case, for other Canadians, he says: ``Don't go there. It's 
okay for me to go there, but don't go there. You Canadians stay 
home; don't go there''. I think the hon. member would agree 
with me that the best way to address these human rights 
violations with Turkey is to go and present it to them face to 
face.
<P>
	We have continually made representations to the Turkish 
government through our ambassador in Ottawa, through the 
embassy in Ankara. As far back as last June the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs raised the issue with his then Turkish 
counterpart, Mr. Çetin, who is now the Deputy Prime Minister of 
Turkey.
<P>
	I am sure these kind of direct interventions, face to face 
interventions, go a long way. Boycotting that country and not 
talking to them is not going to give them the message. We have 
to get there and approach them eyeball to eyeball on this 
situation. That addresses the first two issues.
<P>
	As far as the sale of the CF-5s is concerned, again I do not 
know why the member is making such a fuss over the issue. Just 
after question period today I asked the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs about this. There is no sale of CF-5s to Turkey. That is as 
recent as today. I hope the hon. member will pass that on to his 
constituents and to other Canadians. Yes, we have surplus 
planes. Yes, countries are interested in purchasing them. The 
price is a little lower because they are surplus and used. As of 
today, there is no sale of CF-5s to Turkey.
<P>
	I thank the hon. member for his intervention, but I hope he 
will not be hypocritical-

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="IMMIGRATION">IMMIGRATION</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday, I asked a question to the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration regarding the deportation of a family of Romanian 
refugees, Carmen and Alexandru Dima and their daughters 
Simona and Diana.
<P>
	Once again, the minister refused to intervene in this issue, and 
showed a blatant lack of sensitivity, humanism and compassion. 
The public, as well as the groups and the individuals who 
supported that family, were frustrated and shocked by the 
minister and the government's refusal to use discretionary 
power in this case. The Dima family arrived in Quebec on 
February 27, 1992, and immediately claimed refugee status. To 
everyone's surprise, the IRB and the minister rejected all the 
representations made.
<P>
	The Dima family was very well integrated to the community. 
Mrs. Dima, who was a teacher in Romania, worked as a 
volunteer at the Notre-Dame-de-Grâce school. She was 
promised a job with the Montreal catholic school board. Her 
husband, a computer technician, received a job offer from 
Avtech company, in Dorval.
<P>
	One daughter, Simona, got 97 per cent in French and is in a 
class for advanced or gifted students at the Saint-Luc high 
school. As for Diana, she goes to Notre-Dame-de-Grâce and 
only speaks French. The family also has relatives in Montreal. I 
saw the Dimas cry on television before their deportation, and I 
was very moved by that drama.
<P>
	I want to congratulate the Quebec minister of Immigration, 
Mr. Bernard Landry, who promised to deal quickly, and with 
compassion, with the immigrant applications which will be 
submitted at the Canadian consulate, in New York. This is 
another example of the open-mindedness of the Quebec 
government towards immigrants and refugees. Quebec is truly 
an exceptional land of adoption.
<P>
	I want to mention the solidarity expressed by ordinary 
citizens, parishioners from the Notre-Dame-de-Grâce church, 
reverend Fernand Patry, teachers and students from the two 
above-mentioned schools, as well as by the Brothers of 
Christian Schools, who will look after the family in Plattsburgh.
<P>
	The minister, who is afraid of the Reform Party, and who is 
becoming increasingly hard on immigrants and refugees, should 
take into account these spontaneous expressions of human 
solidarity by the public. I do hope that he will take the necessary 
measures to expedite the processing of the immigrant 
applications of that family, as regards the elements which fall 
under federal jurisdiction.
<P>
	I am convinced that Quebec and Canadian society will benefit 
from the contribution of the Dima family. I am the last speaker 
and I want to take this opportunity to wish you, Mr. Speaker, as 
well as all the members of this House, a Happy Easter.
<P>

	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the 
question to the hon. minister and for his concern for the Dima 
family.
<P>
	I would like to inform him that the family has co-operated 
with immigration officials by returning to the United States 
where they can apply through the normal channels. The Quebec 
government has indicated  that it will interview the family when 
they apply from outside Canada.
