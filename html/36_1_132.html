seek the unanimous consent of the House that the opposition 
motion tabled with the Journals Branch on Friday, October 2, 
1998 by Mr. Brien, the hon. member for Témiscamingue, be debated 
today under Business of Supply, Government Orders.

<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise on a point of order.  I understand that this motion is 
necessary because the motion was not in on time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know from the House leader for the Bloc whether 
he understands by his request that the motion be debated that he 
is also asking that it be votable.  Is that implied in the 
question?  Because if it is, then there is not unanimous consent. 
If he is only requesting that it be debated, then there is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I was going to ask the same question.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, with 
respect to the request as I heard it, we have no objection.  We 
think it is a small technical problem and we have no objection to 
this motion being debated. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Perhaps the hon. member for Roberval can 
clarify the situation.  Is the request that the motion be 
debated, or that it be debated and voted on? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would have liked it to be 
votable, but my discussions, particularly those with the 
parliamentary leader of the New Democratic Party, implied that I 
could not obtain unanimous consent—unless there was a 
change—and I was told that unanimous consent by the House and 
the NDP would be forthcoming only if the motion were not votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent of the House that 
the opposition motion tabled with the Journals Branch on Friday,

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.)</B> moved that 
Bill C-304, an act to amend An Act for the Recognition and 
Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and to amend 
the Constitution Act, 1867, be read the second time and referred 
to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, once again I am disappointed that my bill 
has been given second class status in the House.  For the second 
time since I have become a member of parliament this important 
issue has been denied enough time for a full debate and MPs have 
been denied a vote for or against strengthening property rights 
in federal law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is time to make all private members' business 
votable.  All the private members' business that comes before the 
House should be made votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to use the little time I have to explain why a full 
debate and a vote on Bill C-304 in the House is so important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have received impressive public support for my property rights 
bill, considering that I have had so little time to promote this 
legislative initiative.  I have received 491 pages of petitions, 
signed by 11,292 Canadians from all across Canada who support the 
bill.  I have also received the support of the Canadian Real 
Estate Association which represents more than 200 real estate 
boards in every province of this country. 
That fact alone must surely cause the government to rethink its 
stand on property rights.  It is obvious that this is a very 
important issue for many Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of this House are no doubt aware, this is the 50th 
anniversary of the signing of the United Nations declaration of 
human rights.  Article 17 of the UN declaration of human rights 
reads:  “Everyone has the right to own property alone as well as 
in association with others.  No one shall be arbitrarily deprived 
of his property”.  Despite the fact that Canada ratified the UN 
declaration of human rights 50 years ago, the fact is that 
Canadians are still being arbitrarily deprived of their property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are and have been so many examples.  The example I am so 
familiar with is Bill C-68, the firearms act.  Other examples are 
the Canadian Wheat Board Act, the Endangered Species Act, the 
Pearson Airport Agreements Act, the national energy program of a 
few years ago, as well as many others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues and I will use our time to expose just a few 
examples of how the government has abused the property rights of 
millions of Canadians.  We will explain why all Canadians should 
fear a government that is prepared to run roughshod over such a 
fundamental and natural right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Professor Peter Hogg in his book <I>Constitutional Law of 
Canada</I>, third edition, wrote:  “The omission of property 
rights from section 7 of the charter greatly reduces its scope. 
It means that section 7 affords no guarantee of compensation or 
even a fair procedure for the taking of property by the 
government.  It means that section 7 affords no guarantee of fair 
treatment by courts, tribunals or officials with power over 
purely economic interests of individuals or corporations”.  That 
was from citation 44.9 at page 1030. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Professor Hogg also wrote:  “The product is a section 7 in 
which liberty must be interpreted as not including property, as 
not including freedom of contract, and, in short, as not 
including economic liberty”.  That was from citation 44.7(b) at 
page 1028. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are powerful words.  I ask the members of this House if 
their constituents are even aware of this lack of protection in 
the charter.  Why are we here?  It is our duty as 
parliamentarians to be sure that the foundation, the 
fundamentals, of our society are right.  That is what Bill C-304 
is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Former Liberal Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau argued long and 
hard for better protection of property rights, first in his 1968 
paper titled “A Canadian Charter of Human Rights”, which was 
tabled when he was minister of justice; second in his 1969 paper 
“The Constitution of the People of Canada”; and once again in 
1978 when he introduced Bill C-60, the constitutional amendment 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Trudeau tried to get property rights included in the charter 
in July 1980 and again in January 1981.  Finally in April 1983 he 
said here in the House of Commons “I would say that if we can 
have the agreement of the Conservative Party to introduce an 
amendment on property rights and to pass it in 24 hours”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than try to amend the charter of rights and freedoms, my 
private member's bill, Bill C-304, proposes to provide adequate 
protection of property rights in federal law by strengthening the 
property rights provisions of the Canadian bill of rights, not 
the charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past the government has argued rather poorly that there 
is no need to strengthen property rights in federal law.  The 
government has argued in the past that the Canadian bill of 
rights provides adequate protection of property rights.  But I 
ask:  If property rights are so adequately protected in federal 
law, how can the government keep violating article 17 of the UN 
declaration of human rights by arbitrarily taking the property of 
Canadian citizens? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill of rights only provides rather feeble protection of 
property rights.  Even these can be overridden by just saying so 
in any piece of legislation passed by this House.  My bill 
proposes to make it more difficult to override the property 
rights of Canadian citizens by requiring a two-thirds majority 
vote of this House.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not tying the government's hands to legislate, but we are 
saying that property rights are so important that an override 
clause should pass a higher test in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if the government agrees to abide by the so-called 
guarantees in the Canadian bill of rights as it currently is 
worded, it protects only three things; the right to the enjoyment 
of property, the right not to be deprived of property except by 
due process, and finally the right to a fair hearing. 
Unfortunately the bill of rights does not, as I will explain 
later, prevent the arbitrary taking of property, and that is a 
very serious matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill of rights does not provide any protection of our right 
to be paid any compensation let alone fair compensation.  The 
bill of rights does not provide any protection of our right to 
have compensation fixed impartially.  The bill of rights does not 
provide any protection of our right to receive timely 
compensation.  Finally, the bill of rights does not provide any 
protection of our right to apply to the courts to obtain justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-304 would amend the bill of rights to provide added 
protection for Canadian citizens from the arbitrary decisions 
made by the federal government to take their property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Approval of my amendments to the bill of rights would allow 
Canadians to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the signing of the 
United Nations Declaration of Human Rights, knowing that we have 
finally provided the protection of property rights in federal law 
that the UN declaration called for so many decades ago.  Would 
that not be a wonderful way to celebrate the 50th anniversary? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can see a few members on the government looking self-assured 
and confident that I am wrong and that the government is right. 
The Minister of Justice's little helpers will soon stand up and 
proclaim as much.  I anticipate that, but I am not wrong.  That 
is why we need a full debate in the House.  Not just one hour. 
That is why we need a vote in the House on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Voters in the country have to know that the government by its 
own legislation, the legislation government members have 
supported, and by the actions of its own Minister of Justice 
condoned the arbitrary taking of property in direct contravention 
of article 17 of the UN Declaration of Human Rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of the country do not know that.  They should hang 
their heads in shame rather than parade around the world claiming 
to be the defenders of fundamental human rights. Article 17(2) of 
the UN Declaration of Human Rights states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his property. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have only time to cover one arbitrary taking of property by 
the federal government.  I will use the example I know best.  As 
members know I have been working on Bill C-68, the Firearms Act, 
very actively, in opposition of course.  Section 84(1) of Bill 
C-68 passed by parliament in 1995 and now chapter 39 of the 
Statutes of Canada arbitrarily prohibited an estimated 553,000 
registered handguns: 339,000 handguns that have a barrel equal to 
or less than 104 millimetres in length, about 4.14 inches, and 
214,000 handguns that discharge 25 and 32 calibre bullets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government arbitrarily decided that these 553,000 handguns 
currently safely stored in the homes of law-abiding government 
registered owners were so dangerous that they had to be banned. 
The government ignored the fact and the evidence from Statistics 
Canada showing that unregistered handguns responsible for about 
75% of all firearms crimes in the country were already illegal. 
Why does the government ignore these facts? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 the government estimated that these 553,000 handguns 
represented about half of all the firearms in the existing 
firearms registry.  What proof did the government provide that 
these firearms were dangerous?  None.  The decision was 
completely arbitrary.  I appreciate the show of concern that a 
few members are showing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was the extent of the government evidence to justify the 
prohibition?  In the government's opinion these legally acquired 
properly registered firearms “are not considered to be suitable 
for organized target shooting and such handguns are produced 
primarily for use as weapons”. 
No evidence was ever presented showing how many crimes these 
553,000 legally owned handguns had been involved in or how 
banning them would have prevented any crimes or prevent any 
crimes in the future.  In fact neither the RCMP nor the Minister 
of Justice were able to produce any evidence in parliament that 
the 64 year old handgun registration system had been used to help 
solve even one crime.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government even proved my point about the arbitrariness of 
its decision to ban hundreds of thousands of legally owned guns 
by deciding to leave most of the registered handguns it always 
refers to as Saturday night specials in the hands of registered 
owners until they die.  That demonstrates clearly how arbitrary 
its decision is.  It is then that most of these firearms will be 
seized because many of their heirs will not be able to comply 
with the onerous rules and regulations respecting ownership of 
firearms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If these handguns are safe in the hands of registered owners, 
why did the government need to ban them?  Not once have we had an 
answer to that.  We do not have property rights in this country. 
The criminals are already breaking the law by using unregistered 
guns for their crimes.  How did it improve public safety by 
banning guns in the hands of hundreds of thousands of good guys? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely, if this arbitrary ban were to do any good, the 
government would have to remove these so-called Saturday night 
specials from the hands of their registered owners.  It did not, 
thereby proving the arbitrariness of its decision and providing 
all the proof anyone needs to demonstrate its breaking of article 
17 of the 1948 UN Declaration on Human Rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the announcement of this ban the government destroyed the 
value of these 553,000 registered handguns.  The government did 
not have to physically take property to violate the fundamental 
property rights of these hundreds of thousands of law-abiding 
Canadians.  The government's arbitrary ban destroyed the value of 
these handguns and took money out of citizen's pockets just as 
surely as a mugger takes money out of his victim's pockets on the 
streets of downtown Toronto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government is force and this is how it uses it.  It uses this 
force to throw western farmers in jail just because they choose 
not to sell their wheat to the government.  The government uses 
this force to stop Canadians from receiving television channels 
the government does not want them to watch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we really free when this violation of one of our most 
fundamental rights goes on right before our eyes?  Some people 
will say “what the government is doing is not affecting me”, 
but what will these people say when their government arbitrarily 
decides to take their property or destroy the value of their 
property? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only did the government arbitrarily ban this legally owned 
property but it is refusing to pay compensation for the loss in 
value suffered by this government enforced step.  It is refusing 
to pay compensation for the legally owned firearms that people 
have and that it is going to confiscate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time the government announced this arbitrary ban on 
private property approximately 20,000 to 30,000 of these firearms 
were held in the inventories of government licensed businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Listen very carefully.  On May 19, 1998 a firearm's dealer 
received a letter from the Canadian Firearms Centre in the 
Department of Justice which said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Firearms in a dealer's inventory are not grandfathered and will 
therefore be subject to confiscation as of October 1.  There is 
no compensation scheme planned at this time for dealers or 
individuals whose handguns become prohibited October 1, 1998 and 
are confiscated or turned in. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are words of our own bureaucrats, our own Department of 
Justice.  On September 1, 1998 the Minister of Justice wrote a 
law-abiding gun owner in Ottawa.  Her letter was commenting on a 
1994 gun ban that paid them compensation if they surrendered 
their arbitrarily prohibited firearms to the government. The

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the bill seeks to elevate property rights protection in the 
Canadian bill of rights above that of any rights in the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms, let alone the bill of rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government believes that property rights are important and 
deserving of protection, that they currently enjoy sufficient 
protection, and that there is no need for this private member's 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First I will address the protection already afforded to property 
rights and then why the proposals to codify further protections 
in the bill of rights and the Constitution are unnecessary and 
inappropriate. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Numerous statutes regulate and protect property in Canada. 
There are common law rules which govern the purchase and sale of 
land, for instance, or the taking of interest in mortgages or 
leases.  Real and personal property laws govern the acquisition 
and sale of all property of this nature.  There are also laws 
that protect the right to own various forms of property, from 
vehicles to copyright. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the fundamental rules of law respected by the drafters of 
bills in the Department of Justice is the principle that 
property may not be expropriated without compensation. 
This guiding principle is mentioned on the department's Internet 
site. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This right must be weighed against society's other values.  For 
example, our thinking about property and the equitable 
protection to which people are entitled so that they are not 
deprived of their right to the enjoyment of property has 
evolved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal Divorce Act and provincial and territorial family 
laws ensure that women are not deprived of their right to a fair 
share of matrimonial property, regardless of who has legal 
title. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another source of protection of property rights is the direct 
declaration in the Canadian bill of rights.  The Canadian bill of 
rights has quasi-constitutional status.  A number of its 
provisions were repeated in specific provisions of the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  Since the charter contains no 
specific clause on property rights, section 1 of the bill of 
rights would continue to protect property rights. It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hereby recognized and declared that in Canada there have 
existed and shall continue to exist without discrimination by 
reason of race, national origin, colour, religion or sex, the 
following human rights and fundamental freedoms, namely, 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) the right of the individual to life, liberty, security of the 
person and enjoyment of property, and the right not to be 
deprived thereof except by due process of law. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus this clause protects property rights in that a person 
cannot be deprived of his rights except by regular application of 
the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill of rights requires the Minister of Justice to examine 
every bill before the House to ensure that it is consistent with 
the bill of rights and to report any inconsistency to the House. 
It is then up to hon. members, in accordance with the democratic 
process, to determine whether nevertheless to pass the bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of our main concerns about Bill C-304 is that it would give 
property rights precedence over all other rights protected in 
the Bill of Rights, as well as in the Canadian Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As things now stand, Parliament cannot pass bills inconsistent 
with the charter or the bill of rights without including a 
notwithstanding clause.  Clauses 3 and 5 of Bill C-304, which 
propose the addition of new paragraphs 2.1 and 2.2, as well as 
new section 6 to the bill of rights, would require the votes of 
at least two-thirds of the members of the House of Commons for 
these provisions to be amended or a notwithstanding clause to be 
passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In principle, our government is opposed to any more protection 
of property rights than is already provided for in the charter, 
such as the protection of rights flowing from the act or 
prohibiting discrimination against disabled persons.  This is 
particularly true when we examine the evolving concepts of 
property and discrimination.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a complex society with many interests and competing rights, 
we must recognize that rights are not absolute.  We have and need 
laws to govern the use of property in the public interest.  There 
is a network of laws not only at the federal level but also at 
the provincial and municipal levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier I mentioned the federal Divorce Act and provincial and 
territorial laws which ensure that matrimonial property is 
equitably divided upon the breakup of a marriage.  In addition, 
environmental legislation establishes a whole body of regulations 
governing everything from the disposal of hazardous waste to 
cutting down trees.  There are also laws that govern ownership of 
shares of limited companies, bankruptcy, ownership of land by 
non-Canadians, land use and zoning in residential or farming 
areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In each of these cases and laws there are limitations on 
property, ownership and use.  Everyone recognizes the need for 
these restrictions.  If the government were to consider amending 
the bill of rights, sight should not be lost of the important 
limitations on the enjoyment of property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should also bear in mind that many of the laws are in the 
provincial realm, something the opposition often forgets.  Under 
section 92 of the Constitution Act 1867 each province has 
exclusive jurisdiction over property and civil rights in the 
province.  A good example is the recent adaptation by the Ontario 
Harris government of children under 12 years of age having the 
right to firearms, something that the opposition has not 
mentioned.  Hunting is under provincial jurisdiction. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the new property rights protection program would be 
enshrined in the bill of rights instead of the Canadian Charter 
of Rights and Freedoms, it would apply only to Parliament, and 
not to provincial legislatures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government feels that the ensuing imbalance would do a 
disservice to federal-provincial relations. It would also be 
unfair to Canadians to subject them to two property rights 
protection programs, one at the provincial level and one at the 
federal level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last but not least, Bill C-304 would amend the Constitution Act 
of 1867 to allow for the adoption of the new section 6 of the 
Canadian Bill of Rights which, as already mentioned, would have 
the effect of increasing to two-thirds the percentage of votes 
required in the future to adopt laws that could undermine the 
new protection afforded property rights. The procedure for 
amending the Constitution is, as we all know, quite complex and 
time consuming, and the result is far from being guaranteed. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many existing protections for property rights in 
Canada in the Canadian bill of rights and other statutes and 
through common law.  Canadians currently enjoy important 
protection of property rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to address the firearms legislation. The hon. 
member took most of his time to state to the Canadian public some 
falsities which have been repeated consistently in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all the firearms legislation does not talk about 
confiscation.  It talks about registration.  I remind hon. 
members that the House adopted that piece of legislation and it 
is in contempt of the House to constantly bring up the issue in 
my opinion. An election was won on that piece of legislation and 
a court challenge was won recently on that piece of legislation. 
Parliament has the right and hon. members of Her Majesty's 
Official Opposition consistently forget that fact and are in 
contempt of this parliament to constantly bring up the same piece 
of legislation. We fought the election.  We won the election. It 
is a law of the land at the moment. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The notion of property is much broader than real property. Given 
how broad the concept of real property can be, we must be 
careful if we succeed in altering the existing protection for 
property rights in a quasi-constitutional document such as the 
Bill of Rights.

am pleased to address Bill C-304, introduced by the Reform Party 
member for Yorkton—Melville and entitled an Act to amend an Act 
for the Recognition and Protection of Human Rights and 
Fundamental Freedoms and to amend the Constitution Act, 1867. In 
short, it is an act to amend the Canadian Bill of Rights.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At first glance, the subject appears appealing.  The first 
clause proposes the following, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Paragraph 1(a) of An Act for the Recognition and Protection of 
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms is replaced by the 
following: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) the right of the individual to life, liberty and security of 
the person, and the right not to be deprived thereof except by 
due process of law; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment to the existing legislation removes from 
subsection 1(a) the freedom of enjoyment of one's property. 
Everyone agrees that the freedom to enjoy one's property is a 
democratic freedom. 
One question, however: Is this an unconditional, universal, 
freedom? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see what the member is after in clause 3.  It proposes: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Act is amended by adding the following after section 2: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>2.1 (1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3), every person has the 
right to the enjoyment of that person's property. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a fundamental statement of this bill: the right to 
private property.  For most of us, private property refers 
immediately to our home, but it includes many other things, such 
as a house, car, land, bicycle, to name but a few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am no constitutional expert.  However, I know that the 
provinces have jurisdiction over property and civil rights.  It 
is therefore the responsibility of the provinces to legislate in 
areas involving personal property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member's bill therefore aims at establishing recognition of 
the right to property in federal legislation subject to the 
Canadian Bill of Rights, since it applies only to federal acts 
and institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The right to enjoyment of property is found in subsection 1(a) 
of the Canadian Bill of Rights.  So, we may well ask what the 
point of the bill is and what scope does the member intend for 
it.  I think he is attempting to initiate a general debate on 
the right to private property based on the following assumption: 
the right to private property is a natural right and one that is 
outside of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But many ongoing situations show that personal rights, 
especially in connection to property, often have to be 
restricted for the common good. Take for example environmental 
issues. Environmental and public health protection require that 
legislation be passed that sometimes limits property rights by 
imposing strict regulations on companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example everyone, at least everyone in this place, knows 
about is the speed limit on roads and highways. Such rules limit 
my enjoyment of my car's performance. Yet, careless behaviour 
might see me lose the use of my car. Imagine how disastrous this 
would be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Firearms Registration Act is yet another example. I had no 
intention of ascribing motives to the hon. member for 
Yorkton—Melville. 
And I will not do so. But after hearing his remarks, it seems 
clear to me that, in his opinion, should the Canadian Bill of 
Rights be amended as proposed in his bill, the firearm 
registration legislation would be impossible to enforce and 
would entail prohibitive costs as anyone could demand a hearing 
before a court of law under clauses 2.1(1) and 2.1(4).

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I have just a few comments on the private member's motion by the 
hon. member from the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to address something that he brought up in his 
remarks with respect to the conduct of Private Members' Business 
in this House and the ongoing debate as to whether or not all 
motions and bills that emanate from Private Members' Business 
should be made votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just on the history lesson side for a minute, some hon. members 
but perhaps not all may know that it is only recently speaking in 
the long term parliamentary history that we have been able to 
vote on anything having to do with Private Members' Business. 
Prior to 1985, Private Members' Business would come up for an 
hour, it would be debated, talked out and then would disappear 
forever to the bottom of the list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of the reforms that came out of what has come to be 
known as the McGrath committee, it was decided that this was an 
unsatisfactory way of doing things and that some bills and 
motions of private members ought to be able to come to a vote 
without unanimous consent.  Prior to the McGrath committee 
reforms, it was possible to have a vote on a private member's 
motion or bill but there had to be unanimous consent and one can 
imagine just how rarely that took place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was this feeling that in order to give Private Members' 
Business the significance it was due that there should be some 
process for making sure some private members' motions and bills 
were made votable.  The suggestion at that time was that we would 
proceed as usual with the lottery to determine which members 
would have their bills and motions deliberated upon to see 
whether or not— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  We are listening, Bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  I am sorry if the Liberals feel I am 
ignoring them but I am just not used to having anybody over there 
to talk to.  I have grown accustomed to not having Liberals over 
there to talk to.  I acknowledge that they are now making an 
effort to finally have people in the House, which is nice.  I 
will try to direct some of my remarks their way as well so they 
do not feel so touchy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted, there was an 
attempt to make some Private Members' Business votable. 
There was a standing committee set up on Private Members' 
Business.  This has now become a subcommittee of the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  I thought it would be safe to talk to 
you, Mr. Speaker.  Could we have a little order? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona knows it is always safe to speak to the 
Speaker, much safer than addressing anyone else in the House.  I 
know hon. members want to hear the remarks of the member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona, so perhaps he could continue uninterrupted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in any event I think the 
debate continues as to whether or not this process is 
satisfactory.  I must say to the hon. member that I am not 
convinced at this point that all private members' motions and all 
private members' bills should automatically become votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have a system whereby we make some determination at the 
end of the pipeline as to what will become votable.  I would say 
to the hon. member that if it were to be the case that private 
members' motions and bills were automatically votable, I think he 
would find for that to be the case that there would have to be 
some kind of selection or some kind of weeding out or screening 
at the beginning of the pipeline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot see a situation in which, no matter what the motion, no 
matter what the bill, it would automatically be votable. I think 
there would be problems there.  That continues to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Wild Rose says that it would still have to meet 
the criteria.  That is the point.  Right now there are criteria. 
I hear the hon. member saying that there should not be any 
criteria; whatever people put forward as a bill or motion would 
automatically become votable. If that is not what he is 
advocating then there may be some room for discussion. I am 
trying to point out what I think some of the problems would be 
with the hon. member's suggestion with respect to Private 
Members' Business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to this bill I would say that I have heard the 
debate about property rights go on for some years in the House of 
Commons.  It is always cast in the light of people who somehow do 
not have the same respect for property as those who do and 
therefore want it enhanced either by way of an amendment to the 
bill of rights or by enshrining it in the Canadian Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the hon. member that is not the way the debate has 
played out when it has been on the floor of the House of Commons. 
When we debated whether or not we were to have property rights in 
the Canadian charter at the time of the patriation debate, the 
main opponents to having property rights in the Canadian Charter 
of Rights and Freedoms were the provinces.  It was the provincial 
governments, which he was no doubt supportive of at the time or 
may have been.  Conservative governments, NDP governments, the 
provincial governments themselves were against having property 
rights put in the charter because they regarded that as a matter 
of provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coming from a party that generally is very supportive of 
provincial jurisdiction and any intrusion by the federal 
government into provincial jurisdiction, I find it something that 
perhaps the member should deal with at some point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill we have before us applies only to federal legislation 
because it only deals with the bill of rights.  When I listened 
to the member speak it was clear that his first preference would 
be to have property rights enshrined in the Constitution, if he 
could have it that way.  This is really his second preference 
because he thinks this would be easier and could be done without 
constitutional amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the member's own ideal case, the people that are 
lined up against him are not necessarily colleagues in the House 
of Commons but provincial governments he normally supports when 
they expound the rhetoric of protecting provincial jurisdictions. 
That is something to keep in mind when they get up on their high 
horse on property rights.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the hon. member for Yorkton—Melville on bringing 
the issue of property rights to the floor of the House of Commons 
again.  He has been a strong and consistent advocate of his 
position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ensuring the right of every Canadian to enjoy property ownership 
has been a long and sacred principle of the Progressive 
Conservative Party of Canada.  The Canadian bill of rights 
enacted in 1960 by Conservative Prime Minister John Diefenbaker 
extended protection in the following areas:  the right to enjoy 
property, the right not to be deprived of property except by due 
process and the right to a fair hearing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative Party of Canada has repeatedly supported and 
recognized the importance of property rights.  In 1995 our party 
from across Canada improved a new party constitution which lists 
as its principles a belief that the best guarantees of prosperity 
and well-being for the people of Canada are as follows:  the 
freedom of individual Canadians to pursue their enlightened and 
legitimate self-interest within a competitive economy, the 
freedom of the individual Canadian to enjoy the fruits of his or 
her labour to the greatest possible extent, and the right to own 
property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The protection of property rights has long been a recognized and 
fundamental aspect of social and economic justice.  In 1690 John 
Locke wrote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The great and chief end of men—putting themselves under 
government, is the preservation of property. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A century later, Edmund Burke, one of the great conservative 
philosophers of the British tradition, wrote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The power of perpetuating our property in our families is one of 
the most valuable and interesting circumstances belonging to it, 
and that which tends the most to the perpetuation of society 
itself.  It makes our weakness subservient to our virtue; it 
grafts benevolence even upon avarice. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1948 the Government of Canada signed the United Nations 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights which included the 
protection of property rights.  Appropriately John Humphrey, a 
Canadian law professor who was working as a director of human 
rights for the UN Secretariat, was a key drafter of the document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only was the bill of rights passed in 1960 but the House of 
Commons, through a motion passed in 1988 with the support of all 
parties at that time, indicated its support for property rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly the Liberal government saw fit in the last parliament to 
trample over the spirit of that UN declaration, Mr. Diefenbaker's 
legacy and his expressed will of the House through the Pearson 
airport fiasco. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 the Liberals cancelled the much needed agreement to 
privatize Pearson International Airport and nobody would dispute 
a new government's ability or right to reverse the decision of 
its predecessor.  However, a new government has a mandate to take 
different policy directions.  The Liberals decided in this 
instance that their decision would go one step further, that they 
would remove the rights of Canadian companies from seeking fair 
and just compensation from the government for cancelling the 
Pearson agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-68 which has been referenced by the member for 
Yorkton-Melville is another example of where Canadian individual 
property rights have been trampled.  The Liberals have even 
introduced legislation to do that.  It is interesting to know, 
however, that the Reform and Bloc caucuses in the last parliament 
did very little to highlight what the Liberals were doing at that 
time with respect to the Pearson airport debacle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thankfully members in the upper chamber, Progressive 
Conservatives for the most part but with a few Liberals on side, 
rose to defeat Bill C-22.  For all the abuse that the Reform 
Party inflicts upon the Senate it is paramount for Canadians to 
realize that those individuals concerned about property rights in 
the Senate did their job.  They recognized that this was an 
opportunity for them to protect the property rights of Canadians 
where the Reform Party dropped the ball. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the Reform Party in this instance should spend more time 
working on property rights and less time having its taxpayer 
funded staff engage in libelling and misrepresenting senators in 
political campaigns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am nonetheless pleased to discuss Bill C-304 and protecting 
property rights in this context.  This is an appropriate forum 
for us to do so.  To cite the Right Hon. John Diefenbaker: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament is more than procedure.  It is the custodian of the 
nation's freedom. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-304 would accord stronger protection for the freedom of 
Canadians to enjoy their property.  As mentioned by the hon. 
member for Yorkton—Melville, it would amend the Canadian bill of 
rights to include protection for the following property rights: 
the right to be paid for fair compensation, the right to have 
that compensation fixed impartially, the right to have timely 
compensation, and the right to apply to courts to attain justice 
if they feel in any aspect that their property rights have been 
denied or infringed upon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will forgive me for highlighting the inconsistency in 
the Reform member proposing that the courts already have the 
authority or may be given more authority, given the fact that we 
have seen in the House repeatedly Reform members stand to 
criticize the judiciary. 
Many Reformers have attacked our judges and our courts, have 
referred to them as greedy little parasitic fraternities and have 
proposed a U.S. style of justice as a remedy to Canadians' legal 
problems.  It is therefore refreshing to see the hon. member for 
Yorkton—Melville break from the rhetoric of his caucus 
colleagues and propose that additional authority be granted to 
our courts in this important area of protecting property rights.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I express the support of the Progressive Conservative caucus for 
this piece of legislation.  We need to protect the freedom of 
Canadians to enjoy their property to its full extent.  We need to 
ensure the government respects the property rights of Canadians. 
We need to ensure there exists a due process through which 
property is not seized without fair and just compensation and 
that there is due process to make that determination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill -304 meets those requirements.  In light of that and in 
light of the recent firearms legislation protest on the Hill and 
other protests, we feel there is an existing trend with the 
Liberal government abusing its authority.  For those reasons we 
feel there is a need for legislation such as that proposed by the 
hon. member for Yorkton—Melville and we will be supporting the 
bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK14"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak to the bill.  I may be found in 
contempt if the parliamentary secretary to the justice minister 
has her way in the idea that I intend to raise some bills that 
have been passed previously.  Bill C-4, the wheat board bill, 
comes to mind and whatnot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislative rules on property rights do not necessarily 
protect the individual, which should surely be the intent of a 
bill of rights.  The intent should be to protect individuals from 
legislative abuse by governments of the day.  That is what 
property rights and a bill of rights are all about.  Governments 
change from time to time and the protection of the individual is 
paramount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see this with regard to Canadian farmers who are still 
being thrown in jail for selling their own grain.  That is 
probably a breach of their property rights.  It is certainly 
agreed upon out west where this is being done.  The current rules 
in the legislation certainly did not protect the province's 
constitutional authority over property two weeks ago in Edmonton 
when four provinces and two territories argued that the Firearms 
Act infringed on their property rights and the rights of 
individuals.  The bill of rights and the charter certainly do not 
protect the provinces.  Here again it seems to be the government 
of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will point out specifically so that everyone is very clear 
what Bill C-304 is about.  The member for Yorkton—Melville said 
it clearly before but I will reiterate.  Property rights are 
natural, fundamental, and based on hundreds of years of common 
law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government intentionally left property rights out of the 
charter in 1982.  This was to the detriment of each person's 
democratic rights and economic freedoms.  The bill would put 
forward amendments that would specifically guarantee all people 
have the right to the enjoyment of their property; the right not 
to be deprived of their property unless they are given a fair 
hearing; the right to be paid fair, timely and impartial 
compensation; and the right to appeal to the courts if their 
property rights have been infringed upon or denied.  Every 
person's property rights would be guaranteed in law in Canada 
unless it is expressly declared that the act shall operate 
notwithstanding the Canadian bill of rights.  That should clarify 
precisely what Bill C-304 is about. Those are the words of the 
member who proposed the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned about the inconsistency between the government's 
position on human rights outside Canada and its position at home. 
We recently saw an active demonstration of this at the APEC 
summit in Vancouver.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also in Canada we continue to have a lack of accountability 
concerning basic human rights in our First Nations.  This is 
related in part to the lack of a fully democratic institution 
that provides checks and balances between constituents and 
elected chiefs and councils.  For example, there is no effective 
access to information legislation and labour legislation to 
protect a reserve employee from arbitrary dismissal from a 
position.  These are basic democratic rights.  They involve 
property rights.  These are things that all Canadians should be 
entitled to in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak in support of Bill C-304.  This bill would begin to 
correct the inconsistencies between international human rights 
and practices at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before we can ask for protection of property rights we must 
define property ownership rights.  Quite simply, I would define 
property ownership as the right to transfer property, the right 
to control how a property is used, the responsibility for the 
benefits and the costs associated with the property, and the 
right to compensation when property is taken by governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a long definition.  The vast majority of people 
likely assume that when they own something they have these three 
simple rights.   Sadly, this is not the case.  I only have to 
look at grain farmers in western Canada, which is probably the 
biggest example at the current time, to see that all Canadians do 
not have these rights.  Farmers produce wheat and barley, but 
they do not have the right to transfer their property.  They are 
obligated by law to sell their produce to the Canadian Wheat 
Board.  It gets down to the very basics of human existence when 
someone produces food and wants to trade with another person or 
another country and they are not allowed to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, producers of wheat and barley in western Canada do 
not have control over their property.  They must deliver their 
produce to the Canadian Wheat Board when the Canadian Wheat Board 
tells them to deliver.  Most Canadians believe that they have the 
right to accept higher risk in exchange for the possibility of 
higher returns.  This basic principle of a free democratic 
economy is practised every day on the nation's stock exchanges in 
commodities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is a move in the right direction toward protecting the 
property rights of individuals in this country, as well as 
supporting the very Constitution that protects the rights of 
provinces to the property which is under their control. 
<P><A NAME="LINK15"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, first I would like to thank all of those who have 
participated in this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a couple of questions for the parliamentary secretary for 
justice.  If what she was saying is true, why does the Canadian 
Real Estate Association support my property rights bill?  Second, 
why did the Department of Justice say that there would be no 
compensation for confiscation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's argument that “we won the election so we have 
the right to run roughshod over the property rights of a certain 
group” smacks of a dictatorial attitude.  It is most 
undemocratic and I object to the words that she used in this 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary should read Bill C-68 where it says 
that, in the opinion of the governor in council, they can 
prohibit any firearm.  The Canadian Police Association called the 
actions of this government unwise in the extreme.  We ought to 
listen to what the police say about Bill C-68. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, while a remote possibility exists for judicial review 
of a prohibition order, it would be virtually impossible for any 
court to substitute its opinion for the opinion of their governor 
in council, a few cabinet ministers.  In fact, lawyers from the 
Library of Parliament confirmed this when they wrote “The courts 
would be loath to find that the governor in council acted in bad 
faith”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the standing committee on justice proposed an amendment to 
section 117.15(2) of Bill C-68 to remove the words “in the 
opinion of” and to keep the wording the same as it has been for 
years, requiring an objective test of what constitutes firearms 
that are commonly used for hunting and sporting purposes.

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to emphasize this next statement.  The justice 
minister ignored her own committee, dominated by government 
members, and rejected that amendment.  Consequently, we have a 
completely arbitrary prohibition power for the cabinet entrenched 
in the Criminal Code of Canada; a power, I might add, that 
completely bypasses parliament and cannot be appealed or 
overturned by the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a few more quotations.  In 1903 Pope Pius X wrote to his 
bishops, saying “The right of private property, the fruit of 
labour or industry, or of concession or donation by others, is an 
incontrovertible natural right; and everybody can dispose 
reasonably of such property as he thinks fit”.  That does not 
exist in this country and that is a pity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This quotation is from a recent ruling of the Alberta Court of 
Appeal.  Madam Justice Conrad said with regard to Bill C-68 “It 
establishes an administrative process, with broad discretion 
conferred on the administrative authority affecting property 
rights.  The discretion and broad right to regulate enables the 
federal government to limit and control the property rights of 
law-abiding citizens.  It does not prohibit existing potentially 
dangerous conduct, or conduct related to a serious risk of 
harm”.  That the parliamentary secretary to the justice minister 
should claim this as a victory for the government rings very 
hollow when we read that decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to cite one final quotation from Ayn Rand, who 
wrote in her book <I>Capitalism:  The Unknown Ideal</I>:  “The 
concept of a right pertains only to action—specifically to 
freedom of action.  It means freedom from physical compulsion, 
coercion or interference by others.  The right to life is the 
source of all rights—and the right to property is their only 
implementation.  Without property rights, no other rights are 
possible.  Since man has to sustain his life by his own effort, 
the man who has not right to the product of his effort has no 
means to sustain his life.  The man who produces while others 
dispose of his product, is a slave”.  Let us listen to those 
words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very serious matter.  I fear we are taking it much too 
lightly.  My bill strengthens property rights in federal law.  It 
does not tie the hands of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because Bill C-304 on property rights meets all the criteria for 
making private members' bills votable, I would like to 
respectfully request the unanimous consent of the House to make 
this bill votable.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien:</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
afternoon, we are debating a Bloc Quebecois motion about two 
related issues.  The motion first calls on the House to condemn 
the massive cuts made by the federal government in the health 
care sector, specifically since it took office three years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it calls on the House to recognize and support the 
consensus achieved by the provinces in Saskatoon this summer on 
the social union.  I will have an opportunity later on to define 
what is meant by social union, and what this summer's consensus 
was about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, there are two goals.  Why do we want to address what is 
going on in the health sector today?  Let us be very objective. 
The figures speak volumes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go back to when the Liberal Party came to power in 
1993-94—and my figures come from the review published by the 
Department of Finance—and look at cash transfers to the 
provinces, that is the money transferred by the federal 
government to the provinces and on which the health, 
post-secondary education and welfare systems essentially rely for 
their funding. Total spending under these three programs, now 
known as the Canada social transfer, was over $17 billion, $17.9 
billion to be specific, when the government came to power.  The 
following year, provincial transfer payments dropped to $16.9 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are they this year?  This year, cash transfers will be 
$12.5 billion. 
This is a drop of close to $6 billion.  The provinces are 
receiving a total of $6 billion less than they did four or five 
years ago when this government took office.  That is a big chunk 
of money, and the effects are serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's entire health care system is experiencing great 
difficulty.  It has been weakened, and provincial governments 
have had to push ahead much more quickly with necessary reforms, 
with the result that they are now facing problems in the 
management of the health system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But there is an underlying cause.  The present government made 
the decision to slash provincial transfer payments, knowing full 
well that a very large portion of these payments was used to 
fund health care. 
For Quebec alone, this means an annual shortage of several 
hundreds of millions of dollars that were meant to be 
distributed to each of the province's regions to fund our health 
care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There used to be someone here who would put it very well. I am 
referring to the former leader of the Progressive Conservative 
Party. During the last federal election campaign, he kept 
reminding people wherever he went that the federal government 
was primarily responsible for the cuts in the health care 
sector. That gentleman changed his tune when he moved from the 
federal to the provincial scene. People will pass judgment on 
him when the time comes, but the fact remains that he did make 
those comments at the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as I know, these views are shared by all the political 
parties, which are condemning the devastating impact of these 
cuts on our health care system. The provinces have decided to 
form a united front against the federal government. 
Now that this government has achieved its goal of a zero deficit 
and is enjoying a surplus, it is very tempted to put money back 
into certain areas deemed to be priorities by the public. 
Unfortunately, it wants to do it alone, by implementing its own 
initiatives, merely to increase its political visibility. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1215"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be realized that the Canada social transfer, through 
which transfer payments are made, was somewhat annoying to the 
federal government, because there was no visibility associated 
with the money being transferred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What matters to the public is not visibility, but the program's 
effectiveness which, simply put, means receiving the services 
for which they are paying. The people who pay taxes to Ottawa 
want that money to be returned to them. Of course, one may 
wonder about the need to send money to Ottawa, only to get it 
back afterwards. It would be better to send it directly to the 
Quebec government and to get it directly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We fully realize that the Canadian federal system likes a big, 
huge bureaucracy. 
There is a very sizeable health department in Ottawa, in an area 
of jurisdiction that normally belongs to the provinces.  This is 
why the provinces decided on an agreement in Saskatoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is there is this agreement on social union?  Essentially, 
there are four components  The first one, which is  in our 
motion, is as follows: now that the federal government has 
achieved its zero deficit objective, let it set as its primary 
priority the re-injection of funds into the health system via the 
Canada social transfer, which is already in place, using the 
transfer payment mechanism that is already in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no need to launch initiatives, new programs, left and 
right.  What we are saying is that the priority is to service 
what is already in place, a system with which everyone is 
familiar, and that the provinces could promptly inject this 
money into the system in order to enhance the reforms they have 
put in place, and solidify the health system. 
All the provinces are calling for this.  There is unanimous 
consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point is telling the federal government: before 
launching any new initiatives left and right, before launching 
any new initiatives relating to areas of provincial 
jurisdiction, make sure there is support from a majority of 
provinces.  The provinces are very polite; they could have told 
you to stay within your areas of jurisdiction.  But they are 
telling you, if you want to get involved in initiatives that 
fall under provincial jurisdiction, to ensure a minimum of 
co-ordination and to have the support of a majority of provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third point, linked to the second, is that if the provinces 
want to opt out—that is, to administer these programs themselves, 
because they already have all the infrastructures in place, 
because a similar program already exists, because it already 
addresses these priorities, and all they need to do is inject a 
bit more money into it—they are saying: give us the right to opt 
out with full financial compensation, provided we put the money 
into the same already defined areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last point: the provinces had the great wisdom to add a new 
component, which is rather a thorn in the side of the federal 
government, calling for new co-operation mechanisms in order to 
avoid conflicts, and particularly to settle disputes, so that 
Ottawa will not be the sole judge of whether or not priority is 
being given to spending the money in the defined areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, Ottawa will always have its own interpretation of all 
this. 
Ottawa will say that the provinces fail to meet the criteria for 
exercising their right to opt out. A mechanism should therefore 
be put in place to settle such disputes, and to do so quickly 
and more objectively than on the sole basis of the federal 
government's assessment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There seems to be a great deal of wisdom in this approach that 
is supported by all the provinces. They are asking the federal 
government to show some good faith. However, this request was 
initially given a very cold welcome in Ottawa, starting with the 
Prime Minister, who kindly advised his provincial colleagues 
that, if they wanted to become the Prime Minister of Canada and 
run the country, all they had to do was to get themselves 
elected Prime Minister of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his mind, he is in charge and makes decisions, and if they 
are not happy, they should run against him in an election. One 
was actually considering doing just that, so he got rid of him 
by sending him to Quebec City. 
Now, he is calling on the rest of them to do the exact opposite 
he urged the leader of the Conservative Party. That is quite 
odd. Eventually, his old Liberal guard in this place could even 
stop supporting him. We shall see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the Prime minister took a strong stand in denying this 
request, making people wonder how real his support is for 
flexible federalism, for a system capable of adapting to the new 
realities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the provinces are asking is that the health system in 
Canada, in Quebec and all the Canadian provinces, be managed 
more efficiently, that more money be poured into the system and 
that each province be allowed to further its reforms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can anyone here object to that? One has to wonder about the real 
intentions of the people across the way. 
I am convinced however that, today, all parties—at least on 
this side of the House—will support the key principles.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There may be a few questions here and there on certain points, 
and the provinces will have the opportunity to explain their 
position in the process. But you will see that this approach, 
reinvesting money in our health system and respecting the 
provinces in what they do—and they do it pretty well with the 
resources available to them—will find some level of support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hopefully a number of people on the government side will wake up 
and put pressure on the Prime Minister. Hopefully some of them 
will be a little more modern in their approach to the Canadian 
system and will adapt to this reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is not a votable item, but I hope many members rise 
in this House today to express their support for the premiers' 
initiatives and to say that it is high time the federal 
government reinvested money in the health system, which needs it 
badly, and recognized the damage it has caused over the last few 
years. The drastic cuts that were made in the health system were 
a mistake and they adversely affected the lives of many people 
both in Quebec and in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my colleague opposite for his remarks which I 
listened to with great attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue we are debating is very important to us all.  If we 
believe that all Canadians from sea to sea, and Quebeckers, 
deserve the same minimum standards of health care, do we not need 
to have the federal government set some kind of standards or 
parameters and enforce them in the provinces when it gives money 
under the health and social transfers?  How can we do it without 
the federal government demanding something of the provinces? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien:</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, it must be pointed 
out that the Canada Health Act exists with its fundamental 
principles. Nowhere in the agreement do the provinces question 
that. We could ask ourselves whether the Canada Health Act is 
properly worded, but this is not the purpose of the debate we 
are having today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nobody has indicated a willingness to go against these 
fundamental objectives. The premiers, in the first sentence of 
the press release issued following their meeting in Saskatoon on 
August 7, confirmed their resolve to maintain and improve the 
universal health care system for all Canadians. That was the 
first sentence of the premiers' press release. It seems to me 
that there should be something in there to satisfy the member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This being said, it is one thing for the Liberals to rise in 
this House and say they want to protect the fundamental 
principles of the Canada Health Act. 
However, this borders on hypocrisy if the provinces are not 
provided with the means to meet the criteria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What good does it do if, in theory, you have some strong 
legislation, but, in practice, you do not provide the means to 
enforce it. I have absolutely no doubt that all of the 
opposition parties will agree on this issue and that several 
government members will share that vision or, at least, will 
hopefully realize that, while they talk about setting standards, 
they do not provide the money needed to meet those standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best people to watch over the quality of our health care 
system are not the hon. members of the Liberal Party, but the 
citizens who, along with the various provinces, will put 
pressure on the government and their local representatives who 
are involved in the health care system. 
The best watchdogs for our health care system will always be the 
people and not some opportunistic politicians who do not put 
their money where their mouth is. 
<P><A NAME="LINK22"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
take this opportunity to recognize the good work my hon. 
colleague is doing on these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject of the framework agreement on social issues and 
its enforcement, I wonder if he could tell me whether or not, in 
his opinion, social realities in health, education and other 
areas are closely linked to economic development, especially 
since harmonious and efficient economic development makes social 
support possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would he not consider an economic and social framework agreement 
an interesting proposal on the part of the government? 
This might—and I am sure this will please his colleague, the 
champion of social issues—result in liberalizing 
interprovincial trade once and for all and in dramatically 
improving this country's economic performance, because it all 
starts with us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As strange as it may sound, free trade agreements are being 
signed just about everywhere except between Canadian provinces. 
So, I think this could not only improve our social performance 
but also address a major issue.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for 
pointing out in his preamble that what happened affected not 
only health care but also education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could have made similar remarks about the education system, 
where the government had the nerve to put forward an initiative 
like the millennium scholarships, meddling in a provincial 
jurisdiction, when Quebec's priorities might have been slightly 
different from the federal government's, had the same amount 
been available. But that is another debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank him anyway for pointing out that what is true for health 
is also true for education and, I might add, for social 
assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for an eventual framework agreement on economic development, 
no one can be against that. I come from a border riding. Across 
the lake from us is Ontario. For many of our businesses in 
Quebec, it is easier to trade with the United States than with a 
Canadian province. Standards and regulations governing 
transportation for instance are often extremely complex. This 
creates somewhat artificial trade barriers, which nevertheless 
make some aspects of our system archaic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objective is good, but it is very difficult to reach an 
agreement on an issue identified by all Canadians as a priority, 
namely health care. This government is not very responsive. 
Imagine what it would be like with interprovincial trade. In 
this respect, I have greater confidence in the provinces and 
their ability to come to an agreement among themselves than in 
the federal government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK23"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
address the motion introduced by the hon. member for 
Témiscamingue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My comments will deal primarily with the first part of the 
motion, which reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House recognize the very harmful effect of federal 
cuts to the Canada Social Transfer (CST), particularly on health 
services in Canada— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone knows the strategy applied by the Liberals to eliminate 
the deficit. Year after year, the Minister of Finance 
deliberately underestimated his revenues and overestimated the 
costs of servicing the debt. This allowed him to slash social 
programs, while underestimating the deficit by several billions 
of dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After that underhanded ploy, the federal government started a 
war of flags with the provinces, to promote its visibility while 
ignoring things such as the loss of efficiency, overlap, waste, 
not to mention its own constitution and the primary interests of 
the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Social transfers are at their lowest in 20 years. By the year 
2003, cuts to cash transfers will total $42 billion. These cuts 
have a major impact on our current health care system, in terms 
of access to quality care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone now agrees that the massive cuts made by Ottawa to the 
health care system are the primary cause of the very difficult 
times that our system has been going through in recent years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not the only ones saying that. I will quote some comments 
made by a few groups, including members of the former National 
Forum on Health, who are considered to be reasonable people by 
politicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me begin with the Canadian Medical Association. It says that 
the “cuts to federal transfers to the provinces for health and 
social programs have been the main obstacle to access to quality 
care for Canadians, and the reason for the most serious crisis 
of confidence regarding our health care system since the 
implementation of medicare, in the sixties”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That comment by the Canadian Medical Association can be found in 
a release published in <I>La Presse</I>, on September 22, 1998. The 
association is asking that the amounts cut by the federal be 
restored and indexed to take into account the cost increase for 
new technologies and the fact that the population is aging.

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Healthcare Association issued a press release on 
August 5, 1998 that included the following statement: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>[The federal government must] provide an immediate injection 
of cash and an appropriate growth mechanism for the Canada 
Health and Social Transfer to help meet the health needs of a 
growing and ageing population [—] 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the members of the former National Health Forum felt the 
need to clarify their recommendations, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recommended that $12.5 billion be the floor, not the 
ceiling. [—] The increase in transfer payments to the provinces 
should strengthen the health care system and this money should 
be invested where it has the greatest chance of producing 
positive results. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an article in the May 7, 1997 <I>Journal de Québec</I>, Jean Charest 
blamed the Prime Minister for the cuts that have affected the 
health care sector, and exonerated the Premier of Quebec.  This 
is what he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Bouchard, just like Messrs Harris, Filmon and Klein, has 
been forced to contend with Ottawa's unilateral cuts. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He pointed out that, during the last three years, the Liberals 
cut health and education transfers to the provinces and 
territories by 35%. 
He said this represented at least $6 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So Mr. Charest was right:  all the provinces are feeling the 
effects of the federal government's cuts.  Here are some of the 
headlines from the rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 13, 1998, the CBC reported the following:  “Manitobans 
are travelling to Dakota to seek treatment in mobile hospitals 
working out of tractor trailers along the American border.  To 
avoid the four-month wait in the public health care system, 
Manitobans are paying $1,300 US ($2,000 CAN) out of their own 
pockets for two MRIs, an amount that will not be reimbursed.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 6, 1998, <I>La Presse</I> reported: “Military medical officers 
are lending a hand in Newfoundland's overburdened emergency 
departments.  Thirty medical teams, made up of one physician and 
one assistant, will be providing services in rural and urban 
areas of the province starting in July.  An agreement has 
apparently been signed between the province and the federal 
Department of Defence in order to compensate for the physician 
shortage.  Doctors are complaining they are insufficiently 
paid”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To quote a French CBC report from April 6, 1998: “The government 
of Prince Edward Island will be calling on the private sector 
for construction of a new hospital.  According to the Minister 
of Health, the project will not be possible unless there is 
partial private-sector funding.  She refused, however, to 
disclose the amounts required”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another French CBC report, from February 25, 1998: “Anaesthetist 
shortage in New Brunswick.  The northeastern New Brunswick 
hospital corporation is seeking a second anaesthetist for the 
Acadian peninsula. 
Hiring this specialist will enable the Tracadie-Sheila hospital 
to provide day surgery, which the committee working to save the 
hospital has been demanding for two years”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to another French CBC report on February 27, 1998: 
“Edmonton hospitals have cancelled all non-emergency surgery. 
Emergency rooms and intensive care units are at full capacity in 
Edmonton, in large part because of the high number of cases of 
flu.  Some patients from the northern part of the province have 
had to be taken to Calgary or to Saskatchewan”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present government is telling us the provinces do not know 
how to administer their health care.  I want to tell it that the 
problem is not bad management by the provinces, but the huge 
cuts in the Canada social transfer.  All provinces have had to 
review their health systems.  Their reform was necessary. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1235"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is more, they had to do so under difficult conditions, 
because the government cut the funds that would otherwise have 
supported these health care reforms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is going on all over Canada, and not only in Quebec as some 
would like to think.  The health care system has been hit with 
massive cuts by this government. Attributing all these problems 
to bad decisions and poor management by the provinces is an act 
of bad faith. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, the health care reform was needed because the 
preceding Liberal government had refused to do it for nine 
years.  The reform should have taken place before the PQ 
government came to power, but the issue was a political hot 
potato. 
Mr. Bouchard had to implement measures to stabilize the system 
and he did so under unacceptable conditions, as I mentioned a 
few minutes ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to go on and really describe the adverse effects on 
the provinces, and Quebec especially, of the cuts to the health 
system, but unfortunately I am short of time.  I would like to 
say to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Finance and the 
Minister of Health that they should make amends and return to 
the provinces the money they so massively cut. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK24"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in reply to an earlier question the member for 
Timiskaming—Cochrane said that health care should be in the 
hands of citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is part of the problem as health care in the provinces is 
not in the hands of citizens.  It is administered mainly by 
hospitals which are either charities or incorporated non-profit 
organizations.  As such, there is a very low level of 
transparency among hospital organizations and in the 
implementation of medical care across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> What is happening in Quebec? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  I would like to put a question to the 
member. We are taking this debate very seriously.  I realize the 
Conservatives cannot take a debate in the House seriously but I 
think Bloc Quebecois members will listen to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a problem.  It is not the provinces that are 
mismanaging health.  The problem is there are no good, on the 
ground rules and standards of transparencies at the hospital 
level.  In my riding we know there are problems in the hospital 
where there are real inefficiencies and money being misspent and 
not enough money spent on services instead of administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member for Drummond agree that some standard from the 
federal government would be useful before the money is spent to 
ensure that all the provinces manage health care through their 
hospitals equally across the country? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to tell my hon. 
colleague that every hospital has a board of directors. Regional 
Health and Social Service Boards have one too. Citizens can tell 
those boards and their administrators what their needs are. 
Citizens are very well represented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is using every excuse in the book not to 
pay the provinces what is owed them. It is ironic that it 
managed to find millions of dollars to improve its visibility, 
fund its flag war, buy second-hand submarines and ram its 
millennium scholarship fund down our throats, while lacking 
political will. It has the arrogance to tell the provinces what 
to do and force them to come begging on bended knee. In the long 
run it is Canadians who are paying the price. 
<P><A NAME="LINK25"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand (Richmond—Arthabaska, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
earlier the member for Drummond mentioned the Canadian Medical 
Association. I would like to know whether she agrees with the 
CMA's proposal to earmark part of the CST for health care since, 
as we know, it currently includes health care as well as 
education and social assistance. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1240"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our friends in the Bloc Quebecois forgot to mention education, 
but I am sure it is an area close to their hearts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member agree to an initial transfer payment formula 
that would guarantee a certain amount for health services in 
order to avoid the kind of situation she mentioned? And if so, 
what percentage of the transfer would she like to see guaranteed 
for health care? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his 
question. I think it is very difficult to determine what portion 
of the transfer payment should be earmarked for each province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government cut the cash portion of the Canada social 
transfer to Quebec. It is extremely difficult to calculate which 
portion goes to education, social assistance or health care. In 
my speech today, I wanted to urge the federal government to 
restore the $2 billion it savagely cut from the Canada social 
transfer to Quebec. That is what I wanted to ask the federal 
government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK26"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank you for 
recognizing me. I am very happy to rise today in the House to 
tell you why I do not agree with the assumptions made in the Bloc 
Quebecois' motion concerning the Canadian social union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, I am glad to have this opportunity today to explain to 
our fellow citizens throughout Canada how the motion before us 
is linked to previous federal-provincial-territorial discussions 
where there are winners and losers and where everyone tries to 
see where everybody else fits in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With social union in Canada, there should only be winners, no 
losers, and these winners should not be one level of government 
or the other, but the people of Canada themselves. 
In this respect, social union in Canada has made huge progress 
which I would like to address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But first, I want to talk a little bit about our public 
finances, since the hon. member for Témiscamingue stated earlier 
that Quebeckers would rather pay their taxes directly to the 
province of Quebec which could, in turn, use this tax revenue to 
support health services and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out to the hon. member for Témiscamingue that 
the taxes Ottawa sends back to the province of Quebec are much 
higher than the taxes collected in Quebec. For instance, with 
only 25% of the population in Canada, the province of Quebec 
gets 31% of the Canada social transfer. 
As far as equalization goes, Quebeckers, who account for 25% of 
Canada's population, receive 47% of the equalization budget, 
which means $4 billion each year for the Quebec government to 
spend as it pleases to make sure that Quebeckers have access to 
quality services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Mr. Bouchard's government, whom the members opposite are 
trying to defend, has chosen to make more cuts in health care 
than in other areas, that is its problem, its responsibility, 
and it will be accountable for that to the voters of Quebec. But 
I do not like it when the members opposite use the House of 
Commons to support Mr. Bouchard's campaign, saying that the 
health care situation has absolutely nothing to do with 
mismanagement by Quebec's health minister and by Mr. Bouchard's 
government and with the bad choices they made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the area of manpower and active employment measures, 
Quebeckers pay 23% of the employment insurance envelope but 
receive 31% of the budget under the manpower agreement that we 
have signed. It is another area where Quebeckers receive a lot 
more than the federal taxes they pay.

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say a few words about the ice storm, which gave the 
Canadian social union concept a very tangible meaning in our 
cities and villages in Quebec. The government of Canada will pay 
90% of the costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the funding we owe to the municipalities is being 
withheld by the Quebec government. This subject comes up 
constantly at Treasury Board. But I would like to say how useful 
the Canadian social union is for Quebeckers, who receive a 
substantial share of federal funds. 
As the member for Papineau—Saint-Denis, I benefit from the social 
solidarity that we enjoy in Canada and I am very proud of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to tell members about five improvements that were 
negotiated with the provinces in recent years, including the 
national child benefit. The two levels of government in this 
country wanted to do something about child poverty. This is why, 
in the current three-year period, we will be allocating an 
additional $1.7 billion to fight child poverty, through the 
national child benefit system that was negotiated with the 
provinces, which are partners of the federal government 
regarding this initiative. This shows the flexibility displayed 
by our government to renew Canadian federalism, while helping 
solve the problem of child poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec government will benefit from a budget increase of 
$150 million to implement its family policy and day care 
program, thanks to the increased flexibility provided by the 
federal government's national child benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The labour market agreements helped us settle an old dispute, 
while the new Employment Insurance Act enabled us to better help 
the unemployed get back to work. In the next five years, will 
give to the Quebec government an annual amount of over $500 
million to help its unemployed get back to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian social union is working very well, and I should 
repeat that while Quebeckers make 23% of the total contributions 
to the employment insurance fund, they get 31% of the budget 
spent through active employment measures and training funds. 
This means a net gain for our fellow Quebeckers. 
We are pleased about this because this is what Canadian 
solidarity and the Canadian social union are all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also re-established the employment ministers forum so as to 
work on, among other things, the matter of unemployment among 
young people, which is dividing the country and hurting us.  We 
are determined to beat the problem of high unemployment among 
the young.  This is a priority of the labour ministers forum. 
We meet regularly.  This priority around our Youth Employment 
Strategy and the provincial programs where we co-ordinate our 
benefits much more effectively also represents significant 
progress in the Canadian social union to the advantage of our 
friends in Quebec, once again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have a new employability assistance program for persons 
with disabilities. 
This employability assistance program replaces the former 
occupational rehabilitation program for persons with 
disabilities, a program that expanded from $168 million to $193 
million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And what about this assistance to help people with disabilities 
readapt?  It is a framework agreement, a broad and multilateral 
one, that covers all of Canada, but within this agreement, we 
have signed individual agreements with each of the provinces so 
that the framework agreement applies differently within each of 
the provinces, according to the priorities each has set. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This then is the state of the Canadian social union at the 
moment.  It represents real solidarity among Canadians.  It is 
totally flexible and attuned to the needs of each of the 
provinces in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year, we also considerably improved the student loans 
system in Canada.  The level of debt is very high in Canada, as 
you know, and we took major steps in the latest budget to 
improve the student loans system in Canada, a system that is 
receiving greater funding.  To improve our system of student 
loans in Canada, we consulted with the provinces, the banks and 
student associations.  I think we came up with a student loan 
system that will help to considerably reduce student debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are modernizing the country and we are building real social 
partnerships. 
I would like today to thank all the provincial ministers I have 
had the opportunity of working with in recent years.  Together, 
we have shown that, for children, for persons with disabilities 
and for students across the country, the two levels of 
government can rise above petty partisan squabbles and narrow 
debates over jurisdictional issues.  What all governments really 
want in this country is to serve our fellow citizens so they may 
have a bright future. 
<P><A NAME="LINK27"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister 
began his speech with the old refrain.  I have the feeling I 
have been listening to the same tape for a number of years now. 
It all sounds the same.  He is even using the same figures, when 
in fact things have changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things the minister mentioned was fluctuations in the 
EI fund.  I would have liked him to tell us that, in Quebec's 
case, the fluctuations are all on the positive side of the 
ledger, with that province contributing $475 billion more than 
it receives in EI.  Quebec contributes to the EI surplus but the 
government leaves it out of those programs where we receive more 
than we pay.  This is simply not right, and he knows it. 
Quebec does indeed make a contribution, leaving us behind and 
the federal government ahead, with our money to throw around as 
it sees fit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He cleverly avoided saying anything about the Saskatoon 
consensus.  Nowhere in his speech was there any reference to it. 
Will he tell me which of the four principles in the motion 
about the Saskatoon consensus is not worthy of implementation? 
Which of the four components in the motion—which he probably has 
in front of him—is he unable to approve and support?  I would 
dearly love to hear what he has to say about this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for Témiscamingue.  I would invite him to carefully reread what 
I said from my notes just now.  What I said—and he says my 
figures were wrong—is that Quebeckers contributed 23% of the 
employment insurance fund and were the recipients of 31% of the 
envelope in active measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is extremely important is that these people, who are 
constantly complaining of not having their fair share, receive 
more than their share in several areas. The hon. member for 
Témiscamingue did not mention the $4 billion Quebec receives in 
equalization payments, close to $4 billion, which represents 47% 
of the equalization payment budget.  That is a sum Mr. Bouchard 
could have invested in health or education, had he wanted to, 
for those $4 billion are given by the Canadian government with 
no conditions attached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week, I followed the work on social union very closely, 
because my colleague, the Minister of Justice, was there 
representing the Government of Canada.  I was very pleased that, 
at the end of the day, this federal-provincial discussion ended 
on an optimistic note.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am confident that we will manage to modernize the Canadian 
social union for the benefit of Canadians. There has been 
concrete progress at the sector tables to which I have referred, 
namely improvement in measures against child poverty.  The 
national child benefit that was negotiated with the provinces in 
a superb partnership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a new employability program for the disabled, a 
framework agreement but one that is renegotiated individually 
with each province.  I have already mentioned some of the 
others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The progress already made in each of these sectors encourages me 
to believe that, where social union in general is concerned, we 
definitely have an agreement that will serve our fellow 
citizens, not to try to play one level of government against 
another.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I have two questions for the Minister 
of Human Resources Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first one is he mentioned that the federal government's 
program is flexible and adaptable to the provinces.  If that is 
the case, why have both British Columbia and Alberta been fined 
for being flexible in their programs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second question is he referred to his government as 
modernizing the federation, a true partnership.  My understanding 
is that the Liberal government since taking office has cut 
transfers to the provinces by 23%.  True partnerships are 50:50. 
He has reneged on his commitment of that partnership.  When is he 
going— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The Minister of Human 
Resources Development, a very short answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:</B>  Madam Speaker, if the official 
opposition had voted for the legislation, it would have helped 
the House a great deal in proceeding the way that she wants to 
go. But that is typical of Reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The flexibility I have described is absolutely remarkable. It is 
absolutely the way we have applied it to every program that I 
talked about.  Whether we are talking about the national child 
benefit or employment for disabled Canadians, these are national 
frameworks which are adapted to the realities of each province. 
<P><A NAME="LINK29"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it has been interesting listening to 
the debate on the motion this morning.  The motion is basically 
in support of the provincial premiers and the provincial 
governments that met in Saskatoon in drafting up the social union 
and then coming to an agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate seems to have narrowed down to wanting more money for 
health care.  I do not deny that is an important issue, however I 
feel this is far greater than just a debate on whether or not we 
get more money for health care.  This is a debate on the future 
of our country and the relationship between the federal and 
provincial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that the relationship we have had over the past 30 
years has not worked very well.  What we are looking for is a 
relationship between the federal government and the provincial 
governments that will be progressive, that will be futuristic and 
that will work in the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was interesting to listen to my colleague across the floor, 
the Minister for Human Resources Development talk about this 
government modernizing and being progressive.  I suggest that 
just is not so.  This government is dragging its feet.  It is 
looking at the old way of doing things, the old way of 
domination.  It is not looking at a new progressive partnership 
with the provinces.  It is incumbent upon the government to 
listen to the debate today on how we are looking for a new 
progressive partnership with the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are not showing leadership.  They are not showing 
Canadians that they know what leadership is all about when they 
refuse to accept the premiers' outreach in changing the 
relationship between the federal and provincial governments so 
that it will work better in the future.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government really should reconsider its opposition 
to what is being proposed by the premiers. I find it amusing that 
even the separatist party in the House of Commons, the Bloc, 
seems to be doing more for national unity than the Liberal 
government of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to introduce to the House some comments out of the 
new Canada act which the Reform Party presented to the House in 
the spring.  This is an attempt by the Reform Party to deal with 
some issues to modernize our government so it will be ready for 
the 21st century.  We suggested a few things and in Saskatoon the 
premiers seemed to agree with our intent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We suggested that there should be limits on federal government 
spending power.  The federal government should not just walk in 
and take over provincial jurisdiction because it has money to 
spend.  We felt that the federal government should not be 
financing new programs unless there is support from the 
provinces.  We used a figure of seven provinces having over 50% 
of the population.  The premiers have agreed to a lesser mark 
than that. The premiers are being very generous in saying it just 
needs the majority of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel that any province that chooses not to participate should 
receive a grant equal to the population of the province 
multiplied by the per capita spending of the federal government 
for that new program. The provinces have agreed to something even 
more controlling and more definitive than that. The provinces are 
being very generous in agreeing to this partnership with the 
federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We go on to mention other things in this resolution.  We mention 
a dispute resolution mechanism.  We feel it is necessary to 
establish the parameters of how a disagreement is going to be 
handled up front before getting into that situation.  Again we 
are far more stringent in our presentation than the premiers. The 
premiers have agreed to something that is more generous with the 
federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it very interesting that the premiers seem to be reaching 
out.  They seem to be willing to accommodate.  The premiers are 
willing to be flexible, to use the minister's word.  I find no 
flexibility in the federal government's approach.  I find no 
flexibility in this old way of doing business with the provinces, 
this old concept that someone has to be in charge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government talks about partnerships. A partnership is when 
people work together on an equal basis, respect each other's 
authority under the constitution and respect each other's 
position at the bargaining table.  That is missing from the 
federal government.  It does not seem to be willing to be a true 
partner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues have talked about the cuts to transfer payments 
and that is a fact.  That is something the other side cannot 
argue.  It is a fact that in the last four years this government 
cut 23% of transfers to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not consider that to be a fair partnership.  When the 
federal government originally got into the Canada Health Act, a 
fair partnership was an agreement of 50% funding.  The federal 
government said to the provinces  “We want you to do this; we 
agree to do this and we will fund you 50%”. Now the federal 
government is only funding 23%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the commitment to that partnership, to that 
relationship?  I would suggest it does not exist.  Because it 
does not exist, because the federal government is fronting less 
than a quarter, it has lost the moral right to place demands on 
the provinces.  The federal government has lost the moral right 
to have the controls it insists on.  The government has no moral 
authority to be taking the leadership position when it is only a 
minor shareholder in that partnership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time for this government to take some leadership, to 
recognize the fact that 10 provincial premiers met and discussed 
this social union and lo and behold all 10 of them agreed.  That 
must have been a very momentous occasion, something we do not see 
very often in this country.  Ten premiers, 10 provinces agreeing 
to look at the fundamentals of an agreement.

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ten provinces have recognized the need to work together not for 
power or control, but because that is the best way they see of 
providing services to their people. Like all of us, they have to 
seek election, seek the support of their electorate.  They are 
accountable to the electorate for their actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ten premiers have reached a consensus and what do we have?  A 
federal government holding out and saying it does not care what 
the 10 have agreed on.  It is unbelievable what our Prime 
Minister has said.  To quote the Prime Minister, he said “If 
they”—the premiers—“do not want to take what I am offering, 
they take nothing”. For somebody who is negotiating and trying 
to get a partnership working, that kind of an attitude does 
nothing for co-operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has to change its attitude. It has to be more 
willing to change the way it does business with the provinces. If 
the federal government wants to show leadership to keep this 
country together, in developing new meaningful partnerships with 
the provinces not only on the social union but in other things as 
well, it will have to have the attitude to make it work.  If it 
will not let it work and if it is going to turn its back on 
something that 10 provinces have agreed to, I do not consider 
that to be a partnership at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to caution the Bloc members.  I think that they are 
using this as an attempt to show that Canadians will not support 
them when the government, hopefully does not, but it looks like 
it is not going to be co-operative.  I caution the Bloc because 
what I see here with the 10 premiers coming up with a consensus 
is that the process does work within confederation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process of negotiating for the best for our citizens does 
work.  The problem is the players.  The problem is people like 
the Prime Minister and his cabinet and the people on that side of 
the House who refuse to modernize their thinking and change the 
way of doing things, of governing the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest to the Bloc that there is a process. Canadians 
can work these things out within confederation.  We can be equal 
partners.  We can respect each other's positions and it can 
happen within Canada.  We need to make sure that we have a 
government on the other side that respects that position and is 
willing to work within it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK30"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, the member spoke repeatedly about partnership and 
leadership. As I understand it what the 10 premiers agreed upon 
was that they would take no leadership from the federal 
government in the matter of how they would spend the social and 
health transfers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest to the member that surely as we do live in a 
country that is an assemblage of provinces and territories we 
should expect leadership from the national government and the 
national government should demand to have representation in how 
the national government's money is spent.  Otherwise how will we 
ever have high standards of health care that are universal across 
the country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member at least consider allowing that the Government 
of Canada should have a say in establishing standards of health 
care all across the country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Madam Speaker, I think the member has 
it all wrong.  That is not at all what the provinces are saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces are saying that in a partnership there has to be a 
consensus as to where the money is going and that the federal 
government has no business buying its way into provincial 
jurisdictions. It has no business going into another social 
program, another health program, without the approval and the 
support of the majority of the provinces. That is a realistic 
thing to ask of the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces are not saying they do not want the federal 
government involved and they will not let it determine where it 
is going to spend, but talk to the provinces and get some 
consensus at the provincial level so that they are on board. It 
is this dictatorial way of coming in, spending the money and 
telling the provinces where in their jurisdiction the money will 
be spent that is the problem. 
I will say that from my own experience, the provinces often have 
a better idea of where that money should be spent than somebody 
sitting here in Ottawa 3,000 miles away.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I suspect what we are really discussing here is a matter of 
economics, that at some point, the federal government look— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B> Madam 
Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  I sought to be recognized 
by the Chair.  The tradition in the House with respect to 
questions and comments is that if a person from a party other 
than the member who has spoken— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am afraid that is 
not a point of order.  The hon. member for Nanaimo—Cowichan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley:</B>  Madam Speaker, the hon. member will 
realize that you win some and you lose some. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that this is a case of sheer economics.  At some 
point the federal government looked at its piggy bank and decided 
it did not have enough money to pass on to the provinces.  Its 
own fiscal house was not in order.  It was in serious trouble, in 
debt and its budgets were not balanced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was no other recourse for the provinces.  They knew they 
had to get the money from some place. What the provinces then 
have to do is tax the people even more with all kinds of 
ingenious taxes, ones we have never heard of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this is a problem of economics and it is the federal 
government that has caused this problem with its own fiscal 
mismanagement, could my colleague make any suggestions how the 
federal government could have taken care of this problem without 
putting the burden on the provinces?  Could the government here 
in Ottawa have done something to change that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Madam Speaker, this is more than an 
economics problem.  I appreciate what people are saying. Yes, the 
government could have found the money by more carefully spending 
it in other areas which took priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is much more than an economics issue.  This is a question 
of respecting the jurisdictions that were given to the provinces 
and the federal government under the British North America Act, 
our original constitution.  It is about respecting the foresight 
of our Fathers of Confederation when they were trying to bring 
all these entities together as a country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we go back to respecting that issue, it is about money but it 
is about far more than money. 
<P><A NAME="LINK32"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I would like to begin by saying that it is timely that 
we have the opportunity to debate the social union.  A lot is 
happening.  There is the Saskatoon consensus of the premiers. 
There are ongoing discussions between parties in this House with 
respect to how we might come together, particularly the 
opposition parties if it is possible to arrive at a working 
position that we can advance together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all reacting to a reality that has been imposed on the 
Canadian public by the Liberal government.  That is the massive 
cuts to federal transfer payments to health and post-secondary 
education which came in the form of the creation of the Canada 
health and social transfer, the cover under which the federal 
Liberals moved to do what they said they would never do and that 
is to massively undermine medicare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a great irony in the sense that the Liberals often want 
to take credit for the creation of medicare.  They do not tell us 
that they first promised it in their platform of 1919 and did not 
deliver it until 1966 when they were in a minority parliament 
under pressure from the NDP.  It took them that long to bring 
medicare into being.  It has only taken them a couple of years in 
government, five years, since 1993, to almost completely destroy 
medicare and create conditions in which the provinces now come 
together to advocate a radically different way of dealing with 
health care in this country with respect to the establishment of 
national standards.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though one is disinclined both individually and as a party 
toward this kind of so-called decentralization, one almost has to 
agree with them.  As another member said, there is no moral high 
ground left on that side of the House when it comes to the 
federal authority to regulate health care.  They have completely 
abandoned their share of financing our health care system.  Yet 
they parade around like they are the great saviours of medicare 
and like they have the moral high ground when it comes to health 
care.  They have no moral high ground at all.  They are in the 
gutter when it comes to this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are the ones, contrary to everything they ever promised, 
contrary to everything they ever said, who have become the 
architects of medicare's demise if the country, other political 
parties, the provinces and all of us together cannot act in some 
way to wake up these people as to what is happening in our 
hospitals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Across the country people are not getting the kinds of services 
they need.  People are having to wait longer for surgery and for 
diagnostic services.  There are all kinds of horror stories, 
anecdotal but nevertheless persuasive and convincing, because the 
federal government is not exactly funding a study to see how its 
cuts have affected health care and post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We certainly agree with that element of the motion which 
condemns the government for its cutbacks in transfer payments to 
the provinces.  We condemn the Prime Minister for rejecting out 
of hand the work the premiers have done.  He does not have to 
agree completely with the premiers, but he does not have to be so 
cryptic and so dismissive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He could say yes, very interesting; some good ideas there; let 
us have a look at them.  Instead we get the same kind of 
arrogance from across the way that we see with respect to APEC 
and numerous other examples that the Prime Minister has provided 
for us in recent years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion also talks about support from a majority of provinces 
before new federal initiatives are introduced in areas of 
provincial jurisdiction.  This is very general language.  I have 
to say I am not completely comfortable with it in the sense that 
we would not have had medicare if we had to wait for a majority 
of provinces to agree because a majority of provinces did not 
agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very leery about this kind of language.  I would like to 
know more about what it means before I would certainly agree 
either personally or on behalf of my party and caucus as the 
intergovernmental affairs critic.  I will read from the motion: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>the right for a province to opt out, with full compensation, of a 
new or modified Canada-wide federal government social program in 
areas of provincial jurisdiction when the province offers a 
program or introduces an initiative in the same field. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern is that this actually goes beyond Meech and beyond 
Charlottetown because it says “new or modified”.  In Meech and 
Charlottetown it talked about new programs.  My concern is about 
the introduction of the word “modified” Canada wide program. 
It seems to me that some people might want to argue that if any 
changes were made to the Canada Health Act or to medicare this 
would be a modified program and that this might create the 
conditions under which some provinces could argue that they would 
be able to opt out of medicare.  I would certainly be against 
that.  I am sure all my colleagues share my concerns about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is some tricky language here.  I am not sure exactly what 
it means, but it certainly goes beyond other proposals which have 
created a lot of concern in the country in the past.  I think 
this language, new or modified programs, would certainly create 
those concerns again and perhaps in an even more significant way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not surprised that my colleague from the Reform Party does 
not seem to be as worried about the language as I am. Frankly I 
think they would like to see medicare broken up into 10 different 
systems with very little, if any, national participation 
whatsoever.  The motion continues: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>new co-operation mechanisms in order to avoid conflicts or settle 
them equitably. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would have been much happier with this aspect of the motion 
if it had intimated or, even better, said that we are talking 
about new ways to set and to enforce national standards.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the total lack of moral high ground on the other side and 
given the diminishing participation of the federal government, I 
would agree that there may be a case now for the provinces having 
more say, in conjunction with the federal government, in mutually 
defining what national standards would be when it came to health 
care, when it came to medicare, and how those are to be enforced. 
However that is not what this says.  It may be that the hon. 
member for Témiscamingue was being deliberately general in this 
in order to have a more broadly based discussion.  If that is the 
case then that was an admirable goal, but if it was a deliberate 
attempt not to talk about national standards then this would be a 
matter of concern for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As someone who has argued in the past for the ability of the 
federal government to set standards, to enforce the five 
principles of medicare and to punish provinces for not adhering 
to them, I find it very difficult in this context, not in theory, 
to continue to defend that position when the Liberals have cut so 
much from federal contributions to health care.  It becomes a 
weaker and weaker argument every time they do that, and I regret 
that very much.  I wish they regretted it and I wish they would 
put more money back into health care, recover the high ground and 
be able to say with some confidence and some authority that they 
want to have a strong voice in the setting of national standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern that needs to be expressed in any debate about 
the social union is the ongoing concerns of the aboriginal 
community with respect to how the development of any social union 
might impinge upon its relationship with the federal government 
which it sees as having, and rightly so, a fiduciary 
responsibility or relationship that it feels would be undermined 
by a social union which did not take account of that in some 
particular way.  I see nothing in the motion that reflects that 
particular concern either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons I think the debate should continue about 
the social union.  I think there is opportunity here for 
Canadians to work together.  The premiers have already 
demonstrated this.  The opposition parties are working together 
on this to some degree.  I think it is time for the federal 
government to realistically engage in this debate instead of just 
posturing as the great defenders of medicare and acting as if the 
rest of us are all just beyond the pale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not so.  These people are culpable in many respects for 
the current situation.  They need to face up to that reality and 
to deal with all Canadians in answering the question of how we 
can improve our health care system and how we can maintain it in 
such a way that Canadians have access to the same quality of 
service no matter where they live in the country.

member of the House.  He will remember, particularly during the 
Mulroney years, that the federal government transferred a large 
proportion of tax points to the provinces for social spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest to the hon. member that this has seriously 
eroded the ability of the federal government to intervene in the 
delivery of health care and social spending by the provinces.  At 
the rate we are going with the transfer of actual tax points, the 
that federal government would have little to say in this entire 
debate would be quite academic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member support a return of those tax points?  If 
after due debate the House decided that we wanted to reverse the 
process of giving provinces absolute control over federal money, 
how they would spend it in social spending, and turn the calendar 
back so that the federal government had more power and could 
intervene in setting standards and play a more active role than 
appears to be the case now, would the member support that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that tax points were part of the federal-provincial 
fiscal relationship long before the Mulroney government.  It 
would be quite wrong to suggest that somehow this was a new 
development, something that developed after the Conservative 
government in 1984. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member wants to go back, maybe he should go back to the 
first unilateral cutback in federal transfer payments to the 
provinces which was done by a Liberal government under Allan 
MacEachen in 1982. 
That was the beginning of the problem we have now.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1977 we had an agreement that set up block funding which was 
different from the 50:50 arrangement that existed from the time 
of the creation of medicare.  There were people who warned then, 
notably the NDP, that the creation of this block funding would 
eventually lead to the erosion of medicare and the erosion of the 
ability of federal government to maintain and enforce national 
standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of the block funding led to a crisis in the late 
1970s and early 1980s which led to the Canada Health Act.  Tax 
points are part of the equation.  Our position would be that 
there needs to be a strong and much more significant than we have 
now cash portion of the federal transfer payment, so much so that 
it would give the federal government the ability to speak with 
some moral authority when it came to the maintenance of national 
standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sorry but they just do not have it any more. They gave it 
away as a result of successive cutbacks to the CHST.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I thank 
the hon. member for sharing his concerns about the social union. 
I am sure we will have an opportunity in the coming weeks to 
address some of his concerns, particularly those regarding 
aboriginal peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject of compliance with the Canada Health Act, we will 
let the provinces speak for themselves. However, the provinces 
have been saying all along that they want to maintain a 
universal health care system, which should alleviate the 
member's concerns as to how the health system would be managed 
if they were to become more actively involved than they are now 
in its management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure we agree on the need to put new money into health 
care. I would like to know if the member thinks the priority to 
put new money into the health system is best met through the 
current Canada Health and Social Transfer or if he supports the 
federal government's plan to initiate new programs on its own. 
For instance, if $2 billion were to be invested in health care 
next year, should it go into the existing Canada Health and 
Social Transfer or into some new initiative unilaterally put in 
place by the federal government? I would like to hear him on how 
new money should be invested in health care. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, with respect to any 
decision by the federal government to inject new money into the 
health care, it should be done by restoring cuts.  That by 
definition would be money that would go to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless the government is to put billions and billions of dollars 
back into the system, I would not regard anything as new money. 
I would regard it as money that never should have been taken away 
that is being given back.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand (Richmond—Arthabaska, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise today on an issue that members of the 
Progressive Conservative Party know well. We are talking about 
the social union, but we used to call it the Canadian pact. 
This, of course, was part of our 1997 election platform. If I 
have enough time, I will be pleased to indicate to the House the 
similarities that exist between the two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members pointed out earlier the advantage for the provinces 
to have worked together and reached an agreement. That is the 
positive side. It was the same for the Calgary declaration. It 
was a small starting point. The provinces and territories are 
doing the work. Why? Because Liberals are not doing their job. 
The success achieved by the provinces in the social union is 
linked to a lack of leadership from the government. It is a 
causality link. Liberals are not doing their job, so the 
provinces are doing it for them. 
The Liberal government should show much more inclination and 
willingness to greet positively what is happening in the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The message that we want to send, both to Quebec and to the rest 
of the country, is that, if there are problems in 
federal-provincial relations, it is not necessarily because of 
the provinces. Perhaps we should look at the other side of the 
House, where the Liberals are sitting. But there is hope if the 
provinces are able to talk to each other. That is the 
interesting thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other point I would like to make—and I did so earlier 
in a question I asked this morning—is that the social 
union is not only a health issue, but also an education and a 
social assistance issue. It is not only a money issue. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1330"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT30"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT30"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1330

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea behind social union is not only to say that we want 
six, seven or eight billion dollars more. It is a way of putting 
in place a new and effective system of federal-provincial 
relations. We must see beyond money and health issues, even 
though they are also very important. The health issue was raised 
this morning by my colleagues from the Bloc. I share their view. 
Education also is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, what we are saying is that social union must go a little 
further, but, as I indicated, I will talk about that later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk to the motion put today by my colleague 
from Témiscamingue. Of course, it talks about money. 
The provincial ministers of finance proposed many solutions 
involving cash and tax points over three, four or five years. 
These are all very interesting solutions provided that the 
so-called team captain, in this case the Prime Minister, agrees 
to co-operate. But that co-operation is not there at the moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The deadline for the social union is December 31. Madam Speaker, 
I do not know the state of your personal finances, but if you 
have money, do not bet on that, unless the federal government 
decides to be more open. The social union project appears to be 
in jeopardy. Can we already talk about failure?  No, because the 
very fact that the provinces and territories reached an 
agreement is a great success. But since the federal government 
is not there, that achievement seems likely to be turned into a 
failure, unfortunately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, I would like to come back to the social issue, more 
specifically to the circumstances leading to the need for more 
money. 
But there is the principle of clarifying federal-provincial 
relations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk about the points made in the motion 
presented by my colleague from the Bloc. Restoring the level of 
contributions is a question of money, of course, and it is 
important. I agree with 98% of the Bloc's arguments, which says 
it is Ottawa's fault. In effect, Ottawa is the one behind it 
all. But I disagree—and I rate this at 2%—with its arguments 
because the Quebec government is doing to municipalities what 
the federal government is doing to the provinces. I know, I was 
a mayor long enough. So, it is sometimes neither black nor 
white, but grey. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is interesting, though, is the support of a majority of 
provinces before initiating new federal incursions into sectors 
under provincial jurisdiction. It is fantastic. But what could 
first be clarified is what is neither under federal nor 
provincial jurisdiction. It is said that health care falls under 
provincial jurisdiction. 
That is all fine and good, but how many hundreds of millions of 
dollars in health research are funded by the federal government? 
The tens and hundreds of millions of dollars spent by the 
federal government in research seem to be accepted by Quebec and 
the other provinces. And what about the granting councils? Do 
they come under federal or provincial jurisdiction? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must sit down and look at all areas of jurisdiction, and not 
necessarily make constitutional changes—we have not reached 
that point yet—but maybe establish correctly the different 
areas of jurisdiction and, after that, look at how we can manage 
them for the benefit of Quebeckers and Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, it is important to clarify the areas of jurisdiction, 
because some people always consider our country as being upside 
down or the other way around. 
Maybe we should liken this country to a tree, with the roots 
meaning we are all working toward a common goal, and the leaves 
representing the whole population. Maybe that is how we should 
look at it. The federal government and the provinces alike want 
to be at the top of the pyramid, to have jurisdiction over it. 
But ultimately, the most important in all this is the population 
we are here to serve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, there is also the provincial right to opt out 
with full compensation. I am not sure we really understand what 
it actually means. Opting out means you take your money and 
leave. But it seems now that it is not quite that simple. You 
take the money, but you somehow have to spend it in the same 
jurisdiction and to work toward the same goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not really opting out, except administratively. If we 
really want what the Progressive Conservative Party calls a 
Canadian pact and the provinces call social union, there cannot 
be any opting-out, because we have to agree on certain rules or 
standards.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My NDP colleague raised concerns about the national standards to 
be set by the federal government. That is not our position. We 
are suggesting instead a Canadian pact office with federal and 
provincial representatives who are going to first set and then 
implement the national standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we have standards, if for some reason a province should 
decide to opt out, it should still abide by the standards of the 
Canadian pact or social union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some real progress has been made and I congratulate the people 
and premier of Quebec on this. This is not the same concept of 
opting out we had back in the 1970s or the 1980s. 
It is a right to opt out because some things, some programs have 
been put forward. This will be done in the same spirit, except 
that we might like to manage things. And why not, since the 
provinces have often shown they can manage things better than 
the federal government. I do not have a problem with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be well understood that we are saying that, if we agree 
on the rules, the standards, the basics relating to the Canadian 
pact or social union, we cannot have a right to opt out, pure 
and simple. Should it be an administrative opting out? Sure, why 
not, as long as we abide by the rules. It is nonetheless 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is so important that if we do not have that, we cannot have a 
dispute settlement mechanism. How can we have a dispute 
settlement mechanism without agreeing on the main points? 
What we are proposing is a Canadian pact office which, once it 
has decided how it should work, and decided of course on the 
funding, will set the rules so we can settle any potential 
problems. Of course we do not like conflicts. That is why we 
need well established rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a province chooses to opt out, or if a province that opted in 
mismanages a program, there will be enforcement mechanisms with 
teeth—not only a slap on the wrist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people seem to have a problem with that. I apologize for 
talking about Quebec in particular, but I feel it is important. 
Even though any analogy is lame, may I remind the House that, 
when the free trade agreements were negotiated, a dispute 
settlement mechanism was put in place. Everybody agrees on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we have an agreement on social union, what we call a Canadian 
pact, it is normal to have a dispute settlement process inasmuch 
as we agree on the terms of this social union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would like to stress the fact that the 
provinces must persevere. If I am not mistaken, the next meeting 
will be held in Winnipeg two weeks from now. I hope the Minister 
of Justice will be more voluble. Of course, she had to 
understand what was going on at the provincial level. Perhaps 
this proves once again that there is a dichotomy between what 
goes on here in Ottawa and the reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the provinces that they should persevere and resist 
temptation, and I ask the federal government to start showing 
more leadership.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
debate on the social union initiated this morning by the Bloc 
Quebecois is taking place against the backdrop of an economic 
downturn, which makes it all the more urgent to adopt a series 
of measures to reinvest in the economy the money accumulated at 
the expense of everyone but the Minister of Finance to stimulate 
economic growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have suggested, and we are doing it again in this debate, 
that an increase in the social transfer could, in part, serve 
that purpose, particularly to finance social security, 
post-secondary education and, of course, health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since mid-August, the Bloc Quebecois has been warning the federal 
government that a major economic downturn and even a recession 
could be expected in the next few months. 
In August, we could already see some signs of this, since the 
growth in the GDP had been slowing down for three consecutive 
months, that is in April, May and June. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1340"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT32"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT32"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1340

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last Thursday, Statistics Canada announced a decrease in the 
growth of the GDP for the fourth month in a row, which means 
that, according to the figures registered or estimated by 
Statistics Canada, the Canadian economy lost over $5 billion in 
the last four months, which means about $200 per person in 
Canada. In four months, due to negative growth, $200 from our 
pockets were completely squandered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two more months of economic downturn will usher in a full 
recession. Six months in a row of reduced growth of the GDP is 
the very definition of a recession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two major factors explain the downturn in the economy we have 
been seeing in the past four months. First, there is the Asian 
crisis which is exacerbated by the crisis in the former 
countries of the Soviet Union, mainly Russia. Those two crisis 
combined have resulted in an increase in uncertainty all over 
the world, in a decrease in the value of our exports of raw 
materials, especially to Southeast Asia, which in turn resulted 
in a decrease in the demand for the Canadian dollar and 
therefore a fall in the value of our currency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the face of this world uncertainty, speculators have turned 
to what are called safe havens, in particular the U.S. dollar 
which they have bought in large quantities. They shied away from 
the Canadian dollar, thus accentuating the downward pressure on 
our currency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everywhere, the consequences of this crisis have been enormous. 
The fall of the Canadian dollar may be profitable in the short 
term for the tourism industry, for example, but it is not 
profitable in the long run in the high tech sector, in 
particular in those sectors where inputs have to be bought in 
the United States, in those sectors where high tech electronic 
equipment must be bought at higher prices. Since Canadian 
business must pay more for this equipment, we become less 
competitive at a time where we are already facing an economic 
downturn not only nationally, not only in Quebec and in Canada, 
but also internationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second factor responsible for the decrease in Canada's GDP 
is the federal government. 
For several years we have been telling the government that it 
cannot make deep cuts in social programs, such as health care, 
post-secondary education and welfare, and in transfers to the 
provinces in general, help itself to the employment insurance 
fund surplus and maintain artificially high taxes without 
causing an economic slowdown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In four years of Liberal government, taxes going into the 
federal treasury increased by $37 billion. Individual taxpayers 
had to pay $20 billion more in federal taxes, and businesses had 
to pay $17 billion more. 
These $37 billion taken out of the economy inevitably 
contributed to the economic downturn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The artificially high employment insurance premium rates are 
just another tax in disguise, adding to the tax burden of 
businesses. In a situation where the economy is slowing down and 
where the cost of buying foreign goods has increased because of 
our falling Canadian dollar, now is not the time to maintain 
premium rates at the current high level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is responsible for the economic downturn because 
it has failed to substantially reduce EI premiums and because it 
has chosen to maintain high taxes. 
It is also responsible because of the billions of dollars it 
took away from the unemployed two years ago with its employment 
insurance reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government cannot continue taking more money from taxpayers. 
It cannot maintain all kinds of taxes in disguise, such as EI 
premiums for employers, and think the economy will keep on 
going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the debt reduction policy is also partly responsible 
for the low Canadian dollar and for the harmful effects of its 
fall.

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taking a lot of money, billions and billions of dollars, to pay 
back part of the debt, can look good. That is what the Prime 
Minister bragged about last summer. In 15 months, the federal 
government used $20 billion, which amounts to the surplus found 
in the employment insurance fund, because the premium rates are 
too high, or to one and a half times the health budget. They 
used $20 billion to pay back part of the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What impact did this $20 billion payment have on the Canadian 
and world markets? 
It flooded the money market with new Canadian dollars, which 
reduced the value of the loonie. That is what this federal 
policy did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To understand the situation, one has to know who the Canadian 
debtholders are. In Canada, 25% of debt securities, bonds, etc. 
issued by the federal government are held by foreigners, almost 
half of whom are American. What did these people do when we 
bought back our securities, as the Minister of Finance did? What 
did they do? They exchanged their new Canadian dollars for US 
dollars, because they are Americans, and by doing so they 
flooded the Canadian money market with new Canadian dollars, 
which, in turn, decreased the value of the loonie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other debtholders are chartered banks, pension funds, 
insurance funds. These people were looking, especially last 
summer, for the best return possible and for less uncertainty. 
What did they do when the federal government bought back their 
securities in Canadian dollars? They took the money and either 
exchanged it for US dollars, which is a sure bet in these times 
of uncertainty and crisis in Asia, or bought shares in American 
companies or US bonds, which is a better investment in these 
turbulent times throughout the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance, who asked the Bank of Canada to step 
in, especially in August, to support the Canadian dollar, was 
himself responsible for the precipitous drop of the Canadian 
dollar and for all its impacts on the competitiveness and on 
consumer confidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The monetary policy and the interest rate policy of the Bank of 
Canada are the third reason that makes the federal government 
responsible in part for the economic downturn and, indeed, for 
the recession that could happen next year if the data continue 
to show the same sluggishness observed during the first four 
months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we learned, last August, that the GDP had fallen for three 
months in a row and that other indicators hinted to a major 
economic slowdown, the Bank of Canada decided to raise its 
interest rates by 100 basis points or 1%. 
This 1% raise may seem insignificant, but when there is already 
an economic downturn, one can deal a death blow to the economy 
simply with a 1% shock on the monetary market, through an 
increase in the interest rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Bank of Canada did that, which was very stupid, the 
Minister of Finance said that he still trusted the governor of 
the Bank of Canada, even though the latter is stopping—and I 
would even say throttling—economic growth in Canada.  Gordon 
Thiessen, the governor of the Bank of Canada, not only made a 
mistake when he raised the interest rates by 1%, but recently he 
also sent contradictory signals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last Thursday, when the US Federal Reserve Bank lowered its 
interest rates by 20 base points—it could do so because large 
economies like those of Germany and the United States must lower 
their interest rates—the Bank of Canada followed suit in exactly 
the same proportions. That was nonsense. The Bank of Canada 
should have done nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is precisely what is being asked of the governor of the 
Bank of Canada: to stay put and do nothing. He should lock 
himself in his office, and think up more intelligent measures 
than the ones he is taking to stimulate Canadian economic 
growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why be stubborn, like the Minister of Finance and the Prime 
Minister who, all summer long, made light of the fall of the 
Canadian dollar, and even of the economic downturn?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the contrary, he should admit there is a downturn, that all 
the experts now agree with the Bloc Quebecois who raised the 
alarm the very first week of the financial crisis. All the 
experts are now saying there is no sign that next month or the 
following one—I am still talking about economic statistics—things 
will pick up. As I mentioned before, we are talking about the 
first four months of the current fiscal year, or April, May, 
June, and July. In August and September, unless one is as 
short-sighted as the Minister of Finance, the economy did not do 
better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In August, the Canadian dollar dived to an all-time low. 
Businesses were beginning to complain about the increasing costs 
of American equipment and high technology as a result of the 
decline in the value of the Canadian dollar. If there was an 
economic slowdown in April, May, June and July, we should expect 
the same in August and September. We will then have, according 
to the technical definition, a recession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the last month and a half, we have been asking the finance 
minister to use if not all, at least most of the actual surplus 
to promote economic growth instead of using the entire amount to 
repay part of the debt—we are not against repayment of the debt 
but it makes no sense in the current climate of economic 
uncertainty. 
We are not asking him to spend money recklessly as the Liberal 
government used to do in the old days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind you that the current Prime Minister was once the 
Minister of Finance and that he was responsible for one of the 
largest deficits in Canada, back in the days when the federal 
government used to run deficits. We are not asking him to fall 
back into the same bad habits. Neither are we asking the 
Minister of Finance to repeat his Prime Minister's old mistakes. 
Since the budget surplus will reach between $12 billion and $15 
billion by March 1999, we are simply asking him to take these 
funds and announce imminent tax reductions and measures that 
will boost the economy and restore the confidence of consumers, 
which is now badly eroded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the greatest threat?  It is that in a few months 
consumers, whose savings are unusually low right now, facing 
uncertainty, a falling dollar, and the do-nothing attitude of the 
Minister of Finance and the Prime Minister, will decide not to 
spend, to postpone all their purchases.  As I said, with their 
unusually low savings, they are quite likely to postpone their 
purchases, and that will be the end.  As early as 1999, we will 
be in a recession, and it will be because of the Prime Minister 
and the Minister of Finance, who did not take seriously the 
early signs of a major slowdown in the economy in the last four 
months.  They did not listen to the Bloc Quebecois which, for a 
month and a half, has been mapping a plan for government action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What could the government do to stimulate the economy? 
We are asking for three things.  First, implement a series of 
fiscal measures within a special budget.  These measures would 
include, among other things, a substantial tax break for middle 
income earners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also advocating a reduction of EI premiums to help 
employers go through the economic slowdown and help middle 
income earners who are likely to spend the extra money made 
available through income tax cuts and premium reductions, 
thereby stimulating the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And on the heels of the debate on the Canadian social union, we 
also ask for an immediate increase in social transfers to the 
provinces. Spending on social programs can also result in 
economic growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we are asking the government—this is our second demand—to 
ask the Bank of Canada to stop making erratic decisions and 
creating shock waves in the economy. Nobody knows where the Bank 
of Canada is going anymore. Gordon Thiessen told us “We are 
independent from the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank”. This does not 
hold true anymore. Last Thursday, when the Federal Reserve Bank 
lowered its basic rate by 25 basis points, Gordon Thiessen 
blindly followed suit, something he should not have done.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A better way to manage the monetary policy would have been to 
wait and see. His 1% rate increase at the end of August has hurt 
the economy, but what is hurting the economy even more is that 
we do not know where he is heading. He has put us in an 
uncertain situation. He is putting the financial markets in a 
situation where we expect the worst. Things may not be at their 
worst, but they could certainly be better. We in Canada are just 
keeping our heads above water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gordon Thiessen should keep quiet and lock himself up as I was 
saying earlier. Perhaps the Minister of Finance could reconsider 
Mr. Thiessen's future, for he is the one responsible for our 
greatly reduced options in terms of monetary policy and interest 
rate management policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our third request to the government in this economic slowdown 
scenario is to hold a full public debate on the best way to 
spend the budget surpluses derived from employer and employee 
contributions to the employment insurance fund, from the 
substantial tax increases imposed on middle income Canadians in 
the last four years, and from cutbacks in transfers to the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There should be a public debate on these issues as well as on 
debt management. Why is it important to talk about debt 
management? Because the government is lying through its teeth. 
In the latest budget, at page 58, in table 1.13, we read: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We established a debt reduction plan for the next three years. 
We will use the contingency reserve. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a reserve to provide for the unforeseen.  It amounts to 
$3 billion a year.  What the Minister of Finance said in his 
budget is that if this reserve were not used in the three years, 
it would simply go to repay the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we calculate—and we are able to do calculations—$3 billion 
this year, $3 billion next year and $3 billion in two years add 
up to $9 billion in three years that the Minister of Finance had 
promised to apply to the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He applied $20 billion in 15 months totally contrary to the 
promises in his budget and the electoral promises made, whereby 
50% of the surplus would go to repay the debt and 50% to 
reducing taxes and increasing social transfers, especially to 
support health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has yet again reneged on its promises, as it did 
with its shamefaced lies over the GST.  This is why we have to 
have a public debate.  There is nothing but a wad of lies 
between what they write, what they do and what they say.

Speaker, it is elementary to state that Canada as a country 
respects the rule of law and guarantees human rights and 
fundamental freedoms to all who live here. In the republic of 
Yugoslavia both of these basic principles are being violated 
daily.  The situation has deteriorated beyond a level that can be 
tolerated by Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the UN security council deliberates and waits for the 
Annan report, the New York based human rights watch yesterday 
blamed the international community for failing to take any 
serious actions to stop the killing of Albanian civilians.

deteriorating situation are fast disappearing.  Pressure is 
mounting for military intervention with its all attended risks.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians were deeply saddened to learn of the deaths of the 
Canadian Forces airmen killed in the line of duty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our members in the Canadian Forces deserve safe, reliable and up 
to date equipment to do their jobs effectively. Now that the 
Labradors have grounded and the new Cormorant search and rescue 
helicopters will not be in service for another two years, what 
safe rescue alternative will the forces use to pick up the slack 
should another emergency arise? 
<P><A NAME="LINK73"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know all members of the House join with 
me in expressing our sincere sympathy and condolences to the 
families and friends of the six crew members who lost their lives 
and to the 413 squadron which has been part of the provision of 
this service out of Greenwood and has done so with great 
distinction for a great many years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to let the investigators get on with determining the 
cause of the crash so that the appropriate action can be taken. 
<P><A NAME="LINK74"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
asked the minister what alternative plans he has if another 
emergency arises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Labradors are grounded, the main thrust of our search and 
rescue efforts.  There are other helicopters, other aircraft 
available, but they are all flawed.  They all have problems 
either mechanical, communication or whatever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all these problems plaguing the present search and rescue 
aircraft we have, will the minister consider an urgent lease of 
helicopters even if it means going beyond our borders to find 
them? 
<P><A NAME="LINK75"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we will not fly flawed aircraft.  We will 
fly only aircraft that is certified as being safe to be used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a very extensive inspection program, maintenance program 
and overhaul program to ensure we are putting aircraft in the air 
that are safe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have grounded the 12 Labradors but they can be used in the 
case of life threatening conditions.  There are Hercules, 
Griffons and other aircraft used in search and rescue missions. 
We will continue to provide Canadians with that service. 
<P><A NAME="LINK76"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the minister talks about life threatening conditions.  Obviously 
these helicopters do pose a life threatening situation for the 
crew. There are search and rescue needs in this country which 
have to be met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Labradors are grounded.  The Griffon helicopters with some 
search and rescue capability have some communication problems 
that are very serious.  The Hercules have a limited capacity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I ask the minister what alternative plan does he have for 
search and rescue equipment should an emergency arise. 
<P><A NAME="LINK77"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I indicated, we have a number of 
assets to be able to provide search and rescue missions.  We will 
continue to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many reasons aircraft crash.  Sometimes they are new 
aircraft as well as ones that have been in service for a number 
of years.  The one thing we make absolutely sure of is that we do 
our utmost to make sure that all aircraft in the air are safe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue to provide a search and rescue service with our 
personnel across this country and with the various aircraft we 
have.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the sensible approach is that this commission seems to be going a 
little further than just checking into RCMP activities.  I think 
the Canadian public is looking forward to that.  If our Prime 
Minister refuses to appear before this commission if he is 
subpoenaed, Canadians will never know what the truth of this 
story is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the Deputy Prime Minister to answer my question 
for a change.  Why will the Prime Minister evade this? Will he 
voluntarily appear before the commission or will he let Jean

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

question is shown by her admission that a former senior staff 
member and a current senior staff member in the Prime Minister's 
office are going to appear before the commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us allow the commission do its work.  Why does the hon.

according to the Minister of Finance, the United States and

everyone here knows that all economic levers necessary to 
effectively counter the threat of a recession are available to

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> We are doing very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> The king is happy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, we must act and act now. Does the Acting Prime

which would be the worst possible signal that we could send to 
the financial markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are the straight goods.  Immediate tax cuts would have no 
short term effect on the economy. Heavy spending on social 
programs is what got Canada into our fiscal troubles in the first

from the EI fund to make general tax cuts and stimulate the 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Acting Prime Minister.  Does he not 
realize that using the EI fund to lower the taxes paid by the 
rich, a cut which would be funded primarily by workers earning 
$39,000 and less annually, is the most unfair, most illegal and 
most immoral course he could choose?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

we turned the corner with respect to the deficit reduction, what 
did we do?  We started to reduce taxes for those most in need at 
the bottom end. 
All the Bloc is talking about is trying to bring us back to 
where we were left by the Tories who tried to bury this country.

to fight this barrier—transition from school to the labour

about premiums, as the hon. member wants to keep talking about. 
It is about making choices.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Transportation Agency released a decision a few 
days ago on a complaint from the Canadian Wheat Board about grain 
transportation.  The CN has admitted to some of the blame.  The 
CPR is partly to blame.  By now most prairie branch lines are 
abandoned or in the process of being abandoned.  It is up to the 
farmers now to drive hundreds of kilometres on torn-up roads to 
get to the mainline terminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will this government spend our federal fuel tax revenue 
where it should be spent, on improving roads so farmers can get 
their grain to market?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member should know that it would be 
inappropriate for me to comment on the Canadian Transportation 
Agency issue and the wheat board complaint.  It is subject to 
appeal.  The hon. member should also know that Judge Estey is 
studying this entire issue.  So let us not come to some 
prejudgment here in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of railway line abandonment, I have assured the

have the right to abandon these lines but that they are going

the railroads, not to replace rail hauling.  It is being 
destroyed especially in Saskatchewan where it is already a 
shambles.  Each year $635 million is being sucked out of the 
prairies in fuel taxes while $13 million is being put back.  Does 
the minister want us to go back to moving our grain with horse 
drawn wagons, or will this government put some of its fuel loot 
back where it belongs, into highways in the provinces—

Mr. Speaker, I know the hon. member is sincerely concerned about 
transportation in general, in particular in transportation for 
the grain industry in his home province. We will be having this 
debate in the coming months. I do not believe we can actively 
engage in that debate at this point, not until we have Judge

Mr. Speaker, week after week Canadians have witnessed the dodging

Mr. Speaker, William Kaplan's recent book <I>Presumed Guilty</I>

stand for re-election.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>QUESTION PERIOD 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK181"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I wish to rise on a point of 
order resulting from a question asked by the hon. member for Wild 
Rose in question period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He asked the Minister of Justice, in her capacity as a minister 
from Alberta, to answer a question based on that premise.  In 
other words, it was in reference to the portion of the country 
that she represents in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to remind the Chair that citation 412 of Beauchesne's 
sixth edition at page 122 states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A question may not be asked of a Minister in another capacity, 
such as being responsible for a province, or a part of a 
province, or as spokesman for a racial or religious group. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, you will also know that it is improper 
to ask the Minister of Justice for a constitutional opinion on 
the floor of the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK182"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, surely 
the member from the other side of the House recognizes that what 
I used was a quote from the Minister of Justice from Alberta who 
called the Senate election a joke.  I thought maybe she had a 
better idea. 
<P><A NAME="LINK183"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
there are times when the government House leader should get his 
nose out of Beauchesne's and look at the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The facts are that the member from the Reform Party was looking 
at statements, as he said, that the minister had made.  There is 
absolutely nothing in the standing orders or Beauchesne's which 
prevents that.  If he would like this to be a point of privilege, 
the Reform Party would be happy to do so.  Perhaps he should look 
at what really happens in the House of Commons rather than 
getting his nose into the technicalities of the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The Chair is mindful of the comments 
and thanks hon. members on every side for their very useful 
contributions on this point.  I may say that the citation from 
Beauchesne's that the hon. government House leader referred to is 
perfectly correct, sound and based, I am sure, on long practice 
in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I think the question that the hon. member for Wild Rose 
asked had to do with the constitutional niceties of Senate 
elections.  While it may have been directed to the Minister of 
Justice incorrectly in her capacity as a regional minister—and I 
agree with the citation that questions ought not be directed in 
that way—it did concern something of her duties as Minister of 
Justice in some vague way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Deputy Prime Minister chose to answer the question and I 
think everyone was satisfied with the answer, as they were with 
the question.

rules have been complied with, and we will continue with another 
question period on another day.

and registration scheme will do nothing to curtail the criminal 
use of firearms, is not cost effective in addressing the crime 
problem in Canada and is opposed by the majority of police on the

repeal Bill C-68, the Firearms Act, and direct their hard earned 
tax dollars to more cost effective measures to fight crime.

that following his last inquiry which was a couple of days ago, I 
looked specifically into the status of Question No. 91. I can 
assure him it is at the very last stages of processing and will 
be presented in the House very shortly. 
<P><A NAME="LINK236"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise on this point of order with respect to the answering of 
questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At one time members were able to submit all kinds of questions 
and of course it took forever to get the answers. Sometimes 
people never received answers. The idea of going to the 45-day 
answering period was that in return for actually getting answers 
to some questions, there would be a limitation on the number of 
questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has happened now is that we have the limitation on the 
number of questions and we still wait forever for answers.  The 
government for many years now has been systematically violating 
the spirit of that reform, whereby the ability of members to 
submit many, many questions was traded away in return for a 
guarantee that within a certain period of time there would be 
answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a bureaucracy over there the size of the Titanic. Surely 
it could come up with answers to these questions within 45 days 
and respect the standing orders of the House in this respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I must say I did not know 
the history of these questions.  I would mention that we have 
been asked well over 140 questions and there are in fact seven 
outstanding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I know that the hon. member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona raises a point that when I served as a member 
of the opposition in this House instead of in a capacity in the 
Chair I found irksome as well.  I of course wanted to ask a lot 
more than three questions at a time but was unable to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that he knows that the place to raise this issue is not 
here on the floor with the parliamentary secretary who is of 
course bound by the rules of the House, but in the procedure and 
House affairs committee. I am sure that the hon. member who is 
addressing in the course of his remarks the chairman of the 
procedure and House affairs committee and likely the next 
chairman if the tradition continues, will be able to have this 
matter placed on the agenda before that committee at an early 
date and deal with the matter there instead of here.

Speaker, I seek leave under Standing Order 52(2) to propose an 
emergency debate to address the crisis in Canadian farm incomes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The incomes of Canadian farmers are in steep and rapid decline. 
This constitutes an emergency for farm families in every rural 
community in Canada.  The situation has become desperate and many 
family farms are facing economic disaster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With declining global farm commodity prices, the Canadian 
Federation of Agriculture is now predicting that farm incomes may 
fall by as much as 40% this year alone and perhaps even more on 
the prairies. Statistics Canada has reported that farm cash 
receipts for all Canadian farmers in the first half of this year 
already declined by 5% and prairie farm incomes were down by 
between 10% and 13%. These earlier numbers do not reflect the 
most recent declines or the quickly evaporating demand for 
Canadian products in the wake of the economic meltdown in Asia 
that is now spreading around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian farmers do not receive subsidies like European and 
American farmers receive from their governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An emergency debate is required to allow us, as elected 
representatives, to inform the government of the gravity of the 
situation and to have parliament consider what urgent measures 
are needed to address the looming crisis on the family farm.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the opinion of the Chair, this request does not meet the

matter of such urgency that it requires the House to set aside

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I want to begin my comments by noting that the motion by the hon. 
member urges the Government of Canada to accept the provincial 
governments' initial position in the social union framework 
negotiations and put forward no principles or objectives on 
behalf of all Canadians.  This is wrong.  With the greatest of 
respect, the hon. member should know that all the provincial and 
territorial governments recognize that this is a process of 
negotiation.  They understand that there will be give and take 
between the two levels of government before we come to an 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member seems to think of this in terms of who should 
give in to whom.  That is the old way of looking at things.  This 
is not the way we are proceeding today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our overall goal is to figure out how we can serve Canadians 
better by working together.  This is after all what Canadians 
have asked us to do.  I am surprised that the hon. member does 
not recognize this fact and conduct himself accordingly.  Perhaps 
I should not be surprised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada has tabled a position and we are 
respecting the protocol agreed to by all the governments involved 
in negotiating in public.  However, the motion before us 
indicates that the hon. member does not wish to acknowledge that 
the Government of Canada has any interest in or responsibility 
for the social union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me address this question of the social union and what it 
represents then. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, what is Canada's social union?  It is the means by which 
we as Canadians share our resources and help one another.  It 
means collaboration and it means solidarity. This after all is 
the Canadian way. Newfoundlanders help Ontarians, Ontarians help 
Manitobans, Manitobans help Quebeckers, Quebeckers help British 
Columbians; making sure that we all have access to the basic 
social services we need when we need them, like education, old 
age pensions, social assistance and health care; making sure that 
we all help each other in times of crisis, like the floods in 
Manitoba and the Saguenay, and the ice storm in southern Ontario 
and Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First and foremost, the social union defines what it means to be 
a Canadian.  It represents part of our values, our institutions 
and our symbols which define us as a people and unite us as a 
nation.  It represents our values, values that include sharing 
and compassion, fairness, respect for the dignity of individuals, 
and a sense of collective as well as individual responsibility 
for our mutual well-being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our social union is the way in which we as Canadians pool our 
resources, act on our shared values and look out for one another. 
It distinguishes us from any other nation in the world.  We are 
very proud of what this means for us as a country.  It is why 
year after year Canada is judged by the United Nations as the 
best country in the world in which to live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because it transcends provincial and territorial boundaries, the 
strengthening of the social union is a fundamental responsibility 
of all governments, but of course it is of special concern to the 
Government of Canada.  After all, this is the only government 
elected by all Canadians and therefore accountable to all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How did we get to this social union?  It was not by sheer luck 
or by happenstance.  We built it together piece by piece. 
Provinces, working to meet the social needs of their residents 
and constituents, pioneered new programs.  The Government of 
Canada encouraged other provinces to try similar programs and 
help make the benefits available to all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is how medicare started in Saskatchewan. Today it is how we 
are building the child tax benefit. Look at Quebec and its 
innovative family policies for example. Programs help people get 
back into the labour force. We have a lot to share and a lot to 
learn one from the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Building the social union then was not an easy process.  There 
were challenges and disagreements along the way.  But we have 
ended up with one of the world's best social security systems and 
that is partly due to the fact that there are differences of view 
between different levels of government.  These differences have 
forced us to be more imaginative and to work harder to design 
better programs that suit everyone.  In the end, working out our 
differences with respect and accommodation on both sides has made 
our social union stronger. This is true just as much today as it 
ever was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over more than half a century, our social union has evolved so 
that both orders of government now have a range of distinct 
responsibilities. 
In general, provincial governments are responsible for education 
and the delivery of health services and welfare.  The Government 
of Canada's responsibilities include pensions, employment 
insurance, health protection, interprovincial mobility and the 
redistribution of wealth and resources across the country through 
equalization payments to provincial governments.

<A HREF="#LINKT53"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are shared responsibilities as well.  Both orders of 
government, for example, have a constitutional responsibility to 
promote equality of opportunity for all Canadians.  Securing 
equality of opportunity is a responsibility that the Government 
of Canada takes very seriously.  This is a value that is very 
dear to Canadians from all parts of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the main instruments that can be used to promote equality 
of opportunity is federal spending power.  Every major federation 
in the world provides for this kind of spending power for the 
federal government, but nowhere in the world is this power used 
more flexibly and with fewer conditions than in Canada; not in 
the United States, not in Switzerland, nowhere. This is a point 
that is always lost on the members from the other side of the 
House.  They cannot contest it so they simply do not discuss it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a good thing.  No country as large and diversified as 
Canada could function as well as we do any other way.  We must 
have strong provinces that can try out solutions that fit their 
own populations and cultures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is no secret that provincial governments have been 
demanding changes in the way that spending power is used.  I 
remind the House that the Government of Canada has made changes. 
As a government we have been sensitive and responsive to the 
various demands of people throughout Canada, and rightfully so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has committed itself not to create new cost 
sharing programs in areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction 
without the consent of a majority of the provinces.  This 
government has committed to compensate non-participating 
provinces provided they establish equivalent or comparable 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, we have to make sure we do not put too many 
constraints on the use of spending power.  This would lead to 
paralysis.  We would be unable to keep up with changing needs and 
with circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Premiere Romanow stated:  “The federal spending power gives the 
federal government the opportunity to encourage all provinces to 
adopt ideas that have been broadly supported throughout the 
nation so that all citizens can benefit from equal access to new 
social programs”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This supports the contention that the Government of Canada must 
preserve its capacity to use spending power to promote equality 
of opportunity for all Canadians. However, as we have just said, 
we are fully committed to using it in a way that respects the 
provincial governments' legitimate responsibilities in many areas 
of social policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years we have made real progress working with 
provincial governments to design and deliver new social programs 
for Canadians.  This work has been carried out in the spirit of 
co-operation and mutual respect.  We have begun to implement the 
national child benefit which is providing more federal income 
support benefits to low income families with children.  This 
enables provincial governments to invest in new programs and 
services for these families.  Nutrition, child care and readiness 
to learn programs are but examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have signed agreements with provincial governments on labour 
market and employment programs.  This has removed overlap and 
administrative duplication and has been successful in addressing 
a major irritant in federal-provincial relations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the challenges facing our social union in the future 
and what should we be preparing for now is a very important 
question.  What are the pressures we face down the road that a 
social union framework agreement would help us deal with? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We live in an increasingly interdependent world.  Today's social 
and economic policies intersect like they never have before. 
Those who argue that we can have an economic union without a 
social union in this day and age are sadly mistaken. One only has 
to think about adapting to a knowledge based economy and ensuring 
that individuals, especially our young people, have the skills 
they need for the jobs of tomorrow.  This is a social and an 
economic issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is globalization and the need to stay competitive in the 
international marketplace to secure our standard of living; an 
aging population and new demands on social programs associated 
with people living longer and healthier lives; innovation and new 
technologies, particularly in health care, which we want to 
ensure benefit all Canadians; the need to continue maintaining a 
balanced budget and reducing debt.

<A HREF="#LINKT54"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must emphasize that we can modernize our social programs and 
services and create new social programs where required that will 
address these pressures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It means governments working together to clear the way for more 
rapid progress, to modernize and strengthen medicare, working 
together to help us move forward more quickly with new and better 
programs for children and persons with disabilities, working 
together to do more to address youth unemployment and learning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the assertion implicit in the motion of the hon. member, 
provincial governments recognize the participation of the 
Government of Canada is required to sustain progressive social 
programs that will benefit all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the Government of Canada looking for?  Where are we 
in negotiations to develop a social union framework agreement? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada has three objectives. The first is to 
promote equality of opportunity for all Canadians wherever they 
live or move in Canada.  The second is to ensure that governments 
are working collaboratively on the social union. The third is to 
make governments more accountable to Canadians for the results 
achieved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that the social union framework agreement 
would help to strengthen our social programs and services if 
designed to meet those objectives.  To ensure quality of 
opportunity for all Canadians through our social programs we must 
then reaffirm the principles that underpin our social security 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must agree on some fundamental principles that would guide us 
in strengthening social programs.  These principles include 
access to comparable basic services.  They include freedom of 
mobility so that Canadians can move within their country without 
fear of losing important social benefits.  Finally, they include 
making sure Canadians are treated fairly by their 
governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the principle of flexibility.  Our social union cannot 
mean uniformity.  It cannot mean one size fits all or identical 
programs.  It cannot mean one level of government dictating to 
another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must respect the principle of flexibility to ensure that 
social programs can be designed and delivered in ways that 
respect Canada's diversity.  This includes the unique character 
of Quebec society arising notably from its French speaking 
majority, its culture and its tradition of civil law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that taken together, these principles will ensure 
Canadians have the best of both worlds, the flexibility of 
programs tailored to meet the needs at the community level with 
principles that ensure access and fairness for all Canadians 
wherever they live or move in Canada.  In short, this is the 
genius of the Canadian federation. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is the envy of the world. The federal government remains 
committed to act in the best interests of all Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are concerned about social issues.  They are worried 
about the integrity of our health care system.  They are worried 
about child poverty.  They are worried about the employment 
prospects facing Canadian youth in an uncertain global economy. 
They are worried about the well-being of elderly Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time has come to stop playing politics with these concerns. 
While there is a legitimate place for differences of view between 
the two levels of government, Canadians' tolerance for 
federal-provincial feuding has worn thin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Confrontation only diverts attention from the issues that really 
matter and is an insult to the Canadians who are struggling to 
cope with change.  It undermines the public's faith in the 
government's capacity to serve the public interest.  Quite 
frankly, it must stop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an important goal for the Government of Canada and the 
social union framework agreement.  We must work out our 
legitimate differences in a manner that is constructive and 
non-confrontational.  We must find ways to continue building our 
social safety net together, putting new programs in place to 
address changing needs in an amicable, dignified and respectful 
manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To do so obliges both levels of government to share more 
information, to provide advance notice of any new initiatives or 
planned changes to current programs and to consult and to plan 
together. 
It obliges governments to always put the interests of Canadians 
first.

well-being of their fellow citizens, particularly children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want to know that what we are doing is working.  They 
want hope.  They want to see evidence that our social programs 
and services are making a difference.  They want to be sure we 
are improving the health of Canadians, that fewer Canadian 
children are living in poverty, that our young people really do 
have the skills they need for the jobs of tomorrow and that our 
elderly citizens are living out their lives in dignity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This requires public reporting on outcomes.  This way Canadians 
can decide for themselves whether their governments are living up 
to the commitments made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are just some of the benefits that we believe a social 
union framework agreement could lead to.  But in these 
negotiations the Government of Canada has only one bottom line 
and that is what is good for Canadians and good for Canada.  It 
does not have to be more complicated than that. The social union 
is not something we can cut up and divide. It is the very 
foundation of our society and we must build on it together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out to the hon. member that his colleagues in Quebec are 
now full participants in the social union framework negotiation. 
The Government of Quebec recognizes that this is a process of 
give and take and that we are in fact making progress. As 
recently as last Friday the new Quebec minister for Canadian 
intergovernmental affairs said he is confident that the process 
is moving forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So what is the hon. member hoping to achieve by his motion? For 
the good of Quebeckers and all other Canadians I urge the hon. 
member to follow the lead of his colleagues and work for 
collaboration instead of confrontation.  This is what Canadians 
everywhere, no matter where they live in this great country of 
ours, want and deserve.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member for Waterloo—Wellington has spoken abundantly about the 
social union, justice and social equity. To that end, he dragged 
out the old response of his Prime Minister, who has said time 
and time again that Canada is the most beautiful, the greatest 
and the best country of the world, a country that offers the 
best social equity. But when he is not happy with his opponents, 
our Prime Minister grabs them by the neck and throws them down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member for Waterloo—Wellington what he 
answer he would give, about social equity for example, to one of 
my constituents, Louis-Philippe Roy, a former worker of the BC 
asbestos mine, who received his employment insurance benefits on 
his first application. He has served 15 times as a pallbearer. 
He was paid $22 each time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having worked on 15 occasions and earned $375, he saw his 
employment benefits reduced by $102 per week on his second 
application. Since he still had 17 weeks of eligibility, 
Louis-Philippe Roy has been penalised by its government, which 
brags about its sense of social equity, to the tune of $1,734 
because he had earned $375 for having served 15 times as a 
pallbearer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do you intend to encourage people on employment insurance 
benefits to find work and get themselves out of that black hole? 
When I hear the good member for Waterloo—Wellington, I have the 
impression he is living in a bubble, that he is completely 
disconnected from the reality of those workers on employment 
insurance benefits. What has become of his sense of social 
equity?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member opposite 
for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has a tremendous social safety net in place to help 
people in need from time to time and to help people who require 
it throughout the term of their life, or whenever it is needed at 
the appropriate time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the hon. member is disconnected.  This is really all 
about a social union framework that will assist Canada and make 
it work better.  It will strengthen the federation.  It is part 
of partnerships and it is part of the kinds of things that 
Canadians, no matter where they live in this great country of 
ours, want us to do in a co-operative fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the hon. member fails to realize that we as the federal 
government since 1993 have taken over 17 definitive and 
fundamental steps in ensuring this would happen.  This is 
absolutely key for wherever one lives in this great country of 
ours, knowing that our government is making the changes necessary 
to make the social union work. 
<P><A NAME="LINK247"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was 
interested in hearing the speech of our Liberal colleague, the 
same rhetoric that we have heard for quite some time.  There is a 
question I would like to ask him in terms of priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the transfer payments to the provinces were decreased by 
a large amount, up to 35% I understand in many provinces.  That 
put the pressure on them and they have had some difficult times 
providing their health programs, education programs and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I happen to be one of the people who got into a line-up for 
heart surgery, as the member may well know, back in June 1997.  I 
waited for approximately four and a half weeks before I could 
have my operation.  A couple of people died in that same line-up 
just shortly before my operation.  It is really hectic out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 it was quoted in the House that there were one million 
children living in poverty.  For years now we know that on the 
reserves in our nation there is nothing but third world 
conditions.  I have been in the homes of grassroots natives all 
across the country.  I have sat on their crates and in their 
non-electric homes with no water.  They are living in absolute 
poverty, yet billions of dollars are being poured into that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know where is the accountability for all of 
this.  Why are we having all these problems?  Why are there so 
many homeless on the streets of Toronto?  Why are there so many 
in Calgary?  Why is this all going on if the government is doing 
such a wonderful job?  To me, it has not done anything. I would 
like this member to explain.  Where are the priorities? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member opposite 
for his question.  I know he has some firsthand evidence with 
respect to his own situation and I appreciate that he brings that 
to the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I listened in astonishment to the sheer hypocrisy of 
the kinds of things he said when in fact it was the Reform Party 
in its fresh start and in its so-called 1995 taxpayer's budget 
that called for a $3 billion cut in transfers to provinces for 
health, post-secondary education and welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Added to that was another $3.6 billion to other transfers.  On 
top of that, as if that were not enough, there was another $7.4 
billion slashed from programs funded directly by the federal 
government for things like seniors' pensions and employment 
insurance and another $1 billion in cuts to social security, for 
a grand total of $15 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sheer audacity of the member opposite to get up and raise 
that kind of garbage is beyond comprehension.  It is the Reform 
Party that should take a look in the mirror to see what programs 
it would cut and decimate in the process Canada and our social 
union.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
say to the hon. member that the Liberal government has nothing to 
crow about.  When he talks about the Canadian social safety net, 
when he talks about putting the interest of Canadians first, the 
record is very clear. 
It is the Liberal government that has destroyed the social safety 
net in the country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to come to my riding of Vancouver East 
to see the people who are living in slum housing because of the 
abandonment of social housing.  I would like him to see the 
people who are on the street.  I would like him to see the kids 
whose parents are unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the member have to say about that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member opposite 
for the question.  I can say to her that we as a government have 
not destroyed.  Rather we have built on a strong foundation that 
over time is the foundation of the very country we call Canada, 
and rightfully so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are a nation of builders who have done the right thing in 
terms of our social safety net and other issues.  Quite frankly 
we have a record to which we can point and we can prove it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of where the hon. member is coming from, is she today 
wooing the labour people or is she wooing business?  I find it a 
little galling to take all this from the member opposite and her 
party, a party that would promise significant spending on health 
and social programs while cutting the GST and trying to balance a 
budget.  I would take a little exception to the fact that she 
would try to promote that kind of nonsense.  It really makes no 
sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on the government side have made the kind of sense that 
Canadians want.  We have done it in a manner consistent with 
Canadian values and Canadian institutions.  That is something we 
can be enormously proud of.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very happy to speak today to the 
opposition motion of the Bloc Quebecois, because it is directly 
linked to the mission of the Bloc Quebecois in this parliament, 
namely to, first, defend the interests of Quebec and, second, 
promote the sovereignty and autonomy of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our motion reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House recognize the very harmful effect of federal 
cuts to the Canada Social Transfer, particularly on health 
services in Canada, and that it support the consensus achieved 
by the provincial Premiers in Saskatoon on a project for social 
union. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I would like to talk about the value of the social union 
agreement that was signed in Saskatoon. Members will recall that 
in Quebec and Canada, there has been for many years a major 
debate as to whether the Canadian Constitution gives Quebec 
sufficient authority to administer its own social policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past, there have been interesting examples proving that 
Quebec is capable of administering its social programs. Let us 
take, for example, the student loans and bursaries program. 
It is the best in Canada. Moreover, it is the only one that 
includes scholarships in the basic funding for studies. There is 
also the Régime des rentes du Québec, which was taken as an 
example by the federal government last year for correcting the 
Canada pension plan. So, there are some interesting examples to 
show that Quebec has the means and the capacity to manage social 
programs in an appropriate fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is interesting in the motion is that, in a sense, there was 
an evolution from 1971 to 1998. In 1971, Quebec was not able to 
accept a constitutional amendment because Canada was not ready 
to give it the necessary leeway. The federal government is still 
not ready to do that and the statements from the Prime Minister 
on that subject are not very reassuring. 
He finally said that it was necessary for the federal government 
to continue to administer its money, to assume these 
responsibilities and that it was not ready to let the provinces 
administer these programs on their own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But this time, he is facing a coalition resulting from the 
goodwill of the provincial premiers, including the Premier of 
Quebec, who have finally said that we should have the right for 
a province to opt out, with full compensation, of a new or 
modified Canada-wide federal government social program in areas 
under provincial jurisdiction, when the province offers a 
program or introduces an initiative in the same field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take an example, not in the social area, but in the area 
of education. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1555"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT58"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had such a model been applied, we would not be stuck today with 
the millennium scholarships. In this case, the model used was 
the Prime Minister's model, which says “I have an idea and I am 
right; everybody else may disagree, but I will do it my way 
anyway”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, we end up with two parallel systems: the Quebec 
loans and bursaries system and the millennium scholarships. 
There will be two administration systems. This is the typical 
federal program duplicating something that already exists at the 
provincial level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want this kind of action. We want the right to opt out 
with full compensation. This way, the Government of Quebec could 
implement its own programs where necessary, and it is prepared 
to undertake to do so in areas where the federal government 
intends to invest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take the home care program for example. If it went ahead with 
its plan to develop a home care program without co-ordinating 
its action with the provinces, the federal government could end 
up putting in place a program that totally fails to meet the 
needs of one province or another, a program that does not meet 
the needs of Quebec, while Quebec would receive its share of the 
federal funding if the Saskatoon agreement were applied. The 
Quebec government would undertake to invest in health but would 
have the necessary leeway to ensure its needs are met. 
It is this leeway the provincial premiers agreed on in 
Saskatoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last weekend, the premiers met with the federal spokesperson. We 
are waiting to see what will come out of these discussions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, the motion before us basically says that a step could be 
made in the direction of allowing Quebec to defends its 
interests and move toward greater autonomy while respecting the 
right the rest of Canada to act differently. Positive results 
could be achieved if the federal government showed a willingness 
to move in this direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing this would mean is that when there is “support from a 
majority of provinces before new federal initiatives are 
introduced in areas of provincial jurisdiction”, Canada's nine 
provinces could take action, because Quebec would have the right 
to opt out with full compensation.  It would no longer hold 
everything up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be interesting to adopt this approach, which would 
provide a way out of the difficult situations that now arise and 
the systematic opposition between the federal government and the 
provincial governments, particularly Quebec, because the federal 
government has always been more interested in achieving the 
desired visibility than in coming up with the best possible 
program. 
The best proof of this is the millennium scholarships I 
mentioned earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the same with child care.  Election after election, the 
federal political parties promised a universal child care 
system. The stumbling block each time was the wide diversity of 
situations in the various provinces.  There is no one solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec has done something about the problem in recent years. 
It has introduced $5 day care.  This is very attractive.  Now, 
people can send their child to day care for $5 a day.  This 
program has been tremendously successful.  It is now available 
for all three and four year olds.  This will make good day care 
available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An attempt to find one program for all of Canada will produce 
solutions that will not work for Quebec, but there is no way 
around this because provinces may not, at the moment, opt out 
with full compensation, as provided for in the Saskatoon 
consensus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consensus contains a number of dynamic, forward-looking 
components.  This parliament could make a valuable contribution 
by requiring the federal government to add its support so that 
an agreement can be worked out as quickly as possible.  This is 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are four main components in our motion on the project for 
social union.  I mentioned the right to opt out will full 
compensation. 
There was also agreement that a program could be implemented 
with support from a majority of provinces, and that there should 
be “new co-operation mechanisms in order to avoid conflicts or 
settle them equitably”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a fundamental issue. We are asking federal players to 
get down off their pedestal, to get down to the same level as 
the provinces and find mechanisms so that we will no longer see 
unilateral decisions as in the past; instead decisions would be 
taken by all parties concerned ensuring in the long run that the 
choices made are in keeping with the wishes of Canadians and 
Quebeckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a far cry from the federal government saying it knows 
best, and others should just listen. Essentially, it amounts to 
challenging the federal government's view of the provinces as 
mere branch plants. 
As a result of the Saskatoon agreement, everyone would be 
sitting on the board. There would be decision making mechanisms 
to ensure that decisions are arrived at properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebeckers will be able to assess the federal government's good 
will, the ability of the Canadian parliament to suggest 
solutions and of the Canadian government to follow through with 
them while respecting the provinces' wishes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has often been said “As long as there is a sovereignist 
government in Quebec, we will get nowhere”.  The Quebec 
government has shown its good faith saying “Yes, we are willing 
to be part of the social union as long as we have the right to 
opt out with full compensation; we are going to take a step 
forward by promising to spend this money in the area it is 
intended for”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what cemented the consensus. The only thing missing now 
is the federal government. 
We brought this motion forward today because we believe it is 
very important for the Canadian parliament to be aware of this 
issue and clearly indicate its willingness to accept a solution 
giving Quebec greater autonomy with regard to the management of 
social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very clear in our minds. It is the goal we are pursuing. 
Quebeckers are seeking complete autonomy to be able to make all 
the decisions concerning their future. They will do it globally 
when they opt for sovereignty. In the meantime they are seeking 
greater autonomy in order to provide their fellow citizens with 
the best programs possible. It is in such a context that 
provincial premiers put this constructive proposal on the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past, the Canadian social union had co-operative 
mechanisms to avoid or settle conflicts. Things did not work out 
quite that way in the last few years, especially as far as 
health care is concerned. The federal government, and especially 
the present government, decided unilaterally to make drastic 
cuts in health care. For each dollar that has been cut in health 
and education in Quebec, 75 cents were due to cuts in federal 
transfers to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It means that when hard decisions had to be made in Rimouski, La 
Pocatière, St-Pascal, and Rivière-du-Loup, where significant cuts 
were made in health care because changes were unavoidable, basic 
budgetary constraints were one consideration, but there was also 
that constant and terrible threat of federal cuts in transfer 
payments. Billions of dollars have been cut, and each and every 
province had to fully absorb those cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as health care is concerned, we should examine more 
carefully what that means. Everywhere in Quebec and Canada, the 
problem of financing health care is not a provincial problem 
made in Quebec, in Ontario, in Manitoba or any of the other 
individual provinces. The problem is the same throughout Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certain decisions were made in order to fight the deficit. 
One of the easiest decisions they came up with was to collect 
all the money they could through the employment insurance system 
and then to tell us today that was not why they collected it. 
The other decision was to cut transfer payments. This was the 
easiest way to do it: to offload the problem on the provinces 
who would have to make do with what they got. This is a very bad 
example of how our country should work for those who believe it 
should be a federation. We have tests for these things.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Quebeckers wonder whether tostay within the Canadian system 
or not, obviously these are some of the issues they seriously 
consider, especially when they see their taxes going to Ottawa 
and coming back in ways they do not appreciate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the first time ever, the province of Quebec is faced with a 
$475 million shortfall on cash from the EI fund. In 1997, 
Quebeckers got $475 million less in EI benefits and 
administration fees than what they paid in premiums. This EI 
program is a bad choice for the future. The federal government 
collected a surplus of $6 billion on the backs of each of the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Bertrand:</B> Those are your figures. That is awful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Madam Speaker, would you ask the member opposite 
to listen while I speak? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> Order, please.  I would ask 
members to pay attention to the hon. member's speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Madam Speaker, if there is one region where the 
employment insurance problem exists it is in the Pontiac region, 
where people are having problems qualifying for it, where they 
did not three or four years ago.  They are now running into this 
problem.  It is a problem particular to all the resource regions 
of Canada, but it is present in the Pontiac region as it is in 
all the other regions of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the Bloc motion focuses particularly on showing its 
good faith and that of the other parties in this House by 
pointing out clearly that the social union is an attractive 
route to the future.  It would permit sufficient autonomy, both 
for a province wishing to withdraw from a program and for 
another with an original idea wishing to implement it, so long 
as the majority of provinces were in agreement.  I think the 
federal government would do well to listen to this program and 
arrive at results that would enable Quebec to assume greater 
autonomy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to achieve other successes in the future such as we 
did with the loans and bursaries system and the Régime des 
rentes du Québec, I think we have to develop some mutual trust. 
The federal government would be taking a positive step by saying 
“Yes, we think that, with a social union, we could achieve 
results if those with unique needs or problems are allowed to 
set up individual programs in these same areas”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a foregone conclusion that health care problems in 
Quebec are to be managed the same way as those in Ontario.  Each 
province may have its own needs and priorities.  One province 
may decide to put the accent on prevention and the other on 
cure.  These situations occur. 
If the House were to adopt a motion such as the one proposed by 
the Bloc Quebecois today, it would solve any future problems 
associated with federal duplication of existing Quebec programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, there are two issues here. First, the actions of 
the federal government in recent years should be strongly 
condemned, including the way it has slashed health care, thus 
depriving the provinces of funds that were sorely needed. 
Second, the provincial premiers have extended a hand, in that 
they collectively put on the table a proposal on which they 
agreed in Saskatoon, and which will allow each and every 
province to find what they need to implement the programs they 
feel are appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada, we have been looking for a long time for a formula 
that would allow, for example, the nine predominantly 
English-speaking provinces to adopt a specific type of program, 
and let Quebec implement another one, while having the necessary 
flexibility for all these initiatives to be legal, wanted and 
justified. We are now in the last month of the period during 
which it would be possible to achieve this.

admit that there are some interesting ideas in the Saskatoon 
proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That concludes my speech.  I urge the Liberal majority in 
particular to pay attention.  Quebec could develop its own 
social programs, with full compensation, and the rest of Canada 
could do as it saw fit, implement the programs it wanted, 
without the battles we have seen for the last 40 years.

because this issue had not been resolved.  We have an 
opportunity to move forward, and I hope that Parliament will 
approve the Bloc Quebecois' recommendation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I will be splitting my time 
with the hon. member for Oak Ridges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am thankful for the opportunity to address the motion of my 
colleague on the subject of the social union.  The truth of 
matter is that Canada is the envy of the world.  We have 
consistently been rated among the top countries in the world for 
our standard of living and quality of life.  Canada stands number 
one among the nations of the world in this year's United Nations 
human development index.  We are respected worldwide for the 
country we have built by working together. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the reasons for this envy and respect?  There are 
several, but I would like to take this opportunity to point out 
two in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first is the exceptional quality of our social programs.  We 
need only look around us to realize how fortunate we are to have 
the social system that we do. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health care is one of the main subjects of the motion before us 
today.  Let us take a minute just to get back to basics.  Through 
the combined efforts of federal and provincial governments all 
Canadians have access to health care insurance that enables them 
to seek timely and high quality medical care anywhere in the 
country without worrying that each minute of a doctor's time or 
each step of a particular procedure is costing them their 
savings.  It sounds so simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can compare that brief description with the situation faced 
by our close neighbours to the south.   The United States is a 
wealthy and powerful country and still many people, particularly 
low income families, live without access to medical care even for 
routine check-ups and much less serious interventions because 
they cannot afford medical insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not to say that there is not always room for improvement 
even in a system as good as Canada's health care system.  Nor is 
it to deny that there have been some challenging times over the 
last few years while all governments, the provincial governments 
as well as the federal government, have fought to bring our 
deficits under control.  That fight was necessary to ensure a 
solid future for Canada and for Canadians.  It was necessary to 
ensure the future stability of our social programs including 
health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are not interested in seeing their governments finger 
pointing or hurling recriminations or fighting over their roles 
and responsibilities.  Canadians want their governments to work 
together co-operatively to make improvements in health care as 
well as in all other areas that form the fabric of Canada's 
social union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is for that reason the Prime Minister agreed with his 
provincial and territorial colleagues that the moment was now for 
discussions on how all governments might collaborate to make the 
social union work better for Canadians. 
I stress that I have been speaking about all governments and 
about collaboration and co-operation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to the second source of the envy and respect that 
Canada garners throughout the world, our success in co-operative 
federalism. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a federation.  And it is true that the purpose of 
federalism is to protect and encourage the development of the 
diversity of Canada's regions and provinces.  In particular, 
federalism makes it possible for Quebeckers to enjoy greater 
protection for their language, their culture and their civil law 
system than would be possible in a unitary state. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it must not be forgotten that Confederation was not 
about creating a customs union or a free trade zone among 
provinces.  Confederation was about creating a new country, 
Canada, for a group of people with a shared identity as 
Canadians.  The creation of a Government of Canada that would be 
elected to represent all Canadians was a critical part of the 
design of the new country.  The federal government continues to 
play a pivotal role in the federation and part of that role is to 
ensure in co-operation with the provinces that there is a strong 
social union that works in the interests of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the government elected to represent Canadians everywhere in 
the country, the Government of Canada has a responsibility to 
represent the national interest of Canadians in the negotiations 
on the social union.  This means working together with all the 
provinces to come up with a proposal that is in the best interest 
of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is for this reason that as Minister of Justice I have been 
given the responsibility of negotiating for the federal 
government on the social union and I continue to negotiate with 
all my provincial colleagues.  It is also for this reason that 
the federal government is trying, one step at a time, to ensure 
that Canadian federalism works as well as it possibly can by 
taking care that each level of government undertakes its 
constitutional responsibilities in the most efficient fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, this government has entered into agreements with 
the provinces concerning labour market developments to ensure the 
best service possible to Canadians who require assistance during 
transitions in their working lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a more general level the federal government has made a 
commitment that it will not undertake any new national shared 
cost programs in the areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction 
without the consent of the majority of the provinces.  That same 
commitment includes a right to reasonable compensation to 
provinces that choose not to participate in the national program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The importance of co-operative federalism cannot be overstated. 
This government has always said that constitutional reform is not 
necessary in order to achieve the common goals of all Canadians. 
The federal and provincial governments may together take an 
approach to the exercise of their constitutional powers that 
respects what the Supreme Court of Canada recently described in 
the reference on Quebec secession as the federalism principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A good example of the success that has already been achieved 
through co-operative federalism in recent years is the national 
child benefit system.  This system was the result of negotiations 
between the provincial and federal governments and has two main 
elements:  increased federal benefits for families with low 
incomes through the Canada child tax benefit, and provincial and 
territorial reinvestments in services and benefits for children 
in low income families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between the two levels of government, each working in a 
collaborative fashion in their areas of jurisdiction, we have 
devised a program that will help to combat child poverty in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I can do no better than to quote the words of the 
governor general in the Speech from the Throne in September of 
last year: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we look forward to the beginning of a new millennium with new 
challenges and new opportunities, we can look back at the last 
century of Canadian history and state with certainty that Canada 
is rightly regarded, the world over, as an extraordinary success. 
Canada represents a triumph of the human spirit, bringing 
together the best of what people can do.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
want to take part in today's debate on the Bloc Quebecois' 
motion concerning a project for social union, following the 
remarks made by the Minister of Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government wants to right a wrong, very often it will 
change a name. Unemployment insurance quickly became employment 
insurance. When protesters shout too loud in front of the Prime 
Minister, he does not hesitate to grab them by the throat, to 
throttle them, to throw them to the ground and to let his 
bodyguards break their teeth. You will agree with me that such 
behaviour certainly helps drive his point home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this social union where the Minister of Justice talks about 
equity and social justice, I wonder what kind of justice she 
sees in the employment insurance program. The fact is that the 
government has accumulated a $20 billion surplus in the 
employment insurance fund over the last four years, mainly on 
the backs of the unemployed since they pay EI premiums, and yet, 
when they lose their jobs, 58% of them are not even eligible for 
benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is just as if 58 out of 100 people paying car insurance found 
out, after a car accident, that they were not covered. I find 
this totally unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Premiums are much too high at $2.70 for every $100 of insurable 
earnings, especially since a reputable actuary said last week 
that $1.81 would be enough. I would like to know the opinion of 
the Minister of Justice on this. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am not sure there 
was actually a question contained in that statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As everyone in the House knows, the Minister of Finance and the 
Minister of Human Resources Development have begun a discussion 
with Canadians and have held consultations with Canadians in 
relation to employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me remind the hon. member that employment insurance is one 
part of the social union framework in this country that makes our 
nation the envy of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, let me remind the hon. member that he and 
other members of the House, as well as all Canadians, will have 
an opportunity to participate, and I urge them to participate, in 
the debate on employment insurance in this country.  It is an 
important debate.  None of us would deny that.  It is a debate on 
which many Canadians, many of my constituents, have views which 
they want to express. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the hon. member not to forget that employment 
insurance is part of the social framework in this country that 
provides all of us and our families with a needed sense of 
security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I simply conclude by encouraging the hon. member to 
partake in this debate.

Madam Speaker, I listened with great interest to the erudite and 
very articulate presentation of the minister.  I would like to 
ask her a very specific question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect, she did not seem to give a lot of substance 
regarding the social contract itself.  I am asking about a 
dispute resolution mechanism or anything to do with clarifying 
the rules of intergovernmental co-operation, or specifically the 
issue of tax transfer points as contemplated by Mr. Charest's 
platform in the Canadian covenant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan:</B>  Madam Speaker, let me reassure the 
hon. member that as the federal negotiator for the social union 
framework, my provincial and territorial colleagues and myself 
have had a number of very promising meetings.  We had another 
meeting last Friday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me assure the hon. member that those discussions are going 
very well.  Flexibility is being displayed by all levels of 
government and by all ministers around the table.  I was 
heartened by the discussion on Friday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, let me reassure this House that provincial, territorial 
and federal ministers around the social union framework table are 
working with one common objective.  Everybody needs to remember 
what that objective is.  It is to develop, to maintain, to 
enhance and to build upon our social programs in this country for 
the benefit of all Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK253"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate having the opportunity to speak to the opposition 
motion.  In particular, I would like to clear up some apparent 
misconceptions regarding how spending on social programs has 
fared under the Canada health and social transfer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government's actions in the area of transfers to the 
provinces clearly demonstrate that social programs are a top 
priority.  This is fact, not partisan rhetoric. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the previous longstanding system of transfer payments to 
the provinces, support for social programs came in two forms. The 
first was a cash component.  In other words, direct funding. 
There was a tax point component, where the federal government let 
provinces step in to collect a share of taxes that would normally 
have been levied by Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not an abstract issue.  Under the formula agreed to, as 
the economy grew it meant that the value of these provincial tax 
points would grow.  That meant that the amount of direct cash 
funding could shrink because the total value of that funding 
would remain constant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this previous approach spelled a problem for the 
provinces because the cash portion was scheduled to gradually 
decline.  In fact, the cash portion was on track to dry up 
completely and there was nothing to prevent it from doing so 
until this government acted in the 1995 budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that budget we replaced the Canada assistance plan and 
established programs financing with the CHST.  In spite of 
enormous fiscal constraints that we faced at that time, we saw to 
it that this new transfer system would include a five year 
guaranteed cash floor of $11 billion in addition to tax points. 
In other words, the cash floor is the minimum amount of cash that 
the provinces receive for health, education and other social 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did more than guarantee sizeable and certain cash transfers 
to substantial social programs such as health care.  At the 
earliest possible opportunity, as soon as we got our fiscal house 
in order, we increased this cash flow to $12.5 billion per year. 
This measure, announced in 1997, means that the provinces will 
receive an extra $7 billion over six years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The interesting thing about this increase is that we brought it 
into effect one year earlier than we originally planned.  We were 
able to increase our commitment to assisting the provinces in 
vital social programs because this government's progress in 
deficit fighting has given us some leeway to allocate more money 
toward new health initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the 1997 budget provided $150 million to the health 
transition fund and $50 million to the Canada health information 
system over a three year period.  Our budget of 1996 set aside 
$65 million for the health services research fund and our most 
recent budget increased funding for the Medical Research Council 
by $65 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>None of this would have been possible without drastic spending 
reductions during the early years of the government's mandate, 
cuts which we made sure were deeper for the federal government 
than for our provincial transfers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most severe cuts were in the area of direct program 
spending, which included the operating costs of government 
departments, business subsidies, department transfers and 
appropriations to crown corporations. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1630"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government also made cuts in transfers to the 
provinces.  When the government has an annual deficit in excess 
of $40 billion and an accumulated debt of over $500 billion, and 
when 20% of spending is on transfers to other orders of 
government, that is to say $1 out of every $5 spent, the choices 
are limited.  There is not the option of cutting transfers to the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are those who would argue very different numbers because 
they refuse to recognize the value of federal tax points in their 
calculations.  They ignore the fact that this is a contribution 
to provincial revenues that keeps growing year after year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has one provincial spokesman suggested a willingness to give the 
tax points back?  This issue is not often debated but it is 
extremely important one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians owe it to themselves in our national policy debates to 
understand the issues involved.  Over the years as 
federal-provincial social programs were developed the federal 
government contribution has taken two forms.  One is the 
commitment of direct contribution, but as of 1977 we also have to 
provide the provinces with tax points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is a tax point transfer?  It simply means that the 
provinces can collect a portion of taxes that would otherwise go 
to the federal government.  In other words, provincial tax 
revenues increase, federal revenues decrease and the national 
taxpayer still pays the same rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are good reasons for provinces to accept these tax points 
because as the economy grows so does the value of these points. 
While there have been economic ups and downs, each of these tax 
points is worth much more today than the programs we funded when 
they were introduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider for a moment the tax points transfer to the 
provinces in 1977 to support health and social programs.  In 1977 
these tax points amounted to about $3 billion in revenues.  Today 
they are worth about $12 billion.  In other words, if the federal 
government did not transfer these tax points it would have some 
$12 billion more in its coffers to spend on health and social 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we hear calls for the federal government to hand over 
billions more for health and social programs, we must remember 
that this ignores the fact that provinces enjoy significant 
additional revenues from tax points they have already collected 
in previous years.  That is why we continue to calculate the 
value of tax points in the final calculation of our transfers to 
the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This being said, I would not deny that we asked the provinces to 
share the fiscal sacrifices that governments had to make.  Nor 
would it be fair for me to belittle or to understate the burden 
of restraint that was imposed by necessity on these governments 
and indeed on all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition must also be fair that the motion we are debating 
today fails the test of fairness in two areas.  First, it fails 
to acknowledge the sheer lack of choice that we faced earlier in 
our mandate, and I have already elaborated on that.  Second is 
the point I would like to address further.  The motion suggests 
that the funding policies of the federal government have 
single-handedly imposed harmful consequences for health care and 
other social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite simply the opposition motion does not tell the whole 
story.  I would like to put it in some perspective.  Earlier in 
my remarks I demonstrated that health and social programs were a 
top priority of the government.  What are the priorities of 
provincial governments? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at the province of Ontario as an example, in the current 
fiscal year the CHST is $850 million less than in 1993-94.  Yet 
Ontario has brought in a tax cut amounting to $4.5 billion.  If 
Ontario can afford a $4.5 billion tax cut then it can afford to 
cover the $850 million it is missing in transfers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize that what the provinces do with their money is beyond 
the scope of this debate, but nevertheless to have a fair, 
meaningful and informed debate about how social programs have 
been affected by savings under the CHST we must remain mindful of 
what we are doing as a government, what we can and what we cannot 
do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can we as a federal government balance the federal budget?  The 
answer is yes.  In fact we have already done that.  By restoring 
order to our finances can we as a federal government do our part 
to ensure that the provinces have more money for health and 
social programs?  Clearly the answer is yes, and we have already 
done that.  We raised the CHST cash floor to $12.5 billion and we 
did it a full year ahead of schedule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a federal government are we in a position to increase direct 
funding to key health initiatives?  The answer is yes. 
As I have already indicated our last three budgets have allocated 
more money toward the health transition fund and other programs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can we as a federal government force the provinces to balance 
their budgets?  The answer is no.  It is up to them.  Some have 
and some have not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can we as a federal government demand that provinces use any 
budgetary surplus for spending on health care?  The answer is no. 
Again that is up to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can we as a federal government insist that the provinces treat 
health care rather than tax cuts as a top spending priority?  The 
answer is no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer to these questions are quite revealing.  For one 
thing they reveal that even though spending on social programs 
may be the top priority in Ottawa, it does not necessarily follow 
that spending on social programs is the top priority of the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mark of leadership is the ability to accept responsibility 
for decisions, even unpopular ones.  The record of the federal 
government speaks for itself.  We have no problem accepting 
responsibility for the tough spending decisions we have made. The 
wisdom of these decisions has been borne out by the dramatic 
turnaround in the fiscal health of our nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot accept blame for weakening the social safety net 
through our restraint measures.  In fact the opposite is true. As 
a government that is once again in control of financial destiny 
we have been able to put in place a sound financial foundation. 
Our fiscal turnaround has meant significantly lower interest 
rates for all governments.  That helps business growth and tax 
revenues.  Together this means lower costs for governments 
themselves and that we are better placed than ever before to 
enhance the quality of life and security of individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The policies I have outlined clearly demonstrate the 
government's commitment to sustaining and improving social 
programs. 
<P><A NAME="LINK254"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
there is one comment the hon. member across the way made that I 
agree with.  He said that the record of the federal government 
speaks for itself.  In reality the record is very different from 
the record the hon. member has described. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we hear on the one hand that the transfer of tax points to 
the provinces over the years has somehow been something that has 
mitigated the damage done by the federal government, let us be 
clear that the situation we are in today in terms of the 
provinces now proposing radical changes to the social union is a 
direct result of the $6 billion cut by the federal government 
from the Canada health and social transfer.  It is a direct 
result of the abandonment of the Canada assistance program that 
laid out the entitlements and rights to Canadians in social 
programs.  That is what the Liberal government has abandoned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the hon. member who gave the same line as the 
hon. government member before him, that somehow Canada is the 
envy of the world.  If that is true then why is it that the UN 
committee studying the economic, cultural and social covenant to 
which Canada is a signatory is asking Canada why we have the 
second worst incidence of child poverty in industrial nations? 
Why is it that we have increasing homelessness that now 
constitutes a national emergency? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those questions are coming from the UN and are being directed to 
the Canadian government.  I think they speak to the true record 
of the government in terms of abandonment of social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will the hon. member say to the 1.4 million children who 
live in poverty or the 5 million Canadians who live in poverty 
and do not get any of the benefits that he speaks about today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert:</B>  Madam Speaker, Canada is a federation 
and therefore there is power sharing among other orders of 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly am not pleased to see that we have a homeless 
situation, that we have people who go to bed hungry.  However 
that is why the government has been working with other orders of 
government in the country to improve the living standards of all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that the responsibility is at the ground 
level but Ottawa can only do so much.  As I pointed out in my 
comments, moneys are transferred to the provinces.  What the 
provinces in some cases are doing with those dollars is open for 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We still have the most liveable cities not only in North America 
but probably in the world.  I would point out to the hon. member 
across the way that the government is committed to working with 
our counterparts across the country.  We are committed to 
improving the standard of living of all Canadians. 
We have demonstrated that.  Certainly the comments I made show 
that we are putting our dollars to work in conjunction with our 
counterparts.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to renew the federation, rather than pointing fingers 
we are trying to get all provinces to work with us to improve the 
state the hon. member talked about just a few moments ago. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK255"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> I cannot believe it, 
Madam Speaker. People must know that, in the 1970s, when the 
federal government and the provinces entered into an agreement 
providing for equalization payments for health, the federal 
government unilaterally cut transfer payments to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These transfers, per capita, were drastically cut year after 
year. More recently, billions of dollars were cut from transfer 
payments for health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the federal government kept the money paid by taxpayers in 
Quebec and the provinces, this money was not available to the 
provinces to provide health care and post-secondary education. 
That is a fact. And the consequences can now be seen from coast 
to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member opposite not agree that the federal 
government abdicated its responsibility, diverted public funds 
and brought the provinces to their knees? It is time for a 
change. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert:</B>  Madam Speaker, I would not agree.  The 
provinces were not brought to their knees.  The national child 
benefit system is an example of redirecting resources toward new 
programs to assist low income families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously this promotes the fact that we are not hearing that 
message from the other side of the House.  When we work together 
that message does not come from the other side.  Only the 
sovereignists, the separatists, continue to say that they want 
the money, they will take the money, but we will not have any say 
in terms of how those dollars are spent.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I will be sharing my time in this pressing debate with the hon. 
member for Edmonton—Strathcona. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise on behalf of the people of Surrey Central to address the 
motion of the Bloc Quebecois.  Briefly the motion talks about the 
House recognizing the disastrous impact federal cuts to social 
transfer payments have had, particularly on health services in 
Canada, and that the House support the consensus reached by the 
provincial ministers in Saskatoon on the social union project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The four principles mentioned in the motion are:  to reinstate 
federal health transfers, to require support of the majority of 
provinces for new federal initiatives, to provide an opt out 
option for the provinces, and to provide new mechanisms of 
co-operation to avoid conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week federal-provincial discussions took place to change 
the way social programs are developed and delivered.  Our new 
Canada act introduced these concepts earlier this year.  This 
indicates that the federal government and the provincial 
governments are somehow getting their ideas from the official 
opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new Canada act unveiled by the official opposition in May 
1998 is a proposed blueprint for building a stronger federation 
in the 21st century.  That act incorporates some of the Reform 
Party's best ideas on strengthening the federation and puts them 
into a new legislative format.  It works on two of the main 
founding principles of the Reform Party of Canada: reform of the 
federation and democratic accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new Canada act outlines how our federation can be 
transformed into a true partnership between the provinces and the 
federal government.  It balances existing powers, strengthening 
the federal and provincial governments in several key areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present Liberal government has shown no leadership on one of 
the most important issues facing the country.  When it comes to 
strengthening our federation, the Liberals have been unable to 
reach beyond the status quo.  Our leader has said that it is our 
duty as the official opposition to fill this leadership vacuum.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The social union discussion on the weekend was the first where 
Quebec was a participant and not just an observer.  It makes me 
proud that the new Canada act introduced by our worthy leader 
with a true vision of Canada is an alternative that federalists 
as well as separatists will embrace.  Therefore I will be voting 
to support this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that the Liberal government has been making 
massive cuts to transfer payments to the provinces, amounting to 
about $6 billion or 23%. This has completely destabilized the 
social safety net.  As a result it has placed greater pressure on 
provincial governments.  It has forced cuts in hospitals, medical 
staff and pharmacare programs.  All the while the Prime Minister 
and the finance minister, the prime minister wannabe, shed 
crocodile tears and pose as the champions of medicare. Our health 
care is suffering.  Just yesterday the old Calgary General 
Hospital building was demolished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cuts to health care by this Liberal government have affected the 
delivery of health services in Surrey Memorial Hospital in my 
constituency.  Patients have even died due to lack of adequate 
equipment and services.  All schools, hospitals and medical or 
health care facilities across Canada have been hurt by the 
government's efforts to balance the federal budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have not reduced or eliminated waste and 
duplication in government spending.  Immediately upon balancing 
the federal budget, the government announced new spending 
initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to emphasize that the Liberals balanced the 
budget by raising taxes.  They did it on the backs of Canadian 
taxpayers.  They did it by giving Canadians the highest tax 
burden in the G-7 countries. Nothing is sacred.  The Liberal 
finance minister is eagerly and desperately searching for a way 
to take and spend the $20 billion employment insurance surplus. I 
warn the Liberals that Canadians will not stand for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surrey Memorial Hospital is supposed to be providing hospital 
services for our community.  Many people in Surrey Central tell 
me about the long waiting time, sometimes one to five hours, in 
the emergency ward.  The situation is so bad that many of the 
people I talk to say they will go to a hospital in Vancouver if 
they need emergency medical attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surrey is probably the fastest growing city in Canada.  Our 
hospital services have not kept pace with our growth but the 
cold-hearted finance minister, the legal-talking lawyer health 
minister and the know nothing Prime Minister do not care about 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have a health care system in Canada.  We have a 
sickness care system.  The system does not help you stay healthy 
or get healthy; the system only serves you if you are already 
sick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Turning to the question of the House supporting the consensus on 
a social union project reached by the provincial ministers in 
Saskatoon, we know that the only stumbling block to support for 
the project is the Prime Minister.  The provinces want to limit 
the federal government's power to launch new programs in areas of 
provincial jurisdiction, such as health and education, without 
their support. They want better collaboration in launching new 
social programs and rules established in the event that 
collaboration fails. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This desire to establish rules is magnified because of concerns 
about remarks made by our Prime Minister last month.  His 
willingness to give up some control over social programs was not 
made clear.  His remarks in an interview claimed that “if the 
premiers do not want to take what I am offering, they take 
nothing”.  This is completely unacceptable.  The Prime Minister 
prefers fighting the old battles and maintaining divisions rather 
than bringing people together. No one is free to disagree with 
the Prime Minister.  If you do, you will get fired or pepper 
sprayed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reinstating federal health transfers has been a Reform Party 
policy for at least as long as the Liberals have been cutting the 
transfers. 
In our fresh start platform we promised $4 billion more for 
health and education.  We would have gone through our federal 
government's expenditures department by department, program by 
program, and if necessary, desk by desk to reduce and eliminate 
wasteful spending and duplication of work. On the contrary, 
Liberals preferred to fund the old pork barrel programs and 
sometimes invent new ones like the millennium scholarship fund. 
As the government we could find taxpayers' money to redirect to 
health and education.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, requiring the support of the majority of the provinces 
before starting new federal initiatives that are under provincial 
jurisdiction is a proposal found in the new Canada Act.  Why 
would we want our federal government to implement a program that 
six of the provinces did not want? The new Canada Act calls for 
the federal government to have the support of seven provinces and 
50% of the population before foisting a program on all of us and 
forcing taxpayers to finance it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc motion also asks the House to support providing an opt 
out option for provinces with full compensation from new or 
modified federal social programs in the provinces' jurisdiction 
when that province offers a program or initiates a project in the 
same field of activity. The new Canada Act that the Reform Party 
is promoting offers an unconditional opt out clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc asks us to support providing new mechanisms of 
co-operation to avoid conflicts to deal with them fairly.  No 
room for pepper spray here.  I presume the Prime Minister will 
not be able to support this one. This is a well-known legal tool 
used to reduce levels of conflict.  The goal is to replace the 
adversarial system of conflict and dispute resolution with a more 
co-operative system.  Arbitration can protect both sides in a 
dispute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be happy to support this motion.  As hon. members know, 
the Liberals have been sneakily recycling our ideas and the other 
opposition parties have been learning from us as well.  Now the 
Bloc has shown some interest in us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud of my leader and Canadians will be proud when he is 
the next Prime Minister of Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK257"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
would like to congratulate my colleague on the comments that he 
has made.  I encourage him to continue in that direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a couple of issues I think we should explore a little 
further.  There have been accusations made by other members of 
the House.  They suggested that what we really want to put 
together is a potpourri of the social service programs so that 
each province has its own special little program which is 
different from any other, so there will be no continuity of 
programs and everything will really be chaos and there will be no 
standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the references in the new Canada Act says very clearly 
the establishment of national standards with regard to social 
programs and things of this type.  It seems to me that we need to 
be very careful how we do this.  There seems to be a borrowing of 
ideas by the Liberal Party in particular.  It seems that the 
Liberals forget completely to study the concept and to understand 
what we are really trying to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am wondering if my hon. colleague could help the Liberals 
understand what we are really trying to do so that they are not 
taking things on the surface and forgetting totally what this is 
really all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for the wonderful question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new Canada act is a draft.  It is there for public 
consultation.  It is so good that everyone is embracing it and we 
are getting very positive responses from every corner in the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand the remarks of the Prime Minister who is 
supposed to lead this country are very arrogant.  Can anyone 
believe the Prime Minister of Canada making these remarks when he 
says that if the premiers do not want to take what he is 
offering, they take nothing.  I do not expect that from the Prime 
Minister of Canada. Probably the prime minister of Indonesia 
could make that kind of comment.  It is very arrogant and is not 
acceptable in our society.

year is working and we are getting responses from every corner. 
I am sure that the other parties are getting these ideas and I am 
very happy and proud that they are learning from the Reform 
Party.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I listened to the hon. member across 
the way recite Reform dogma.  I am wondering if he really 
understands what tax credits to the provinces mean because that 
was part of his speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have watched the economy grow because we have the deficit 
down to a zero balance and we have the government budget under 
control. The rest of the countries in the world see that we are 
serious about fiscal restraint. We have had economic growth of 4% 
in the last few years and this year looks like it will be around 
3%.  That means to say that the provinces have got 4% more and 3% 
more.  Interest rates are at a 30-year low which means the 
servicing on their debt is lower. Does the member really 
understand all this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Madam Speaker, the question speaks 
for itself as to how the Liberal Party understands the important 
issues in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The transfer payments to the provinces were cut by the huge 
amount of 23% which is more than $6 billion.  It affects health 
care and education in our provinces.  The provincial governments 
and the municipal governments are under pressure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite the hon. member to come to my constituency and talk to 
the people who are not offered emergency services. How long is 
the waiting period?  How many hospital beds are closing?  I ask 
the member to wake up and listen to Canadians to understand the 
situation in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about balancing the budget and eliminating the 
deficit.  Anyone can balance the budget.  They could have 
balanced the budget 29 years ago if it was to be balanced on the 
backs of the Canadian taxpayers.  We are paying 28% higher taxes 
than the average of the G-8 countries.  We are paying higher 
taxes than the Americans south of the border.  Look at the effect 
on the Canadian dollar.  The Canadian dollar is diving.  The hon. 
member needs to understand all these things before he asks that 
kind of question.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the House to speak to the Bloc 
Quebecois motion on the social union. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had the opportunity to work with the hon. member for 
Témiscamingue and I admire his passion for politics, his 
political smarts and his dedication to his constituents. I think 
this motion clearly shows the failure of the status quo and how 
this failure hinders the delivery of social programs in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a discussion forum in Quebec City and a similar meeting in my 
riding of Edmonton—Strathcona, everyone realized that the hon. 
member for Témiscamingue and I were proposing a slightly 
different approach to resolving the national unity problem. 
But we both understand that this problem is mainly the result of 
federal mismanagement of constitutional affairs and social 
policy. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has overstepped its jurisdiction and has 
entered into areas that rightfully belong in the domain of the 
provinces.  This federal intervention is seen as a kind of 
insulting paternalism in Quebec, Alberta and the rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As is being discussed today, the federal intervention has also 
led to the deterioration of Canada's social programs.  The 
federal government promised a centrally planned and administered 
solution to our social needs.  It has not been able to live up to 
that promise. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all due respect, I would like to remind my colleagues in 
the Bloc Quebecois, whom we should congratulate on their motion, 
that we can build a new partnership within Confederation if we 
keep trying to break the federal government's monopoly. We must 
bring about changes that will ensure every province has the 
level of autonomy it demands.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion addresses among other things the very serious 
problem of underfunding of our national health care.  When the 
federal government established the Canada Health Act there was an 
understanding that it would pay 50% of the costs.  In exchange 
the federal government was able to implement the nationwide 
health care program that legally bound the provinces to implement 
health care according to dictates of Ottawa.  Many Canadians 
viewed this as a fair exchange.  The provinces lost some autonomy 
but Canadians saw the benefits of a nationwide comprehensive 
health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This system is no longer working the way it was supposed to. 
Since 1994 cuts to health care and social transfers have reached 
23%.  The federal government does not even meet half the 
commitment to the provinces it said it would commit under the 
Canada Health Act.  The same federal Liberal politicians who 
claim to care about health care are starving the provinces of 
health care dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The irony in this is that premiers Ralph Klein, Mike Harris and 
others have received criticism for trying to work creatively 
within a cash strapped health care environment.  This has meant 
some tough choices but the Canadian people should remember that 
it is the federal government that has broken its health care 
promise to the people and not our premiers. The Prime Minister 
has let us down and the premiers are working to fix the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has not only broken his promise to the people 
of Canada, he has ignored the legal opinion of the supreme court 
which over the summer stated that the federal government has a 
duty to enter into good faith negotiations with any provinces 
dissatisfied with the status quo.  When the first ministers get 
together defers to old style political bullying. The Prime 
Minister wants to call the shots without making a fair 
contribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a new reality in Canadian politics that the Liberals 
are going to have to understand.  There is now widespread support 
for the rebalancing of powers and widespread dissatisfaction with 
overcentralized, out of touch Liberal style federalism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from the Bloc has brought attention to an issue 
Reformers have campaigned on for some time, the need to reinvest 
in health care.  Reformer has proposed a $4 billion reinvestment 
that would come from cuts to programs we believe are not core 
government services.  Any politician who does not believe there 
is at least $4 billion of waste in the federal government is 
either dishonest or asleep. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is not finding the waste.  The problem is convincing 
Liberal politicians to stop playing politics with the paycheques 
of average Canadians and to start spending taxpayer money on 
programs taxpayers actually support.  Why is the Liberal 
government spending money on the millennium fund when health care 
remains underfunded?  Why has it once again interfered with 
provincial jurisdiction? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important aspect of the social union is the suggestion 
that the federal government should actually have to work to gain 
the support of 50% of the provinces before pursuing a new 
program. Imagine a system where the federal government has to 
find support for federal programs before moving ahead with them. 
This would be truly revolutionary in Canadian politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has outlined in the new Canada act a provision 
that seven provinces must give their support before a federal 
initiative can be implemented.  But the provision in front of us 
today calling for six provinces to commit to a program is 
definitely a good place to begin.  If the federal government goes 
ahead with the program after six provinces have signed on, those 
provinces that are not supportive of the federal initiative can 
pursue their own programs with full compensation.  This is very 
important. For too long the federal government has used its 
powers of taxation to ignore constitutionally protected 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the federal government is interested in seeing quality 
programs implemented it should not be concerned if they are being 
implemented at the provincial level or the federal level. It 
should be argued that programs administered locally better meet 
the needs of the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion also suggests some form of conflict resolution 
strategy should be created in cases where the federal government 
and the province or provinces disagree as to what qualifies as an 
equivalent provincial program.  I have looked into a prospect of 
a national standards tribunal, a proposal that goes beyond what 
is mentioned in the new Canada act and what is being offered 
today by my hon. colleague from Témiscamingue.  It is a project I 
will continue to work on, as I believe there is clearly a dilemma 
between the rebalancing of powers and the establishment of 
national standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are not prepared to accept extreme regional disparity. 
Nor are they prepared to accept poor federal mismanagement of 
social programs. 
Therefore some dispute mechanism must be created that addresses 
the question of jurisdiction in the context of national 
standards.

powers and the return of many powers to the provinces but to 
reaffirm my commitment and to find a way to remove the obstacles 
currently standing in the way of the success of the new Canada 
act and the proposal put together by the premiers in 
Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal failure to understand that Canadians want to see 
fundamental changes to the administration of Canadian social 
programs will very likely become the single most united force in 
the united alternative effort.  Status quo federalism is a 
failure that Liberals continue to hang on to, despite the damage 
it is doing to national unity and despite the damage it is doing 
to the Canadian social fabric.  It is a shame that Canadians have 
to suffer, but I am optimistic that this issue will unify 
Canadians in opposition against an arrogant, out of control 
Liberal government that refuses to listen to the people, the 
provinces, the courts or anyone else who disagrees with it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, as my hon. colleague said, this is 
really a speech that we have to take with a grain of salt from 
what I have heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform's 1995 taxpayers' budget, which Reformers have cited so 
many times, called for $3 billion worth of cuts in transfers to 
the provinces for health, education and welfare.  Their plan also 
called for a further $3.6 billion to cuts in other transfers, 
including equalization payments.  On top of that, the $7.4 
billion that the Reform wanted to slash from programs was funded 
directly by the federal government such as seniors pensions, 
employment insurance and an additional $1 billion worth of cuts 
to social security spending.  That is $15 billion worth of cuts 
in social programs. I think the member is talking through his 
hat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer:</B>  Madam Speaker, obviously the hon. 
member needs some clarification because he is probably reading 
those statistics upside down, as Liberals normally do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I can take a moment to clarify our position.  The Reform 
Party has always campaigned that there should be more money made 
available especially for health care and education. That is in 
all our campaign material from the last election and we continue 
to say it is possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason we say that is we all know, as I mentioned in my 
speech, this government fails to see what exactly it needs to 
priorize when it comes to spending. If we would sit down and put 
partisan politics aside, as we continue to hear from that corner 
of the House, and say what is best for Canadians perhaps we could 
find the solutions that the Reform Party has put forward when it 
comes to putting more money in areas of health care and 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not get into the specifics, but we have outlined areas 
where we see enormous amounts of waste in the way the federal 
government spends its money.  I would take the time with the hon. 
member any time to show him that waste and hopefully we can come 
to the conclusion that the Reform Party has the answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to work with the provinces, unlike the heavy handed way 
of central government we have seen from the Liberals.  We want to 
work with the provinces to actually achieve their goals in the 
best possible way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage the member to take a close look at those figures and 
look at himself and see that the Liberals have done more to hurt 
the social union in Canada than the Reform has ever done in its 
history.

combined?

</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that, does it not make sense to try to work with the 
provinces as we proposed in the new Canada act? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for Medicine Hat for his well stated question.  I agree with him 
totally.  It has been unfortunate that the Liberals and 
governments of the past have managed in such a poor fashion to 
cut over $7 billion in transfers to the provinces.  Shame.  That 
is what I say.  I agree with the hon. member that it is a 
terrible thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we propose and what we have always said, as the hon. member 
questioned, is there needs to be a stronger commitment from the 
federal government to deal with the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard from a number of members that the tax points are an 
element that the provinces can use in order to spend money within 
their provinces. There still remains a problem of flexibility 
that comes with this argument of tax points.  If the provincial 
governments do have increased tax points, as many members 
opposite argued, what good are those tax points if they do not 
have the flexibility to actually implement the programs that 
would work best within their provinces? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the core of the debate is also addressing the fact that 
the federal government needs to move outside of this domain of 
central, heavy handed politics and start working to create a real 
sense of unity, start working to entrench the transfers that were 
initially taken out of the system by this government and build 
stronger unity in this country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I have just a 
few comments on the motion before the House. I will make a few 
remarks on the federal government and its initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have clearly shown Canadians that we are not interested in 
turf wars.  The Government of Canada wants first and foremost to 
offer equal opportunities to each and every one of its citizens. 
We are absolutely convinced that all Canadians have an 
irrevocable right of access to comparable social programs and 
services, regardless of the region in which they live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government has implemented a variety of initiatives aimed at 
redefining the roles and responsibilities of the federal 
government and the provinces, and has contributed to renewed 
federalism.  On the leading edge of these initiatives is the 
federal-provincial-territorial council on social policy reform, a 
forum which enables the government to strike productive 
partnerships for joint solutions to the most common social 
problems facing Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The council on social policy reform has met four times since its 
establishment in June 1996. Over that short time, our country 
has witnessed unprecedented co-operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The innovative initiatives that have ensued are clear evidence 
that the elements uniting us outnumber those dividing us.  More 
specifically, they demonstrate that governments are at their 
most effective when they pool their efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national child benefit is a perfect example of this new 
collaborative approach. 
In the summer of 1996, the premiers made child poverty one of 
their priorities and agreed to co-operate with the Government of 
Canada to provide an integrated child benefit system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As soon as the government negotiators focused on the real goal, 
which is to provide children with a good start in life to help 
them become healthy, educated and productive adults, partisan 
politics were set aside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, I am sorry. I forgot to tell you that I will be 
splitting my time with the hon. member for Wentworth—Burlington.

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Negotiators of both levels of government realized that it was 
important to ensure that poor children have a chance to make it. 
They realized that the fight against child poverty requires a 
national effort based on a constructive partnership between the 
federal government and the provinces and territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In January, we started to put $800 million back in the pockets of 
middle income working families with children. An additional 
amount of $850 million will be given to them in the year 2000, 
for a total of $1.7 billion handed out every year to the middle 
income working families. 
And that is in addition to the $5.1 billion we now allocate to 
families with children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind my hon. colleagues, and in particular the sponsor of 
the motion before the House today, that, thanks to the increased 
Canadian child tax benefit, the province of Quebec now has 
access to an additional $150 million a year to provide programs 
and services that can meet the particular needs of Quebeckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the agreement reached on the national child benefit, a 
working group made up of federal, provincial and territorial 
representatives started to develop a national action plan for 
children to promote the well-being of Canadian children through 
new policies and procedures in terms of social services, health, 
justice and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are fed up with federal-provincial bickering. They know 
we live in a democracy and differences of opinion are 
unavoidable, but coexistence is possible. As a matter of fact, 
they want us to work in co-operation to establish efficient and 
sustainable social programs for the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If anybody has doubts about the determination of the Government 
of Canada to take this approach, he should consider the 
agreements on labour market development we have signed with the 
provinces and territories in the last two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Témiscamingue will certainly agree with me 
that our unprecedented offer to transfer to provinces and 
territories the jurisdiction over labour market development has 
allowed Quebec to design and implement training programs suited 
to its particular needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These agreements fulfil the Canadian government's commitment to 
get out of labour training, and they show that the Canadian 
federation changes to meet the needs of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, we are going to transfer $2.7 billion to the Quebec 
government under the terms of the Canada-Quebec agreement on 
labour market development for active programs to help the 
unemployed re-enter the labour force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These agreements give new opportunities by reducing duplication 
and overlap. Even more important, they yield concrete results. 
They allow governments to improve employment opportunities for 
Canadians by providing them with good services at the right 
place and time, and at the lowest cost possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This new distribution of powers shows that, with a few mutual 
concessions, governments can effectively consolidate the social 
union. Thus, we can co-operate to achieve common social goals 
and, in doing so, create governmental programs that are better 
targeted, improve the delivery of services and make considerable 
savings.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As we all know, the most recent talks on the social union were 
held in Edmonton last Friday. I learned with great pleasure that 
this meeting was very productive, the province of Quebec being 
represented for the very first time at the negotiating table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The media echoed comments by the Quebec minister of Canadian 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Joseph Facal, who said that he was 
confident about the outcome, which hints at the possibility of 
new developments in the next few days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The negotiations on the social union are tangible evidence that 
it is possible to live together in harmony, thanks to the 
respect and trust that we have for each other. It is possible to 
share the same values of generosity and social justice, without 
giving up traditions and approaches exclusive to each region in 
the area of social development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this opportunity to congratulate all my colleagues from 
both sides of the House who took part in this very important 
debate. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK263"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
would like to make a couple of comments and to question the hon. 
member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened very carefully to what he had to say about the social 
union.  He made it sound like a very positive affair. However, I 
think one concern expressed by Canadians right across the country 
is that basically the deliberations taking place between the 
provincial premiers and the federal government on the social 
union have absolutely no context in terms of a public debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no involvement by the Canadian people as to what should 
constitute a social union in Canada, what the relationship should 
be between the provincial governments and the federal government 
when it comes to jurisdictions of the provinces or the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the hon. member believe that such a closed door, 
backroom process that has basically cut out and censored the 
Canadian people from that debate is something to speak of so 
positively? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member believes the social union that is being 
developed is something so positive, why is it that basically in 
Canada the social safety is in complete tatters?  We have growing 
homelessness and growing poverty as result of his government's 
policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do he and his government propose to say to Canadians who 
have now been placed at increasing risk and are very vulnerable 
because of the $6 billion cut to those programs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb:</B>  Madam Speaker, I hope the hon. member is 
not suggesting that the two provincial NDP governments from 
Saskatchewan and British Columbia have entered the meetings 
unprepared and without consulting their people.  One would assume 
that the premiers, the NDP government and the other 
representatives of the other political parties would at least 
have some understanding of what their people want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for us at the federal level, this is an ongoing discussion 
and debate.  Many of my colleagues and I on a regular daily basis 
hear from our constituents that they want a framework which 
responds to the needs of the people, a framework which is 
flexible and maintains the integrity of social programs from one 
end of the country to the next. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the member it was not too long ago that one of our 
ministers responsible for the transfer payments to social 
programs threatened not to give one of the provinces the transfer 
payment for social services.  That was the province of British 
Columbia.  The province decided on its own to tinker with the 
social program the federal government had set up and it 
threatened not to give the money for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue to maintain a social program that is flexible, 
that is national in scope, and that responds to the needs of the 
people.

their people. 
<P><A NAME="LINK264"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I begin by observing that politicians are the 
representatives of the people.  We are supposed to hear from the 
people and carry on a debate such as this one in a forum like 
this place.  This is democracy in action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the member for Témiscamingue for putting his 
motion on the order paper and giving us an opportunity to debate 
it today on behalf of all our constituents and all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to take part because I would like to take the 
debate around the corner and deal with another aspect of the 
problem of transferring money from the federal government to the 
provincial government for health and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One idea we have not debated much in the House today—and it has 
not been much of a debate at all—is that we should be examining, 
among other things, how efficiently that money is used by the end 
users, principally education and medical institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is certainly true that the federal government cut social 
transfers and that the Ontario government passed that cut on to 
hospitals and universities.  This is not to disparage the Ontario 
government.  Indeed I hope it is listening.  One of the problems 
with what it did is that it basically cut approximately 20% out 
of the funds available for hospitals and universities as a result 
of the cuts in transfer payments by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with that is when an efficient organization running 
at 100% efficiency is cut by 20%, the organization gets hurt.  On 
the other hand, if institutions that are running at 50%, 60% or 
70% efficiency are cut by 20% they are not hurt.  In fact they 
become even more inefficient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question I would like to raise is whether or not, 
particularly the hospitals and the universities and especially 
the hospitals, are using the money they receive from all levels 
of government as wisely and effectively as they should. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The money involved is big.  It is not just the $12.5 billion in 
social transfers from the federal government.  It is also from 
the provincial governments.  It amounts annually for hospitals 
alone from government sources to $17 billion a year.  When we 
include universities and other higher education institutions the 
amount is $34 billion per year.  That is a lot of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty is that the institutions receiving this money, 
again particularly hospitals and universities, are charities. 
They are usually incorporated as non-profit organizations under 
the Canada Corporations Act.  These two business entities or 
organizational entities that comprise hospitals and universities 
have very little requirement in law for the kind of transparency 
that other institutions have which leads to accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It might amaze members to realize that a non-profit corporation, 
for example, does not need to have, certainly under the federal 
statute, a chartered accountant perform its audit.  It does not 
have to submit annual financial statements to the government as 
do non-profit organizations.  There is a serious omission here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The board of governors of a non-profit corporation has no 
standards set by any level of government to explain what it does. 
When they are charity boards of governors the only legislation 
that pertains to them is no legislation at all.  It is case law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have this very big difficulty about whether a charity or 
non-profit organization, the collective of these, is actually 
spending the money it is receiving from both the provinces and 
the federal government in a way that the public can monitor 
effectively and know that money is being well spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Témiscamingue earlier in the debate said that we 
should let the control of health care and education be done by 
the citizens, those who are closest to the situation.  We cannot 
do that if the citizens do not know what is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to hospitals I will give a few examples from my 
own area, although there are anecdotal examples across the 
country. 
The Hamilton Health Sciences Corporation in my riding is in a bit 
of a controversy.  It was contracting out brain injured patients 
to a facility in Texas which turned out to have such a bad 
reputation for treating patients that the state of Texas would 
not use the facility.  When the Hamilton Health Sciences 
Corporation was challenged on this by local journalists and the 
local MPP, its chief executive responded that it was not the 
obligation of the institution to monitor what was happening in 
Texas.  This is the problem of a hospital contracting out without 
careful due diligence as to whether it is a good facility and the 
public does not even know this is happening.

<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must ask ourselves if we want to know in detail how hospitals 
and other institutions are carrying on when they contract out 
services.  I suggest that this is only the tip of the iceberg of 
a very big problem.  It is not just a matter of health care and 
care for the patients, it is a matter of the effective use of 
taxpayer dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other areas concerning compensation which have created 
another major problem in my riding.  Chedoke-McMaster Hospitals 
gave a severance package to their chief administrator worth 
$818,000.  That is an incredibly unacceptable use of taxpayer 
dollars, but that was done.  I will not go into the details of 
this controversy because it is the subject of litigation, but 
when the chief executive was hired in 1991 she immediately hired 
onto the staff a close personal friend.  This is a case of 
nepotism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One might say that the board of directors of the hospital should 
be in control of this.  But I challenge members to talk to 
politicians and citizens who have served on hospital boards of 
directors.  They will say that trying to get information out of 
the administrators of hospitals is near impossible.  The reason 
is that there are no standards.  There is no countrywide standard 
for the administration of charities and non-profit corporations 
which would apply in the case of hospitals that are spending $17 
billion a year as of 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a great deal of anecdotal information about how 
hospitals contract out for goods and services.  Hospitals do not 
have to issue tenders.  They can do it however they want, and 
indeed this happens.  Gifts are received by people in the 
business of purchasing for hospitals.  I do not know about 
universities, but certainly for hospitals there is a lot of very 
negative information about how goods and services are purchased 
and gifts are exchanged.  This is all because of a lack of 
transparency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cuts originally made by the federal government and the cuts 
that were inevitably and maybe properly passed on would have 
worked.  I do not know whether the Ontario government had much 
choice or whether any other provincial government did.  Those 
cuts would have been efficient if only we could have rid the 
institutions of the inefficiencies.  These institutions cut 
nursing staff and beds when they should have been cutting 
administrators.  They should have been cutting the fat out of 
their bureaucracies.  The machinery is not there and the 
transparency is not there to enable this to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would encourage and seek the support of other members of the 
House for any initiative that might come in this House that would 
involve bringing a greater level of transparency and 
accountability to charities and not for profit organizations.  It 
is imperative that we re-examine the Canada Corporations Act and 
require at least the same level of transparency that exists with 
for profit corporations or, at the very least, the same level of 
transparency that exists now with bureaucracies.  That would be 
an important first step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next thing would be to re-examine the government's 
obligation to oversee charities across the country and perhaps to 
write new legislation that defines the standards of 
accountability and transparency for charities.  That would go a 
long way to making the cuts in social transfers acceptable to 
Canadians.

BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I will be brief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to tell us whether he is in favour of 
the part of the motion we moved today, which would give a 
province the right to opt out with full compensation when a 
federal program does not meet its needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member willing to push the proposal which was unanimously 
approved by all the premiers in Saskatoon, giving a province the 
right to opt out with full compensation, provided it reinvests 
in the same area, and sell it to the Prime Minister, who seems 
to have his mind made up on the matter, in sharp contrast with 
the consensus reached in Saskatoon? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  No, Madam Speaker, I would not support 
the motion, simply because if we are going to have a standard in 
every province across the country then it has to be the national 
government which sets that standard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with the provinces is that they all seem to want to 
go it alone.  Ontario made a 20% cut.  However, it did not think 
to create efficiencies in the institutions that it was cutting. I 
think that leadership has to come from the federal government so 
that we can give all Canadians the same opportunities to health 
care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am the first one to admit that Quebec, if it can go it alone, 
may do it better and more efficiently, but what about the rest of 
the country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is very important that the national government be a 
national government and show leadership in this. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to remind my 
colleague that the Saskatoon proposal provides for the right to 
opt out with full compensation, but it is also possible for five 
provinces representing the majority of Canadians to set up 
different programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This forms a whole. This would allow English provinces to have 
the federal government agree to their program while Quebec would 
set up its own. Would it not be a way to allow every province to 
develop programs meeting its particular needs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague said earlier that we cannot do away with 
leadership. 
It should not be forgotten that our proposal includes decision 
making mechanisms. The provinces could not do it alone, but they 
could have some influence to avoid a repeat of what we saw with 
the millennium scholarship fund when, because of its autocratic 
attitude, the federal government created a system parallel to 
the existing one in Quebec, the loans and bursaries system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is my colleague adamant in his view that it is unacceptable for 
Quebec to exercise its right to opt out with full compensation, 
and that, basically, he would rather see Quebec leave Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B> Madam Speaker, we are all in the same boat.  We 
must work together on that boat.  In my opinion, the federal 
government must show leadership in this matter.

somewhat amazed to hear the Liberal member answering my 
colleague by saying we are all in the same boat and need to all 
row in the same direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He does not know his history and he does not respect the 
constitution.  In the constitution, we in Quebec had rights as a 
people.  When the government interferes in an area that comes 
under provincial jurisdiction, as it does in Quebec, we are not 
in the same boat.

women are poor. I would like him to think about that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Madam Speaker, I strongly feel that if 
any province is disadvantaged in this country then it is the duty 
of the federal government to come to its rescue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now things are fairly good in Quebec.  Elsewhere in the 
country they are not so good.  It is true that, given the money, 
Quebec does have the expertise to manage it well.  I do not doubt 
that for an instant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as Canadians we must look to the entire country.  This 
is federal money we are talking about.  It is all very well to 
talk about provincial rights, but we are talking about federal 
money.  As long as this money is coming from the federal 
government, then surely the federal government should make sure 
that it is used in the interests of all Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House recognize the very harmful effect of federal

union, with the following main components, 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will deal with those components later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to return to the very harmful impact of federal 
cuts on the Canada social transfer.  I would first like to point 
out that, before the transfer, there were inter-regional 
subsidies, if I may put it that way.  There used to be the 
Régime d'assistance publique du Canada, the RAPC, the Canada 
assistance plan or CAP. 
There were programs that subsidized individual Canadians equally 
in matters of health and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Canada assistance plan, need determined the level of 
funding.  In other words, since the end of the 1960s, the poorer 
provinces received more of the money set aside to fight poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has the Liberal government done since it took office?  It 
eliminated the Canada assistance plan and the established 
programs financing and came up with a single amount for 
essentially equal redistribution among all the provinces.  In 
other words, Quebec, which had been entitled to 34% of the 
Canada assistance plan because of its needs, found itself with a 
share of the Canada social transfer that was equal and 
proportional to its population.  The first cut was on needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec was relieved to not be held back any more by a set of 
standards that some regretted, but that others regretted less, 
because they prevented what happened under the Canada assistance 
plan.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This set of standards precluded among other things the 
reimbursement of the difference between the salary paid to 
individuals who chose to work to earn a living and social 
assistance allowance paid out by Quebec since 1975, in 1976 
under the PQ government, to encourage those who wanted to not to 
go on welfare and to stay in the labour force. Incentives were 
provided, so that workers would not be penalized for working 
instead of going on welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This system, which was introduced in Quebec after 1976, in 1977 
I think, and was still in place when the Canada health and 
social transfer was announced, has never been compensated by the 
federal government. 
In other words, Quebec could get 50% of its social assistance 
expenditures refunded by the federal government, out of the 
Canada assistance plan account, but it had to make up the 
difference out of its own pocket for the working poor. There is 
no doubt the Canada assistance plan needed to be changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada health and social transfer was the first form of cut 
sustained by Quebec. 
The following year, the federal government slashed funding 
across the board bringing social transfer payments down from $19 
billion to $11.7 billion, imposing an initial cut of $7 billion. 
In the last election, it gave us back $1 billion, claiming to be 
increasing payments when in fact it was reducing the cut by $1 
billion. With these drastic cuts, being made in often difficult 
circumstances because unemployment was high, Quebec ended up 
paying a high price for the adjustments made by the federal 
government in its fight against the deficit. The social 
transfer, in itself and as a channel for making more cuts, has 
taken its toll. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When, in its motion, the Bloc asks that the federal government 
put money back into the Canada social transfer, it seems to me 
that members on all sides should applaud. 
It is essential that now that the federal government, to a much 
greater extent than it cares to admit, has eliminated the 
deficit by taking money—that is what we said, and it is true—from 
those who could least afford it, return the money to the health, 
education and welfare sectors through the Canada social 
transfer.  It must not start dreaming up new programs like the 
millennium scholarships, regardless of whose ego is in need of 
stroking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the people who have been hurt, and who are still 
hurting.  Seventy-five cents of each dollar cut in Quebec last 
year was because of federal cuts in health and education.  The 
Government of Quebec was stuck with actually making the cuts and 
is the one being blamed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the entire House should agree that the money should be 
returned to the Canada social transfer and nowhere else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the motion goes further.  It says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House—support the consensus achieved by the 
provincial Premiers in Saskatoon on a project for social union, 
with the following main components:

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members opposite who are so fond of saying that Canada's 
federalism is the most flexible and “federalizing” of all are 
demonstrating their great ignorance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several federations I know cannot even conceive of the central 
government—which is not the best government, not a more 
intelligent government with greater compassion, but just another 
level of government—deciding unilaterally to interfere in areas 
that, under the terms of the Constitution, belong to another 
level of government—which is not inferior in level, intelligence 
or compassion, but merely has different responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion says that there should be “support from a majority of 
provinces before new [federal] initiatives—” 
We could have gone a lot further. Everyone should have no 
problem agreeing with that wording. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I am sure there will be a problem with a fundamental issue, 
since the notion of the social union is no longer a meaningless 
expression coined for Quebec. Indeed, the provincial premiers 
agree on “the right to opt out, with full compensation, of a new 
or modified Canada-wide federal government social program—because, 
as we know, some amendments can change the nature of 
things—in areas of provincial jurisdiction when the province—and 
here Quebec made a concession considering what has existed 
for 30 years—offers a program or introduces an initiative in 
the same field”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This right to opt out with full compensation is essential, not 
for Quebec's sovereignty, but so that the existing 
constitution—which has been terribly twisted, transformed and 
tainted—may have a minimum of meaning, and so that in the social 
sector—which, historically, was strictly a provincial 
jurisdiction—there would be no question of imposing on a 
province—and I am thinking of Quebec of course—programs and 
amendments regarding which a province could not opt out with full 
compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why? Why Quebec? Because in the social sector people can make 
different choices. These choices are all legitimate, but they 
are different. In Europe, some countries have the same level of 
social spending, but the choices they make are different. It is 
a matter of culture, because culture also involves that aspect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the social field, the key word for effectiveness is 
integration. 
Quebec can have a co-ordinated range of social policies because 
this is what it wants given its priorities, the priorities set 
by the National Assembly—not by one party or another, but by 
the National Assembly. It wants this integration to ensure a 
better use of the money and a greater effectiveness of the 
resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this government was elected, the Standing Committee on 
Human Resources Development was asked to conduct a comprehensive 
review of social policy. From the outset, it was felt that the 
integration of social policies would be a priority. It is 
strange how all researchers and, I might say, the rest of Canada—that 
expression “the rest of Canada” is not from us—were 
hoping that the integration would be implemented by the federal 
government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rest of Canada wanted policies to be harmonized at the 
federal level, whereas Quebec always wanted to integrate its own 
social policies. That is precisely why it agreed for the most 
part with the Canada social transfer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This right for a province to opt out with full compensation is 
absolutely fundamental. In Quebec, it has been defended equally 
strongly by Liberal and PQ premiers. It is the expression of 
Quebec's cultural desire to integrate its own policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned that Quebec made one concession. The right to opt 
out with full compensation as historically applied did not 
require any kind of commitment from Quebec to spend that money 
in a particular area. Therefore, to show that it was willing to 
compromise, Quebec agreed that this would apply only when the 
province offers a program or introduces an initiative in the 
same area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This proposal is extremely important because it is fundamental 
to the recognition of Quebec as a distinct society, not only in 
words but in practice. It is fundamental to the recognition of 
the right of Quebec to do as it pleases in areas of provincial 
jurisdiction under the Constitution. This is something Quebec 
cannot give up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I followed the work of intellectuals, because they are the ones 
who initially worked on the social union concept. 
I know that, in Canada, they wanted to adjust to our changing 
society. I also know some of them wanted to reach out to Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that when the premiers agreed on these proposals, they 
must have been very happy because they were looking for a way to 
reconcile Quebec's social objectives with those of the rest of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Bloc Quebecois and Quebeckers have always 
respected the other provinces' opinion that social and economic 
policies must be integrated by the central government. We have 
no choice but to recognize this right. But, in the same way, we 
have always wanted others to recognize Quebec's right to 
integrate its own social policies and to define its own 
priorities as it sees fit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As long as the federal government has this spending power, which 
means that it has the power to impose taxes, Quebec intends to 
get its full share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Social policy has been deeply affected by the cuts the 
Government of Quebec has been forced to make as a result of the 
federal government's cutbacks and its battle against the 
deficit.  Although there were still social democratic concerns, 
there was not enough money to meet all of the needs, and we had 
to make some painful and difficult choices.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As I, and others, have said, people have suffered, people 
needing health care, welfare and education.  How many young 
people have had to go further into debt, how many resources have 
had to be cut at all levels of education, up to and including 
post-secondary education?  Some universities have been left 
seriously short of funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that we have brought the deficit under control, which we 
always agreed was the prudent thing to do, and that the federal 
government, which already has a budget deficit of over $7 
billion for the first four months, is headed toward a sizeable 
surplus, it is urgent that this House recognize that this money 
must be put into the Canada social transfer. 
This House must also accept the right of the provinces to opt 
out, which is essential if this Constitution, which does not 
make much sense, is to have a least a modicum of meaning for 
Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member for 
Mercier for the history lesson she just gave us on what I would 
call the social evolution of Canada. She clearly described how 
the premiers came to the consensus they have reached, especially 
on the right to opt out with full compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the information she gave us about our history and our 
evolution shows why the federal government has to get on board, 
agree to this consensus and allow Quebec and every other 
province in Canada to make their own choices in order to meet 
their particular needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question I want to put to the hon. member is the following: 
Would this right to opt out with full compensation not provide 
the people with a better way to assess the efficiency of their 
governments? We have seen significant federal cuts in health 
care, especially in the last few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxpayers, at least in Quebec, do not ask themselves each and 
every day who is responsible for what. With this proposal to 
allow the provinces to opt out with full compensation, would the 
people not be in a better position to clearly assess, at the end 
of a mandate, if a government made the right choice and did a 
good job in this or that area? 
Could the hon. member for Mercier give us her views on this 
issue and tell us if she thinks this would help to improve the 
quality of democracy in Quebec and Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the question refers to the notion of integration I 
mentioned.  If policies could be integrated, they would be more 
effective.  The government that integrates is in fact in a 
better position to be accountable and to say why it used money 
and then it can be judged in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very bad thing when the public is unable to see how 
government decides.  Canadian federalism today certainly lacks 
clarity.  I was saying earlier that the government in Quebec cut 
deeply.  However, what the public does not know is that for 
every dollar cut, 75 cents went to the federal deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The deed was done to health, education and social assistance, 
but it went to reduce the Canadian deficit. 
So, it is vital to democracy that people know that government is 
accountable and that the details of management are revealed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to the opposition day 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been sitting in the House all day listening to the 
debate.  I have found it very interesting.  The subject matter we 
are covering is called the social union in Canada, the 
discussions between the provincial premiers and the federal 
government.  This is something of critical concern not just to 
the House but certainly to the people in every region of Canada. 
It would be very interesting to hear the kind of discussion that 
has taken place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to make a couple of observations to begin.  First, 
it is very clear from the motion before us and from the debate 
that has taken place that the premiers of Canada and the 
territories are involved in a debate on what they would like to 
see as a new social union or their relationship with the federal 
government as a direct result of the massive cutbacks in the 
Canada health and social transfer that have been experienced in 
Canada.  There is no getting away from that reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened very carefully to the debate by hon. government 
members who tried to persuade us or convince us that the social 
safety net in Canada is alive, well and healthy.  They tried to 
convince not just the House but the people of Canada that we are 
the envy of the world.  I have heard cabinet ministers say that 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is something different.  Being involved in the 
debate today I would like to draw the attention of members to the 
fact that Canada was a signatory to the UN international covenant 
on economic, social and cultural rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is very interesting about that covenant is that the UN 
committee assessing the record of member countries in carrying 
out the covenant has recently sent the Government of Canada a 
very tough list of 81 questions outlining its concern about where 
Canada is not meeting its obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote from some of the questions the UN 
committee has put to the Canadian government that have to be 
responded to by Canada.  For example it says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee has received information that food bank use has 
continued to increase in Canada and has approximately doubled 
over the last 10 years—Does the government consider the need 
for food banks in so affluent a country as Canada consistent with 
article 11 of the covenant? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all waiting to hear that answer.  It goes on to ask 
another question: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—Child poverty is at a 17-year high of 20.9%, meaning that 
nearly 1.5 million children live in poverty in Canada.  Although 
the last recession ended in 1991, poverty rates have risen since 
then. Please—explain how this unacceptable situation has been 
allowed to occur. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not me asking the question.  This question comes from 
the UN committee on economic, social and cultural rights and is 
to the Canadian government.  It asks another of its 81 questions 
of the Canadian government: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—At what point would the government consider homelessness in 
Canada to constitute a national emergency? 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the answer to that question.  I only have to look at my 
riding of Vancouver East to see that there are more than 6,000 
people living in slum housing. There are people living on the 
street.  We only have to look at the city of Toronto or the city 
of Winnipeg or any major urban area.  We only have to look at the 
status of aboriginal people in Canada to know about homelessness, 
the lack of shelter and the lack of food security.  It is a very 
desperate situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no getting away from the fact, no matter what 
government members try to convince us of, that this is a direct 
result of the abandonment of the Canada assistance program in 
1996 and the federal government running for cover under the 
Canada health and social transfer and slashing $6 billion from 
social programs in Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT85"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak about that a bit because it signalled the 
beginning of a new era.  Clearly the federal government was 
abandoning its national responsibilities, which has resulted in 
the proposals we hear from the premiers of Canada who are saying 
that the federal government is not relevant any more.  They feel 
the government has cut them back so much that they want to take 
what they can and set their own standards and programs.  They 
want the federal government to butt out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian people and members of the House, certainly those of 
the New Democratic Party, have a different view.  We believe it 
is very important there be an increasing and strong role for the 
federal government in terms of a social union, a social charter, 
and the establishment of national standards in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It simply is not good enough to say that there will be a 
transfer of funds to the provinces and there will be no 
conditions attached to it.  We only have to look at things like 
the child tax benefits or the state of post-secondary education 
to know that the Canada health and social transfer has been a 
dismal failure, not only in relation to the lack of funding and 
the retreat of public funding it has signalled in Canada but also 
because it has not been accompanied by the conditions, standards 
and guidelines we need to have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, when we look at social welfare programs, the much 
touted child tax benefit by Liberal members is something that is 
quite appalling when we consider that the poorest of the poor, 
the people on welfare, will not be able to benefit from the child 
tax benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is absolutely no assurance that provincial governments 
which save money as a result of this benefit from welfare 
payments will put that money back into welfare programs to 
actually help people on welfare.  There is no assurance that 
those moneys will not end up in workfare programs where people 
basically lose their entitlement to social assistance as a result 
of the demise of the Canada assistance program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the reality of what has come about with the 
advent of the Canada health and social transfer, is it any wonder 
that the provincial premiers are now convening their own meetings 
and trying to draw up their own framework of what they think 
their relationship with the federal government should be? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the federal NDP believe that the federal government not 
only has to be at the table but has to reinstate the funding that 
has been lost from our health care programs, our educational 
programs and our social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last budget we heard a lot of hype about the budget being 
an education budget that would help young people.  Again the 
reality has been something very different.  I only have to speak 
to young people in my own riding, students who are suffering from 
an enormous debt load, some of them $25,000, $30,000 and $40,000 
as a result of skyrocketing tuition fees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This begs the question:  Why have those tuition fees gone up so 
much?  It is because of the retreat in public funding by the 
federal government which has abandoned the area of education. 
Post-secondary institutions have been left with no recourse but 
to increase tuition fees so that now the tuition fees in Canada 
are higher on average than tuition fees at publicly funded 
universities in the United States, a situation that is very 
shocking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the millennium fund that was unilaterally announced by 
the federal government with no consultation with the provinces, 
no consultation with the stakeholders and no consultation with 
the experts in post-secondary education.  It is being touted as 
the future for students when in fact it is a foundation that is 
increasing the privatization and corporatization of the 
post-secondary education system.  The money that has been put 
into that fund does not even begin to make up for the funds that 
have been taken out by the federal government in its support for 
post-secondary education.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question there has been an abandonment of federal 
responsibility and a complete absence of national standards and 
national programs that historically have helped hold this country 
together.  This is something we should be aware of as we begin 
this debate of a new social union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to demand that the federal government take up its 
responsibility not just in terms of a fiscal framework but also 
its responsibility in setting, with the co-operation of the 
provinces, a sense of national purpose, a sense of national 
accessibility whether it is health care, social programs or 
post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other very disturbing aspect is the lack of accountability 
and public debate around the issue of a social union.  The 
provincial premiers have been meeting and may feel they are 
having productive discussions and have their own process of 
dealing with their own jurisdictions.  However on an issue as 
fundamental and critical as this one which really deals with the 
future vision of our country, it is critical that the federal 
government and this House ensure there is accountability for the 
way the process unfolds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just before the provincial premiers met in Saskatoon, the result 
of which is this motion before us today, some of the leading 
representatives from the social justice, civil society and labour 
movements wrote to the provincial premiers.  These included the 
Canadian Health Coalition, the National Anti-Poverty 
Organization, the Child Care Advocacy Association of Canada, the 
Canadian Labour Congress, the Canadian Centre for Policy 
Alternatives and the Canadian Federation of Students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did these groups have to say?  These organizations have 
been involved as watchdogs.  They have monitored the shocking and 
appalling situation that has unfolded as a result of the retreat 
of public funding under the Canada health and social transfer. To 
quote from their statement to that conference in Saskatoon, they 
said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such fundamental change to the way in which Canada's national 
social programs are managed is of great importance to the 
Canadian public, the labour movement and the vast array of social 
justice organizations dedicated to a vision of progressive social 
policy for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The social union has already undergone significant change.  The 
implementation of the Canada health and social transfer marked a 
massive restructuring of national programs for health, education 
and social assistance. The block funding approach and the 
elimination of national standards for social assistance put us on 
a path toward `no strings attached federalism' and further 
devolution of federal responsibility for national programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of the elimination of national standards for social 
assistance, abysmally inadequate rates of assistance have been 
cut in many provinces and workfare is flourishing, putting Canada 
in shameful violation of the United Nations Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights requiring that work be freely chosen, 
a fundamental tenet of democracy. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They went on to say in their statement: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of the public and organizations committed to the 
preservation and enhancement of national social programs, we are 
concerned that the Canadian public has had no opportunity to 
discuss and debate the vast changes to the social union which 
have already taken place nor is there any process in place 
through which the public can participate in these and future 
negotiations on the social union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the interest of democracy, closed door, backroom federalism 
must end. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a very significant statement which has come from these 
groups.  Not only have they been the watchdogs of the federal 
government in what has gone on, but they are now sounding the 
alarm in terms of this debate that is taking place.  They are 
making it quite clear that this type of critical debate about the 
relationship of the provinces to the federal government and how 
it encompasses our social values and our national programs must 
be a debate that includes organizations such as those which I 
mentioned and others, key stakeholders that do have a significant 
contribution to make.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, the motion before us today raises some very key 
points about what has gone fundamentally wrong and is clearly at 
the feet of the federal government as it brought in the Canada 
health and social transfer.  We have to be very careful.  We have 
to make sure that we do not embark on a new kind of proposal and 
a process that excludes the Canadian public and sets us on a 
course where we will no longer have a framework of national 
programs and national policies, whether it is education, social 
programs, welfare or health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a lot of concern over the fact that the premiers are 
suggesting that there would be a right to opt out of any program 
that was new or modified.  What does that mean exactly? What does 
a modified program mean?  Does it mean that if the federal 
government provides some modification to our medicare system the 
provinces can opt out in some way? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to insert into this debate the sense that there will be 
national standards that can provide a sense of universality, a 
sense of security and significantly provide a fiscal framework. 
When the committee at the UN on the covenant on social, economic 
and cultural rights writes to the Government of Canada and asks 
at what point will we be declaring homelessness a national 
emergency, we have to be able to demonstrate that we have 
national programs that will ensure we do not have those kinds of 
emergencies.  They should not exist in a country as wealthy as 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most harmful things that has taken place in Canada in 
the last few years has been the destruction and abandonment of 
our social housing programs by the federal government.  In my 
riding people are literally on the street.  People are living in 
slum housing as a result of the lack of federal funding for 
social housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just came back from a mission to Indonesia and Thailand with 
the Canadian Council for International Co-operation. We looked at 
the conditions in those countries as a result of the economic 
crisis there.  There is no question the impact has been 
devastating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was shocked by the reality that some of the conditions there 
are not dissimilar from what I have witnessed in my riding. 
People are at incredibly high risk as a result of the demise of 
the role of the federal government and the abandonment of the 
sense of a national focus in these programs. We are at a very 
critical point.  We have to hold this government accountable for 
the damage and havoc it has created for the people who could 
least afford it:  people who are unemployed, people who are 
homeless, people who are living in poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have the second highest poverty rate of any 
industrialized nation.  I heard the Minister of Justice say that 
Canada was the envy of the world.  We have five million people 
who live in poverty and 1.4 million children who live in poverty 
as a result of her government's policies. That is nothing to be 
proud of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to talk about social unionism, we should talk about 
social unionism in a way that respects social entitlements and 
human rights in this country so that no person goes hungry or 
homeless.  We should make job creation a priority.  We should not 
abandon the unemployed by cutting back on UI benefits.  That is 
what real social unionism would be if we were to take the time to 
sit down and bring about the new kind of co-operative federalism 
many of us would like to see.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
certainly agree with some of the things my colleague mentioned, 
in particular with the fact that the Liberal government is 
responsible for the chaos in the health sector coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to comment on what she said regarding national 
standards.  At first glance, national standards seem to make 
sense, but when you start thinking about it and look more 
closely, you realize that such a vast country, made up of 
provinces and of Quebec from coast to coast, and to another 
coast since there is the Arctic, cannot have a single standard. 
You cannot impose the same norm across the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are differences in needs between the Atlantic provinces, 
Quebec, Ontario and the West.  National standards might do more 
harm than good.  In fact, the proposal of the premiers assembled 
in Saskatoon provides that a province, Quebec or any other, can 
withdraw from a new federal program, if judged inappropriate to 
its particular environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be an excellent thing, because the government would 
transfer to the province enough fiscal points to generate the 
same amount of money the federal government was willing to 
offer.  That way, the province could set up a similar program, 
but better tailored to its own needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we had followed this kind of approach over the last decades, 
we would not have experienced the troubles we have. I would like 
to give an example, and I will ask my colleague for her comments 
on the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A case in point is the millennium scholarship fund; $2.5 billion 
of taxpayers' money will be entrusted to a private body headed 
by the president of Bell Canada. What for? To give scholarships 
to students. This seems great and it is for the rest of Canada, 
but not for Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For over 30 years we have had a scholarship system which has 
been running smoothly. Our situation is different. These 
millennium scholarships deal with a problem we do not have. 
Statistics prove it: Quebec students graduate from university 
with an average debt load of $11,000. In the rest of Canada, it 
is $25,000. Why? 
Quite simply because CEGEP is free; the last year in CEGEP is 
first year university in other provinces, a very expensive year 
since tuition fees are much higher than in Quebec. In some 
places they are more than double what they are at Laval or in 
Montreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is when you want to make a system universal, it is 
very difficult to meet everybody's needs. How is the member who 
raised these issues earlier reacting to this? Does she not 
understand the opting out clause is fundamental to meet 
everybody's needs? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Madam Speaker, it was a very long 
question and I know the debate is going to finish in two minutes, 
so I will try to give a very short answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the member for his thoughtful question.  He says that 
national standards sound good, but somehow they have not worked 
in the past.  I would not agree with that opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is because we have had national standards in the past 
that we have been able to produce very good national programs 
such as medicare, social programs that have helped bring Canada 
together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree that there is huge diversity in this country.  But it is 
precisely because of that that we need to have some sense of a 
base of what it is Canadians can expect as an entitlement to 
services and programs, whether they live in the west, the 
maritimes or Quebec.  That is precisely why we need to bring back 
those national standards.
