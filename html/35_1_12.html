effectiveness of programs of government.
<P>
	Currently the government gets one report a year because the 
law forbids the Auditor General from tabling more than one 
report. It is a huge brick and becomes a media event for about a

16,516 people calling for dramatic changes to the current Young 
Offenders Act.
<P>
	An 18-year-old resident, Roy Asselstine Jr., was the victim 
of gang violence by young offenders. When they appeared in 
court they showed no respect for the judge or any remorse for 
what they had done to this innocent young chap.
<P>
	This petition calls on Parliament to revise the Young 
Offenders Act by lowering the age limit to allow prosecution to 
fit the seriousness of the crime. I am proud to add my name to it.
<P>
	The petitioners did this under duress. They should be 
congratulated because there are several young gangs in the city 
of Chatham and they were threatened. Almost single-handedly 
they collected over 16,000 names on the petition. I am hoping 
members will call our office and I will send the petition to them 
if they care to circulate it in their ridings.

	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House take note of ideas and suggestions expressed in the House, at 
pre-Budget regional conferences and elsewhere with regard to the forthcoming 
Budget, especially with respect to increased economic growth, the creation of 
jobs and the reduction of the deficit.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, the purpose of today's debate is to give 
members of this House the opportunity to express their opinion 
on the Budget.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This is an historic day. This debate is the first of its kind. In 
the past members of Parliament were not part of the budget 
making process. Budgets were tabled here. They were debated 
upon here and they were voted upon here, but there was little 
opportunity for members of Parliament to influence the content 
of those budgets. On all sides of the House the focus was on 
scoring points for the party, not for the country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="679"> 679 </A></B>
<P>
	We believe that process was deeply flawed. Wisdom-and 
I know this will come as a great surprise to the House-is not 
confined to finance ministers. The issue before us is clear. How 
can we expect Canadians to understand or to accept hard 
choices if they are not part of the process of choice?
<P>
	How can we in the House as parliamentarians expect 
Canadians to trust us if we do not trust ourselves? The people of 
Canada deserve to be brought into the budget making process 
and the Parliament of Canada must begin to play a larger role.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Unfortunately, there was not enough time to have the House 
Standing Committee on Finance take part in this year's budget 
preparation. Things will be different next year when House 
committees will have a central role and very real influence.
<P>
	Today's debate, the first of its kind in Canadian history, is 
proof of the government's intentions. It follows a process 
started in last November, at the University of Montreal. Since 
then, we have held a public meeting with 38 of Canada's most 
distinguished economists. Critics for the Bloc and the Reform 
Party were present, I may add.
<P>
	We have published several new documents informing 
Canadians on this country's economic state. Four independent 
research institutes organized conferences in Halifax, Montreal, 
Toronto and Calgary where representatives from all sectors of 
society studied the issues to which we, as members of this 
House, will be confronted in this year's and next year's budgets. 
The public process will be broadened for the 1995 budget 
preparation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There are several conclusions that we can draw on from the 
consultation process this country has begun. First, one has to 
have been heartened by the degree to which Canadians were 
willing to put self-interest aside and discuss issues together to 
look for practical, real solutions to the challenges we face.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	Second, it is clear that the priorities of Canadians are jobs and 
economic growth, that they want the deficit brought down but 
not as an end in itself. They believe that as long as deficits are 
too high unemployment will remain too high.
<P>
	Third, there is a profound sense that the status quo simply will 
not do and that if we continue on our current path then that 
would be a road to nowhere.
<P>
	Fourth, there is a desire on the part of Canadians for a budget 
that embodies a game plan, a strategic outlook in which the 
various budgetary measures that are to be taken can be judged as 
to their effectiveness.
<P>
	Fifth, there is a clear sense that the choice we face as a country 
is not between jobs or the deficit but that there is an urgent need 
to focus on both. There is a belief that we will never solve the 
deficit until we develop sustained and strong growth. At the 
same time Canadians understand that the growing debt itself is 
an impediment to that growth. To attack the deficit without 
encouraging growth would be foolish. To attempt to spur growth 
and jobs as if the debt and deficit did not matter would simply be 
futile.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, the stakes are much higher than mere details of 
the budget. We aim not only to trim government but to rethink its 
entire role. Today, we have a golden opportunity to change our 
way of doing things, not for financial reasons but for reasons of 
common sense.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As a government we have already begun a variety of processes 
designed to bring deep and dramatic reform to government, to 
the way we operate, and to our policies and programs in a wide 
range of areas. The actions that were taken by the whip in terms 
of cutting down the costs of this place are a beginning and 
simply a kernel in the approach we want to take to the frugality 
of the way in which we generate taxpayers' money.
<P>
	Yesterday in the House the minister of human resources laid 
before the people of Canada the beginnings of deep-seated 
reform in areas within his jurisdiction. If today was an historic 
day then surely yesterday was one as well. I congratulate my 
colleague because he really does bespeak for modern liberalism.
<P>
	There will be more initiatives in the weeks and months ahead. 
That is why we have made it clear from the very beginning that 
the 1994 budget should be seen as a first step, the first stage in a 
two-stage process culminating in the 1995 budget.
<P>
	Unfortunately the deficit outlook for 1993-94 remains as was 
set out in my November speech, that is to say in the $44 billion 
to $46 billion range. A view exists in some quarters that the 
deficit for the following year, that is the year for which we are 
budgeting, 1994-95, could fall below $40 billion by itself 
without any direct fiscal action. That view unfortunately is not 
valid.
<P>
	It is true that part of the increase in the deficit for this year is 
due to one-time influences.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="680"> 680 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	However, according to a number of factors, it is also clear that 
the reduction of the deficit will evidently be limited in 1994-95 
if no direct fiscal measures are taken.
<P>
	First, in 1994, the growth of the economy will probably come 
in large part from better corporate profits. There is little chance 
however of this growth translating into an equivalent growth of 
federal revenues.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	The low earnings registered by corporations during the last 
few years have allowed them to accumulate considerable losses 
which they will be able to apply to their income tax payable this 
year.
<P>
	Secondly, the erosion of some tax bases is continuing, 
especially in the area of tobacco for example.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Third, the growth in personal income taxes for this year is 
likely to be weak. This is due to the unacceptably high level of 
unemployment and slow income growth.
<P>
	Fourth, the effect of disinflation on the government's 
revenues is substantial.
<P>
	Fifth, many of the savings assumed in the 1993 April budget 
were never secured through legislation.
<P>
	Finally many cost pressures must be faced, such as the 
support for the east coast fisheries, that were never provided for 
in the last Conservative budget. This is very important because 
the fisheries is only one example. Not only were the revenue 
projections in that April budget wrong, but the expenditure 
projections which any government must have a handle on were 
unrealistic as well.
<P>
	For members on this side of the House-and I know members 
on the other side of the House feel the same way because I heard 
the leader of the Reform Party and the leader of the Bloc 
Quebecois talk about it-it is crucial if as parliamentarians we 
are to regain the confidence of the Canadian people that, 
whether we are in government or in opposition, we not be afraid 
to lay in front of the Canadian people the facts and be judged by 
them. The days of phoney accounting, of illusion, must be over. 
I know it is something all members on this side of the House 
support.
<P>
	I will be clear. Without further action the deficit for 1994-95 
will be significantly above $40 billion. To get the deficit on 
track so that it will drop to a level of 3 per cent of GDP by 
1996-97 immediate action is necessary. That action must not 
consist of overly optimistic growth projections or accounting 
sleight of hand as was done too many times in the past.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	For the purposes of forecasting, we will follow the advice of 
our main economic experts. We will be conservative in our 
estimates and will not indulge in wishful thinking.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We have clear priorities: to create jobs, to increase economic 
growth, and to help those who are truly in need. The debt and 
deficit problems of our country present severe difficulties and 
severe obstacles in the way of meeting these priorities. They 
keep interest rates too high. They drain off our country's income 
to foreigners and they force us to keep our tax rates up.
<P>
	The question is: How do we get the deficit down? Let me 
frame the challenge. There are those who blame the public 
service. They are wrong. We could let every public servant go. 
We could discharge every soldier. We could board up every 
government building. We could shut the whole show down and 
we would still have a deficit.
<P>
	There are those who blame the poor. They are wrong. We 
could abandon all the major programs we have in place to help 
the elderly, to help those who are unemployed, to help those who 
are in need, and the deficit would still be with us.
<P>
	I would hope no one in the House today would argue that the 
deficit should be brought down on the backs of those who are 
most in need. If they did I would simply point out, as my 
colleague the Minister of Human Resources Development 
pointed out yesterday, that not only is slash and burn morally 
wrong economically it will not work.
<P>
<B>(1030 ) </B>
<P>
	What this country needs is something that it has been deprived 
of for too long. We need a long term solid growth strategy to 
bring the deficit down, to put Canadians back to work, to 
restructure our industrial base so that we can face the 
competition that lies outside our borders. What we need is a 
growth strategy that is creative, compassionate and 
constructive. As a government that is what we intend to put in 
place.
<P>
	The budget this year will have real cuts but it will also set in 
train important processes to reform the most fundamental 
programs of the federal government. That takes time and 
requires consultation but make no mistake, that reform will take 
place.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I am sure all members of this House agree with our objectives 
of economic growth, job creation, compassion and deficit 
reduction. What we need today is an in-depth debate to help us 
determine the manner in which, together, we can attain these 
goals.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="681"> 681 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In the debate today the easiest priority for any one of us on 
either side of the House to put forward is one's own. The most 
obvious area in which to ask for more spending is one's own. 
The most obvious area to ask for cuts is in somebody else's 
backyard.
<P>
	This debate is about a national budget, not a personal budget. 
It is about tradeoffs and the balance that we need as a nation. If 
today there are ideas for more spending then we need to hear 
today where that money is going to come from. If there are 
proposals for cuts then we need to know the effect of those on 
jobs and on Canadians most in need.
<P>
	If there are those who argue against changes in taxation then 
we need to know from them if they feel that the existing list of 
tax exemptions is fair. We have asked Canadians across the land 
to consider the tradeoffs. It is now up to this House to do that 
very thing as well.
<P>
	This country needs a budget that speaks to the needs of all 
Canadians. This government intends to provide that and I know 
that the debate we are about to have in this House will contribute 
a great deal to that effort.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Under our rules there are no questions 
or comments after the Minister of Finance's speech.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, here we are in the last phase just before the tabling of 
the federal budget for the 1994-95 fiscal year which, as 
everyone knows, begins on April 1.
<P>
	Few budgets have been as eagerly awaited as this one. The 
new government has had a chance to distinguish itself from the 
government that the voters judged so harshly in the last 
elections. It is the new government's responsibility to tackle 
with conviction and fairness the complex problems facing 
Canada that can be seen in our poor economic situation and the 
crisis situation in government finances.
<P>
	The number of real jobs that have been created is still 
negligible. There are not even enough new jobs to absorb the 
newcomers onto the job market, and 40 per cent of the jobs lost 
through the recession have not been made up. The Canadian 
economy is still performing well below its potential.
<P>
	The indications of the crisis in government funds are now so 
well known there is no point in dwelling on them further. Suffice 
it to say that the federal debt has reached a critical point. The 
federal government has been borrowing money for a long time 
to pay its grocery bills, and then to pay the interest on those 
loans.
<P>
	From 1985 to 1993, when the ratio of the debt to GDP in 
Canada increased by 82 per cent, that ratio increased by only 21 
per cent on average in OECD countries. The net federal debt is 
increasing so quickly that it has now surpassed 70 per cent of 
GDP, up from 46.4 per cent in 1985.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	What is more, every year one third of federal revenue goes to 
paying the interest on the debt. The situation would be less 
critical if the government was going into debt in order to invest 
in capital projects. According to the 1993-94 Main Estimates, 
the government's capital expenditures represent only 4.16 per 
cent of total gross program expenditures.
<P>
	In addition, 53 per cent of that amount goes to the Department 
of National Defence alone. A burden of this size weighs heavily 
on the strength of the economic recovery, primarily by exerting 
undue influence on medium- and long-term interest rates. We 
must quickly reduce this burden by a considerable amount, and 
at the same time we must be careful not to shatter this fragile 
recovery. 
<P>
	According to the Prime Minister, the size of the federal debt is 
not so spectacular when compared with the debts in European 
countries. Perhaps he should take a second look, and not 
compare apples with oranges. Canada's total public debt is the 
highest debt of all G-7 countries, after Italy's. And the federal 
debt is the largest part of Canada's total debt.
<P>
	Therefore, the government cannot choose to solve only one of 
these two problems, either the debt or the sluggish recovery, and 
leave the other issue unresolved. The two issues have to be 
tackled at the same time, or any success that comes about will be 
only short-lived.
<P>
	Since last October 25, speculation has been rife about the 
government's plans for public finances, that they will reduce 
spending, or go even more deeply into taxpayers' pockets. 
Nothing has yet been decided and uncertainty prevails.
<P>
	Although the throne speech gave nothing away in this regard, 
it does appear that reducing the deficit through taxation is at the 
very top of the government's list of priorities. Job creation 
seems to have been relegated to second place, along with the 
elimination of useless expenditures, the ones that inspired the 
Liberal leader to such impassioned and repetitive speeches 
during the election campaign.
<P>
	Yes, there is still the infrastructure works program, the one 
that is clearly inadequate. Let's look more closely at this 
program. The federal government's contribution will amount to 
$2 billion over two years.
<P>
	The increase in unemployment insurance premiums that came 
into effect at the beginning of 1994 raised an additional amount 
of $800 million per year. Anyone can rob Peter to pay Paul. It is 
not necessary to have a government that says it has experience to 
do it.
<P>
	All analysts are unanimous in making objections to increasing 
taxes on the payroll. This is just what the government has 
decided to do with unemployment insurance. One can ask 
whether the government really wants to see this recovery that 
everyone is waiting for. Everything points to the fact that, apart 
from its program  to repair municipal infrastructures, this 
government has decided to do nothing but gaze in open-eyed 
wonder at its little red book. The government is making a 
religion out of its electoral creed, to which it believes it owes its 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="682"> 682 </A></B>
<P>
election. Propaganda has never been so effective, since even the 
government, the author of the red book, believes in it.
<P>
	Recycled as the throne speech, the red book is still providing 
fodder for the Prime Minister's speeches, and the Minister of 
Finance is still taking delight in it. Again yesterday, I saw a 
government minister religiously brandishing the booklet in this 
very House. The worst is yet to come, since in a few weeks we 
are very likely to see it reappear sumptuously adorned as a 
budget speech. In other words, the government's job creation 
program is the same as the one we saw from the Liberal Party 
during the election campaign: nothing but words and the 
incantation: jobs, jobs, jobs. And as for the rest, they are 
counting on a hypothetical recovery that is likely to happen of 
its own accord. This is an irresponsible gamble on a better 
future, as well as being an ominous memory lapse about the 
causes of the deficit.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is not necessary to remind hon. members that boosting the 
economy means less unemployment, less welfare and higher tax 
revenues. Thus it contributes in two ways to lowering the burden 
related to the public deficit.
<P>
	For example, if we had the same number of jobs we had before 
the last recession, the expected deficit for 1993-94 would be 
well below the figure announced by the Minister of Finance, 
which is artificially inflated for obvious reasons. That target is 
quite modest.
<P>
	With normal expansion in the number of jobs over the past 
three years, we could have avoided the sudden deterioration in 
the budgetary situation of the federal government and the 
provinces.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	When the recession began, the federal deficit was $29 billion; 
today the Minister of Finance puts it at $45 billion. The main 
cause of the increase is an unexpected drop in revenue.
<P>
	During the first seven months of the current fiscal year, 
revenues were down 5.7 per cent from the same period the 
previous year. This drop is disturbing, because it occurred 
despite a slight improvement in the economy.
<P>
	The deficit now represents 6.2 per cent of GDP, a proportion 
twice that of the American debt, which is 3 per cent of GDP 
according to the OECD. A 1993 study by the IMF says that even 
if the economy were performing at full capacity, Canada's 
governments would have a deficit on the order of 3.5 per cent of 
GDP, with forecasts of 2 per cent for 1998. So there is also a very 
serious structural problem here.
<P>
	Three years after the recession technically ended, the deficit 
has reached, according to our calculations, about $41 
billion-that is, if one eschews accounting fictions (which are 
so dear to the Minister) and includes the impact of lower interest 
rates on debt-servicing charges. The Minister of Finance has not 
done either of these things, despite his commitment to greater 
transparency in setting out budgetary parameters. He obviously 
finds it more appealing to announce a reduction of the deficit 
from $45 billion to-say-$37 billion rather than a much less 
dramatic reduction from $41 billion to $37 billion. It is a 
numbers game.
<P>
	I want to ask the Minister today if he stands by the projected 
deficit for the current fiscal year that he announced at the end of 
last November.
<P>
	Debt servicing constitutes the largest budget item: $39.5 
billion in 1992-93. Given the wide gap between short-term and 
long-term interest rates-almost 3.5 percentage points-is 
there a strategy at work? One may well wonder. Does the 
Department of Finance have a strategy for taking advantage of 
falling short-term interest rates by continually shortening the 
average term of government securities? Since at the present time 
there are no inflationary pressures in Canada or the United 
States, where the most recent data demonstrates a further drop in 
inflation rates, the question is worth asking.
<P>
	Last year in Canada the domestic inflation rate-which does 
not include imported products-was not even 1 per cent. Under 
the circumstances, is it reasonable to continue, for example, 
paying 7.1 per cent on 30-year borrowings? When you have a 
debt of $507 billion, the difference between a borrowing cost of 
5 per cost and a borrowing cost of 6 per cent represents more 
than $5 billion. How many home owners are there in Canada just 
now who would opt for a 10-year mortgage at 8.5 per cent? Very 
few.
<P>
	Fiscal equity demands that certain tax shelters be closed, but 
the Minister of Finance is now trying to give this idea a broader 
meaning, so that it can include the notion of expanding the tax 
base. But eliminating this or that deduction used by a significant 
proportion of the population means by definition increasing the 
tax burden on those taxpayers, who belong very largely to the 
middle class. In other words, it amounts to increasing their 
taxes. The Minister of Finance talks about transparency, but he 
does not want to call a spade a spade. He would be happier if 
nobody noticed his little manoeuvre and he could pull a fast one 
on us, as they say.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="683"> 683 </A></B>
<P>
	The Minister should be warned against two temptations: that 
of retroactive measures and that of unequal treatment of 
taxpayers according to their conditions of employment.
<P>
	The very notion of a retroactive measure strikes at the heart of 
a society governed by the rule of law, and we are such a society. 
Citizens are rightly outraged by the arbitrariness of power when 
the government changes the rules in mid-game to suit itself. 
Outrage was certainly the reaction in Quebec when the 
government brought in a retroactive surtax in its last budget.
<P>
	As far as RRSPs are concerned, and they are very much at 
issue just now, workers who do not have the advantage of 
benefitting from a pension fund must be treated on the same 
footing as those who do.
<P>
	It is really rather odd that the government is contemplating 
additional taxes affecting large numbers of people while at the 
same time complaining about the growing scale of the 
underground economy, which is causing tax losses for it. And at 
a time when the Canadian and Quebec governments finally seem 
to have seen sense as far as tobacco taxes are concerned, we 
must hope, as I said two weeks ago in this House, to see a rapid 
and energetic decision. Let us face facts: our governments have 
let the situation fester.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	Deciding to lower tobacco taxes will not prevent governments 
in the slightest from continuing and even stepping up their fight 
against tobacco use. In the medium term, tobacco consumption 
depends on more than price. The proof is there: American taxes 
on tobacco are much lower than ours and yet Americans smoke 
less than Canadians. Moreover, when they buy smuggled 
cigarettes smokers cease to contribute to paying for the 
health-care costs than tobacco taxes help to underwrite.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There is a simple way to achieve greater fiscal equity. It 
consists of putting into effect the recommendations contained in 
the latest report of the Auditor General. We have to attack the 
level of expenditures and we have to do it with determination.
<P>
	First of all, we have to deal with the most widespread problem 
causing the greatest unfairness, the problem of fiscal 
expenditure.
<P>
	In 1987, as the economist Léo-Paul Lauzon reminds us, 
90,000 companies made profits without paying a cent in taxes. 
According to the Auditor General, Canadian companies 
invested $90 billion abroad of which $16.1 billion went to tax 
havens. In such cases the revenues are only taxed abroad at the 
accommodating rates prevailing in those countries. The 
amounts mentioned only reflect the investments which are 
declared because many of those companies are not obliged to 
produce information statements. In this way, each year hundreds 
of millions of dollars escape taxes.
<P>
	It is obviously quite essential that all corporations must be 
subject to a minimum level of taxation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	But, in the field of tax inequity, I repeat, the prize goes to 
family trusts. Analyst Claude Picher of <I>La Presse</I> writes about 
them in a recent article describing the formula, which-and I 
quote-``allows taxpayers to set up a trust and include in it 
securities whose yield is tax-exempt as long as it remains in the 
trust, which, under present provisions, can be practically 
indefinitely''. As we know, this system was set up by the 
Liberals, and prolonged by the Conservatives. They have been 
passing the buck, from one government to the next. I continue 
the quotation: ``The trust must be set up according to a complex 
and costly procedure, which makes such trusts much less 
affordable, unless you happen to have a fortune''. A trust, then, 
of course, intended for rich families. I have inserted a few 
personal comments into the quotation. I feel that people will be 
able to distinguish between the cold comments by analyst Picher 
and the ones I have added.
<P>
	In an article in the January 29, 1994 issue of <I>La Presse</I>, the 
same economist considers, and I quote: ``that it is credible that 
the tax provisions for family trusts represent a shortfall of $340 
million annually''. And these are conservative figures, since it 
is the government's responsibility to unveil the true dimensions 
of this flagrant injustice and eliminate this unseemly shelter 
once and for all. The Minister, who has access to information 
about this issue, knows this: he knows the exact extent of this 
scandal. As a result, he is under considerable pressure: his 
knowledge of this issue is certainly strengthening his desire to 
right a wrong and put back into the public coffers hundreds of 
millions of dollars each year that would provide relief for the 
taxes he is preparing to impose on the middle class.
<P>
	We must also expect substantial reductions in federal 
expenditures, traditional expenditures. But-not so fast!-not 
by charging ahead and arbitrarily slashing 5% across the board. 
Because of its role as initiator of the budget crisis, the federal 
government must first set an example; it must clean up its own 
act. Since this government was elected, the federal government 
has been preparing to take shots at easy targets: social programs, 
people who have no lobby, no union, no representation, no party, 
no voice. They are easy targets; they are the ones at whom the 
government has been taking shots since yesterday. And, a year 
from now, we shall see the results. It is also easy to target 
transfers to the provinces; from the federal point of view, the 
provinces are like chicks surrounding a mother hen. But there is 
no announcement about its own waste or its own ponderous 
bureaucracy.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="684"> 684 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	We have not heard any speeches about that. We have not heard 
one Minister admit guilt or declare an intention to cut the 
bureaucratic machinery down to size. Nothing. Once again, we 
are bracing for the culpable connivance that made the federal 
government one of the causes of our present deficit.
<P>
	The evidence is accumulating. Yesterday, it was the Minister 
of Human Resources Development putting forward his fantasy 
plan for improving the quality and range of health and social 
services by cutting related expenditures. A vicious circle. We 
shall see how he manages.
<P>
	Where transfers to the provinces are concerned, aside from 
the equalization payments, the federal government's decision 
will be made public in three weeks, as part of the budget. But 
where federal government expenditures are concerned, nothing. 
No announced speech, only vague phrases for media 
consumption. And any reference to federal timetables is cloaked 
in confusion.
<P>
	For example, the Minister of Finance repeated several times 
that his first budget, the actual budget, the one that is coming up, 
apparently would not be the real thing. What is this upcoming 
budget going to be? The budget of another country? The budget 
of another organization? No, apparently it is not going to be the 
real budget. The 1995-96 budget, next year's budget, is going to 
be the real thing; that is where a reform of social programs could 
be included. That is where we could see how these programs 
would be delivered by the two levels of government.
<P>
	We cannot see any need for such lengthy delays in a field like 
labour and occupational issues, occupational training. These 
issues have been dragging on for years, and what Quebec is 
asking for is both known and endorsed by all players from all 
sectors in society in Quebec.
<P>
	But, according to the Minister for Human Resources 
Development and his colleague responsible for 
federal-provincial relations, we must wait not one year, but two, 
to ascertain what the federal government will deign to bestow. 
At least that is what he was saying until yesterday morning; then 
he presented us with a timetable covering approximately 12 
months. Perhaps he realized the confusion his former statement 
had created.
<P>
	Does this mean that the Minister of Finance is locked into an 
unrealistic timetable? Or does it mean that the right hand does 
not know what the left hand is doing? Or, instead, a rather 
clumsy plan to postpone any meaningful streamlining of the 
federal bureaucracy, and not give English-speaking Canada the 
unpleasant impression that the Quebec sovereigntists were right 
to point to fat in the federal bureaucracy?
<P>
	Any old excuse seems valid to put off the time when they will 
have to look in the mirror.
<P>
	But we all know that there is fat in the vast federal body. 
Exactly how much? That is a carefully guarded secret that we 
cannot rely on people inside to reveal. There must be a careful, 
detailed examination of all internal expenditures by the various 
departments. An in-house operation would not be credible. We 
have only to watch what the Auditor General says about, for 
example, one very specific expenditure to see the gaps between 
the federal bureaucracy's perceptions and outside analyses.
<P>
	I quote a passage from page 25 of the 1993 Main Points; the 
Auditor General writes: ``For 1990-91, we estimate that the 
total cost of operating the Administrative Flight Service-that 
is, the VIP Fleet-was about $54 million.'' Fifty-four million 
dollars. In Part III of its Estimates, the Department disclosed 
total costs of approximately $27.5 million. Outside estimate: 
$54 million; in-house estimate: $27.5 million. One single item, 
twice as expensive.
<P>
	We therefore repeat our demand that a multi-party 
parliamentary committee of the House of Commons be created, 
whose mandate would be to go through all the government's 
operating budgets. If the government party is serious in wanting 
to reduce the deficit in a way that is meaningful but fair, it must 
immediately attack pointless government expenditures and the 
many overlapping areas of responsibility that result from 
systematic intrusion by the federal government into areas of 
provincial jurisdiction. The Official Opposition is prepared to 
co-operate in this job of cleaning up federal finances.
<P>
	In the field of labour, the Government of Quebec estimates at 
$250 million the annual waste inherent in overlapping areas of 
federal and Quebec responsibilities in Quebec. Against all 
common sense, the government is resigning itself to letting this 
overlap last at least another two years, thus entailing an 
additional loss of $500 million. Can we still afford such inertia?
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	The federal government's attitude in this matter looks a lot 
like the attitude the Soviets had during the Cold War in their 
negotiations with the Americans. What we have we keep; what 
you have is negotiable.
<P>
	The Prime Minister made us smile the other day when he said 
that Quebec would lose out if the federal government withdrew 
from this sector. Since Quebec receives as a whole from the 
federal government barely the equivalent of what it contributes 
to it, every time the government withdraws from a sector, there 
must be, in all logic and in all fairness, a compensation or even a 
transfer of tax points equivalent to the federal expenses in 
question.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="685"> 685 </A></B>
<P>
	If this were not the case, it would just be another way for 
the federal government to unload a part of its deficit on the 
provinces. And one wonders if this reaction on the part of the 
Prime Minister does not in fact foreshadow unilateral 
withdrawals by the federal government from certain sectors that 
it now considers less important, leaving it up to the provinces 
to pick up the pieces and make up for the loss.
<P>
	It would be as if the provinces were to tell their hospitals: 
``We are withdrawing from the health sector. You will just have 
to find the money elsewhere''. It would be an outrageous move 
on the part of the federal government, but quite in keeping with 
the system. In this system, there is a senior government and all 
the others have to adapt to its moods and priorities. In the last 
budget speech, for example, Ottawa unilaterally ended its 
financial contribution to the development of new social housing.
<P>
	Therefore the impact the next budget will have on provincial 
finances is not necessarily limited to the issue of transfer 
payments. There are three major federal transfer payment 
programs: Established Programs Financing, equalization and 
the Canada Assistance Plan. The three programs do not 
necessarily evolve in the same way.
<P>
	Moreover, the federal government includes in these transfers 
not only payments in cash, but also the proceeds of the tax points 
transferred to the provinces through agreements on shared-cost 
programs. It is a way for the federal government to look better. 
But it has no direct control on what these taxes yield and it 
cannot take back unilaterally the tax points. It only controls the 
cash transfers, whose evolution constitutes the real test of 
federal equity in this matter.
<P>
	In the case of Quebec, this test is blindingly clear. In the past 
decade, the federal government's program expenses increased 
by 53 per cent while the transfers to Quebec went from 6,250 to 
7,624 million dollars, which represents an increase of 22 per 
cent, the lowest of all the provinces. But one must go beyond 
these absolute, raw figures to see what all this represents in 
constant dollars and per capita. When inflation and population 
growth in Quebec are factored in, you get a greater than 20 per 
cent decrease for the decade 1983-1993. Such is the true picture 
of federal transfers to Quebec, a greater than 20 per cent 
decrease in the past decade.
<P>
	A portion of these transfers goes to health care, a sector where 
needs are closely linked with age. Because of the 
rapidly-growing population of seniors, the needs increase 
automatically year after year and the provincial finances must 
cover them entirely. And there are people who claim in all 
earnestness that certain provinces, including Quebec, have not 
sufficiently contributed to solving the federal government's 
fiscal problems. In fact, Quebec has already contributed more 
than its share.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Therefore Quebec has already paid a heavy price on the 
expenditure slashing fronts. It is time now for the feds to leave 
most of the provinces alone and to start taking the medicare they 
have been prescribing to some of the provinces, particularly 
Quebec.
<P>
	At the bare minimum transfer payments to the provinces 
should hold steady in constant dollars on a per capita basis. 
Provinces that have been singled out in recent years should 
regain a little of what they have lost.
<P>
	For some time now the Minister of Finance has been hinting 
that it will be necessary to cast the fiscal net in a wider fashion. 
If the minister wants to close tax shelters that benefit the happy 
few, so much the better. However if he is looking for some 
convenient way of raising new taxes on the middle class he 
should not count on our co-operation. Taxes are already high 
enough.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development has been 
hinting at the necessity of curtailing the safety net, as if those 
who need it were to blame for the economic mess we are in.
<P>
<B>(1100 ) </B>
<P>
	If they are looking for wasteful spending they should be 
looking at home. There is still a lot of fat in the federal 
government, not only at the higher levels with all those useless 
trips, those public relations contracts and so forth, but also in the 
inner workings of all the departments, especially those that 
duplicate what other ones are already doing either in Ottawa or 
in the provincial capitals.
<P>
	Oh yes, the federal government agrees on paper that these 
parallel bureaucracies should be streamlined. But where is the 
agenda, the strategic plan, the incontrovertible proof that 
something is going to happen soon that will put the federal 
government on the same diet as the ordinary citizen or business 
person? Now is the time to act. But it seems that anything is a 
pretext for procrastinating.
<P>
	As a matter of fact, overlapping between federal and 
provincial departments is embedded in the system to an 
astonishing degree. The Bélanger-Campeau commission in 
Quebec has arrived at the conclusion that the overlapping costs 
Quebecers a couple of billion dollars a year-only Quebecers. 
How about the rest of Canada? This being the case it is very 
difficult to believe that one could not trim a couple of billion 
dollars rather rapidly off the imposing coast to coast federal 
machinery of government. The same could be said of definitive 
efforts.
<P>
	Although the economic upturn is quite tepid it should still be a 
couple of billion dollars in additional federal revenues. Retail 
sales are on the move and the housing sector should do better 
this year than last year.
<P>
	If the federal deficit is really heading south it will bode well 
for interest rates. We must not forget that a single percentage 
point drop in interest rates, and long term rates are still too high, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="686"> 686 </A></B>
<P>
means $8 billion more annually in  the pockets and in the cash 
register of the country. This will have a substantially more 
significant impact than the government's infrastructure 
program.
<P>
	However one cannot rely exclusively on the consumer. One 
must address the structural crisis in the economy. If we want to 
stiffen the backbone of our industrial firms we must invest more 
in research and development. We must also help the conversion 
of the defence industry to civilian uses.
<P>
	In short, the next federal budget should provide sensible 
answers to real questions and not repeat the mistakes of past 
projects.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In closing, we are well aware of the difficulty of the task 
assigned to the Minister of Finance. His budget must attack on 
several fronts: it must provide incentives to create jobs, reduce 
public expenditures, bring about tax equity, and eliminate 
overlap. Many battles loom, and we recognize that not one of 
them is easy. But there must be action on all these fronts 
simultaneously, and such action must be properly balanced. 
That is the only way of giving people hope again and giving rise 
to a spirit of solidarity; only these things can make recovery 
possible.
<P>
	Aside from these thoughts that we submit for the 
consideration of the Minister, kindly allow me to express one 
pressing concern: concern about the plan to reform the present 
system of social programs. I come back to this point again today 
in order to call for vigilance over the reductions this exercise 
will not fail to have on the social programs we have acquired 
since 1928.
<P>
	The government says it has no intention of tearing the social 
safety net. But in order to reassure its objective ally, the Reform 
Party, on this issue, it has not neglected to state that one of the 
purposes of this operation is to reduce the costs of social 
services. How can we believe that a reduction in resources 
allocated to this sector will not automatically bring about a 
reduction in services? Whatever the case, if the Minister of 
Finance wants to give as many reassurances as possible about 
the government's real intentions, he must at least give a clear 
signal in his budget. Not another flight of oratory, not another 
promise, cross his heart and hope to die! No, Mr. Speaker. He 
must maintain at its present level in constant dollars, and taking 
changing needs into account, the federal government's 
contributions to funding provincial health and social programs, 
by means of transfer payments to the provinces.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	I have a great mistrust of cosmetic expressions that claim to 
maintain. Sure, the level of transfers to the provinces will be 
maintained. I can already hear a budget speech: ``Mr. Speaker, I 
announce to the nation that we shall maintain the level of 
transfers to the provinces,'' when what is meant is really a 
freeze. That would be hypocrisy. That is why it must be clear, 
that is why the signal to come from the Minister of Finance-if 
he is serious when he suggests that he may maintain transfers to 
the provinces-must be very  clear that the transfers to the 
provinces are being maintained at their present level in constant 
dollars, and taking rising needs into account. That is what we 
mean by a clear signal from the Minister.
<P>
	We want the government to know, right now, that no one will 
fall for magic tricks that would consist in reducing its 
contributions and, like Pontius Pilate, forcing the provinces to 
do its dirty work.
<P>
	We shall blame the federal government just as much for 
hitting the disadvantaged indirectly, using the provinces as 
intermediaries, as if it did the job directly.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> According to our rules, there are no questions 
or comments after these remarks.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I will recognize the leader of the Reform Party, but 
beforehand the member for Calgary North has a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to advise that 
following the debate on this motion by the leader of the Reform 
Party, the hon. member for Calgary Southwest, speakers for the 
Reform Party will be dividing their speaking time into 10 
minutes for speaking and five minutes for questions and 
comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
first of all wish to thank the Prime Minister and the finance 
minister for providing this opportunity for the pre-budget 
debate in the House.
<P>
	Second, I want to underscore the importance of this first 
budget of the new administration to the overall economic, social 
and political well-being of the country. As all hon. members 
know, the federal debt is in excess of $500 billion. The projected 
deficit for 1994-95 is in the vicinity of $44 billion to $46 
billion.
<P>
	The single most important thing that this government can do 
in its first term of office is to bring federal spending under 
control. Of course the primary instrument for doing that is going 
to be the budget which the minister brings to this House in a 
couple of weeks.
<P>
	Reformers have a number of specific suggestions to make 
with respect to controlling federal spending, suggestions which 
have been market tested in the public arena, including in the 
federal election. However there are three additional 
contributions that I would like to bring to this pre-budget 
discussion.
<P>
	The first is an overview of our consultations with the public 
on the issue of public spending, consultations which have been 
going on since March of last year and which have involved 
thousands more people than have been involved in the minister's 
pre-budget consultations.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="687"> 687 </A></B>
<P>
	The second is a summary of conclusions drawn from these 
consultations, conclusions which we believe will be useful to 
the minister in preparing his budget and in endeavouring to 
determine what the spending priorities should be of the 35th 
Parliament.
<P>
	The third contribution I want to make is a brief commentary 
on the prospects of a full-blown tax revolt in this country if the 
government seeks to solve its fiscal problems by tax increases 
rather than spending cuts.
<P>
	In making these remarks I will endeavour to be brief, it having 
been my experience that politicians who cannot practise 
economy in speech are rarely able to practise economy in 
anything else.
<P>
	Early in 1993 Reformers engaged in an extensive consultation 
with our members, with knowledgeable resource persons and 
with the public on the subject of federal spending.
<P>
<B>(1110 ) </B>
<P>
	We asked over 100,000 Canadians by way of a mail survey 
whether they believed the federal government should deal with 
the deficit and debt problem through spending cuts or tax 
increases. We asked them to give us their views on what the 
spending priorities of the next Parliament should be. In 
particular, we asked in what areas the federal government 
should maintain or increase its current level of spending and we 
asked in what areas the federal government should reduce or 
eliminate spending in order to preserve financial support for 
higher priority items.
<P>
	With this background data we developed a list of about $20 
billion worth of spending reductions which we felt could be 
implemented in a three-year period if the federal government 
sought and obtained a mandate from the public to do so.
<P>
	This deficit reduction program was unveiled to the media and 
the public in three stages in the spring of 1993. On March 29 in 
Toronto we unveiled proposals for saving between $9 billion and 
$10 billion through the reform of federal transfers to individuals 
and provinces with the emphasis on reform of transfers to 
individuals. On April 13, 1993 in Vancouver we unveiled further 
proposals for achieving savings of $4 billion to $5 billion 
through reductions in transfers and subsidies to the private 
sector. On April 22 here in Ottawa we unveiled proposals for 
achieving savings of between $5 billion to $6 billion through the 
reform of the operations programs and structures of the federal 
government itself.
<P>
	I would be pleased to table these papers describing these 
proposals for the consideration of the finance minister and hon. 
members, even though some of the figures are slightly dated. All 
of these papers, I might add, were made available to the previous 
government, although I am not sure that they survived the great 
shredding which occurred after October 25.
<P>
	We organized all these proposals into a 45-minute slide show 
suitable for presentation to public audiences and town hall 
meetings. The first public showing of this presentation was 
made on budget day, April 26, 1993 to an audience of over 1,000 
people in Calgary. We subsequently made this presentation, the 
whole theme on how you come to grips with federal spending, 
available to almost 200 Reform spokespersons across the 
country. As a result, it was shown to thousands more people 
across the country at dozens and dozens of town hall meetings, 
followed in most cases by a question and answer period.
<P>
	In addition, we prepared a broad sheet containing the same 
information on proposals to cut federal spending and distributed 
over 2.5 million copies door to door prior to the federal election.
<P>
	This is a description of what a populist party calls intensive 
and sustained public consultation on an important issue.
<P>
	Now for the conclusions relevant to the minister. What 
conclusions did we arrive at through this public consultation 
that would be of relevance to the minister in preparing his 
current budget? Let me list four:
<P>
	First, there is an enormous interest in the subject of federal 
spending and taxation at the grassroots level in this country. 
There is a great thirst for relevant information and a genuine 
desire on the part of ordinary people to contribute to a solution 
to this problem.
<P>
	Second, it is false in our judgment to say that the public is 
only interested in spending cuts if they are made at someone 
else's expense. Time and time again we have heard Canadians 
say, and many of these are Canadians in dire circumstances, that 
they are still personally prepared to make some sacrifices. All 
they ask is that the sacrifices be distributed fairly, in particular 
that those with political or economic clout do not manage to get 
themselves exempted.
<P>
	Third, it is possible to generate in our judgment substantial 
informed sustainable public support for spending reductions, if 
one goes after it and if one can hold out genuine tax relief as the 
light at the end of the tunnel.
<P>
<B>(1115 ) </B>
<P>
	Fourth and finally, these in our judgment are the spending 
priorities the Canadian people want this Parliament and the 
minister to pursue in 1994-95.
<P>
	First, maintain federal transfers in support of health care at 
present levels or better. Second, maintain or even increase 
federal support for higher education and labour force training. 
Third, preserve federal support at current levels for the heart of 
the pension system, the veteran's pension, the guaranteed 
income supplement and old age security for households below 
the national average household income. Leave RRSP 
contribution levels alone.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="688"> 688 </A></B>
<P>
	Fourth, maintain or increase federal support for 
environmental conservation, although many people feel that the 
effectiveness of federal spending in this area could be vastly 
improved. Fifth, maintain or increase federal support for the 
administration of justice.
<P>
	If these really are the spending priorities of the Canadian 
people, and we remain open to suggestions from other members 
concerning this whole subject of priorities, spending on 
virtually everything else the federal government does should be 
decreased in order to reduce the deficit and to maintain the 
ability of the federal government to finance its activities in these 
high priority areas.
<P>
	Just to comment on my third contribution on the prospects of a 
tax revolt, what prospects does the federal government face if it 
does not respond to the public desire to cut spending but instead 
chooses to raise even higher the total tax load carried by 
Canadians? The fiscal and economic consequences of such an 
action are many and well known. Increasing the tax burden will 
contribute to the growth of the underground economy, the 
exodus of job creating private capital in entrepreneurs, the 
further erosion of social services as more and more dollars go to 
servicing the debt and the reduction of international 
competitiveness.
<P>
	What this House must also consider are the political 
consequences of increased taxation. In particular, the prospects 
of unleashing a full blown, bottom up tax revolt, the like of 
which this country has never seen. Let me speak particularly of 
the potential for a tax revolt in British Columbia and Alberta, 
where the majority of our Reform MPs come from and where we 
have a vast network of grassroots context. Let other MPs from 
other provinces give the finance minister their frank and honest 
assessment of the prospects of a tax revolt among their own 
constituents if his budget imposes a higher tax load upon those 
constituents.
<P>
	On Vancouver Island, for example, there are probably more 
retired Canadians and more RRSP participants per capita than 
anywhere else in Canada. All the MPs on that island with the 
exception of the Minister of National Revenue from Victoria are 
Reform MPs who campaigned hard on the spending reduction 
program that I have outlined.
<P>
	Many of their constituents are people who have provided their 
own retirement safety nets through RRSPs, in many cases 
because they did not have access to public sector or company 
plans and in many cases because of their declining faith in the 
Canada Pension Plan and the government's capacity to finance 
OAS in the future.
<P>
	If the finance minister's budget contains even a hint of 
reducing the capacity of these people and their children to care 
for their own retirement needs, the minister will unleash a 
torrent of protest from these RRSP contributors and recipients 
focused on the Minister of National Revenue's office in Victoria 
which will  reverberate across the country and make the GST 
protest of the 1980s look like a Sunday school picnic.
<P>
	In the province of Alberta, as the minister well knows, there 
remains a deep mistrust of Liberal taxation policy, particularly 
among people in the energy sector. The four government MPs 
from Edmonton won their seats by a combined plurality of less 
than 3,500 votes, three of them by less than 300 votes, the 
Minister of Natural Resources by a plurality of less than a dozen 
votes.
<P>
	Their capacities to represent their constituent's interests are 
very much still in the balance and on trial.
<P>
<B>(1120 ) </B>
<P>
	Rumours have persisted for weeks, to the point at which they 
are now considered more than rumours, that the finance minister 
is considering imposing a carbon tax on the producers and 
consumers of fossil fuels. This tax would no doubt be presented 
as an environmental measure, but since it will not apply to the 
nuclear waste outputs of Ontario Hydro nuclear plants or to 
hectares flooded by hydro electric companies like Quebec 
Hydro, it will have a particularly onerous and discriminatory 
effect on Alberta's petroleum, coal and utility sectors. It will be 
seen in Alberta, rightly or wrongly, as the present government's 
equivalent of the hated petroleum and gas revenue tax that was 
the cornerstone of the national energy program.
<P>
	If the minister's budget were to contain such a measure it 
would completely undermine the position of the minister of 
natural resources in his home province. It will provoke an ugly 
confrontation with the Government of Alberta at a time when the 
Prime Minister says he wants a new era of federal-provincial 
co-operation and it will damage the economy of one of only two 
remaining provinces that are still making net positive 
contributions to equalization.
<P>
	It has been said that this administration has rarely met an 
interest group it did not like, but there is emerging in this 
country an interest group which none of us can afford to 
disregard. It is the forgotten interest of the last 30 years, the 
interest that pays the bills. It is the interest of the long suffering 
Canadian taxpayer whose motto has become enough is enough. 
It is an interest that is finding its voice and its capacity for action 
through dozens of organizations, conferences and publications 
dedicated to protecting that interest from merciless, continuous, 
never ending exploitation by high spending governments.
<P>
	In conclusion, to the taxpayers of this country, to whom all of 
us are ultimately accountable, we say that your voice has been 
heard by many of us in this House. If it takes a full blown tax 
revolt employing every legal means conceivable to convince the 
government that taxpayers have had enough, that tax revolt will 
find an ally and a command post within this House among 
Reform MPs and other MPs who came here to cut spending.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="689"> 689 </A></B>
<P>
	Our advice to the finance minister and the government as 
they finalize their 1994-95 budget is eight words: cut spending, 
do it fairly, do it now.
<P>
	As our substantive contribution to restoring the financial 
health of the federal government and the financial health of the 
Canadian economy, we will lay on the table the $20 billion in 
proposed spending cuts which we have discussed extensively 
with the public. Take them, modify them and improve them but 
do not ignore them.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Members will be aware that under the 
present rules of the House it would strongly appear that the 
member who just spoke is subject to 10 minutes questions and 
comments if members are inclined to raise them. However, 
perhaps they do not wish to speak after the leader of a party has 
just spoken. I take it the member for Yukon would like to make 
questions or comments.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to thank the member for Calgary Southwest for his 
comments. While there are many comments I would like to 
make, I would like to focus on one aspect.
<P>
	I think there is no question that all of us in this House agree 
that the debt and the deficit are a problem for Canadians. The 
question is how to address that in a fair and balanced way.
<P>
	I am going to speak to one issue that the member for Calgary 
Southwest raised and that is the question of taxes. I agree that 
the middle class has been absolutely overburdened with taxes. 
We have a situation now in which individual Canadians are 
paying far more in taxes than they did in the past while 
corporations, for example, are paying far less.
<P>
<B>(1125 ) </B>
<P>
	The member for Calgary Southwest talks about a tax revolt. I 
find it revolting that while people cannot put food on the table 
we have the rich and privileged in this country who can shelter 
their money in a private trust. I find it revolting that while there 
are Canadians in this country who are working every day and all 
members of the family are working and cannot make ends meet 
that we have 90,000 corporations that are still not paying a cent 
of tax. I find it revolting that while there are people who cannot 
make ends meet for their children, while there is 18 to 20 per 
cent youth unemployment in this country that we still have many 
people in this country using tax shelters and they are the rich and 
they are the corporations and we must address that tax in equity.
<P>
	No one is talking about putting a further tax on the already 
overburdened middle class but we have a group in this country 
not contributing its full share.
<P>
	I want to ask the member for Calgary Southwest if he does not 
believe that we need to shift the burden from the individual, 
from the middle class, to make sure that those who are 
privileged and wealthy in our society are paying their fair share. 
I would like to ask the member if he agree for example that in 
RRSPs there should be a provision, as there is now, that allows 
that Canadians are having investment in foreign countries 
through those contributions rather than in this country where we 
need to develop business and jobs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> I thank the member for her question. The short 
answer to her general question is yes we believe in greater 
equity in the tax system and if the member would examine the 
middle part of the presentation which I discussed she will see 
that we are calling for a reduction of $4 billion to $5 billion in 
federal transfers to the private sector through subsidies and 
through tax concessions.
<P>
	The only cautionary words that I would add to my answer to 
the member is that we do have to be conscious, because we are 
an exporting country, that if our total tax burden on our 
businesses exceeds that of their competitors then we simply 
drive them out of business, create higher unemployment and kill 
jobs.
<P>
	The greatest illustration of this at the current time is in the 
province of Ontario if you stand at the border and interview 
these companies that are leaving southern Ontario for the United 
States, even for up state New York which used to be one of the 
highest cost areas of doing business in the world, and ask them 
why they are leaving they give you a very short answer. They 
show you their tax position in southern Ontario, they show you 
their tax position in up state New York and then they ask how 
they can continue to do business under those conditions.
<P>
	My answer to the general question of the member is yes but 
with a cautionary note about driving business out by excessive 
taxation levels.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to congratulate the Member for Calgary 
Southwest on his speech. I would like to ask him a question 
about RRSPs.
<P>
	I personally feel that RRSPs allow us to prepare for our old 
age, and the better we are prepared for our old age, the less we 
will be a burden on Canadian society, when the time comes to 
pay annuities to senior citizens.
<P>
	It is a program that I really like and that is really close to my 
heart, which I have not yet had the chance to use, however, but I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="690"> 690 </A></B>
<P>
encourage Canadians to take advantage of it. I hope that the 
government will continue along this road, and I am not saying 
that I know any of the Finance Minister's secrets. We are 
allowed to use the RRSP  program to purchase a home. I feel 
that, at our age, we should also be able to use our RRSPs to help 
our children buy a home.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	I would like to hear the views of the hon. member for Calgary 
Southwest on this plan, which is called the RRSP Home Buyer's 
Plan. Do you think there is something positive in this idea, and 
do you think it should be renewed in the next budget?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order! Before I recognize the member 
and he answers the question, I would like to ask the hon. member 
for Carleton-Gloucester to address his remarks to the Chair in 
future. I recognize the hon. member for Calgary Southwest, if he 
would like to reply.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question.
<P>
	My response is this. Like the hon. member I support the RRSP 
program in principle, partly because of the reasons the member 
gives and also because it has enabled many Canadians who have 
no other way of providing adequate retirement safety nets for 
themselves to do so.
<P>
	Second, I believe that using RRSP funds to support the home 
buyer's program is useful and helpful and should be sustained, 
not be cut back. I would urge members to put that view before 
the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I noticed in the answer of the leader 
of the Reform Party to another member that he thought 
preferences in the existing tax act that sheltered companies in 
the export business should be maintained. At least that is what I 
thought he said.
<P>
	Does that mean he has shifted his campaign position? At that 
time the central thrust of the Reform Party was a tax design that 
basically eliminated most of the tax preferences in the act. If the 
member wants to have preferences for export companies that 
might take away from his notion of a flat tax.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question.
<P>
	I did not mean to imply that I was seeking special tax 
preference for exporting companies. I was just cautioning that if 
we put the total tax burden on Canadian companies, particularly 
exporters, at higher levels than that of the companies in 
countries we are competing with, we end up driving them out of 
business.
<P>
	Our major recommendation in the materials we wish to table 
with respect to reducing special treatment for companies is 
mainly in reducing the use of tax concessions as a regional 
development tool. That is the argument we have used all along.
<P>
	Before I sit down, may I formally table these documents? I 
ask permission to do so.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There have been discussions about that 
point. I believe the Reform Party leader realizes he has to get 
unanimous consent to table the documents.
<P>
	Is there unanimous consent among the members that the 
leader be allowed to table his document?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
short supplementary.
<P>
	I want to understand this clearly. The hon. member would 
maintain all preferences that exist for corporations within the 
act right now with what exceptions? Could the member please 
clarify that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would not maintain all 
preferences.
<P>
<B>(1135 ) </B>
<P>
	The details of our program call for reductions and tax 
concessions to business of about $1.5 billion over a three-year 
period. These are unspecified, although we have had discussions 
on what they might be. The number one candidate on our list 
would be to stop using tax concessions as a regional 
development tool under regional development programs. That is 
the only specific which is contained in that material.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> A point of order, the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe there is unanimous 
consent in the House for continuing the debate over the lunch 
hour from one o'clock until two o'clock.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is that agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> Mr. Speaker, on this side of the House we will 
now have speeches of 10 minutes and 5 minutes questions and 
comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Godfrey (Don Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, my first 
duty in this my first speech is to thank the people of Don Valley 
West in Toronto who put me here and to try to keep my faith with 
them. My second duty is to thank my family who helped me to be 
here as well.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, during the election campaign if you asked the 
people of Don Valley West what they wanted, they would give 
the same answer that all Canadians gave, which is two different 
things. They want these two things simultaneously. These two 
things can be found in our famous red book on page 111.
<P>
	At the top of page 111 in Table 1 we talk about savings from 
cuts to Conservative programs, so Canadians do want spending 
cuts. At the bottom of page 111 we talk about economic growth 
and job creation. That is what I really want to talk about today.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="691"> 691 </A></B>
<P>
	When the Minister of Finance met late last year with various 
economists in Ottawa, when he talked to the various 
consultative groups across Canada, he heard a lot about the top 
of page 111, cuts to spending. As the leader of the Reform Party 
has just shown us, we are going to be hearing a lot more during 
this debate about cuts to government programs.
<P>
	What the Minister of Finance has heard less about in his 
consultations with both the professionals and with ordinary 
Canadians is about the bottom of page 111: economic growth, 
primary wealth creation and jobs, jobs, jobs.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance has a difficult role. He has to be both 
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. He has to be nasty cop, but he also has 
to be nice cop. It is to his nicer nature that I wish to appeal today. 
That is why my remarks are going to focus on the bottom of page 
111.
<P>
	The most important single thing this budget can do is to create 
an atmosphere of hope, an atmosphere of experimentation, 
renewal and excitement for Canadians.
<P>
	An economy is not simply a series of statistics and numbers. It 
is a psychological state. An economy will grow if people feel 
good about themselves and their country. If they feel good they 
will take risks; they will change jobs; they will start businesses; 
they will grow businesses; they will buy houses; they will buy 
cars; they will buy appliances.
<P>
	The Conference Board of Canada last week noted the 
incredible boom in business and consumer confidence since the 
election. Business confidence went up 10 per cent; consumer 
confidence, 13 per cent in the last quarter of 1993. It is 
interesting to note that the same phenomenon took place in the 
United States after the election of President Clinton.
<P>
	Thus it is crucial that our first budget keep that mood of 
confidence going. An optimistic mood will translate into 
economic growth and job creation. Too much emphasis on cuts 
to government spending will destroy consumer and business 
confidence. What the minister has to do with his split 
personality is to walk the narrow line between cutting spending 
and investing in the future.
<P>
<B>(1140 ) </B>
<P>
	I would ask the Minister of Finance to remember the spirit of 
another government which came in, in another era, in another 
country, the spirit of the new deal of Franklin Roosevelt in 1933. 
That spirit has been characterized as bold, persistent 
experimentation.
<P>
	The red book mentions such experimentation under the 
headings of investing in people, equality under the law and 
culture. But the most challenging and economically stimulating 
and exciting experimentation must take place in the area of 
research and technology, specifically involving venture capital, 
increased research and development, the Canadian technology 
network and the engineering program.
<P>
	Canada needs to create a national system of innovation or 
what the finance minister has called a long-term growth 
strategy. As the red book notes: ``The crucial role of the federal 
government in such an innovation system is to work with the 
private sector to identify strategic opportunities for the future, 
then to redirect its existing resources toward fulfilment of those 
opportunities''. This approach has been called in other 
jurisdictions the Quebec Incorporated approach or in our own, 
the Team Canada approach.
<P>
	The point is that smaller societies like ours have to pull all 
their national resources off the shelf if they are going to compete 
as a team, if they are going to compete internationally. What 
happens when we do not? We have too many examples of where 
we have failed to do what we ought to have done: the case of 
Connaught Bio-sciences being bought by a French owned 
company, the case of Lumonics being bought by a Japanese 
company.
<P>
	What happens when we get it right? History provides 
examples of that too. When Canada competed as an industrial 
team in World War II we built such extraordinary facilities as a 
major shipbuilding operation in Quebec, a major producer of 
artificial rubber at the Polymer plant in Sarnia.
<P>
	The experiments we undertake will require new 
configurations of business and finance, new partnerships of the 
public and private sector. We need to create new business 
structures to realize these strategic opportunities. What some 
have called innovative business enterprises look perhaps to us 
more like Japanese Keiretsu or German banking groups or 
Swedish industrial groups than normal Canadian business 
organizations. Words like networks, consortia and virtual 
corporations can best describe these new entities.
<P>
	What are some of these strategic opportunities? They abound. 
Their primary definition is that they are things which no one 
enterprise can undertake by itself and can only be undertaken 
collectively. In Ontario, for example, with our extraordinary 
base in auto production and auto parts, should we not be a 
leading jurisdiction in the production of green cars? Should we 
not corner part of that advanced environment market, whether it 
is in the fuel area or in the disposal area?
<P>
	The previous Conservative government did something very 
good when it produced CANARIE, that extraordinary 
consortium to build the electronic highway, a consortium which 
defies all the rules of business. It includes traditional 
competitors like Unitel and Stentor and brings in provincial and 
federal governments, universities and research centres. 
CANARIE is a virtual corporation dedicated to a huge task 
which cannot be done by a single entity.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="692"> 692 </A></B>
<P>
	In health care we have the same opportunities. We have an 
enormous biomedical base and no receptor capacity in industry. 
In Alberta there is a consortium of small companies which is 
coming together to build housing in Japan. They are creating 
a new kind of business entity. That is the sort of 
experimentation we need.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In Quebec, 13 industrial clusters were established by the 
Minister of Industry, Gérald Tremblay. But one question must 
be asked: if an industrial cluster performs well, within Quebec, 
would it be possible for it to perform even better on the 
Canadian level? A cluster in the petrochemical industry, for 
example, or the aerospace industry. In summary, we need a 
social plan for the whole of Canada, using Quebec's model as a 
starting point.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In short, Canada needs a budget which shows that cutting 
spending, investing in experimentation and innovation must be 
simultaneous events, not sequential.
<P>
	Canada's economic problems are as much a function of slow 
economic growth as they are of excessive government spending. 
Let us make sure that both the spending problem and the slow 
growth problem get equal attention in this budget.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Tremblay (Rosemont):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
greatly the interest shown by my colleague from Don Valley 
West for the Quebec model. I would like to elaborate a bit on 
what he said particularly on development strategies.
<P>
	Because Quebec has a strategy in certain sectors, our 
colleague from Don Valley West says: ``Listen, if a development 
strategy is good for Quebec, would it not be good for Canada as a 
whole?''
<P>
	In some cases, I say yes. For example, for years we have had a 
proposal for a high-speed train between Quebec City and 
Windsor. We are anxious for the government to move on that 
because these technologies are important for the future and 
would benefit both Quebec and Ontario.
<P>
	In other sectors, it is unfortunately not the case. That is not 
unfortunate, in a way, since the sectors we choose cannot always 
be the same. A good example is nuclear energy. The federal 
government has spent on nuclear energy hundreds of millions of 
dollars which have essentially benefitted Ontario.
<P>
	Quebec has enough hydroelectricity for years to come and it 
has never really been interested in investing in nuclear energy. 
But, through the federal government, Quebec taxpayers have 
been forced to spend on nuclear research those hundreds of 
millions of dollars which now essentially benefit Ontario, which 
moreover competes with us on the New York market.
<P>
	Then I say: ``Listen, if it is true in an international context-in 
any case, Quebec like the rest of Canada is increasingly 
becoming an economic region of North America-we can no 
longer implement projects for Canada, with economic and 
competitive implications, without taking into consideration the 
whole of North America''.
<P>
	It is obvious that a region like Montreal is in direct 
competition as much with Boston and New York as with Toronto 
and other cities and can therefore also probably conclude joint 
ventures with them. The political structure is losing importance 
on the international scene. We must each invest in projects, in 
sectors that are important for our future.
<P>
	We can have joint projects with Ontario because we have 
mutual interests. But we have diverging interests in other 
sectors, where both Quebec and Ontario will have to find other 
partners in the world.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Godfrey:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member 
for his question.
<P>
	It is extremely interesting, but in a way it is the paradox of 
Quebec, if I may quote the hon. member's leader. In other 
words, if it makes sense to have industrial clusters at the Quebec 
level, why not at the Canadian level? Because we control our 
own territory we can create a tax atmosphere that is not the same 
as that in New York but that could be the same everywhere in 
Canada.
<P>
	What I have always admired most about Quebec over the past 
30 years is the willingness to experiment that has found new 
funding formulas. The Caisse de dépôt et de placement, for 
example.
<P>
	I agree that if the high-speed train makes transportation 
sense, if it is not just a luxury, then yes, it is exactly the type of 
joint experimental project we should be trying out. We have to 
take advantage of the fact that we are after all a common market.
<P>
	Lastly, if we are going to create clusters, we have to concede 
that in some cases-atomic energy, for example-it makes 
sense to have the headquarters in Ontario. In the case of the 
aerospace industry, on the other hand, the headquarters should 
be in Montreal, with a branch plant, for instance De Havilland, 
in Ontario. The trick is to have networks all over the country that 
can benefit from all the resources. That's what we did not have 
during the unfortunate business of Connaught BioSciences Inc., 
where there were the resources, in Quebec as a matter of fact, 
both technical and financial, and we missed the boat.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate the member for Don Valley West on his maiden 
speech. I guess we all know that there are not many maidens left 
here. I would say that his comments were very perceptive and 
bear paying close attention to.
<P>
	Certainly coming from a rural northern area one of the crucial 
problems we have is access to capital. During the election I 
know his party spoke about an investment fund for small and 
medium sized businesses. The New Democratic Party presented 
a very comprehensive proposal for a national investment fund 
wherein we could utilize both public pension funds and private 
funds to help entrepreneurs. There are many in the country and 
many young people who now want to start their own business. 
They may indeed be very small enterprises.
<P>
	As well as the industrial strategy to which the member 
referred, could he give his views on the necessity to ensure that 
we can get capital to small businesses in all areas of the country, 
rural as well as urban?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Godfrey:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Yukon.
<P>
	We talk specifically in the red book about new kinds of funds 
called expert funds based on the model of MDS Capital, a health 
care outfit, and investing on the basis of its expertise. That is the 
kind of new model we need wherever businesses find 
themselves, whether they are in small or large communities.
<P>
	What makes the difference is a fund that understands the 
nature of business and is prepared to put equity into it as well as 
lend money to it. That will also have an effect on the way banks 
conduct their businesses in the future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil):</B> Mr. Speaker, I congratulate 
the Minister of Finance on his initiative in making the budget 
preparation an open and consultative process that allows 
Canadians from coast to coast the opportunity to be heard and, 
more important, the opportunity to be consulted prior to the 
adoption of the budget. I hope it is reflective of the way future 
budgets will be prepared by all ministers of finance.
<P>
	I was considering what I would do if I were minister of 
finance. I would ask myself the questions: How did we get into 
this mess in the first place and, more important, how are we 
going to get out of it? Canadians from every walk of life know 
full well that the state of the economic mess that has been 
collectively created must be addressed.
<P>
	My first recommendation to the minister is to tell Canadians 
the exact state of the Canadian economy. Canadians have a right 
to know the state of their fiscal house.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The people of Canada and of Quebec know vigorous action is 
needed. Greater Montreal, which used to be a prosperous city, 
has been hard hit economically. Many plants have closed their 
doors. The unemployment rate, especially among young people, 
has reached unacceptable levels, and the percentage of families 
living below the poverty line is climbing steadily.
<P>
	It is high time we got back to basics. We have to learn to live 
within our means, to respect every dollar that is earned and do 
more with much less.
<P>
	Our government's aims and objectives are well known. We 
want to encourage economic growth and job creation, we want to 
protect those who cannot protect themselves and above all we 
want to reduce the deficit.
<P>
	How to tackle the challenge? It is important not to go in for 
stop-gap, temporary solutions. On the contrary: our approach 
must be balanced, rapid and complete. And above all we must 
take care not to hurt the burgeoning economic recovery.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	We must launch an unwavering attack on the deficit, all the 
while balancing our revenue sources, carefully reducing our 
expenditures and bolstering the economy so as to increase the 
growth now anticipated to reach 3 to 4 per cent.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Balancing these elements demands that Canadians undertake 
a thoughtful evaluation of the expectations of government. In 
turn government must be politically brave. We must be frugal 
and the mismanagement of public funds must be halted. We 
must go after every single dollar of savings, and duplications of 
services must be eliminated.
<P>
	What must be the priority of the Minister of Finance? In my 
humble opinion the only priority is one of jobs, jobs, jobs. 
Government alone cannot create jobs. It must however generate 
and foster an environment under which the private sector can 
grow in order to better create those desperately needed jobs.
<P>
	Government must develop a climate fostering competitive 
advantage. All the while it must maintain a healthy social 
environment.
<P>
	I believe our government is on the right track with the recent 
signing of the NAFTA and the GATT. Canada is now well poised 
squarely within the new global marketplace, offering 
opportunities that will allow business and industry to take 
advantage of the new international markets.
<P>
	These agreements are a good start, but I ask the Minister of 
Finance to live up to the government's commitment to assisting 
small and medium sized business. Time and time again small 
business has created 85 per cent of new jobs. The time has 
finally come to act. If the Minister of Finance wants those 
desperately needed jobs then the government must give those 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="694"> 694 </A></B>
<P>
900,000  entrepreneurs access to desperately needed capital. 
The requirement for personal guarantees for small business 
loans must be removed immediately.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The riding of Vaudreuil, which I have the privilege of 
representing, is composed of both rural and urban areas. The 
main activities of the rural part of my riding centre on corn, 
dairy farms and poultry breeding.
<P>
	Grain producers in Vaudreuil have taken the initiative of 
setting up an ethanol fuel producing plant that will be financed 
by the business community as well as the producers themselves. 
Besides being a clean and environmentally friendly fuel, ethanol 
will assist in increasing corn production in the region, helping 
by the same token farmers in my riding who are in dire straits.
<P>
	Such a factory would give direct full-time employment to 300 
people, and its construction would create 600 jobs. The only 
impediment is the fuel tax, which would have to be eliminated if 
ethanol is to become an economical alternative to gas for 
automobiles.
<P>
	It is very easy to increase the taxpayer's fiscal burden. But I 
would like to warn the Minister of Finance against the lure of 
easy money and urge him not to increase income tax for 
Canadian men and women, as they are already paying the 
highest taxes in the industrialized world. A report published in 
November 1993 by the OECD shows Canada's unenviable 
position among the Group of Seven; for the last three years, 
Canadian families have known the highest income tax increase 
as well as the sharpest decrease in net income.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance must, therefore, look elsewhere for 
new revenues. Or else, and this is quite feasible, he could reduce 
expenditures in different fields, by restructuring the machinery 
of government and the way in which services are delivered.
<P>
	In my opinion, the first thing to do is demand that each 
department justify its budget. A reward system evaluating the 
performance of administrators in each department should be set 
up. We could then estimate the savings and costs linked to the 
new guidelines, as well as the amount of red tape required.
<P>
	We must put a stop immediately to the spending spree that 
several departments embark on when March 31 looms near, at 
the end of every fiscal year. However, let us reward thrifty 
administrators and penalize big spenders!
<P>
	We must approach governmental services in a new way, which 
does not mean that government should relinquish its role or give 
up delivering services which Canadian men and women have 
come to expect from it.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	Better co-operation between the three levels of 
government-federal, provincial and municipal-would 
eliminate all the waste caused by the duplication of services. 
The idea is not to take away any power, but to identify clearly the 
level of government best qualified to manage an area of 
jurisdiction in the most economically efficient way, with the full 
co-operation of the other levels of government.
<P>
	By eliminating bureaucratic duplications and overlappings, 
we would save money at all levels. First, individuals and 
businesses would have to deal with less levels of government, 
thereby reducing their administrative costs. Second, doing away 
with some costly departments would mean immediate savings 
for taxpayers and governments alike. Third, co-operation 
between the federal and provincial levels of government would 
increase the efficiency of services provided and produce 
economies of scale which would entail enormous potential 
savings without jeopardizing the quality of those services.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Other areas I would urge the Minister of Finance to look at 
would be in the reassessment of all government assets: tracts of 
land, buildings, commercially competitive enterprises and other 
assets that are no longer central to the needs of restructured 
government.
<P>
	I encourage the Minister of Finance to introduce debts bonds 
in which Canadians could participate, knowing that every dollar 
they invest would go directly to reducing the debt. With 
domestic borrowing interest payments will flow back into the 
Canadian economy thus allowing the government to reduce its 
external debt and retain better control of its own economy.
<P>
	Another idea I would propose would be the tax lottery on 
gambling and winnings. I am sure every Canadian would be in 
agreement. Speaking of lottery, why not implement a Canadian 
debt lottery? It may encourage participation from Canadians 
who normally do not participate in lotteries. The proceeds 
thereof could be split between the Canadian and provincial debts 
based on an equitable formula.
<P>
	In conclusion, economic and fiscal renewal in Canada will not 
be an easy task but it is far from impossible. Realistic options 
exist for new approaches to debt management, the 
administration of government and the framework it sets for 
economic growth. All we need is the political will and 
Canadians will follow.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate the hon. member on his excellent speech. I share 
his concern in the farming industry.
<P>
	I was wondering whether he would like to comment on what 
his thoughts would be in resolving some of the management-la-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="695"> 695 </A></B>
<P>
bour problems we seem continually to have in the grain industry. 
This issue has bugged and hurt  farmers for years. What are the 
member's feelings on that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Discepola:</B> Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned before about 60 
per cent of my riding is rural. During the campaign I had the 
opportunity to meet with many dairy producers as well as grain 
producers. I must admit it rarely surfaced during my campaign. 
Many dairy producers are quite satisfied with the supply 
management system and it works very well.
<P>
	With regard to grain producers they are desperately in need of 
other sources of prospects for development products. The main 
project we have in mind, not only for the area of Vaudreuil, is a 
task force on ethanol development as was mentioned yesterday 
in the House. I think that would benefit Canadians, especially 
those in rural areas.
<P>
	I have not experienced the management problem but I thank 
the hon. member for the question anyway. If he has any ideas I 
would not mind discussing them with him.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too compliment the member on his 
remarks, especially the portion of his speech that dealt with the 
necessity of us getting more access to capital for small business.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	Would the member take the remaining minute or so to give us 
some of his ideas that we might consider implementing so that 
we could be much more aggressive in that area?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Discepola:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question. Being in small business myself, having founded a 
small business in 1976, I had the misfortune of having to deal 
with financial institutions.
<P>
	I have talked to many small business people. Every single one 
of them without a doubt-and the majority has seven or eight 
employees or less-is prepared to hire one or two employees if 
given access to capital. Instead of investing and putting their 
hard earned life savings on the line, they would like to invest 
through proper access to business loans to introduce new 
projects they have in mind.
<P>
	If we could encourage small businesses to take the initiative 
on their own to put forth projects they have had on the 
backburner for many years, we would go a long way toward 
creating the jobs desperately needed in the country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I want to thank the Minister of Finance for this opportunity to 
outline our expectations with regard to the forthcoming budget, 
away from the media scrums we saw during the past month and 
certainly a change from Question Period, where the minister has 
made a habit of leaving questions unanswered.
<P>
	In this debate, the Bloc Quebecois maintains that to carry out 
a tax reform that is fair, effective and sustainable and to avoid 
drastic cuts in public spending and, especially, in social 
programs, the Minister of Finance will have to do very shortly 
what we have been asking him to do all along, and that is set up a 
special parliamentary committee to examine federal spending 
and the federal tax system.
<P>
	It is really too bad that so far, the minister has failed to 
respond to requests in this respect from the Bloc Quebecois. In 
this House, the words transparency, democracy, co-operation 
and responsibility are often mentioned, but acting according to 
these principles is another story altogether.
<P>
	Everyone here is aware of the pitiful state of our public 
finances. Everyone is convinced that appropriate steps must be 
taken to turn the situation around.
<P>
	The federal debt, as a number of colleagues mentioned earlier, 
recently rose to a record $507 billion.
<P>
	The situation has deteriorated since the recession. The deficit 
has risen from $31 billion in 1991 to $45 billion in 1994. The 
Canadian government's operating deficit is now 6.2 per cent of 
GDP or, according to the OECD, twice that of the United States.
<P>
	The government's performance in terms of the deficit and the 
state of its finances in general is mainly due to an unexpected 
drop in tax revenue.
<P>
	This drop is very disturbing, because it occurred despite a 
measure of economic growth. There is necessarily a connection 
between lower tax revenues and the growth of the so-called 
underground economy.
<P>
	The disastrous state of our public finances cannot be allowed 
to continue, because generally speaking, it restricts the 
government's ability to deal with the real problems, and 
especially unemployment. The deficit alone drains domestic 
savings and increases Canadian borrowing abroad. In fact, 
between 1983 and 1992, the proportion of the federal debt owed 
to non-residents more than doubled. Of all G-7 countries, 
Canada has the highest foreign debt. The state of its finances 
undermines Canada's credibility and is harmful to investment, 
because of the risk premium which is a factor in raising 
Canada's interest rates.
<P>
	The prime cause of the disastrous state of our finances is the 
state of the economy. We are just coming out of a very long 
recession, one of the longest and worst since the depression in 
1929. Economic recovery is slow to get off the ground and is in 
fact much slower than in 1982.
<P>
	This recession which we all deplore is due, first and foremost, 
to the dogmatic policies of the Bank of Canada, which caused a 
substantial spread between short-term real interest rates in 
Canada and those prevailing in the United States at the time. Mr. 
Speaker, when will the members on the other side of this House 
understand that the real rate in Canada, the only one that matters 
to investors, has slipped by more than 6 per cent  compared to 
the US rate. Under the circumstances, how are we supposed to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="696"> 696 </A></B>
<P>
attract investors and keep our Canadian investors on the 
domestic market? The situation is unacceptable!
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	Because of this policy, and primarily because of the previous 
government's policy, we entered into the recession during the 
first quarter of 1990, that is before everyone else. The ensuing 
downturn in the world economy exacerbated the situation in 
Quebec and in Canada.
<P>
	When we examine the situation, we note that since April 
1992, Quebec has recovered a scant 25 per cent of the jobs lost 
during the recession, whereas in the rest of Canada, the figure is 
considerably higher, namely 60 per cent. The unemployment 
rate remains unacceptably high. It hovers at roughly 13 per cent, 
and at 11.2 per cent for Canada. These unacceptable levels hide 
the real tragedy faced by hundreds of thousands of Quebecers 
and Canadians.
<P>
	We have been waiting a long time for the recovery, the one 
which according to economists' figures, has been under way for 
nearly two years now. The recession and the slow recovery, 
coupled with the underutilization of Canada's output potential, 
have contributed to a decline in government revenues. 
According to a study by the International Monetary Fund, of all 
G-7 countries, Canada's deficit is the most sensitive to the state 
of the economy. Furthermore, as the leader of the Opposition 
mentioned this morning in his excellent speech, still according 
to an International Monetary Fund study, even if the Canadian 
economy had achieved its full potential in 1993, we would still 
continue to rack up in the coming years deficits in the order of 
3.5 per cent of GDP. Therefore, what we are also facing is a 
structural problem in Canada.
<P>
	This problem is related to the nature of the federal system, and 
to its chronic, historic inability to adjust to new social and 
economic realities. I can give several examples of how the 
nature of the system is responsible for the anemic recovery. 
First, in view of the poor distribution of powers and federal 
encroachment upon provincial areas of jurisdiction, the system 
leads to program duplication and overlap, resulting in an 
inability to achieve the very aims for which the programs were 
created. It is estimated that duplication costs Quebec roughly $2 
to 3 billion per year.
<P>
	Here is a second example of how the system contributes to an 
anemic recovery. Because of the nature of the system and the 
natural tendency to centralize everything, the two levels of 
government compete with each other to see who can provide the 
most, not the best, services. We have seen this happen in many 
areas such as manpower training, regional development and 
transportation, a field with which I was associated in the past.
<P>
	Under this system, the rule never changes. The federal 
government must have the highest profile, the Canadian flag 
must nudge out all provincial flags, including Quebec's. The 
result is inefficiency, duplication and encroachment on areas of 
provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	My hon. colleagues opposite persist in brandishing their red 
book each time we raise a concern or point to economic inertia. 
However, the facts speak for themselves. Our system is 
outmoded and in decline.
<P>
	Third, the federal system results in a lack of cohesion and 
policy integration, thus impeding a healthy recovery with 
respect to jobs, economic growth and consequently, tax 
revenues. We cannot emphasize too strongly the problem of 
integrating the various components of income security, 
manpower training and labour market integration or the need to 
decentralize for the sake of efficiency and subsidiarity, needs 
which are very clearly understood in Europe, particularly with 
Maastricht.
<P>
	Not only is this system inflexible and inadequate in terms of 
generating a steady economic recovery and adequate fiscal 
revenues, it has lost any sense of priority, thanks to those who 
have kept it running for decades, often the same people who 
today sit in this Liberal government. In a world in constant 
upheaval, certain priorities are inescapable.
<P>
	The legacy of federalism in the area of R and D funding and 
training is one good example.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	Canada spends the least on research and development, 1.4 per 
cent of GDP, compared to 3.1 per cent in Japan and 2.8 per cent 
in the United States. It is outrageous that we have not made a 
priority, historically, of such a key sector as research and 
development.
<P>
	The federal R and D legacy for Quebec is even worse, since 
over the past 30 years Quebec has only received between 12 and 
18 per cent of R and D spending, while Ontario got over 50 per 
cent. It is not surprising, then, that Quebec is not getting its 
share in the economic recovery. Historically, Quebec has been 
weakened because the structural benefits related to R and D have 
not taken place there, and the federal government has 
contributed to that problem.
<P>
	At the same time, Canada has turned in a notably poor 
performance in training and business training. Nevertheless,R and D and manpower training are the keys to meeting the 
challenges of globalization, to a sustainable recovery, jobs, and 
adequate tax revenues. That is self-evident. It is not surprising, 
given the poor performance of the system, that in only two years 
Canada had slipped from fifth to eleventh place among 
industrialized countries on the competitiveness scale of the 
World Competitiveness Report in 1992.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="697"> 697 </A></B>
<P>
	It is not surprising either that according to the same report 
for 1993, Canada's future prospects ranked 20th out of 22. We 
see Quebecers and Canadians losing faith in political 
institutions. In a world of constant change, we cannot simply 
mark time indefinitely.
<P>
	Faced with all that, this whole mess, and faced with a 
government that gives people no hope, except constitutional 
conferences, now economic conferences, conferences on human 
resources, conferences that will drag on and on with no solution, 
we have a better idea of why those who have been left behind and 
those who have been crushed and strangled by Canada's tax 
system, namely the middle-income people, are cynical about 
politicians.
<P>
	We had better understand their feeling of revolt, their feeling 
of powerlessness and their frustration at not being able to make a 
real choice except once every four years and at having the wool 
pulled over their eyes in the meantime. We have a better 
understanding, even if we do not agree with them, of the reasons 
many of them are forced to turn to the underground economy, to 
the black market, thus cutting into government revenues and 
worsening the state of the government's finances.
<P>
	The problem of contraband cigarettes is only an expression of 
a much more serious situation than those who claim to govern us 
would admit. It is simply an expression of a widespread 
disillusionment and even disregard felt by Quebecers and 
Canadians.
<P>
	Quebecers will soon choose what they think will be a more 
promising way to the future than what the present system offers. 
When Quebec becomes sovereign, of course it will take charge 
of its destiny and Quebecers will be accountable to themselves 
and to History; it will also be an ideal opportunity for Canadians 
to redefine themselves, to create institutions that reflect who 
they are, with a strong central government if they so wish and 
wall-to-wall national standards if that is what they want. In 
short, Canadians will have every opportunity to develop on the 
basis of models that suit them and that we respect but no longer 
share as Quebecers.
<P>
	Meanwhile, to get into the subject before us today, and so that 
I will have time to get my whole message across, I would like to 
tackle head-on the issue of public finances. Since the Minister 
of Finance began consultations, many have said that it is not 
possible to put the public finances back in order without cuts in 
social programs, because transfers to individuals and provinces 
account for more than half of program spending. The way the 
government's consultations, led by the Minister of Finance, are 
going, we are inclined to think that he and his colleague, the 
Minister of Human Resources, are tempted by that solution.
<P>
	If not, how do you explain that in his department's own 
booklet on Canada's economic challenges, it is said that our 
social security and health systems are too generous? How do you 
explain that the member for Hull-Aylmer, who loves to travel 
by Challenger jet at $170,000 per speech, could talk about 
cutting the health budget by 20 per cent? How do you explain 
that every time I asked him in this House to deny the rumours 
about it, the Minister of Finance never did?
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	The statistics that were quoted in this House yesterday on 
underemployment and on the poverty of women and children 
should have convinced us and convinced this government that 
social programs must not be tampered with, that the less 
fortunate members of our society must not be targeted, as the 
previous government has been criticized for doing.
<P>
	These figures should have convinced the government to stop 
hounding those who are hard up, as we would say, and to try 
instead to improve their well-being and prospects by putting 
into place adequate economic policies and taking corrective 
action such as restoring funding to social housing which was 
shamefully cut by the previous government.
<P>
	The second option, one apparently favoured by the Minister 
of Finance, is to draw on middle-income taxpayers. We, from 
the Bloc Quebecois, do not think this is appropriate either. 
Sound management of public finances is required. The 
middle-income taxpayers, who have borne most the 68 per cent 
increase in federal taxes since 1984, are not able to contribute 
additional tax revenues. They are overburdened.
<P>
	They should not be the ones affected by the broadening of the 
tax base this government is considering because, as I said, the 68 
per cent increase in federal taxes was borne mostly by those 
taxpayers. Again, the Minister of Finance is tempted to adopt 
this course of action.
<P>
	On January 28, the headline in <I>La Presse</I> read-and I will 
have to use the name of the minister-``Martin has his eye on 
seniors and social programs''. The article went on to say that the 
minister intended to tax health care and insurance plans that 
employers contribute to and was contemplating measures 
affecting certain exemptions benefiting middle-income seniors 
as well as the capital gains exemption and the limit on RRSPs. 
The Bloc Quebecois believes that the middle-income taxpayers 
deserve a break.
<P>
	As part of the public finance review process, it was suggested 
that, to put finances back on a healthy footing, transfer 
payments to the provinces should be cut. The solution does not 
lay there either. In the end, the same people end up footing the 
bill, except that the provinces, Quebec in particular, bear the 
brunt of the cuts and the fiscal restraints, while the federal 
government is washing its hands of the matter.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="698"> 698 </A></B>
<P>
	The provinces have done more than enough in that respect 
since 1984. Let us just say that, from 1984 to 1993, the rate 
of federal transfer payments to Quebec-I am taking the case 
of Quebec because it is the one I am most familiar with, but 
this probably applies throughout Canada-has dropped from 29 
to 18 per cent.
<P>
	During the same period, the federal government share in the 
financing of health and post-secondary education programs fell 
from 45 per cent to 32 per cent.
<P>
	These drops in federal contributions to Quebec resulted from 
several measures taken by the federal government to pass on its 
public finance management problem to the provinces.
<P>
	Just for established programs financing, the Quebec Minister 
of Finance estimated that, for fiscal year 1992-93 alone, federal 
cuts cost the Government of Quebec nearly $2 billion in lost 
revenues. Who paid for that? The taxpayers, the same taxpayers 
on whom the former Minister of Finance levied a special tax.
<P>
	That is not where the money should come from. The tax base 
needs to be broadened, but by eliminating tax loopholes 
benefitting high-income taxpayers and big corporations. I see 
that I have only two minutes left. So, I will just quote a few more 
facts.
<P>
	In preparing his Budget, the Minister of Finance should think 
of the richer Canadian taxpayers. According to Yves Séguin, an 
eminent Quebec tax specialist and former Quebec Minister of 
Revenue, in 1991, 368,000 of them reported $68 billion in 
income on which they were taxed at an actual rate of 18 per cent, 
while the basic tax rate was 29 per cent.
<P>
	By adding just three percentage points to their actual tax rate, 
the government would have recovered $2 billion in new tax 
revenue that year, but chose not to.
<P>
	I would suggest that the Deputy Minister of Finance get 
money from the thousands of corporations that did not pay a 
single penny in taxes. It is obvious that all the numbers are not 
out in the open. The Department of Finance has been compiling 
data since 1987, but according to Léopold Lauzon, another 
well-known Quebec tax accountant, 90,000 companies made 
$27 billion in profits that same year without paying any taxes.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	A minimum tax of say 10 per cent on these profits would have 
allowed us to collect almost $3 billion more in new tax revenues. 
Why are we not doing it? The Bloc Quebecois is urging the 
Minister of Finance to impose on corporations a minimum tax of 
up to 10 per cent for instance. That is where we must look for the 
billions of dollars missing from the federal coffers.
<P>
	It is the same for family trusts. We have talked about it but 
there are not enough truly comprehensive studies in this regard. 
A figure of $350 million in annual tax losses was put forward by 
Claude Picher of <I>La Presse</I> and confirmed by other analysts 
elsewhere. But we know that there is probably more money in 
these family trusts. In  1982, the most recent year on record, 
total assets in trust amounted to $87.7 billion although this 
amount includes other things besides family trusts. We do not 
know the true extent but we do know that we can add hundreds of 
millions of dollars to the federal Treasury by putting our foot 
down.
<P>
	So we are reiterating another request of the Bloc Quebecois: 
to set up a parliamentary committee. I heard the Finance 
Minister say this morning that we had to wait until 1995 and 
follow the process leading to the preparation of the 1995-96 
budget. We cannot wait until 1995-96. The Minister must 
immediately set up this special parliamentary committee to 
fully review the federal government's overall budget and fiscal 
spending in order to implement a lasting and equitable reform 
and especially to close loopholes and eliminate tax inequities I 
pointed out to you earlier, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	My colleague, the hon. member for Joliette, will speak further 
about the Auditor General's new revelations as there are 
hundreds of millions of dollars to be collected there. In 
conclusion, I would like to convey through you to the finance 
minister the following message: I hoped before the holiday 
season that the finance minister would not renew the Canadian 
monetary policy pursued by the former Governor of the Bank of 
Canada.
<P>
	Instead, he appointed the right-hand man of the former 
Governor of the Bank of Canada with essentially the same 
mandate, namely monetary and price stability regardless of 
economic growth. I am asking him through you to review this 
monetary policy to strike a balance, as many economists, and 
not only the 90 per cent of economists here in Ottawa but people 
such as Pierre Fortin, are asking him to strike a new balance 
between his objective of long-term price stability on the one 
hand with short-term employment growth and economic 
development on the other.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
first of all to congratulate our colleague, the member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, on his speech. I agree with many of 
his concerns, some of which I also mentioned in my own 
presentation.
<P>
	I feel the member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot missed a great 
opportunity. Since he is the critic for finance, I listened 
carefully to what he had to say but his statement remained very 
general; I would have hoped for something more precise. I share 
his views, particularly in the areas of research and development 
and small businesses.
<P>
	As I said before, he had the perfect opportunity to make his 
point and I would have hoped for more concrete and precise 
statements.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="699"> 699 </A></B>
<P>
	As regards my riding and my beautiful province, I get 
frustrated when I hear day after day the B.Q. and the P.Q. say 
that the problem with the economy of Canada and of Quebec 
is that the federal system no longer works, that the problem 
with the rate of unemployment in Quebec is that the federal 
system no longer works.	
<P>
	Today for the first time in the history of our Parliament, we 
had a perfect opportunity to say something concrete.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	I repeat my question to the member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot: If ever Quebec were to become 
independent, what percentage of the tax burden, and especially 
the debt, and what percentage of unemployment insurance and 
other social systems would it be just for Quebec to take on, 
according to him? Is it not better for all Quebecers and all 
Canadians to work together towards building a better country 
and a better province?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague for 
his remarks. If I was not clear enough, let me add a couple of 
words to make myself perfectly clear this time.
<P>
	My message to the Minister of Finance is as follows. First, he 
must not target those members of our society who are having the 
worst possible time right now, I mean the unemployed actively 
looking for a job; and the majority, the vast majority of them are 
actively looking for a job.
<P>
	Second, he must not target the people on welfare, through cuts 
to the Canada Assistance Plan, and other transfer and 
equalization payments aimed at improving the fiscal situation of 
the provinces.
<P>
	Also, I ask him not to cut those transfer payments to the 
provinces, as a whole, since, in the end, there is only one 
taxpayer.
<P>
	Furthermore, I am ask him to spare those who have been 
paying taxes, carrying an ever increasing burden since 1984, and 
who are fed up; I mean the middle-income earners. That is 
essentially the first message I wanted to convey.
<P>
	The second one is that he should tackle the real problems, the 
tax loopholes. I mentioned a whole series of them, I could have 
added more to the list; in fact, there are many studies, albeit 
incomplete, to back me up. The studies are there but the extent 
of the problem regarding tax loopholes, especially family trusts, 
is not fully known.
<P>
	It has been said, and this is not out of line, that a minimum of 
$350 million is involved here. It might require the House to 
unanimously give the Auditor General a mandate, well within 
his authority, to conduct an in-depth study of tax havens, family 
trusts and the like. That would be the only way. That study 
should be an integral part of the proceedings of the ad hoc 
parliamentary committee the Minister of Finance has  been 
asked to set up. He would then combine that study with the 
Auditor General's report and the committee's democratic 
proceedings. That is the first part of my message.
<P>
	The second one, Mr. Speaker, is that the ball-I am referring 
to sovereignty versus federalism-the ball is going to be in my 
colleague's court and in his federalist colleagues'court, during 
the next provincial election, but most of all, during the ensuing 
referendum debate. In the last five years, there has been no 
proof, on the contrary, that the system can be changed to respond 
to Quebec's aspirations.
<P>
	So, I will ask my colleague to conserve his energy because in 
the upcoming debate he will need all of it to demonstrate that the 
system can meet Quebec's expectations and that it can foster 
economic development and take up the many challenges we face 
in a global economy.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to 
be here and to congratulate you on your appointment. I am 
delighted to be taking part in this debate today with my first 
speech, while not my maiden speech, in this Parliament. May I 
also say that the view is different from this side of the House. I 
want to take this opportunity to thank the people of Halifax for 
letting me have this view. It is one which I hope to keep well into 
the future.
<P>
<B>(1235 ) </B>
<P>
	The election that we all came through last fall was a landmark 
in more ways than one for the people of Canada. Our country had 
been in difficulty and remains challenged by numerous 
problems for its people and for its government. There was a 
resounding message sent by the people of Canada to this place, 
to its members, to the government and to all of us. That is that 
the overwhelming concern of Canadians is the concern for jobs.
<P>
	I remember hearing a commentator once talking about the 
way citizens watch the news. They watch the news and ask if it 
affects them, their family, their neighbourhood, their city, their 
province, and their country.
<P>
	If the answer is no to all of those, then the next thing is how 
much entertainment value is there in the item.
<P>
	The late great speaker of the American House of 
Representatives, `Tip' O'Neil, said it very well when he said 
that all politics are local. The most local of those issues for 
Canadians is the question of a job, job security and providing for 
their families.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="700"> 700 </A></B>
<P>
	I am delighted to be on this side of the House, led by the 
Prime Minister, the Minister of Finance and other members of 
the cabinet who have put the highest priority on job creation 
and economic growth.
<P>
	It is time that the compassionate side, the understanding side 
of government was foremost in the eyes of Canadians. It is time 
that the people of this country know that those people they have 
put in positions of power are determined to see that life 
improves, that this country, the most favoured one on earth, 
lives up to its potential and ensures for each of its citizens the 
kind of life that our birthright should be giving to us.
<P>
	I look at the specific programs that were promised in our 
much vaunted red book and again I am reassured because we are 
keeping our promises. As members of Parliament, as the 
governing party, as all members of this House, whether in Her 
Majesty's Loyal Opposition or on the government side or sitting 
as independents, we know that the people of this country have 
said to us that there is much to be proven.
<P>
	Those of us who were fortunate enough to receive a second or 
in some cases a third or a fourth election from our own electors 
cannot rest on our laurels because we too have much to prove to 
the people of this country. It is absolutely essential that the 
question of trust be restored between those of us who sit in this 
chamber and the people who put us here. It is absolutely 
essential that the profession to which each one of us belongs, the 
profession of politics, be allowed to earn back some of the much 
lost lustre that we saw go down the drain over the past number of 
years.
<P>
	I believe that this can be accomplished, not easily, not 
quickly, not overnight, but it can be accomplished.
<P>
	I am delighted, for example, that the infrastructure project 
that was much talked about during the campaign is underway 
and beginning in all parts of this country. I am further delighted 
that programs such as the residential rehabilitation assistance 
program and the youth service corps will be initiated to create 
jobs and to restore perhaps the most important element, the 
element of hope for Canadians of all ages.
<P>
<B>(1240 ) </B>
<P>
	We know what the job is before us. We know that we must 
invest in Canada's businesses. We must work with small and 
medium sized businesses which are certainly in my much 
beleaguered region of the Atlantic the backbone of the economy.
<P>
	For five years on the other side I railed at a government that 
did not listen and seemed to have a search and destroy policy 
with regard to the Atlantic. Atlantic Canada does not deserve to 
be the stepchild of Confederation nor will it remain so under the 
policies of this government.
<P>
	Small business is the way to go in Atlantic Canada. The 
infrastructure projects that are being worked on there right now 
will be the jump start. In the long term it will absolutely be the 
change in policy toward small business, the unfettering of small 
business that will bring us into our proper place.
<P>
	I have said for five years and I hope for a further five years I 
will say we do not like to come cap in hand. We are a very proud 
region. We are a region that has sent to other parts of this country 
educators, lawyers, politicians, community activists, bankers, 
you name it. We will continue to do so.
<P>
	Governments must understand that those of us who come 
from the Atlantic region are really disjointed and cut off if we 
have to stay somewhere else for too long. We live in a very 
special part of the country. It is a part of country that we want 
our children to be able to inherit from us and to be able to make 
their place in the greater Canadian society.
<P>
	We are very fond of our brothers and sisters in central, 
western and northern Canada. We like to visit. We like them to 
visit us. However we do not want to see the four small provinces 
clinging to the Atlantic Ocean become have not provinces but 
provinces that stand as equals in Confederation.
<P>
	We believe that this will happen because of the policies 
outlined in the red book. We believe that this will happen 
because of the commitment of the Prime Minister. We believe 
that this will happen most definitely because of the 
determination of the people of those four provinces.
<P>
	The federal government understands full well its 
responsibility to the people of this region and indeed to the 
people across the country. It is important that we keep the 
promises we made and we will do so. It is even more important 
that the country as a whole sees the results of these promises in 
the programs that the federal government will put forward.
<P>
	It is important, for example, that the Canadian government 
provide capital to attract high tech business such as the Red 
Cross blood fractionation facility scheduled to be built in 
Halifax. This facility alone will create up to 400 permanent high 
tech jobs and $11 billion in economic spinoffs in the 
metropolitan area and the province of Nova Scotia.
<P>
	This would be an amazing project for almost any centre in the 
country. In Atlantic Canada, it is the kind of thing that we have 
been seeking and attempting to attract for a long time. I must 
compliment the provincial government in Nova Scotia, most 
particularly the minister of development, for the work done to 
bring that plant to the metropolitan area.
<P>
	Our government also must take advantage of the fact that 
Canada is a trading nation. Jobs and prosperity depend on our 
ability to sell products abroad.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="701"> 701 </A></B>
<P>
	On that note I speak again of the city of Halifax and the great 
port of Halifax which, until last week, was the largest ice free 
port in the world. We had a little bit of ice last week. No doubt 
it was the cold air coming from central Canada. It was a great 
shock for Haligonians to wake up and see icebreakers working 
in their harbour. Tied up in the harbour and sailing in and out 
is one thing but having to break the ice in our harbour is a great 
shock to our systems. We hope that it will not happen again. 
Unfortunately, I do not believe there is anyone in this Chamber 
that can actually control that.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It is questionable.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Yes, it is questionable.
<P>
	The port of Halifax is perhaps the greatest single asset in the 
industrial sense in the province of Nova Scotia. I can go back to 
the quotations of the days of wooden ships and if you will pardon 
my paraphrase or my editing, Mr. Speaker, wooden ships and 
iron persons. In the province of Nova Scotia, our port is again 
ready to be a major player in the industrial development of 
Canada, in particular with regard to our enhanced trading 
capacities.
<P>
	We have frequently been accused of seeing only in Atlantic 
Canada the north-south aspects but we also see the east-west. 
The port and the transportation links out of the port of Halifax 
can be of tremendous benefit to all Canadians. We in the port of 
Halifax invite hon. members who sit in this Chamber to come to 
see the facilities we have and to see what a tremendous asset this 
is and can be to the people of Canada.
<P>
	Along with our developments in business, trade and job 
creation we also have to ensure, as I said earlier, that Canada 
remains the compassionate country the rest of the world 
believes us to be.
<P>
	I compliment the Minister of Human Resources Development 
on his announcement yesterday and on the initiative that he will 
take to ensure that compassion and common sense remain the 
keystones and the key notes of a Liberal government.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to take part in 
this debate and I look forward to further debates in this House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to assure the hon. member that the view from this side of 
the House has improved considerably as well. Although I am 
new here, I think that is probably the case.
<P>
	I spent some of the best years of my life, from 17 to 20 years 
of age, in the maritimes. I wonder if the member could think 
back to what caused the diminution of the prospects of the 
maritimes in the first place. After all, the first settlements in 
Canada took place in Nova Scotia in Annapolis Royal and the 
Bay of Fundy. What happened in the maritimes to cause the 
diminution of the prospects in the first place?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Edmonton 
Southwest for his question. Actually when I heard the direction 
of the question I was thinking that as a child growing up in a very 
political household I heard the answer to that question a lot.
<P>
	Let me begin by saying that maritimers are very committed 
Canadians. Indeed we have been tried. That is why it can be said 
we are passionately committed to this country, to its future and 
to its prospering.
<P>
	There are many things. First, the sort of downhill slide did 
begin at Confederation because of the emphasis on east-west as 
opposed to north-south. We always had close ties to New 
England, to the Caribbean. To a great extent until probably the 
first war that continued.
<P>
	There were questions-heaven forbid that I should bring this 
up-about buying Alberta oil. Nobody would buy Cape Breton 
coal nor could our apples be shipped to Ontario. There were a 
number of questions with regard to trade within the country, 
questions that still remain to be answered. I hope, as all of us in 
Atlantic Canada hope, they will be answered over the next term 
by this government.
<P>
	The other thing was migration. No question. We have been 
staffing the universities, courts and the public services of the 
other nine provinces for a long time. While people come back 
they tend not to come back until their careers are over. That has 
been a problem as well.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	Mainly the major problem has been a lack of an industrial 
policy that truly fits the Atlantic region. It is my belief that the 
emphasis on small business as mentioned in the red book and as 
the hon. Minister of Finance has been talking about in his 
pre-budgetary consultations are the kinds of policies and 
programs that will flow from the ideas that will specifically 
assist Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	We do not have the population or I suppose to a degree the 
inclination for megaprojects. Megaprojects were tried. 
Everyone who lives in Nova Scotia can tell horror stories about 
Clairtone, heavy water and that sort of thing.
<P>
	However we do have both the inclination and the ability to 
succeed in small business. If small business is given its head, as 
I think it will be by this government, then we will see a new 
prosperity in Atlantic Canada in which a number of my 
colleagues are looking forward to taking part. We invite the hon. 
member and you, Mr. Speaker, to visit us at any time because of 
course one of the most successful small businesses in Atlantic 
Canada is tourism.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="702"> 702 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian Murray (Lanark-Carleton):</B> Mr. Speaker, may I 
first congratulate you on your appointment. This is also my first 
opportunity in the House of Commons to thank the people of 
Lanark-Carleton for putting their trust in me as their member 
of Parliament.
<P>
	I want to thank the Minister of Finance for convening this 
special pre-budget debate. This is a worthwhile extension of the 
cross-country consultations the minister has held during the 
past 10 days.
<P>
	The most important consultation with the people of Canada 
took place late last year when each of us during an intensive 
47-day election campaign heard first hand from Canadians how 
they felt about their country and their governments.
<P>
	The economy of my riding which is just west of Ottawa 
includes small businesses, farms, manufacturers and the centre 
of Canada's high technology industry. The people of 
Lanark-Carleton have felt the full impact of the recession and 
the realignment of international trade. I have been impressed by 
the tenacity and the resilience demonstrated by many small 
business owners.
<P>
	I am sure all hon. members listened during the election 
campaign to countless individual examples of economic 
hardship, personal bankruptcies, jobs lost or families squeezed 
by ever-increasing taxes demanded by every level of 
government.
<P>
	On October 25 Canadians voted for change. They demanded a 
change from a system that fostered dependency to one that 
rewarded initiative; a change from a climate of worry to a 
climate of hope; and, a change from a system of privilege to a 
system of fairness.
<P>
	When the first budget of this government is presented it will 
be judged by the men and women of Lanark-Carleton on how 
we live up to our commitment to change. There is no shortage of 
ideas available to the minister as he prepares the budget. There 
are only difficult choices. Therefore we need a set of principles 
to guide us as we make those choices. In particular, we need to 
reward individual initiatives and those who create jobs for other 
Canadians. We must be fair. We must agree that taxes are too 
high. People have said ``enough''.
<P>
	In the short time I have today I want to mention a few specific 
items. Whether we like it or not each federal budget influences 
the behaviour of Canadians. There will always be trade-offs but 
the issues of fairness as perceived by taxpayers must be 
addressed. Though we try to make the tax system neutral society 
is too complex for the tax system to accommodate all of our 
differences.
<P>
	Personal taxation has been based on the traditional family 
unit. We must come to grips with the realities of change in the 
family unit, whether it be single parents, working couples or 
stay-at-home dads. Like many Canadians, I am wrestling with 
how we can make the system fairer by allowing for these 
differences.
<P>
	Several residents of Lanark-Carleton have suggested we 
look at the income of the family unit as a whole. There is a sense 
that families which decide to have one parent remain at home 
while raising children are penalized by the tax system. One 
suggestion which I personally support would allow income 
splitting between spouses while they have dependent children.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	I have also heard from many people who are very concerned 
that the budget may target RRSP contributions. It is easy to 
portray this tax expenditure as a benefit for the rich. However 
for many self-employed people and others who do not have the 
security of a company or government pension plan RRSPs 
represent their best opportunity to save for their retirement.
<P>
	The government should also continue to encourage people to 
take personal responsibility for their future.
<P>
	During the election campaign all parties spoke of the 
importance of small business to our economy. In fact we are 
looking to small business to be the primary engine for economic 
growth and job creation in Canada.
<P>
	If it is the role of government to create an environment to 
stimulate private enterprise what can we do to show 
entrepreneurs that we mean business? We must allow them to 
operate free from the growing burden of taxation, required 
contributions and paperwork they now face. Our priority should 
be to make it easier for them to hire new employees. 
Government must change its attitude and realize that the vast 
majority of business people are honest, law-abiding citizens 
who do not need bureaucrats and government auditors looking 
over their shoulders.
<P>
	Let us address the question of financing for small business 
through the innovative use of the tax system. Just as we should 
encourage those who create jobs we should use the tax system 
aggressively to reward individuals who invest in Canadian 
start-up companies.
<P>
	For example, the real problem we face as we move further into 
the information age is how to finance small software companies 
with few if any capital assets. Their main asset is brain power. 
Though a high percentage of new high-tech companies fail, 
those which succeed more than compensate for that risk. This 
has been proven many times in my riding. The well-known 
success stories inevitably spin off new companies. This may be 
an opportunity to put the capital gains tax exemption to good use 
by rewarding risk takers. Low risk investments do not need 
support from other taxpayers.
<P>
	Business associations have been saying for years that 
government handouts to large businesses should end. Let us take 
those groups at their word and channel money from existing 
grant programs toward funding tax incentives for job creation. 
Grants would remain available to small businesses as their more 
stringent cash-flow requirements make it difficult for them to 
take advantage of tax incentives.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="703"> 703 </A></B>
<P>
	One government-funded program that has received far too 
little credit comes under the community futures program of the 
Department of Human Resources Development. Local business 
development centres provide loans as well as technical advice 
to new or existing companies.
<P>
	Over the past six years the Business Development Centre in 
Lanark-Carleton has been responsible for the creation of 
several hundred jobs at little cost to the taxpayer. As we look for 
expenditures to cut I hope ministers will recognize the 
importance of maintaining this community based program.
<P>
	The first budget of this new government is only one step along 
the road toward renewed prosperity and job creation. The 
coming months will see the development of complementary 
programs that were outlined in the Liberal election platform 
``Creating Opportunity''.
<P>
	As a responsible and caring government we must never lose 
sight of Canadians who are the casualties of global economic 
forces. As Canadians we are in this together. We do need to 
ensure that scarce financial resources are directed where they 
will be most effective.
<P>
	I wish the Minister of Finance well as he and his colleagues 
continue to work on dismantling interprovincial trade barriers 
and the sooner the better.
<P>
	I also believe we should keep in mind that real job creation 
comes from the creation of wealth, not its redistribution. The 
minister is faced with making exceedingly difficult choices in 
the certain knowledge that he will not please everyone.
<P>
	The people of Lanark-Carleton will be looking for a budget 
that rewards initiative, inspires hope and restores a sense of 
fairness in the way that government operates.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my intervention is more to my hon. colleague by way of an 
observation than a question. As I listened to my colleague's 
presentation I was struck by the common sense embedded in 
virtually everything that I heard. I want him to know that there 
are some very strong parallels on both sides of this House.
<P>
	If the hon. member could in a couple of minutes expand on the 
notion of income splitting for families.
<P>
<B>(1300 ) </B>
<P>
	This is a question that has come up time and time again, the 
inequities in our tax system between working parents where two 
parents are working and where the sacrifice is made with a stay 
at home family.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Murray:</B> Mr. Speaker, this has been of particular interest 
to me personally over the years. I have not pursued it primarily 
for the reason that in my previous job I enjoyed a high income 
and it was always my sense that if someone talked about the 
problems that high income earners face with the tax system they 
should be dismissed as perhaps those who do not deserve to be 
complaining.
<P>
	However, when one looks at the burden of taxes on upper and 
middle income earners and if we consider that a family could be 
five or six people getting by on the income of one person one 
starts to realize that there is quite a bit of unfairness embedded 
in the tax system.
<P>
	I really had my suspicions confirmed during the election 
campaign when I would go door to door. During the daytime I 
would meet women who were at home raising their children and 
very much feeling the pinch from high taxes.
<P>
	It is only fair that the government make this change partly to 
recognize that people who do stay home to look after their 
children are providing a real benefit to society. Most of us would 
agree that it is in the interest of the children and the interest of 
society if they are able to be raised by their parents.
<P>
	I have not looked into the intricacies of such a change. I am 
sure it has been suggested in the past. I am sure the Department 
of Finance must have looked at this as an option. It is one that I 
intend to explore in the coming days. I thank the hon. member 
for his comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
as an economist I know most of the jokes about my profession. If 
you laid all of us end to end there would be no agreement. We 
never seem to hold the same opinion on anything.
<P>
	Given the reputation it is amazing, however, how much 
agreement there was among the 42 economists whom the hon. 
Minister of Finance had assembled for some pre-budget advice 
in the middle of December. Of the 42 about 36 agreed on a 
number of points that I think are important to recall on the 
occasion of this House debate.
<P>
	First, the budget deficit has three highly undesirable 
consequences that make lowering it one of the most important 
tasks facing this Parliament. Other speakers in this debate have 
presented or will present projections of recent trends and I will 
not repeat them here. Suffice it to note that since I started 
speaking about a minute ago the federal debt has increased by 
another $75,000.
<P>
	One of the points made by the economy experts was that 
continuing deficits threaten the viability of our social programs. 
Under some reasonable assumptions by the fiscal year 2000 the 
interest on the then existing debt will take up 50 per cent of total 
government revenues as compared with the 31 per cent it will in 
1993 and only 21 per cent it did in 1983.
<P>
	As the hon. members of this House know, program spending 
has already been cut so much that future cuts will result in 
serious inefficiencies and public resentment. Therefore if the 
deficits continue, required increases in interest payments will 
have to come at the expense of social programs. It is precisely 
because of this threat to social programs that Reform continues 
to put so much emphasis on the need to eliminate the deficit.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="704"> 704 </A></B>
<P>
	The experts also noted that deficits raise the interest rate and 
therefore lower investment, economic growth and home 
construction. These effects are due to the fact that every year 
there is only a limited amount of savings generated by the 
economy. Lenders who use their money to buy government 
bonds cannot lend it to firms that want to build factories or to 
Canadians who want a mortgage to buy homes.
<P>
<B>(1305 ) </B>
<P>
	Future generations of Canadians will be hit by a double 
whammy: lower capital stocks and productivity, as well as tax 
burdens to pay the interest on the debt.
<P>
	One of the most serious concerns expressed by the experts 
was that continuing deficits raise the probability of a financial 
crisis. We have all heard about the problems which face New 
Zealand, Sweden, Britain and Italy when international investors 
lost confidence in the ability of their governments to restrain 
deficits.
<P>
	No one can predict what might set off such a crisis in Canada. 
The Minister of Finance's economic experts were almost 
unanimous in their judgment that the probability of such an 
event is increased the longer the deficit persists.
<P>
	The second major point on which there was overwhelming 
agreement among the economic experts was that it will be 
impossible to eliminate the deficit without substantial spending 
cuts. An economic recovery cannot generate enough revenue to 
reduce a deficit to 3 per cent of GDP, no less eliminate it. The 
rate of economic growth required to achieve this goal simply is 
without historic precedent and virtually unachievable.
<P>
	At the same time, it is clear that the deficit cannot be 
eliminated by higher taxation, either through higher rates or a 
broadening of the base. Any such attempt would further 
stimulate the growth of the underground economy or tax evasion 
and therefore is unlikely to raise sufficient revenue.
<P>
	The third point of major agreement among the experts was 
that the deficit could not be eliminated by inflation. Until the 
1970s, perhaps inflation could be used to depreciate the real 
value of government debt. However, in today's world of 
integrated and highly sophisticated capital markets neither 
national and especially not international lenders will buy 
Canadian bonds whose purchasing power is depreciated by 
inflation unless they are compensated by a corresponding 
increase in the interest rate.
<P>
	It is easy to see what the public demand for such higher 
interest rates will do to the size of the deficit. Every one 
percentage point increase in the interest rate quickly translates 
into an increase of $5 billion in debt payments and therefore the 
deficit.
<P>
	For this reason I hope that Gordon Thiessen, the new 
Governor of the Bank of Canada, will continue to pursue price 
stability in the tradition established by his predecessor, John 
Crow.
<P>
	I should further note here that inflation also cannot be used to 
decrease unemployment and raise economic growth. The idea 
that this is possible represents a theory that was found invalid as 
a result of the experiences of the 1970s and later in Canada and 
elsewhere.
<P>
	As the last point in my contribution today I would like to note 
that the economic experts assembled by the Minister of Finance 
offered a wide range of suggestions for spending cuts. However, 
none had so many supporters in principle as did the suggestion 
that spending cuts should be achieved through the so-called 
restructuring of social programs. To the best of my memory, 
only Michael Walker of the Fraser Institute elaborated on the 
term restructuring. Mr. Walker's suggestion was based, much 
like that of the Reform Party during the election campaign, on 
the realisation that vast amounts of government transfers go to 
families with high incomes.
<P>
	Without further elaboration let me just note here that in 1992 
families in the upper decile with incomes over $100,000 per 
year received $2.5 billion and $1.5 billion in UIC and old age 
security benefits, respectively. Similar large amounts were 
received by families with high incomes by any other standard.
<P>
	From these facts follows a clear and precise definition of 
restructuring of social programs. It means the elimination of 
transfers to those who do not need them. Would the hon. 
members of this House please note this important point that 
needs repeating. In the Reform lexicon, restructuring of social 
programs does not mean reduction to payments to the poor. It 
means eliminating payments to those families that by a wide 
consensus do not need them.
<P>
<B>(1310 ) </B>
<P>
	During my election campaign the vast majority of high 
income earners I met expressed their willingness to forego their 
receipt of these benefits if other Canadians made similar 
sacrifices to balance the budget.
<P>
	In summary, I remind the members of this House that finance 
minister's economic experts urge the government to take prompt 
action in eliminating the deficit with spending cuts, not tax 
increases or inflation, and that the spending cuts be achieved 
predominantly through a restructuring of social programs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
just a couple of comments to make on some of the things the hon. 
member had to say.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="705"> 705 </A></B>
<P>
	It is appropriate that the member pointed out in part of his 
speech the role that interest rates play in increasing the deficit. 
He was counselling against the strategy of higher interest rates 
because it would have the effect on the deficit that he pointed 
out. However, I think it would be useful not just to apply that 
insight in terms of how not to deal with the deficit now, but 
also how the deficit was created in the first place.
<P>
	Much of the deficit that we have before us today was created 
not by the social spending that the Reform Party wants to 
criticize, but by the high interest rate years in the early eighties. 
I think that is one of the holes, if you like, in the Reform 
analysis.
<P>
	We cannot go back and change those interest rates. We cannot 
go back and eliminate the debt that was created by those interest 
rates. I realize that, but there is a kind of implicit blaming of 
social spending for the deficit when studies have shown, 
particularly a Statistics Canada study, that it was the high 
interest rates in combination with tax expenditures that were 
largely responsible for the deficit and not social spending.
<P>
	The member's argument would be much more credible if that 
were at least acknowledged. It may be that there might be some 
restructuring of social programs in order, but I do not agree with 
the member that the way to do it is to eliminate universality. If 
high income Canadians who are receiving these benefits are so 
willing to contribute to the deficit then why can we not do that, if 
they are that willing, through a more progressive income tax 
system whereby they would pay for these universal programs 
they receive through the income tax system?
<P>
	What would be the member's objection to that? Why do we 
have to accept that the only way that high income Canadians can 
do this is by foregoing these certain benefits and paying for them 
item for item instead of accepting that for once we could have a 
fair tax system in this country and high income earners could 
pay the share that they have paid less and less of in the last nine 
years thanks to the tax reforms of the Conservative government?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the rhetoric that I 
received from the distinguished member who just spoke.
<P>
	The Governor of the Bank of Canada did not very happily 
raise the interest rate. He was forced into raising the interest rate 
because of developments in the world and because of pending 
inflation.
<P>
	There is simply no way in which a government or a private 
corporation can sell its obligations in an environment of 
inflation and charge a low interest rate. It is now a well 
established fact among those who are economically literate that 
if we have inflation we will have high interest rates, otherwise 
nobody will lend money.
<P>
	I think we should see the episode of high interest rates in the 
early 1980s as part of that process.
<P>
	I would like to respond to the member's notion that high 
marginal tax rates would be an equitable thing to do and that 
there is no distinction between taking back or not paying out in 
the first place social program spending transfers. High marginal 
tax rates throughout the world have been shown to generate 
disincentives which feed back on the welfare of the entire 
society. That is why universally throughout the world high 
marginal tax rates were removed. In fact, in many countries 
when the marginal tax rates were lowered total revenue was 
increased because effort and attempts to hide income 
disappeared.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	When I asked a student who came to me the other day what he 
would do after he graduated, he said: ``I will move to the tax 
haven, Seattle''. This is what our distinguished member will 
have to remember, unless he is prepared to close the borders 
from Canada, if he imposes very high marginal tax rates on 
Canadian citizens. They, especially those who are productive, 
original and entrepreneurial, will go to where they do not have to 
pay these high taxes. One might say good riddance, but I can tell 
the hon. member it will not be in the interests of Canadians that 
these young entrepreneurs, the originators of small business 
stimulation, the innovators will go to where the tax rates are 
lower.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the other day the Prime Minister suggested in Question Period 
that each member present had a bill of about $3 million for his or 
her part of the overhead. I hope the Prime Minister pays close 
attention because I am just about to pay mine off as my 
contribution to this debate.
<P>
	This really is the speech I was elected to give. This is why I 
got into politics in the first place. I hope that over the next 
couple of years I will be able to make a continuing contribution 
through the caucus and through the House to our national debate 
on the economy. I want to thank the government very much for 
making this possible so early in this 35th Parliament. It is going 
to be an evolutionary process as we go from this budget to the 
next budget.
<P>
	I am one of those real live entrepreneurs that one hears so 
many people talking about. I went to Edmonton in 1975 with 
absolutely nothing. I was living in a basement apartment at my 
sister's. I was paying maintenance to my ex-wife who lived in 
Vancouver.
<P>
	I started with absolutely nothing and built a business that 20 
years later at its peak does about $7.5 million a year with 130 
employees. Today, this very day, I am proud to tell everyone that 
our employees are one-third share owners in the company. As of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="706"> 706 </A></B>
<P>
today, the ink is dry and we have gone one-third to our 
employees, one-third  to me and one-third to my partner. I am 
very proud of that.
<P>
	Over these 19 or so years that we have been in business I am 
embarrassed to say that we have been the recipients of one grant 
from the government. We got $16,000 through western 
diversification. I am in the photo finishing business. I think 
somehow the $16,000 grant from the federal government came 
from the Western Grain Transportation Act. Figure that one out. 
How did my photo finishing business end up getting about 
$16,000 from the Western Grain Transportation Act through 
western diversification?
<P>
	The real question here is that we qualified for the grant 
because a person came knocking on our door and asked: ``Are 
you doing any expansion? If you are, I can get money from the 
federal government for you. You do not have to do a thing. All 
you have to do is open your books. I will go through them and I 
get 25 per cent of anything you can get''. I thought long and hard 
about this because we had gotten this far without a nickel from 
the government and would it not be nice to get everywhere 
without a nickel. But then I thought that we were paying the 
taxes and if we did not take advantage of these bonehead 
programs our competitors would, leaving us at a disadvantage. 
Therefore we did.
<P>
	We received that particular grant because we were getting 
involved in another aspect of the business. Our investment was 
$300,000. Does anyone in this House reasonably think that any 
business person would make a business decision of whether or 
not they should make an investment of $300,000 because they 
can get $16,000 from the government? Absolutely not. And any 
business person who would, should probably not be in business 
in the first place.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	Over Christmas I was having coffee with one of our 
employees in the lunchroom. I said: ``Joan, if you have a word to 
say, here is a chance to say it. What would you like me to say?'' 
She replied: ``Tell them to stop having the government take 
money from me to give it to somebody else. I am barely getting 
by on $10 an hour. Tell them I am sick and tired of the 
government and other people wasting my hard-earned money''.
<P>
	When was the magical mystical moment that we as members 
of this government or elected members of any order of 
government suddenly went through a magic laying on of hands 
and became venture capitalists? It did not happen. We as 
government take a dollar in taxes from business or individuals. 
We take it into government, we chew it up and spit it out as 20 
cents. We give that 20 cents to someone else to go into 
competition with the very people who gave us the dollar in the 
first place. It just does not make any sense.
<P>
	One can see in any newspaper the government grants and 
government loans, government money for nothing. There are 
over 600 grants through the various government agencies that 
people can get. Peat Marwick Thorne has a book on how to get 
money out of the government. Large businesses have people on 
staff that do nothing but get money from government.
<P>
	If we had a Klondike today it would not be out west or in the 
north. It would be right here in Ottawa where there are people 
mining for gold whose business it is to get money out of the 
government. Well that money people get is money which is 
earned by individual taxpayers, $10 and $20 at a time and we 
have to think about it in that context.
<P>
	It must have been over 20 years ago that an hon. member of 
Parliament coined the phrase of corporate welfare bums. Well it 
has not changed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Blaikie:</B> David Lewis.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> That is right. It was David Lewis. It has not 
changed. It is not the role of the federal government or any 
government to take from individuals and decide who are going 
to be the economic winners and losers in society. That is the role 
of private entrepreneurs.
<P>
	We would go a long way in reducing this tax burden on 
Canadians if we were to stop this insane practice of government 
grants and handouts to business. If a business does not have what 
it takes to run on its own, it should not be in business in the first 
place. If a business has to have money from the government to 
be established you can bet it is going to have to have money from 
the government to continue.
<P>
	The government's role then in business, at least in my 
opinion, is to have an infrastructure program that allows for 
consistent high quality education in the country so that we have 
a resource pool of people to get into business. Roads, sewers and 
other infrastructure, consistency from orders of government and 
environmental standards, that sort of thing. But most of all there 
should be a tax environment that rewards investment and 
entrepreneurial risk by allowing those who actually do 
something to keep some it.
<P>
	A final and important point is that we should elevate the status 
of innovators and entrepreneurs in our society to a level 
commensurate with the commitment in what entrepreneurs, 
investors and risk takers actually give to our society.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by 
congratulating the member on his address. Having come from an 
entrepreneurial background myself I share many of his feelings 
and views.
<P>
	However there is something I have learned over the last four 
or five years about government grants, or government handouts 
to use the hon. member's expression. I have learned that the 
largest number of  grants given to corporations, whether they be 
small, medium or large, through the Government of Canada do 
not come from the various line departments whether it is 
industry or western diversification as the member cited. In fact 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="707"> 707 </A></B>
<P>
the real grants that are given to corporations are buried in the 
Tax Act of Canada, that 15,000 pages of rules and regulations, 
all those special preferences. Of course those preferences which 
have been put into that act over a number of years by Liberal and 
Conservative governments, many of them no longer meet their 
original policy objectives.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	Would the hon. member be willing to take the same passionate 
view about eliminating those tax grants as he does on the direct 
handouts?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker, I definitely would. As a 
matter of fact the faster we can get to a flat tax system the 
happier I will be. This whole notion of write offs for this, write 
offs for that, you have to be a Philadelphia lawyer, you have to 
have 14 tax accountants to figure out where Tuesday was, is 
absolutely insane.
<P>
	We will have a revolt but the revolt will be all the tax lawyers 
and tax accountants who will be looking for work if we only 
simplified it and made it fair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
know that what the member just said is music to the ears of the 
member for Broadview-Greenwood, except he did not actually 
come out and say that he was in favour of a single tax-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> I was waiting for you 
to do it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Blaikie:</B> -and the member will still wait awhile before 
he hears me say it, although I would have to say that the point 
made about the complexity of the tax system and the way in 
which what is supposed to be a progressive tax system turns out 
to be a non-progressive tax system because the higher up the 
income bracket you are, the more you are able to hire people to 
figure out how not to pay taxes is a point that is well taken. That 
is why I continue to be open to the member's proposal, if not 
convinced at this point.
<P>
	I just want to say to the member, I was going to bring up David 
Lewis if he had not. He could not remember the name, so I had to 
help him along. David Lewis, former leader of the NDP in this 
Parliament was the one who coined the phrase of corporate 
welfare bums and I am glad to hear a Reform Party member 
talking about that.
<P>
	I know there was some talk of that in the Reform Party 
platform, but their tendency has been to concentrate and to have 
Canadians concentrate on what people at the lower end of the 
income scale are allegedly getting for nothing in the form of 
welfare, social programs or whatever. I think the distinction that 
exists between certain groups in the House is that I find the 
welfare that exists at the top of the system much more offensive.
<P>
	If there is a single mother on welfare getting more than she 
should, maybe that should be corrected, but that does not drive 
me wild. What drives me wild are the tax expenditures that are 
claimed and created by government and exploited by business 
which sees many large profitable corporations in this country 
paying absolutely no taxes at all.
<P>
	I have certainly done my best while I have been here-and I 
think the member will vouch for this-to call attention to that. I 
am glad to hear someone from the Reform Party calling 
attention to that as well. If he is serious about that he is going to 
have to take on some very strong powers and principalities, to 
use a Biblical term, because they have got their claws right into 
the public trough through the tax system.
<P>
	When I was first elected here along with you, Mr. Speaker, in 
1979, the deficit was $14 billion and tax expenditures for that 
year were $32 billion, twice the deficit. We could have paid the 
deficit off and had $18 billion left over if we had been smart 
about tax expenditures. However we have not been and it is time 
that we did get smart about tax expenditures.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be very quick and very 
brief. The essential basis of anything we do as far as taxes are 
concerned or concessions to anybody, business or people, is that 
we have to have a foundation of fairness in everything we do.
<P>
	It must not only be seen to be fair, it has to be fair. That is what 
this great debate is on when we talk about whether or not people 
should have deductibility of a business expense, lunches and 
that sort of thing.
<P>
	What we have to do is to inculcate a sense of fairness in 
everything we do and set a direction and leadership from this 
House so that when people in Canada say: ``Well, we have to 
tighten up our belts and live within our means'', they can look to 
the Parliament of Canada and say: ``Look, they are setting the 
example and that is where the leadership has to come from''.
<P>
<B>(1330 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham):</B> Mr. Speaker, Canada has too 
often taken a shortcut to economic prosperity. We have been 
living on natural resources while neglecting the true revenue 
enhancing areas of secondary manufacturing and technological 
innovation. The branch plant economy is in disarray. Most 
research and development occurs south of our border and has 
crippled our ability to learn from a changing economy and 
environment.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="708"> 708 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to ask my colleagues to ponder this as they drive 
home tonight in their American-built cars and turn on their 
Japanese television sets.
<P>
	We are drowning in a sea of debt. This debt is not only at the 
federal level but involves all levels of government. It is in 
excess of $650 billion. If we include the unfunded portion of the 
Canada pension plan, it is over a trillion dollars. This amounts to 
over $35,000 for every man, woman and child in this country.
<P>
	A change is sweeping the industrialized world, a change that 
discards the old smokestack economy for a new knowledge 
driven society. This is our chance to get our public sector debt 
under control and at the same time get our economy growing. 
The easier and least painful way to solve problems is to have the 
economy grow at a faster rate than government spending; 
indeed, we should reduce government spending and at the same 
time get our economy growing.
<P>
	This is our chance to regain control of our economy and our 
country for all Canadians, a chance to make the 21st century 
truly Canada's century.
<P>
	I will be using two terms in my presentation; one is 
investment and the other is consumption. I take a rather wide 
ranging view of the term investment. It is not only building and 
equipment but also research and development and training and 
education. In a sense, it is an investment in brains. 
Consumption, of course, is the simple consumption of goods and 
services.
<P>
	We must create and foster more investment and considerably 
less consumption in order to get our economic house in order, as 
well as driving our economy on to success as we approach the 
21st century.
<P>
	The two facets of the budget are revenue and expenditure. I 
will touch only briefly on the revenue side and only with respect 
to the concept of investment.
<P>
	The infrastructure spending program is to create investment 
and thus jobs. Similarly the capital gains tax exemptions are 
exemptions in support of private sector investment. So to deny 
these exemptions would be counter productive to stated 
government objectives. Furthermore, capital gains taxes tend to 
be inflationary. Without these exceptions it will be a real 
temptation to government to inflate the economy, and I am sure 
none of us want to see the days of 21 per cent interest rates again.
<P>
	Some will argue that these exemptions are for the rich. I 
would like to point out that the rich most likely have already 
taken full advantage of these deductions. It is only the middle 
class that has been unable to utilize these tax advantages.
<P>
	Specifically I would like to speak in support of the retention 
of the $500,000 exemption for farmers. Most farmers live a 
difficult financial life. The constant requirement for capital 
investment in machinery, equipment and buildings, as well as 
the low return on these investments, puts a constant hole in their 
pockets  leaving them unable to invest in registered retirement 
savings plans, or to save. As a result, most farmers regard the 
farm as a retirement nest egg. So I believe it is very important to 
retain this deduction.
<P>
	I note that had the deduction not been available for 1991 this 
would have only accounted for $235 million. I note that the 
quantum of revenue from this source has also been declining by 
3.3 per cent between 1989 and 1990, and 19 per cent between 
1990 and 1991. So you can see, Mr. Speaker, this is not a very 
significant area of government revenue in any case.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	Having argued in defence of capital gains tax exemptions 
generally, I would like to narrow the focus of this exemption. It 
should be available only in support of small and medium sized 
Canadian owned businesses. It should only revolve around 
trading in small and medium sized shares. I suggest that we 
eliminate the $100,000 general exemption but expand the 
$500,000 exemption now allowed privately held small 
businesses so that this deduction would include minority 
interests in small and medium sized firms.
<P>
	I have other ideas for creating secondary markets in these 
shares so that small and medium sized businesses can get access 
to the capital they need in order for them to create new 
businesses and to modernize older ones. Only in this way can 
they take full advantage of Canada's march to the 21st century.
<P>
	I would also like to mention in passing that the foreign 
component of registered retirement savings plans should be 
eliminated as this deduction is inconsistent with our needs for 
domestic capital formation.
<P>
	I would now like to talk about the expenditure side of the 
budget. This is what appears to the public as the seemingly 
endless sinkhole of taxpayers' dollars. I have here a statement of 
federal government expenditures presented by the Department 
of Finance; old age pensions here, agricultural subsidies there, 
job creations elsewhere, in short no rhyme or reason, no 
statement of government purpose.
<P>
	I come back to my original definition of investment and 
consumption. I propose that the government prepare its 
accounts with a view to these two terms. I have briefly attempted 
to do this. This has been made very difficult for me since no 
department of government seems to think in this terminology. In 
any case I have roughly calculated that less than 20 per cent of 
spending revolves around investment and that the rest of 
expenditure is in support of consumption.
<P>
	It seems to me that the government's approach to deficit 
reduction must have two objectives with respect to consumption 
spending. First we need to define the core area of consumption 
spending. Here I think of the genuine need for old age pensions 
and support for those unable to care for themselves due to 
physical or mental impairment and so forth. The balance must 
then be discretionary consumption spending. The overall  
approach must be a degree of absolute elimination of 
discretion-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="709"> 709 </A></B>
<P>
ary consumption spending, and second, for those who remain a 
conversion to investment spending.
<P>
	What does this mean? It means we can no longer afford simply 
to pay people because they do not have a job. We cannot afford 
to pay mothers a total of half a year's unemployment insurance 
benefits regardless of the merits or wants for this type of 
program. We cannot afford to transfer moneys to the provinces 
that they transfer to the municipalities. In turn they can support 
youth from the ages 15 to 21 so that they can leave the 
responsibilities of family life and be unproductive members of 
society.
<P>
	Of course we will continue to support the concept of 
universality for social services in our medical system but we 
must question whether treating the common cold is an essential 
service.
<P>
	The elimination of services or a degree of them is obvious. 
The conversion from consumption to investment is somewhat 
more complex. It seems clear that if people are not going to be 
engaged in work, they should ultimately be trained or retrained 
in order to regain entry at a higher level than when they left. If 
for some reason this is not possible these people should be 
supported based on the degree of their commitment to undertake 
work directed at the improvements to their communities.
<P>
	I suggest this will encourage the dignity and self-respect that 
all humans are entitled to embrace. This commitment of 
government to upgrade the skills of our labour force will allow 
all of us to participate in the march to prosperity in the 21st 
century.
<P>
	In conclusion the road for Canada is in front of us. It involves 
a change in attitude by government as it approaches investment 
and consumption in government finances. Indeed it embraces a 
change in attitude of all the people in Canada. It recognizes that 
we can no longer drive our consumption spending based on want 
but rather it must be based on genuine need. It must recognize in 
its legislative agenda the need to support investment not only in 
the small and medium sized Canadian owned business sector but 
also in the grey matter of all the people in Canada.
<P>
	The chance to build a greater nation is in front of us. Now is 
the time to take bold steps to claim Canada's destiny.
<P>
<B>(1340 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
congratulate the member on the comments. I presume that he is a 
new member in the House. I believe he has not suffered with 
some of the atherosclerotic disease that seems to be prevalent 
with some aged members in this House.
<P>
	I would like to know from the member if it would be possible 
for him to infuse this fresh enthusiasm into some of those aged 
members.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Shepherd:</B> Mr. Speaker, I accept the hon. member's 
comments. I guess it comes from not being actively involved in 
politics to some extent, although that is not quite true. I had 
some involvement in my early youth here in Ottawa. However, 
being out in the real world trying to make a buck and having to 
meet payrolls, seeing both sides of our economy, people having 
problems as well as people being successful, gives me a good 
perspective on what I think we need as a nation. I will try to 
instil that around here if I can.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton-Peel):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would also 
like to congratulate the hon. member for Durham for injecting a 
very fresh idea into this debate. He and I share something in 
common in that the agricultural parts of our ridings are farms 
that are agriculturally valued very differently than farms in 
other parts of the country.
<P>
	When a farm is passed on and when there is succession right 
now, the paper value of the farm far exceeds its value as a 
working farm. Therefore, it is absolutely essential that the 
$500,000 exemption continue.
<P>
	I am just old enough to remember when death duties existed in 
Ontario and I saw farms being lost to government, farms that 
had been in families for generations.
<P>
	The member talks about cancelling the $100,000 capital gains 
exemption. Does he simply feel that it is too small? Is that his 
reason for wanting to cancel it and dwell on the $500,000 
exemption?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Shepherd:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not think it is unusually 
small. Indeed the finance department's estimates are that this is 
a $650 million loss of revenue had those exemptions not been 
available in the last taxation year 1991, I believe.
<P>
	It is significant, but what we need to do, getting back to the 
government's agenda, is to re-focus on where we want those 
exemptions to exist. Currently I suspect the lion's share of those 
exemptions are in stock trading and investment real estate 
transactions.
<P>
	Basically, our problem today is clearly that the small business 
sector is under siege and one of its biggest problems is capital. I 
would not say the banks of this country are failing the small 
business sector, but their debt type of financing is not what the 
small business sector is looking for. It is looking for equity and 
equity participation and we must spend a considerable amount 
of time to formulate these markets.
<P>
	What I am suggesting is that we have a significant shift in our 
taxation system which recognizes that we need to have the 
underpinnings of the small business investment there and that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="710"> 710 </A></B>
<P>
we expend one. However, as the Minister of Finance has 
mentioned, if we are going to do one thing we have to pay for it 
and the way we are going to  pay for it is to reduce the $100,000 
exemption on other forms of investment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome the remarks of my 
colleague today.
<P>
	There was one part of the member's speech on which I would 
like a short clarification. He mentioned that he did not support 
young people between the ages of 17 and 21, I believe it was, 
getting social assistance. Was the hon. member suggesting that 
he did not want people who are abusing the system to get that 
kind of support? Was he suggesting maybe that those who were 
in genuine need should continue to get that support?
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Shepherd:</B> Mr. Speaker, basically what I was trying to 
say by the whole tenor of my speech was that we have to get back 
to focusing away from pure subsidization of consumption.
<P>
	What I am proposing is that we need some other kinds of 
incentives to our young people rather than just being in receipt 
of consumption income. We should have to earn it somehow. 
Basically one earns that by being engaged in education or by 
pursuing a better career, which are useful aspects to one's 
society, or by being involved in the labour market.
<P>
	In my campaign during the last election I ran into many young 
people who are abusing the system. It is not acceptable. We talk 
about our commitment to youth. We are sending some terrible 
signals to our young people. We are telling them it is acceptable 
to do this. What we have to do is give them encouragement to get 
back into the job market and to give them their dignity and 
self-respect back.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Judy Bethel (Edmonton East):</B> Mr. Speaker, today is 
special for me. It is my first opportunity to address Canada's 
35th Parliament.
<P>
	A good start would be to congratulate you and all members of 
Parliament on their election to the House. I look forward to 
working with everyone and for my constituents. I commit to 
you, Mr. Speaker, that I will do everything I can to make this 
Parliament the most positive and productive one ever.
<P>
	I am proud to represent the riding of Edmonton East. 
Edmonton East is the heart of our city. It includes Edmonton's 
business district and its government centres, the Alberta 
legislature, Edmonton city hall and Canada Place.
<P>
	The Avenue of Nations and the Old Fort Road business and 
revitalization zones are lined with strong and vibrant 
enterprises. Edmonton East includes families living in beautiful 
river valley communities and families struggling to survive on 
little or no wages in inner city communities.
<P>
	Edmonton East is truly a reflection of Canada. People from all 
over this world have come to find a better life for themselves and 
their children. They are willing to work hard and to consider new 
and innovative solutions to the challenges of unemployment, the 
changing economy and our growing social needs.
<P>
	They understand that this budget will have a profound impact 
on them because of the magnitude of changes needed to get our 
financial house in order. They want to be involved. They want to 
be informed. More important, they want to be part of the 
solution.
<P>
	Last Saturday I was an observer, a very active listener at the 
pre-budget conference in Calgary. I heard clearly what western 
Canadians had to say to our Minister of Finance. Their advice 
was sincere, profound, diverse and far reaching. I must say the 
essence of that advice cannot be wrapped up in the simplistic 
headlines of yesterday's newspapers.
<P>
	There was consensus. The deficit must be reduced. There was 
an understanding that the reductions could come from economic 
growth, a more equitable tax base, increased tax rates and 
reduced program expenditures. Participants at the workshops 
had some great advice for the minister to consider in developing 
his budget.
<P>
	I would like to share these suggestions with the House. John 
Howard, Vice President of MacMillan-Bloedel, says to increase 
the clawbacks from high income earners and focus attention on 
where the money goes. Do not base privatization on ideology. It 
needs to be cost effective, fair in process and fair in result. He 
says deregulate. There are too many governments and too many 
interventions especially in environmental matters.
<P>
	Ardyth Cooper from B.C. believes that cuts across the board 
favour the status quo. She says we need instead to restructure 
our programs from the ground up and with vision.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	Doris Ronnenburg from Alberta expressed concerns about 
Pathways, the much needed aboriginal training programs and 
their effectiveness.
<P>
	Hugh Wagner from Saskatchewan suggested government 
should support small business through equity investment in 
venture capital companies rather than regional development 
departments.
<P>
	Vicki Dutton from Alberta wants to see an end to all 
government subsidies to business.
<P>
	Roberta Ellis-Grunfeld's group encourages us to keep 
listening and to invest in human capital. A sense of strategic 
direction is needed and we are to keep in mind that equal is not 
always equitable.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
	Diane Hunter's group believes that programs should be 
measurable, have clear objectives and be cost efficient. Each 
should be co-ordinated and harmonized with other levels of 
government.
<P>
	Jim Gray's group said that there needed to be increased 
confidence and trust in government and more consultation with 
the people.
<P>
	The Auditor General's report should be part of the budget 
process and be dealt with by a parliamentary committee to 
ensure follow up.
<P>
	These are the voices of Alberta and western Canada and they 
do not all sing from the same song sheet.
<P>
	There are some who represent Alberta as cold, hard and 
uncaring. There are some who believe those in need are at fault, 
that they have done something to deserve pain. There are those 
who believe that charity begins at home and stays there. There 
are those who believe that Alberta is full of rednecks, cloned to 
act the same, think the same and be the same. That is the other 
Alberta. That is not my Alberta.
<P>
	My Alberta would balance eliminating the deficit and 
reducing the debt with feeding hungry children and providing 
deserving men and women with real jobs which allow them to 
support their families with pride and with dignity.
<P>
	During the election campaign my office was located deep in 
the inner city on what is less than affectionately known as the 
strip. My campaign team and I saw a way of life that I will never 
forget and which I will represent until my public life ends.
<P>
	I will never lose sight of Virgil. He is an aboriginal child who 
was a great help to our campaign. Late last October he showed 
up wearing ten T-shirts because he had no jacket. I will never 
lose sight of the young men and women who were forced by a 
cycle of abuse and addiction into the degrading life of 
prostitution.
<P>
	I will always represent the steady stream of capable, qualified 
and willing Albertans who cannot find work. These are the 
people who were not at Calgary last weekend. These are the 
people who need to be part of our budget deliberations. I urge the 
members opposite and all members of this House to listen to all 
the voices of Alberta.
<P>
	I am convinced that we can reduce both the fiscal deficit and 
the human deficit.

<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette):</B> Mr. Speaker, while listening this 
morning to the hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe, who 
described the current financial situation of the Canadian 
government, noting how alarming is the national deficit's 
growth and how high is our foreign debt, I came to the 
conclusion that the future of the next generation of Quebecers 
and Canadians was not very promising and that we are going to 
leave a very poor legacy to our children, in fact the worst ever.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	The situation is extremely serious and must be corrected. 
Moreover, in those days of anemic economic recovery, 
taxpayers are under the impression that the federal government 
does not do its share to improve management methods and 
eliminate waste. The Auditor General insists on that aspect in 
his recent report, when he states that, today more than ever, it is 
clear to civil servants and parliamentarians that Canadians 
expect them to manage firmly and cautiously rather than find 
new ways of spending borrowed money.
<P>
	As the Bloc Quebecois said during the election campaign, we 
want a reduction of $10 billion in government spending, 
including tax expenditures, of which $3 billion would come 
from a 25 per cent cut in the Department of National Defence's 
expenditures. Recent information suggests that the Liberals are 
considering reducing government spending by only $2 billion, 
excluding the non-recurrent expenditures incurred last year, 
which amounted to $4 billion. This objective is so low and 
unambitious that the <I>Globe and Mail</I> had this to say in a editorial 
published last January 18:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Liberals are just as complacent about the debt as ever. Either that or they 
sincerely believe that the federal government is 99 per cent fat free.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois and the Official Opposition are of the 
opinion that there is some fat within the federal government. 
One only has to read the newspapers to see that indeed some cuts 
can be made. Just take for example the controversy surrounding 
the new Canadian embassy in China, or the travelling expenses 
of new Liberal ministers.
<P>
	To eliminate waste, unnecessary spending and 
mismanagement in the government administration, I reiterate 
the request made by the Bloc Quebecois for the creation of a 
parliamentary committee which would examine and review 
budgetary expenditures item by item. It would be appropriate to 
set up such a committee. The most recent Auditor General's 
report clearly demonstrates that Quebecers and Canadians are 
right to think that the government is wasting some public funds. 
To illustrate that point, I will use the most shocking examples of 
waste, unnecessary spending and mismanagement of public 
money mentioned by the Auditor General.
<P>
	Let us begin with National Revenue. Because of a flaw in the 
deduction applying to resources, the government lost $1.2 
billion in revenue. If it had, as recommended by the Public 
<P>

<B><A NAME="712"> 712 </A></B>
<P>
Accounts Committee, a system allowing for quick amendments 
to a flawed tax expenditure program,  the government would 
have saved a good chunk of that money.
<P>
	Let us now look at Investment Canada, which spent $132,000 
to set up a new office, with kitchen and bathroom for its new 
chairperson, when in fact the previous incumbent's office in the 
same building already had all these facilities.
<P>
	Let me give you another example. Let us take a look at 
travelling expenses. Travelling expenses linked to the use of the 
government's Challenger aircraft have reached $54 million, 
more than half of which is for trips made by ministers. 
According to the Auditor General, this total amounts to an 
equivalent of $19,650 per hour.
<P>
	Is this the best way to pay for our ministers' and other 
officials' travels? Some say that government airplanes have to 
be used for security purposes. It may be so, but would the price 
of a commercial flight providing special security measures for 
our ministers be over $20,000 an hour? I doubt it very much.
<P>
	Now, let us turn to Fisheries and Oceans. The Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans spent $587 million on the Northern Cod 
Adjustment and Recovery Program. Out of this amount, almost 
$15 million was wasted because of mismanagement, according 
to the auditor general.
<P>
	The department gave compensation to people who were not 
fishing northern cod, but other species not affected by the 
moratorium. Also, payments were made to fishermen who were 
illegally fishing cod. If I can get 20 more seconds, Mr. Speaker, 
it would be easier for me to resume the debate later today.
<P>
	In the meantime, 5,300 people have yet to receive benefits 
they are entitled to, because the department has some 
reservations about their eligibility. These stalling tactics used 
by Fisheries and Oceans Canada are illegal, and we know that all 
of the coastal communities urgently need that money.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It being two o'clock, pursuant to Standing 
Order 30(5), the House will now proceed to statements by 
members, pursuant to Standing Order 31.

	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Peterborough Family Y has just celebrated its 125th 
anniversary. It operates in the oldest continuously used Y 
building in Canada. This gives members a strong kinship with 
the founders of 1868.
<P>
	The YMCA is an example to all Canadians of how to adapt 
without trading in principles and philosophy. One hundred and 
twenty-five years ago you had to be young, male and Christian 
to belong to the Y; today you have to be none of these things. 
Today more than 20 per cent of the memberships in our Y are 
subsidized.
<P>
	If a founder of the Y came back he would be surprised at the 
changes, but he would soon realize that the basic principles of 
self-help, community service and tolerance are stronger than 
ever.
<P>
	Congratulations to Kathleen Bain, Doug Walker and Bob 
Gallagher for Canada 125 medals in recognition of their work

	<B>M. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> Mr. Speaker, we learned 
recently that several property owners along Témiscamingue 
Lake were allowed to bring the first collective action against the 
federal government for damages caused by a dam which was 
built in 1908. Because of that dam and the high water levels, 
these lakeside residents have been facing numerous problems 
such as landslides, inaccessible beaches, tree uprooting and land 
erosion.
<P>
	Besides asking for financial compensation, lakeside residents 
want the Minister of Public Works to ask for a reduction of about 
half a meter in the water levels of Témiscamingue Lake. 
According to a recent report from the firm AGEOS Science, and 
contrary to what other studies say, that half-a-meter reduction 
would not lead to floods in the Montreal area.
<P>
	As the member for the Témiscamingue riding, I am very

	According to the 1993-94 estimates expenditure plan for this

House today to speak on a matter of importance to the 
constituents of Huron-Bruce and to all rural Canadians. That is 
the future of rural post offices.
<P>
	I am very pleased that the government has acted quickly after 
the election and initiated a 30-day moratorium and subsequent 
extension on post office closures, along with a review of Canada 
Post operations. This action has given rural Canadians a great 
deal of hope that the disastrous actions of the past government 
will not continue.
<P>
	Since 1986 almost 1,000 rural community post offices have 
been closed or converted to retail outlets, 16 of which have 
occurred in my constituency. In small towns across Canada post 
offices lie empty, a constant reminder of job loss and 
abandonment. In many cases the post office was the only federal 
presence towns had.

and ensure that future closures do not occur.

	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
on an issue of utmost importance not only to my own 
constituents but to all Atlantic Canadians.
<P>
	The port of Halifax is the economic hub of the region injecting 
over $400 million per year into the local and regional economy. 
This is a great deal of activity, yet traffic at the port is more than 
30 per cent lower than what it was in 1990.
<P>
	It has been argued that a rethinking of some federal policies, 
specifically rail fuel taxation and capital asset depreciation, 
would greatly enhance the competitiveness of the port, 
increasing traffic and also creating badly needed jobs in the 
region.

	I know the new finance minister will not ignore Atlantic 
Canadians like his Tory predecessors and I urge him to seriously

	<B>Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as a long-time member of the Toronto Real Estate 
Board I hope the government will extend the RRSP home buyers 
plan. Scheduled to expire on February 28, the plan links 
ownership with retirement planning.
<P>
	The home buyers plan eliminates the question of whether to 
save for a down payment or retirement. It also recognizes the 
key role housing plays in economic growth. The program costs 
the taxpayer nothing to operate.
<P>
	I believe an extension would show government support for the 
real estate industry. It would also help first-time buyers 
establish the dream of home ownership. Let us keep that ball 
rolling.

	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
unilateral cuts made by the Conservative government in the area 
of social and co-operative housing in their last two budgets have 
had very serious consequences. In Quebec City, and especially 
in the downtown area, the need for social housing is enormous. 
At the present time, more than 1,200 families are on waiting lists 
for an apartment in a low-cost building, and more than 600 other 
families have applied for co-operative housing.
<P>
	Concerned by the urgency of the situation, the city council 
passed a resolution on January 10, 1994, asking the federal 
government to review the budget of the Canada Mortgage and 
Housing Corporation. The city is requesting enough money for 
social housing, and it would like to see the Co-operative 
Housing Program reinstated and the establishment of a program 
of rental housing renewal which would limit the contribution of 
the renter to 25 per cent of his or her income.
<P>

points out areas of gross fiscal mismanagement.
<P>
	Therefore I suggest that instead of allowing the Auditor 
General to report only once a year, let us allow these reports to 
come out several times a year in a timely fashion, so that

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is directed to the Prime Minister. 
Yesterday, when he spoke to students at a high school in Toronto, 
the Prime Minister, echoing his Minister of Finance, indicated 
that his government's first budget would contain no major 
spending cuts to bring down the deficit. On the weekend in 
Calgary, the Minister of Finance made it clear that it would be at 
least a year before we would see any major spending cuts.
<P>
	My question is this: Considering what was said yesterday in 
Toronto by the Prime Minister, are we to conclude that the 
government has reversed its policy by postponing real spending 
cuts and that, underestimating the gravity of the structural 
causes of the deficit, it has decided to rely on the hypothetical 
boost afforded by an otherwise lacklustre economic recovery?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the government's policy is well known. We said that cuts were 
needed but that budget cuts alone were not the answer, that we 
would also have to rely on economic growth.
<P>
	After winding up his consultations in the House of Commons 
this afternoon, the Minister of Finance will prepare his budget, 
and we are looking forward to hearing the budget speech before 
the end of this month. For the time being, this is all speculation. 
I simply said that cuts would prevent us from achieving all our 
objectives, because we must ensure that jobs are created in 
Canada, otherwise the problem will just get worse.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there is a major difference between speculation and the 
conclusions drawn from public announcements by the Prime 
Minister and his Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Does this mean that instead of spending cuts, the 
government's new strategy will now consist in increasing 
government revenues by broadening the tax base, in other 
words, by a very substantial increase in the tax burden for many 
Canadians? Does the government realize that in so doing it will 
compromise economic recovery by reducing the purchasing 
power of consumers?

	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
with everything that has been said so far, the Minister of Finance 
has consulted broadly in Canada. Today for the first time ever 
there is a debate in the House where members have been invited 
to make suggestions to the Minister of Finance. Then he will 
write his budget in the next three weeks. Now we have to wait. 
The time of speculation is over. It is a time of action. I know the 
Minister of Finance will prepare a very good budget.

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to know why the Prime Minister has 
decided against a general review of all government spending and 
more specifically of the government's operating expenditures 
and the fat in the federal machine and why he is now so reluctant 
to make cuts where there is money to be saved, in other words, 
by cutting government waste and costly and useless duplication 
by various levels of government?

	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker,

of government. As for the budget, the Leader of the Opposition

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is directed to the Prime Minister. 
Yesterday, he announced that the days when the federal 
government neglected Toronto were over. Does the Prime 
Minister remember that a little further to the east, there is a city 
that has just received the dubious honour of being named the 
poverty capital of Canada? Does he recall the position of his 
Minister of Finance who proposed the striking of a special 
Cabinet committee to oversee Montreal's economic recovery?
<P>
	Can the Prime Minister give some assurances to the 
disadvantaged neighbourhoods in Montreal and unveil today the 
strategy he intends to put forward to spur Montreal's recovery?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
last summer the city of Toronto only had one minister in cabinet. 
It now has a much better representation with very good 
ministers. I can say the same about Montreal.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The City of Montreal is very well represented in Cabinet by 
senior ministers. I think that the residents of Montreal know that 
their interests are very well represented in government by the 
ministers of finance, foreign affairs and heritage, as well as by 
the member for Mount Royal who is a secretary of State and 
assists us in Cabinet. Therefore, Canada's two major cities are 
very well represented and that is what I said in Toronto.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as the Prime Minister has stated that the City of 
Montreal is well represented in Cabinet, I would like to ask him 
if he is prepared to announce today that he is setting up the 
special Cabinet committee to oversee Montreal's economic 
recovery, an initiative which he promised during the election 
campaign and which is contained in the red book, a promise that 
the voters heard him make many times during the election 
campaign. Is he prepared to make this announcement, Mr. 
Speaker?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Quebec has six representatives in Cabinet and four of them come 
from Montreal. I think we already have our committee.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Finance, in keeping with the 
pre-consultation with members of the House on the budget.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has been quoted in the past as saying there 
will be no new taxes. Is it therefore the position of the 
government in principle that any new revenues must come from 
increasing current taxes and reducing tax exemptions but not 
from implementing new taxes?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, the position taken by the Prime 
Minister and myself has been very clear. We feel it is necessary 
to build greater equity into the tax system. It is only as a result of 
greater equity that Canadians will be prepared to support the 
system and the very difficult choices we have in front of us.
<P>
	I would like to go on, and I would like to do so in answer to the 
member's first question, to give him an opportunity perhaps in 
his second or third question to respond. In the debate this 
morning the member referred to the fact that those who would 
seek a tax revolt would find an ally, in fact a command post, in 
his office and in the Reform Party.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="717"> 717 </A></B>
<P>
	I simply would like to say that this is an historic day for the 
country. It is the first time we have ever had a pre-budget 
debate. The member opposite was elected to represent his 
constituents in the House where the great debates ought to take 
place. It is here that the differences of opinion in the country 
ought to be set out. It is here that Canadians look for leadership. 
I am sure the member was misquoted or did not mean it. I would 
like to give him an opportunity to stand to clarify his remarks, 
that he did not mean any tax revolt in the House.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the chance to respond to questions when the 
government puts them to us. I gather that is procedurally 
acceptable to you.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It could be that in the course of a question 
period we would end up with just questions on both sides. I am 
hoping there will be some questions and some answers, but I will 
leave that up to the hon. member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Just briefly in response to the hon. member, 
everything I said this morning reflects very accurately the views 
that were expressed to me by my constituents during the last 
election and by many other Canadians across the country.
<P>
	I also should clarify that when I talk about a tax revolt I am 
talking about what other Canadians are going to do. I made very 
clear that what I mean is something that is perfectly within the 
law and by legal means.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am sure that in this response there is going to 
be a question. I would hope that it would be forthcoming.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> I have a supplementary question for the 
Minister of Finance. We are asking serious questions. If the 
minister would give us a straight answer we would like to hear it.
<P>
	Along the same lines as my previous question, the 
government's speech from the throne promised the goods and 
services tax would be replaced. Is it the government's position 
that any replacement of the GST, while it may be fairer and more 
efficient, will not impose any additional tax burden on 
Canadians? In other words, is its proposal for the replacement of 
the GST revenue neutral?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, one would certainly hope so.
<P>
	What we have said, and we made it very clear, was that we are 
not going to foreclose the options the parliamentary committee 
was going to discuss. It will be discussing this with the 
provinces and there will be negotiation with the provinces.
<P>
	Obviously the wish as expressed by the leader of the Reform 
Party is one that we share. We do not want to increase the tax 
burden on Canadians as a result of this goods and services tax 
which has caused so much damage to the country.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (LaSalle-Émard):</B> Mr. Speaker, I consistently 
miss the applause line.
<P>
	The answer to the leader of the Reform Party is that we would 
hope so, but we do not want to foreclose the negotiations with 
the provinces and indeed the wishes of Canadians as they will be 
expressed to the parliamentary committee on which his party 
will be represented.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a further supplementary question for the Minister of 
Finance. I think this will be helpful to all members on both sides 
of the House.
<P>
	It is difficult for members of the House and for the public to 
participate in productive pre-budget consultations on the 
budget without seeking pertinent information on the budget 
itself. This will be helpful to members opposite as well.
<P>
	Could the minister clarify for the House what subject matters 
and lines of questioning he considers appropriate for a 
pre-budget consultation and what subject matters and lines of 
questioning he considers inappropriate and off limits?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The question is very far reaching. I know the 
hon. member would not want a list of all the questions. I am sure 
there would be a very succinct answer coming from our Minister 
of Finance.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, the fact is that we have now had four 
very public consultative conferences at which Canadians did not 
have to stand to ask the Minister of Finance what he wanted 
them to talk about and at which Canadians set out very clearly 
the issues as they saw them.
<P>
	I would simply therefore suggest to the hon. member that if he 
is indeed looking for direction he might well look to the lines of 
discussion that took place by Canadians in our conferences.
<P>
	I would say that I am a little taken aback by the question of the 
leader of the Reform Party, that he would like me to stand and 
give rigid direction. Perhaps that is because it applies in his 
party. In our party we are democratic.

business incubator and third, increasing investments in research 
and development.
<P>

the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	The minister has just completed a series of cross-country 
meetings to consult with Canadians about the upcoming budget. 
Could the minister tell the House what proportion of 
participants favoured increasing federal revenues and what 
proportion favoured decreasing federal spending?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt that there is a 
consensus across the country on the need to decrease 
government spending, one that we on this side of the House 
share very much.
<P>
	What occurred and was very interesting was that in each and 
every one of the conferences-in the workshops and in the 
debate about the nature of the deficit, the necessity of preserving 
our social programs and rebuilding our economy-virtually 
everybody understood the necessity of augmenting the revenue 
side of the governor's <I>p</I> and <I>l</I> statement. I cannot think of a better 
word; I have not been in this job long enough. More so, no one 
disagreed with the absolute necessity of building more equity 
into the tax system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, it seems the idea 
that a group of people out there want an increase in taxes has 
been attributed to the hon. minister. Could the minister identify 
these people and who they supposedly represent?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a great deal of difficulty 
understanding the thrust of the member's question.
<P>
	The fact is that virtually everybody-and I said it in my first 
answer-wants to see more equity in the tax system. In fact that 
is an essential part of building a strong economy. There was no 
one out there who said they did not want to have more equity in 
the tax system. Everybody understood that building more equity 
in the tax system meant filling in tax loopholes and taking away 
exemptions from one segment of society that they enjoy that 
other people do not. That is the kind of system we are going to 
build.

	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Agriculture.
<P>
	The ongoing labour dispute involving west coast 
longshoremen is costing Canadian grain farmers millions of 
dollars a day. Contrary to what the minister of human resources 
claimed yesterday in the House there is no settlement in sight. It 
is obvious that the plan of dockyard owners is to hold Canadian 
grain farmers hostage.
<P>
	Could the minister tell thousands of innocent grain farmers 
caught in this mess what he intends to do to resolve this major 
agricultural crisis?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, I say to the hon. member for 
Lisgar-Marquette that my statement yesterday did not indicate 
that a settlement was in sight. I said a settlement was possible 
because the parties were not that far apart.
<P>
	What is going to be required is a real good sense of public 
interest in their responsibilities and a recognition that under the 
collective bargaining process all parties to the dispute have a 
responsibility not only to themselves but to the entire country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
wonder if the hon. minister could use his talent in speech in 
negotiating rather than answering for the agriculture minister.
<P>
	I have a supplementary question. With all due respect to the 
minister, the only thing unions and owners agree on is that there 
will not be a quick voluntary settlement. This lockout is an 
obvious attempt by the dockyard owners to force federal 
government intervention.
<P>
	Could the minister tell the House what is to be gained by 
waiting for this to happen?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, I say to the hon. member for 
Lisgar-Marquette that in a time when the difficulties we face in 
this area are very sensitive it does not help for members of 
Parliament to be trying to inflame opinion or trying to pit one 
group against another.
<P>
	It is very important in statements made in the House that we 
recognize the two parties to the dispute must be encouraged to 
come back to the table to exercise their responsibilities under 
collective bargaining.
<P>
	In the meantime the government is carefully monitoring the 
situation. We are prepared to offer mediation services as soon as 
the two parties make a request. We will certainly keep in mind 
the public interest of Canadians. Of that the member can be 
assured.

decline of the groundfish stocks in Newfoundland.
<P>
	We have to take every action possible to protect and rebuild 
the stocks. We also have to take into account the century old 
tradition of cod jigging in Newfoundland and subsistence 
fishing in other areas, including the lower north shore of Quebec 
for example.
<P>
	Given this, can the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans tell the 
House why he is resorting to closing down the recreational and 
food fisheries in Newfoundland and will he be taking such 
drastic action elsewhere?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to congratulate the hon. member for St. 
John's West on an excellent first question in this place. May I 
say that my predecessor as minister of fisheries would agree that 
that is the best question a member for St. John's West has asked 
in this place in many years.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tobin:</B> Somewhere John is chuckling.
<P>
	I want to assure my colleague it is with the greatest of 
reluctance the Government of Canada has come to the 
conclusion that it is necessary to stop the food or recreational 
fishery along the northeast coast and south coast of 
Newfoundland. The decision was taken only after the latest 
scientific evidence indicated a drop in spawning biomass since 
1989 of almost 99 per cent in some areas and an indication of 
some black market in cod.
<P>
	We have taken the decision. I think it is understood and 
supported by the vast majority of the people of Newfoundland 
and Labrador. We are going to look at the area zone 4RS which 
affects the west coast of Newfoundland and the north shore of 
Quebec. The scientific survey vessel came back to port this past 
weekend. The analysis will be available in another four or five 
days. I will take a look at the analysis.

is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Without the power of recall, voters will not have an 
opportunity to replace an MP who has lost their confidence. This 
situation is clearly unacceptable and intolerable to Canadian 
voters who have a right to proper representation.
<P>
	My question for the Prime Minister is this. If the voters in a 
riding submit a petition that demands the removal of an MP and 
the calling of a by-election, and if the number of voters signing 
that petition is greater than 50 per cent of the number of people 
who voted in the last federal election, will the government 
respect the wishes of the petitioners and enact a recall process?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
spoke about this problem on Friday. It was tried in Alberta in 
1936. There was a request by the people who elected the premier 
at the time, Mr. Aberhart, that he be recalled. He passed 
legislation abrogating the legislation retroactively.
<P>
	This is puzzling me a little bit, so I hope he will consult with 
his leader because his father was involved at that time. We 
should study the situation of 1936 and after that we can consider 
what should be done.
<P>
<B>(1445) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, a 
supplementary question. Yesterday the Prime Minister said that 
democracy demands that members be allowed to fill out their 
term.
<P>
	Is the Prime Minister suggesting that democracy is served 
when MPs who betray the trust of voters are rewarded with a 
four-year no-cut contract and that democracy is endangered 
when the voters have the opportunity to remove such an MP and 
force a by-election.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we have been elected under the law of the land and the law of the 
land states that we were elected for the full term.
<P>
	Of course often after an election some citizens are not too 
happy with the way they voted. I am sure that in the riding of the 
hon. gentleman there are more than 100 persons today who 
regret they voted for the Reform Party and if they had a chance 
they would need, in his case, only 110 people to sign a petition 
that would void the majority he had in the election.

question is for the Minister of Transport. Last Friday, the 
minister answered a question asked by the hon. member for 
Louis-Hébert concerning the criteria which led to the closure of 
the radar control facility at the Quebec City airport. The 
Minister of Transport said that the review process was being 
applied to the country's entire air traffic control system. He said, 
and I quote: ``I can assure my hon. colleague that the
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="721"> 721 </A></B>
<P>
same criteria will be applied, whether it be in Quebec City, 
Calgary, Moncton or Vancouver.''
<P>
	Was proximity the determining factor in the decision to 
transfer the radar control facility from Quebec City to Montreal, 
since it is located 120 air miles from the control centre in 
Montreal?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
what I said last week in the House was that the criteria which 
will be established to make decisions regarding the Quebec City 
airport are similar to those which will apply elsewhere. I can 
assure the hon. member that the basic criteria relate to safety and 
the provision of services in one's preferred official language. 
This is what we intend to look for when we review this case and 
any other one.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans):</B> Mr. Speaker, why then 
does the Minister of Transport not apply the same reasoning to 
the Ottawa airport, which is located less than 90 air miles from 
the Montreal airport? Is it because people do not want to come 
and work in a French environment in Montreal? Is that the real 
answer?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
in his first question, the hon. member asked if this was the 
primary criteria. I can tell him that it was not. What I said to the 
hon. member is that we want to ensure that people can get those 
services in both official languages, and we also want to ensure 
everyone's safety. I sincerely regret that the hon. member does 
not seem to believe that the service provided in Montreal can be 
as good as the one in Quebec City.

	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is for 
the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
	Last Thursday the minister informed the House that the 
federal government would participate in the B.C. Utilities 
Commission hearings on the Kemano River diversion project.
<P>
	Many suspect the project will have a negative impact on the 
environment and on fish stocks yet the minister said he cannot 
halt or delay the contentious project because he inherited a 1987 
agreement signed by his predecessor.
<P>
	Given that the government was able to cancel the EH-101 
helicopter contract and the Pearson airport contract, will the 
minister fulfil his responsibilities and cancel the 1987 
agreement if fish stocks on the Fraser River are threatened?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for his question. I 
know he has a genuine interest in matters regarding fish habitat.
<P>
<B>(1450 ) </B>
<P>
	The member asks why is this not like the EH-101 and 
Pearson. The EH-101 was a $5.8 billion project that was not yet 
under way. The Pearson proposal was a $750 million airport 
expansion that was not yet under way. The Kemano project is a 
$1.5 billion project in current dollars and those dollars have 
already been spent.
<P>
	Given the Reform Party's well-known and often expressed 
interest in the deficit, I think the member would want me to 
acknowledge that the terms of the 1987 settlement agreement 
are such that the Government of Canada, the Government of 
British Columbia together with Alcan entered into an agreement 
where any move to slow or stop the project could potentially see 
the two governments liable for that delay or stoppage.
<P>
	I am saying to the hon. member what I am sure he would 
expect. The government's intention is to allow all evidence by 
all officials to be put forward before a B.C. review panel, to 
allow the panel to speak for itself and to not pre-judge the 
results.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta):</B> Mr. Speaker, the project is not 
without cost if it goes through. If this project is as 
environmentally benign as Alcan would have us believe, surely 
it would not mind guaranteeing the west coast fishing industry 
compensation if its predictions do not come true and fish stocks 
on the Fraser River decline as a direct result of the Nechako 
diversion.
<P>
	Is the minister prepared to demand that Alcan provide 
compensation to commercial and sport fishermen in British 
Columbia if wild salmon stocks on the Fraser River decline in 
number as a direct result of this project?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the member in his first question said: ``Will the 
minister agree to stop if-''. In his second question the member 
said: ``Will the minister and government agree to compensation 
if-''.
<P>
	The previous government negotiated an agreement behind 
closed doors and then locked the doors. This government has 
opened the doors, opened the process and made officials and 
tens of thousands of pages of documents available to an open 
review process. We are not going to pre-judge the process. We 
are not going to say hypothetically what we would do if we are 
going to allow the facts to speak for themselves in an open 
process as committed by the Prime Minister during the course of 
the last election campaign.

the Minister of National Revenue what he intends to do to

smuggling and the consumption of smuggled cigarettes in 
Ontario are essentially correct as far as I can tell.
<P>
	How would I educate the Ontario minister? I do not know. It is 
hard with NDP members in that government. We attempted to 
put the material in front of them which demonstrates that this is 
a national problem. Quebec may have more of a problem than 
the province of Ontario, but if anyone in Ontario is of the view 
that this is a minor problem and strictly one in Quebec, let me 
say that they are quite wrong. There is a very substantial 
smuggling problem in Ontario and a very substantial 
consumption of contraband cigarettes in Ontario particularly by 
young people.
<P>

a strategy for dealing with what is essentially a national problem

<P>
	The timing could not be worse given the devastating toll of the

	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette):</B> Mr. Speaker, when I interrupted 
my speech just before Question Period, I was listing some 
examples of wasteful spending and poor management of public 
funds. I mentioned National Revenue, Investment Canada, 
ministers' travel expenses, the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans, and I was getting to the matter of student loans.
<P>
	In 1990, 1992, and 1993, the Auditor General stated that 
annual ceilings for student loans had been exceeded. In 1993, 
the annual ceiling had been exceeded by $170 million. 
According to the Auditor General, action was urgently needed to 
correct the situation and ensure compliance with the provisions 
of the Canada Student Loans Act.
<P>
	We are not against lending money to students. We are aware of 
the financial needs of students, but the decision to exceed 
approved ceilings is up to Parliament, not departmental 
officials.
<P>
	Another example concerns the Canadian Aboriginal 
Economic Development Strategy. This strategy would invest $1 
billion over a period of five years. Three departments were 
responsible for implementation of the strategy: Indian Affairs 
and Northern Development, Industry, Science and Technology 
and Employment and Immigration. The purpose of this strategy 
was to address disparities between aboriginal peoples and other 
Canadians, and its objective was to help aboriginal peoples 
achieve economic self-reliance.
<P>
	Between 1989 and 1993, $900 million was spent under the 
strategy. The Auditor General deplored the lack of 
harmonization between the departments, which were supposed 
to co-ordinate their activities and put in place an evaluation 
framework. Because of this lack of leadership, the framework 
was not put in place until 1993, four years after the strategy 
came into effect.
<P>
	There are also very few ways to evaluate the effectiveness of 
this strategy. In fact, $900 million is being spent without any 
assurance that these expenditures are justified.
<P>
	In 1992, for instance, the Department of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development spent $20 million on 73 economic 
development organizations in communities considered to be 
fully developed. On the other hand, it spent $33 million on 296 
organizations in less developed communities. No wonder the 
Auditor General has asked for measures to monitor and evaluate 
these programs.
<P>
	It is most unpleasant when one is speaking to the Chair and 
members on the other side of the House are talking. I think we 
deserve some respect when we speak on behalf of our fellow 
citizens.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The hon. member for 
Joliette has raised a point, and I must say I agree. I would ask 
hon. members to continue their discussions outside, behind the 
curtains, so that we can hear what is  being said and the hon. 
member for Joliette can continue his speech undisturbed.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> I will go on, then, Mr. Speaker. To sum up, I do 
not know what real benefits have resulted from the activities 
outlined in the strategy. Were the resources maximized? We do 
not know whether the funds were spent on native priorities or 
whether there is a more cost-effective way to obtain the same 
results. A review of the Canadian Aboriginal Economic 
Development Strategy is therefore essential and programs must 
be assessed at that level.
<P>
	Another example is the Old Age Security and Canada Pension 
Plan. Pension benefit overpayments are in the range of $120 to 
$220 million each year, thus increasing administrative and 
implementation costs by 50 per cent to $260 million. These 
overpayments represent 0.5 per cent of total payments.
<P>
	The detection, recording and recovery of overpayments is not 
being managed in a cost-effective manner. Overpayments could 
be related to deficiencies in two key program activities: Canada 
Pension Plan disability reassessment and Guaranteed Income 
Supplement renewal. The systems and procedures in place for 
the recording, control and collection of overpayments fell far 
short of meeting minimum standards for such accounts.
<P>
	Past efforts to prevent and detect overpayments have been 
minimal and ineffective. The department responsible does not 
even maintain information on the extent of overpayments. That 
is why the Auditor General had to come up with an estimate 
himself.
<P>
	Here I would like to quote from the Auditor General's report: 
``In short, the Department does not have proper control of the 
overpayment situation. Benefits are paid to those not entitled to 
receive them. Existing systems do not allow managers to 
quantify the amounts involved or to manage their collection 
efficiently. Moreover, the Department is not organized for 
enforcement activities such as the recovery of overpayment''.
<P>
	There is another example: the Canadian International 
Development Agency, better known as CIDA. This organization 
continues to invest in development projects unlikely to be 
sustained beyond donor countries' financial assistance.
<P>
	This government agency did not maximize its use of resources 
and its projects have not led sufficiently to self-reliant 
development of the countries receiving financial assistance.
<P>
	It is important to resolve conflicts among multiple goals such 
as alleviating poverty while pursuing commercial and political 
objectives.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="725"> 725 </A></B>
<P>
	CIDA must channel its efforts. On the one hand, pursuing 
multiple objectives to meet the demands of various Canadian 
interest groups raises costs and diverts us from the intended 
objective. Commercial and political goals have caused CIDA 
to scatter its human and financial resources.
<P>
	On the other hand, new objectives have been added to those of 
the 60s and 70s such as economic and social policy reform of 
third world countries; human resources development; the 
promotion of human rights; sustainable development and 
environmental protection; finally, delivery channels, program 
proliferation and CIDA personnel rotation between countries 
every two to three years.
<P>
	This situation has increased the administrative burden and 
made the assessment of project results much more difficult.
<P>
	Corrective action is needed and the Canadian International 
Development Agency must act: one, to streamline its operations 
to be more efficient and effective; two, to review its project 
management strategy; three, to spell out its accountability to 
Parliament and the Canadian public; four, to be more open and 
transparent with regard to its strategic objectives. Finally, 
information on the results obtained should be made public.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	Just think, all these examples are taken only from this year's 
report, nothing else. The Investment Canada case is a good 
example of waste by a public servant. In management courses, 
we learn that officials and other managers often want to increase 
their sphere of influence by hiring too many employees or 
asking for operating budgets which are too high. All this leads to 
irrational spending. Civil servants do not always have the 
interest or the desire to challenge the government apparatus 
head on.
<P>
	That is why we want the committee that will analyze 
government spending to be made up, not of public servants, but 
of parliamentarians answerable to the people.
<P>
	We believe that it is the people's representatives who should 
ensure that the various programs achieve their objectives and 
that the public service and the government manage the 
allocation of public funds fairly, efficiently and economically.
<P>
	I again quote the Auditor General, who wrote in his report: 
``Most of the time, Parliament is not provided with adequate 
information on the results that departments and Crown 
corporations have achieved with billions of dollars of taxpayers' 
money''. Since parliamentarians do not have sufficient 
information on the government's financial situation, we think 
that the cases of waste and mismanagement reported by the 
Auditor General are just the tip of the iceberg.
<P>
	A parliamentary committee to analyze public spending could 
provide Parliament and thus the public with more information 
on the government's financial situation. On this point, we agree 
with the Auditor General's proposal to ask departments to 
provide clear and comprehensive reports in which they would 
give Parliament an exact accounting of their stewardship by 
providing results-oriented data on major spending items.
<P>
	Duplication of programs and overlapping jurisdiction are 
another waste of public funds. Not many studies deal with this 
issue, but among those that do, we have one done by the 
Treasury Board of Canada in 1991. It concluded that for at least 
half the provinces, provincial and federal programs apparently 
overlap in about 60 per cent of cases. The unclear division of 
power, federal interference in provincial jurisdiction and the 
federal spending power are the main reasons for this duplication 
and overlap.
<P>
	The Bélanger-Campeau Commission estimated that a 
sovereign Quebec would save $233 million on transportation 
and communication costs and $289 million on the collection of 
duties and taxes, by eliminating this duplication. The problem is 
therefore potentially very important. However, no recent studies 
to estimate the cost of duplication in all provincial and federal 
programs exist. Some sources estimate the total cost at nearly $3 
billion; others put it higher than that.
<P>
	That is why we ask this House to give the Auditor General a 
mandate, free of partisanship, to make a serious, complete study 
of duplication and overlap in all spending programs of the 
provincial and federal governments.
<P>
	In conclusion, the Bloc Quebecois thinks that the Canadian 
government must show that it is doing its part to reduce the 
deficit by eliminating waste, unnecessary programs and 
mismanagement of public funds. For this, we ask the Liberal 
government to stop hesitating and to set up a parliamentary 
committee to study government spending, item by item.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	This is part of a series of measures proposed by the Bloc 
Quebecois to put the government's finances back on a sound 
footing, without making the most disadvantaged or the 
provinces bear the burden of the necessary reduction in the 
federal deficit.
<P>
	We also ask the Liberal government to act quickly and 
energetically to eliminate the cases of waste and 
mismanagement identified by the Auditor General, which I 
mentioned in my speech.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
brief comment. The hon. member for Joliette gave a good many 
very convincing examples of inept government administration. I 
have another one for you.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="726"> 726 </A></B>
<P>
	With respect to occupational training, the federal and Quebec 
governments spend roughly $1 billion annually in Quebec 
alone. Despite this fact, the occupational training needs of 
Quebecers are still not being properly addressed.
<P>
	We have seen that in this particular area, overlapping 
jurisdictions swallow 60 per cent of the total amount allocated, 
that is 60 per cent of $1 billion, or $600 million. This money is 
used to deal with administrative problems, which leaves a mere 
40 per cent for real occupational training. This is completely 
outrageous.
<P>
	In spite of the promises in the white paper, we are now being 
told to wait two years for a review of these problems. This is 
unacceptable.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I totally agree with my colleague's 
remarks. More examples could have been given. Mention was 
made of the inept management of the public service. We could 
also have mentioned public service renewal, a process that is 
two years behind schedule. In his report, the Auditor General 
noted that the public service is absolutely indispensable to the 
operation of government. He also said, however, that the public 
service does not have the necessary tools to ensure effective 
management or the necessary controls to fulfil its obligations to 
the public.
<P>
	We could have given you many more examples, but since time 
is limited, we have to be content with underscoring the principal 
areas highlighted by the Auditor General. Follow-up action 
must be taken as soon as possible and the necessary changes 
must be carried out in order to ensure the sound operation of the 
House of Commons.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South):</B> Mr. Speaker, on the 
occasion of my first speech to the House of Commons in the 35th 
Parliament of Canada let me first express my sincere gratitude 
to the residents of my riding of Mississauga South. I am 
honoured to represent their interests in Ottawa and to serve their 
needs.
<P>
	I also wish to thank my wife Linda, and my children Aaron, 
Reagan and Whitney. All members of Parliament know the great 
personal sacrifice that our families have made so that we can 
pursue our goals. In this, the International Year of the Family, 
we say to you: ``We miss you, we love you and we thank you''.
<P>
	We also thank the Prime Minister for his vote of confidence 
and the historic decision to allow all members to speak freely 
and openly on important issues such as this pre-budget debate.
<P>
	Canadians are well aware of the complex and troubling 
problems we face today such as chronic deficits, high 
unemployment, poor economic performance and the lack of 
credibility of government.
<P>
<B>(1525 ) </B>
<P>
	In 20 years of corporate life and as a chartered accountant I 
learned quickly that for every complex problem there is a simple 
solution, and it is wrong. To focus solely on deficit reduction is 
too simplistic. We need a balanced approach to fiscal and 
monetary policy to promote economic growth and job creation. 
This, coupled with expenditure rationalization, will lead to 
deficit reduction.
<P>
	Financial performance can be improved in two ways: 
increasing revenues or decreasing expenses. On the revenue 
side, tax increases are not an option in this budget. Canadians 
are already over-taxed. Alternatively, we need to broaden the 
tax base by expanding the economy.
<P>
	On the expense side, cutting and slashing to lower the deficit 
would be destructive. Moreover it does not take into account the 
value of an integrated expenditure plan which can create 
synergies and opportunities in support of economic growth.
<P>
	Government must redefine its philosophy on expenditures, 
viewing them not as spending but rather as investing in people, 
programs and assets. We are investment managers of the 
taxpayers' funds, and when we invest, not only must we set 
returns and performance requirements but we must also become 
accountable to the people of Canada. When these returns and 
performance requirements are not being achieved government 
has a duty to take corrective action.
<P>
	Annually the Auditor General has reported on countless 
examples of waste and mismanagement. We must respond to 
these reports and demonstrate that we have learned from our 
mistakes.
<P>
	Our social programs were initially designed to provide a 
social safety net for those in most need. Although the system 
served Canada well in the past, we must overhaul and renew 
these programs to fit the realities of the 1990s and into the 21st 
century.
<P>
	We must simplify our tax system and restore equity and 
fairness both in the personal and the corporate sectors. We must 
streamline government operations at all levels to improve 
productivity and efficiency. We must provide incentives for new 
investments, particularly in small and medium sized businesses 
to create lasting jobs for Canadians.
<P>
	For every one dollar investment in Canada the multiplier 
effect is five times in terms of the contribution to our economy. 
This creates new jobs and a broader tax base which is essential to 
the meaningful reduction of the deficit.
<P>
	At this point I would like to make a few specific suggestions 
for budget consideration. We must aggressively deal with the 
underground economy to ensure that more are paying their share 
so that all are paying less. With an estimated 20 per cent of our 
economy underground the government has a duty to  conduct 
more network audits and to introduce more comprehensive 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="727"> 727 </A></B>
<P>
forensic auditing techniques to address this most serious 
problem.
<P>
	In regard to RRSPs, contribution limits should be set at levels 
that will allow all Canadians who are not members of pension 
plans to adequately provide for their retirement income. These 
levels should be comparable to those afforded to members of 
registered pension plans.
<P>
	With regard to the $100,000 lifetime capital gains exemption, 
it has not met its objectives of stimulating investment in 
Canada. The exemption should be discontinued and the savings 
be reinvested in job creation initiatives.
<P>
	Old age security for our seniors should not be affected by this 
budget. The present tax law already claws back a portion of the 
benefit where the taxpayer has other income. The Prime 
Minister told seniors during the election campaign that old age 
security was a dividend, recognizing their lifetime of 
contribution as taxpayers and we should honour that position.
<P>
	The rising level of foreign-owned debt is draining capital out 
of Canada. As such, consideration should be given to incentives 
for Canadians to invest in our country, such as tax exempt bonds.
<P>
	On unemployment insurance, benefits should be paid only to 
those Canadians who are unemployed and looking for work.
<P>
<B>(1530 ) </B>
<P>
	The current practice of paying benefits where there is only a 
disruption of earnings should be reviewed and a threshold of 
earnings should be considered as a basis for increasing the rate 
of clawback on these social benefits.
<P>
	On immigration, the federal government must enforce its 
immigration sponsorship agreements where the sponsor is able 
to meet their obligation. In 1993 the region of Peel alone had 
some 11,000 welfare claims from immigrants who were already 
covered by a sponsorship agreement. Thirty-eight per cent of 
those agreements broke down in the first year, rising to 62 per 
cent before the end of the second year of the 10-year 
sponsorship. In addition, 59 per cent of those sponsors were 
children sponsoring their families. In a large number of cases 
they did not have the financial ability to do so.
<P>
	The rise in defaults has been dramatic and the burden is 
falling squarely on the shoulders of the Canadian taxpayer. 
Fiscal responsibility requires that we must address this 
situation.
<P>
	On health care, the federal government contributes 24 per 
cent of the cost through transfer payments to the provinces and, 
as such, should ensure that the funds are being appropriately 
spent. However, Ontario has over two million unauthorized 
health cards in circulation, costing that province as much as 
$900 million per year in fraudulent claims.
<P>
	Although this is under provincial jurisdiction, there is only 
one taxpayer and this type of savings opportunity cannot be 
ignored.
<P>
	With regard to economic growth, new partnerships must be 
built with the business sector which will be responsible for the 
creation of 85 per cent of all new jobs. That means that the 
government must provide meaningful incentives, such as job 
creation tax credits, training subsidies, UIC premium 
exemptions and wage subsidies as its partnership contribution.
<P>
	We must also provide a supportive environment by 
streamlining government services and creating one stop 
shopping for those services, especially as it relates to small and 
medium sized businesses and to export opportunities.
<P>
	In conclusion, the pursuit of economic growth coupled with 
sound financial management and wise investing will allow us to 
deal effectively with the challenges before us. To quote from the 
government red book, a strong economy is the essence of a 
strong society and therefore jobs and economic growth must be 
our top objectives.
<P>
	Political credibility requires fiscal responsibility. The people 
of Canada have given this government the mandate to make the 
tough decisions necessary to restore our economic strength and 
to create opportunity, hope and jobs for all.
<P>
	Canadians also understand that all who are able will be called 
upon to contribute their fair share. We need a tough but fair 
budget. We need it now for the long term benefit of all 
Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to congratulate the member for Mississauga South on his 
first speech in this House. He made some extremely good points.
<P>
	However, I would like to ask him a few questions on tax 
policy. He mentioned at the beginning of his remarks that he felt 
that there should be no new taxes. I certainly concur that the 
middle class and individuals are just totally overburdened on 
taxes. He concluded his speech by talking about fairness.
<P>
	I would like to ask the member for Mississauga South if his 
comments at the beginning of his remarks would include the fact 
that there should be no consideration in this budget of taxing 
those profitable corporations that now pay no tax. Last year the 
Auditor General told us that there are millions of dollars in 
uncollected taxes because of the provision for profits to be put 
offshore and therefore not taxed in Canada. We know that the 
family trusts, where the rich can shelter their money, are not 
taxed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="728"> 728 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to ask the member, when he talks about no taxes, 
is he talking about allowing these tax loopholes for the rich and 
for profitable corporations to continue or does he really want 
to see a fair tax system so that the individual taxpayer gets less 
burden when everyone is paying their fair share?
<P>
<B>(1535 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for 
Yukon for her kind words of congratulations.
<P>
	I do not think I can do justice to her question in the brief 
moments that we have here but let me comment with regard to at 
least the concept of no new taxes vis-à-vis corporations, 
offshore companies and family trusts.
<P>
	The concepts of fairness and equity would say that 
government has to revisit all of the provisions. There are no 
more sacred cows. To the extent that businesses are indeed 
draining capital or sheltering business income through offshore 
instruments, this government, if it is to be true to its value 
system of fairness and equity in our tax system, must 
investigate, analyse and work toward reasonable solutions to 
ensure that the income derived from Canadian soil is invested to 
the greatest amount in Canadian opportunities.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the hon. member for Mississauga South, whom I want to 
congratulate on his maiden speech. I noted that he talked about 
the elimination of the $100,000 lifetime capital gains 
exemption.
<P>
	Does the hon. member not think that by doing away with this 
exemption, to which every taxpayer is entitled during his or her 
lifetime, the government is in effect taxing the inflation that it 
has itself generated because of negligence, because of a bad 
interest rate policy in some cases and because of excessive 
taxation?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Mr. Speaker, the $100,000 lifetime capital gain 
exemption was introduced two Parliaments ago by the previous 
government. It was sold to Canadians on the basis that it was 
going to stimulate investment and job creation in Canada. I 
think that Canadians embraced those principles as being 
honourable.
<P>
	However, the government in its implementation made two 
fundamental errors in that exemption. First of all, it did not 
establish a V-day value for investments and so allowed 
investments which were already made and had holding capital 
gains on them which were eligible for that exemption. It 
forewent the opportunity to direct this exemption to new 
investment.
<P>
	Second, the government did not specify or restrict the nature 
of investments that could be made under this program. As such, 
investments even such as Florida vacation properties became 
eligible for that exemption. Under the circumstances I think the 
hon. member would  agree that this particular exemption, 
although honourable in its roots, was very poorly implemented. 
The optics are very bad to the Canadian taxpayers and the 
dollars that the government is foregoing by permitting that 
exemption would be much better spent by investing in job 
creation initiatives.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernie Collins (Souris-Moose Mountain):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is my honour and privilege on behalf of the electors 
of Souris-Moose Mountain to rise on this very memorable 
occasion to make my first presentation to the members of this 
House on a topic so crucial and that is the budget.
<P>
	We are honoured to have the hon. minister, Mr. Paul Martin, 
as the minister in charge of this department. I am sure that the 
members from across the House have recognized his 
capabilities and are prepared to work with him along with each 
of us.
<P>
	For me, having come from a riding that has been notable for 
people who have served in this capacity, it is a humbling 
experience. I do know that I have the support of my wife, 
Delphine, and my family. If I were to name all the members of 
my family we would be here for some time.
<P>
	Let me just say that from the oldest member Michael to the 
youngest member Carrie-Lynn, I do know that they are prepared 
to make a commitment, along with me, of total responsibility 
and trust to those who have placed me here.
<P>
<B>(1540 ) </B>
<P>
	I look forward to the opportunity to work with all members of 
this House as we go forward to address the challenges of this, the 
35th Parliament.
<P>
	Because my riding is so vast, almost 300 miles across, I have 
had the opportunity to travel 30,000 miles and meet constituents 
during the campaign. Our riding encompasses the entire 
southeast corner of Saskatchewan. From the Manitoba border 
one can travel 300 miles to Minton in the area of the Big Muddy. 
From the United States border our constituency reaches 180 
miles north to the Qu'Appelle Valley.
<P>
	I found that everywhere I went young people were seeking 
hope. They desire a chance, a way to make themselves known in 
this great country of ours. They do look to us to light the fire in 
their eyes and to renew the hope in their hearts so that they along 
with us can be the beneficiaries of this fantastic country.
<P>
	My riding includes seven First Nation reserves, the Sakimay, 
White Bear, Ocean Man Band, Ochapowace, Cowesses, 
Kahkewistahaw, and Pheasant Rump. I know their hopes and 
aspirations are for recognition as a First Nation and for 
self-government. They too search for hope for their families.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="729"> 729 </A></B>
<P>
	I am happy now to put forward some ideas that may be 
incorporated into, as it is being prepared by the people of 
Canada, this budget for 1994.
<P>
	I have travelled through southeast Saskatchewan and have had 
a very clear, concise concern put forward to me by different 
groups of people.
<P>
	In the agricultural community never did I find a farmer who 
said he wanted a handout. What they did ask for was a fair price 
for the product they produced.
<P>
	Certainly that is all too true when I look at the unemployed. 
They wish to have training to improve their skills so that they 
can become part of that hope and dream.
<P>
	I remember a meeting in Estevan some three or four years ago 
when the then Minister of Finance, Michael Wilson, brought 
forth the goods and services proposal. The business people of 
that area spoke loudly and clearly and said they could stand a 3 
per cent or 4 per cent flat tax or basic tax but that would be the 
ceiling.
<P>
	What has happened since that time? I am sure the House 
remembers the reports in the newspapers that the goods and 
services tax was creating such a great amount of wealth that the 
government was not sure what it would do with it.
<P>
	We still find that the truth of the matter is that the goods and 
services tax did not produce the expected wealth. What it did 
produce was an army of people out collecting the tax, creating 
for small and large businesses alike a horrendous amount of 
paperwork.
<P>
	I look to this government to get rid of these levels of 
paperwork that take hours and hours for business people. They 
are in the business of making money, not just spending time 
filling out government reports.
<P>
	In the history of Canada there is no tax that I know of that is as 
hated as the goods and services tax and I want to assure all those 
people in Souris-Moose Mountain that in one clear voice they 
have spoken. They do not want any more taxes and they do not 
want an unfair tax system.
<P>
	What I do mean is a fairness in taxes. I believe, as the report of 
the Auditor General has indicated, that the Government of 
Canada must close loopholes so that investors cannot borrow 
money, invest it in foreign countries and then have a tax shelter 
of these investments.
<P>
	I also believe that the Auditor General when he does make his 
report should frequently bring those recommendations to this 
House so that we can fix those areas which are inappropriate or 
wrong. Corrective steps to overcome the problems must be 
taken.
<P>
	What about accountability and proper management? I read 
that between $120 million and $220 million is lost annually 
because of pension plan and old age security benefits paid to 
ineligible people. I know a case in which an individual was able 
to approve for himself educational funding. Where is the 
accountability?
<P>
	These are the things that have gone on in the past which my 
constituents have made clear to me they will not tolerate any 
longer.
<P>
	I want to switch gears into the area of student loans. The 
student loan program is costing the government a tremendous 
amount of money. The tax on student loans should be equitable 
and should be fair. There should be a six month buffer for 
students to pay.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	Let us be thoughtful when we are spending our money and 
how it is accounted for. My constituents are not pleased about 
spending $1.6 million on a painting when there are 1.6 million 
unemployed.
<P>
	I have a few quick observations from consultations with my 
constituents. Several have suggested to me that a tax on lottery 
winnings especially over a certain level would be acceptable.
<P>
	An opportunity should be given for communities to invest in 
themselves. This could be handled through an infrastructure 
program, but there are tax implications. A suggestion has been 
made that citizens could make a one-time contribution to a 
community fund and receive a tax benefit.
<P>
	Given that a significant amount of our debt is held by foreign 
countries a concerted effort should be made to buy back that 
portion of the debt that is held outside this country.
<P>
	I am confident, as is everyone in this House I am sure, that we 
have a talented, thoughtful and visionary man at the helm of this 
overwhelming economic situation. Remember that Paul Martin, 
Sr. was a man of vision, a man of action and a statesman. He was 
a man Canadians trusted and respected. He was a true Canadian. 
Our present finance minister will surely be deserving of the 
same accolades as he prepares and presents, with our help and 
the help of all Canadians, the budget for 1994.
<P>
	A famous writer of Negro heritage, Langston Hughes, 
depicted the life of his family and indicated that one could go 
through life laughing or crying. His solution was: Go through 
life laughing. Enjoy it. Part of the challenge is to provide an 
opportunity for the people of this country to go through life 
enjoying it. We will enjoy our part if we know that we have 
contributed to improving the standard of living and the hopes 
and expectations of all Canadians.

	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened closely to what the hon. member for 
Souris-Moose Mountain had to say, as I did to everything that 
has been said in this place so far today. I think that, if we were to 
sum it all up very concisely, there would be at least two main 
ideas emerging. First, a good many people in this country have 
lost confidence in their politicians and second, we have a 
government mired in a situation that can be attributed to 
government mismanagement.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="730"> 730 </A></B>
<P>
	Every member who has participated in this debate has 
pointed out several instances of mismanagement, like this 
business with health insurance cards, although this involved the 
Ontario provincial government to some extent, and other telling 
examples of mismanagement on the part of our governments.
<P>
	What strikes me about this debate is that we seem to be 
rehashing the same old things we have been hearing for ten 
years. I am sure there are people in my riding who are thinking 
just that: ``All that stuff, we have been hearing about for ten 
years''.
<P>
	This morning, the Minister of Finance mentioned relying on 
meetings he had had with 30 or 40 top economists in Canada. 
But we have been relying on Canada's 30 or 40 best economists 
for 10 or 12 years already and, instead of improving, things are 
getting worse.
<P>
	I want to put this question to the hon. member for 
Souris-Moose Mountain regarding Quebec. As you know, it is 
most likely that we will be holding a referendum in Quebec 
within a few months. Here is how the people of Quebec view the 
overall situation at this time. In 1980, when the Liberals took 
office, the cumulative debt in Canada was about $80 billion. 
Incidentally, our present Prime Minister was Minister of 
Finance in that Parliament. At the end of their mandate, they 
passed on a debt of $200 billion or so. Under the next 
government, a Conservative government, it rose to $500 billion. 
We know that upon separating from Canada, we will take on 25 
per cent of the Canadian debt. Had we voted ``yes'' in the 1980 
referendum, we would have had to pay $20 billion out of this 
debt, but if we vote ``yes'' now, it will cost us $125 billion. This 
means that over a 13-year period, Quebec's share of the debt has 
increased by over $100,000 million. As the holder of 25 per cent 
of the voting shares in this company called Canada which has 
increased our debt by $100,000 million in 13 years, in what way 
is this partnership profitable to Quebec?
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Collins:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question the hon. 
member has put forward.
<P>
	Let me say that he is being more than optimistic in his thought 
that all of us in this House, with the exception of the Bloc, are 
going to stand by while he departs from this country, because it 
will not happen. We are in this for the long haul. In this, the 35th 
Parliament, each and every one of us has a commitment to the 
debt and to the improvement of the welfare of this great country 
of ours.
<P>
	I can assure hon. members that the people of Souris-Moose 
Mountain will make their commitment to continuing to come up 
with a budget that considers Quebec, that considers Yukon, that 
considers all of Canada.
<P>
	I am pleased that the hon. member for Yukon is here because 
she is going to be part of this process so that jointly we come up 
with a decision. We are not going to do it as individuals but 
together collectively we will come up with a solution.
<P>
	It is easy to turn to the past and say that it was the fault of 
someone else. I suggest that we have to come up to today's 
standard and ask: What are we going to do now? We have a new 
group of people. They are optimistic. I am optimistic and I can 
see nothing but good for this country under the leadership of our 
great Prime Minister and our Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Along with us, the hon. member from Quebec will be 
surprised how happy he will be when the budget for 1994 comes 
forward.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
wish to offer my congratulations to the hon. member for his 
election to Parliament and also congratulate him on his remarks 
today.
<P>
	The hon. member has asked the members of this assembly for 
advice with respect to the budget. I have many things I wish to 
offer in terms of revenue saving items. I do not have the time 
right now but will get them on the record later.
<P>
	I have one question I would like to raise at this moment. On 
the budget considerations by the Minister of Finance, the 
minister of defence is considering closing certain military 
installations across the country.
<P>
	CFB Moose Jaw which is now called 15 Wing has been in 
existence for many years. It has been there for very practical 
reasons, for example, the cloud-free skies, adjacent flat 
topography and a low population density to the south. These 
have contributed to the positive training and safety conditions of 
the base.
<P>
	Would the hon. member join with me in making 
representations to the minister of defence to ensure that this 
facility remains intact for the benefit not only of our country but 
also for the province of Saskatchewan and for the military and 
residents in and near Moose Jaw?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Collins:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question.
<P>
	On many occasions he and I have shared the opportunity of 
coming together on certain topics. The kind of thing that has to 
happen in this House is that we have to come up with a collective 
approach to dealing with problems.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="731"> 731 </A></B>
<P>
	I assure the hon. member not only will I be part of that but 
I want to work very hard to convince all members from 
Saskatchewan that we collectively ensure the base at Moose 
Jaw continues to stay open.
<P>
<B>(1555 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
say that this is a great day to be in the House of Commons.
<P>
	When I decided to take on the challenge of being a member of 
Parliament representing not only the Lethbridge constituency 
but the people of the province of Alberta, I faced in my home in 
Edmonton a number of young people, young men and young 
women who were concerned about their futures. These young 
people who had visited my home from the University of Alberta 
were quality students, young people who had the potential to 
make a great contribution to Canada. But their main concern was 
job opportunity: How do I get a job after I have studied so hard 
and taken on a major loan portfolio as well? That was their main 
concern.
<P>
	At that time I said I thought I would like to take on the 
challenge of federal politics and be in the House of Commons, 
leaving the Legislative Assembly of Alberta where I had served 
my people for some twenty-eight and a half years. So today I 
feel it is a great day that I am able to stand and take part in this 
pre-budget debate and make a contribution that I feel should 
assist those young people.
<P>
	We in Canada, specifically the people of my constituency as 
in other areas, have other concerns as well, with the deficit and 
the debt and with the type of leadership we will have this 35th 
Parliament. Will we achieve what we have established and set 
out to do? I would like to talk about that for a few minutes today.
<P>
	During the past two weeks as I sat here in this assembly I 
listened very carefully to what the Prime Minister had to say and 
what the Minister of Finance had to say regarding their 
objectives and the hints they were going to give. I know as well 
as all other members do that they may not have been able to lay 
out a full plan with all of the details. That is because it would 
have been the traditional way where the government lays out the 
plan and then goes into a defensive mode and we in the 
opposition go into an offensive mode and we become 
adversaries over the plan as set out.
<P>
	As I understand it the plan is still loose and is building and is 
open to suggestion. That is why we have this opportunity today 
to fulfil our commitment to Parliament, to the people and to the 
Minister of Finance, to fulfil that plan.
<P>
	As I looked at some of the remarks of the Minister of Finance 
during the past week I believe he gave us some hints. He said on 
page 387 of the January 26 <I>Hansard</I>: ``We are going to hit our 
target through a combination of growth, cutting unnecessary 
spending and building more equity into the tax system''. He 
went on to say on another day in Question Period: ``We are going 
to  broaden the tax base and fill in the tax loopholes and this will 
simply remove inequities in the tax system and make it a great 
deal fairer''.
<P>
	Those are noble objectives. What I hope we are able to 
impress upon the Minister of Finance is that in his budget he will 
have to implement the details that are satisfactory to the 
Canadian people.
<P>
	I want to go a little further in <I>Hansard</I> as of January 26 and 
issue a bit of a concern in this listening process. One of our 
Reform Party members raised the matter of the Reform zero and 
three plan, or our proposal to reduce the deficit. The Minister of 
Finance in his comments of <I>Hansard</I> of that day said that our 
proposal was a kind of savagery.
<P>
	I only say to the Minister of Finance that he should rethink 
that. And I ask this question: In this listening process has he 
taken the time to listen to all of the details, the tabling that our 
leader made today? Is he prepared to read through the plan to see 
if there are suggestions and ideas which can be used before he 
writes off in a partisan way suggestions that have been truly 
tested by hundreds of thousands of Canadians and supported by 
them because that is why there are many Reform members 
sitting in this assembly today.
<P>
	After reading some of the comments of the finance minister 
and after what I heard today in Question Period, I get the feeling 
we could be on the verge of more taxes or new taxes or increased 
taxes. Certainly there will be a shift somewhere within the cross 
section of Canadians. Someone will pay more and maybe 
someone will pay less or pay the same. In that equity formula 
there will be an imposition of a greater amount of taxation. In 
this context I say to the Minister of Finance that there are very 
few people who support the concept of more taxes, especially 
new taxes.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	An article in the <I>Financial Post</I> of January 30, 1994 referred 
to American growth relative to the Canadian growth, and I think 
the minister should take it into consideration. It stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Fast-paced economic growth in the U.S. is likely to drag Canada along 
eventually, economists say, but lack of consumer demand and government 
cutbacks will make it a struggle.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Despite booming exports to its neighbour, Canada will be hard-pressed to 
keep up with the U.S. economy this year.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	These are the reasons given in the articles:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Fragile consumer confidence and rising taxes have left it several steps behind 
in the recovery process.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I suggest the minister should make note of the article. Another 
thing about taxation and the approach to it is that more taxation 
is not the way to cut the deficit.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="732"> 732 </A></B>
<P>
	I refer to a government document entitled ``Canada's 
Economic Challenges'' and dated January 1994. Page 48 of the 
document talks about Canada's tax burden. It states: ``Canada's 
tax burden has been steadily increasing. Since the early 1980s 
total government taxes as a share of GDP has risen 
significantly''. If we look at the graph over the last 10-year 
period it is about 6 per cent.
<P>
	Page 39 talks about the public debt. It states: ``The public debt 
burden continues to rise. Relative to GDP, Canada's combined 
federal and provincial debt has increased two and a half times 
since 1981-82''.
<P>
	The point I want to make to the finance minister is that even 
though taxes have increased significantly relative to GDP, our 
debt continues to rise. Just increasing taxes is certainly not the 
solution to the problem we face.
<P>
	I listened very carefully last evening to the remarks of the 
Prime Minister in Toronto, along with my good colleague from 
the Bloc Quebecois. The Prime Minister indicated to Canadians 
and to the people in Toronto that he would like to cut the deficit 
to 3 per cent of gross domestic product by the third year of the 
government's mandate. He said that there would be cuts but that 
the best way was through growth.
<P>
	The Prime Minister did not talk about the kinds of cuts or the 
kinds of objectives. Again today the Prime Minister hedged on 
how we were to deal with the question of social programs. There 
is a challenge for the government. A soft Liberal approach will 
not work.
<P>
	The Investment Dealers' Association made a submission to 
the Minister of Finance in January 1994. I have just received a 
copy in the last couple of days. Referring to the approach of the 
government, the association indicated that the government must 
do more than what the Prime Minister has said, that it must deal 
with the expenditure pattern of governments. The association 
indicated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The deficit for the current year is now projected at $45 billion, about 5 per 
cent of GDP. The government's stated policy is to reduce the deficit to 3 per cent 
GDP within three years-requiring a $20 billion or 45 per cent reduction in the 
deficit.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We have to recognize that we are left with $25 billion as a 
deficit. The association went on to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This deficit target is a worthy fiscal objective. However, the government 
cannot rely on strengthening economic growth to close the deficit gap within 
the forecast period. The scale of expenditure reduction to achieve the 1996-97 
deficit target suggests massive reform of federal and provincial spending will be 
required.</BLOCKQUOTE>
I certainly want to echo and support that. I believe it is the way 
the government must handle it.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	What do I suggest Canadians are also saying? They are saying 
that the government must priorize its spending. I believe it 
should work toward deficit reduction and balancing the budget 
within a term of the 35th Parliament. I expect that in the budget 
there will be targets, priorities and a concrete time line for 
deficit elimination.
<P>
	That is the challenge of the Minister of Finance. I am at the 
end of my time. I would like to thank you, Mr. Speaker, the 
government, the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance for 
the opportunity to make these remarks on the pre-budget debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Don Valley North):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate the member on his election and on his first speech 
on the pre-budget debate.
<P>
	Before I put my question, I mention to him that we promised 
in the red book that we would bring down the deficit to 3 per cent 
of GDP. In his plan, as was mentioned during the campaign and 
as he mentioned again today, he is to eliminate the deficit in 
three years. This means that on average it must be reduced by 
$15 billion every year for the next three years to meet the target 
of a zero deficit.
<P>
	Would the member explain to us how he would do that? From 
where would he cut $15 billion every year on average for the 
next three years?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> I certainly appreciate the 
question. It is a very leading question. It gives me an 
opportunity to espouse our position very clearly.
<P>
	Some ingredients have changed since we set forward our zero 
in three plan in early 1993 in terms of revenue possibilities. The 
actual deficit is much greater than the one we projected. I 
believe we were looking at around $35 billion. We are now into a 
projection of $44 billion to $46 billion. There certainly are other 
areas of government that we must look at in terms of bringing 
about those kinds of expenditure reductions.
<P>
	Basically the Reform Party looked at three areas. In the broad 
area of government efficiency we recommended that some areas 
have 15 per cent cuts. That is in the document we presented 
today.
<P>
	The second area we looked at was grants that are now made 
available to businesses and special interest groups. In that area 
we felt we could reduce the expenditures of government by 
about $4.3 billion.
<P>
	The third area we looked at were transfers to individuals. We 
have said clearly that health care was not one of them. We were 
to maintain the expenditure pattern as set out in the 1992-93 
budget. It is to be kept at that level until we could maybe add to 
it, but there would not be a reduction in health care spending or 
in advanced education. We also had a hold on retraining and 
criminal justice programs.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="733"> 733 </A></B>
<P>
	Other areas we were looking at were unemployment 
insurance and old age assistance. For example, we wanted to 
look at an income threshold of $54,000. In examining that we 
could reduce the direct expenditure in that area by about $3.5 
billion, by putting in that family threshold of $54,000. Those 
are some of the kinds of things we were looking at.
<P>
	We have tested those with many Canadians and have had very 
positive responses. We intend to continue to do that. There may 
be others we will have to put on the table. Now that we have a 
major contingent elected to the House, it would be our plan to 
develop, refine and certainly be more specific in terms of further 
expenditure reduction patterns.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to congratulate my hon. colleague for Lethbridge on 
his excellent speech and I am happy to hear a member from the 
Reform Party say they would maintain the resources allocated to 
health care and social security systems. I feel that this shows 
progress in the analysis made by Reform Party members, and I 
think the Bloc Quebecois and the Reform Party will eventually 
reach common ground on this. Besides I had yesterday the 
opportunity to discuss at length with the member for Lethbridge 
before commenting on the speech by the Prime Minister.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	I would like to ask my colleague if it would not be appropriate 
for the Reform Party to support the request the Bloc Quebecois 
made many times to the Minister of Finance that a special 
parliamentary committee be struck, with responsibility for 
looking at the tax and budget expenditures as a whole, so that 
drastic cuts are not made across the board, and so that, after an 
item-by-item review, cuts and increases could be determined. 
We feel, for instance, that expenditures on social housing should 
rise. Through you, Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleague if it would be 
possible for his party to support mine on that point?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> As a Reform caucus we certainly 
considered the presentation of the Bloc Quebecois in its 
amendment to the main motion.
<P>
	In terms of the concept of having a parliamentary committee 
to review the budget and the priorities and to look at areas where 
we could reduce and cut in a responsible way, I think it had a lot 
of merit. What made it very difficult for Reform members to 
support the concept were some of the other items listed in the 
major paragraph called the amendment. Because of that we felt 
it was not the right thing to do. The original idea, the concept of 
more study by a broader group, did have some merit.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
rising today to participate in the debate in advance of the 
upcoming budget. In so doing I want to concentrate my remarks 
on the overall financial objectives of this organization which 
must decide these things for the Government of Canada.
<P>
	The Government of Canada is the largest organization in the 
country. Like any other board or management we are well 
advised to keep in mind our central function of overall planning 
of our financial objectives. Historically that is one of the most 
important roles of this Parliament and recently it has been one of 
the most neglected. In my comments I want to take some time to 
review these objectives from the perspective of the Reform 
Party.
<P>
	During the course of the election campaign our party 
campaigned on the necessity of setting the following financial 
objectives. In the life of this Parliament we would work toward 
the elimination of the current budgetary deficit without 
resorting to significant tax increases. That was called the zero in 
three plan. On that basis we went from being a relatively minor 
party to being the effective opposition today for most of Canada.
<P>
	I want to review why it is an appropriate financial objective 
and especially ask government members to consider my 
comments. In light of the financial developments we will also be 
considering these things.
<P>
	I am not going into the very good reasons that exist for 
stopping the growth of debt, for eliminating annual deficits, for 
not raising taxes or for not raising general price levels. My 
colleagues in the party have covered those topics very 
competently. I want to look at the timeframe proposed for our 
particular financial targets.
<P>
	Why deal with the fiscal problems of Canada in the life of this 
Parliament? First, it is a modest objective because it is 
necessary to deal with far more important objectives in terms of 
our economic development. We cannot hope to deal with the 
problems of debt or significantly lower the tax burden until we 
eliminate the significant problem of annual structural deficits.
<P>
	Second, the problem is political. We are all elected. We all 
know it is politically difficult to undertake the steps necessary to 
reduce this particular problem. The political will necessary for 
that will not sustain itself for very long and certainly will not 
sustain itself beyond the life of one Parliament. The previous 
government had two mandates to deal with this problem and was 
unable to do so. Third, there is a very good fiscal reason. Today 
the problem of the deficit is largely driven by the past sins of 
governments. We have accumulated an enormous debt on which 
we generate a huge amount of interest payments. Those interest 
payments are really today the essential problem in the annual 
deficit.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="734"> 734 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1615 ) </B>
<P>
	Every year that we fail to deal with this we add to the debt 
burden and by implication we add to the future stream of interest 
payments. If we deal with this problem  only gradually we will 
find that our actions year by year are offset by the very tax 
burden that we create.
<P>
	Fiscal gradualism does not work. This was the policy of the 
former PC government and it illustrated it in spades. Year after 
year we had nine budgets with incremental measures to deal 
with rising debt. Every year the pattern of debt and interest 
payments served to offset those actions and to offset the deficit 
targets and we find ourselves more or less in the situation we 
were 10 years ago.
<P>
	Of course the former government complicated that situation 
by resorting to other measures. Once it recognized fiscal 
gradualism was not working it got into a pattern of systematic 
overstatement of growth projections and eventually into the 
fiasco we had in the election which was deliberately misleading 
people as to the financial state of our country.
<P>
	We know that today the Minister of Finance has spoken very 
eloquently about this. We are looking at a deficit this year of 
between $44 billion and $46 billion. That is $13 billion above 
the $32.6 billion that would have been indicated to us less than a 
year ago. That is more than just an off-shoot in projections.
<P>
	On top of that we have the largely unprecedented situation 
where we have actually had to go back and revise the deficit 
from the year before, the year that ended over six months ago. 
Now we find we were $5 billion higher not on this year but on the 
year before this year when we were talking about the deficit 
during the federal election campaign.
<P>
	I do not want to focus just on the last government. This is a 
pattern in the historical record of the failure of fiscal 
gradualism. If we look at the deficit from 1867 to 1992, and I 
refer members to chapter 5 of the Auditor General's report at the 
end of 1992, we had accumulated net public debt of $423 billion. 
Yet only $37 billion of that or less than 10 per cent was due to 
annual shortfalls. The rest was due to interest and compound 
interest generated by those mistakes.
<P>
	This government has initially in its rhetoric recognized that 
we have a significant structural deficit program. It has switched 
from some of its campaign rhetoric to some of the rhetoric we 
heard from just about every government and every party that has 
been elected afterwards to recognize that this is a problem. 
Nevertheless the government continues to opt for a policy of 
fiscal gradualism.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance repeated today in this House his 
target of 3 per cent deficit to GDP by the end of this Parliament.
<P>
	I cannot understand the clear rationale for that. I can tell the 
House that even if that objective were achieved by this 
government that is a target above the annual trend growth rate of 
this country. In other words even achieving that target we will 
continue to see our debt burden and the relative burden of our 
interest payments  continue to climb. We are already at 
dangerously high levels here. We all know the impact.
<P>
	A previous speaker said that if interest rates were to go up one 
percentage point we would add $5 billion to the deficit. If they 
go up one percentage point we will be adding $10 billion to the 
deficit within five years as a consequence of the compounding 
of that error.
<P>
	Fudging numbers and putting out false projections are not the 
way to go. I hope the government is not beginning to slip into 
that pattern.
<P>
	Let me raise a point of concern. Today the minister made 
reference to financial projections for the next fiscal year. We in 
our party are trying to do an analysis of our situation to make the 
best proposals possible. In spite of those figures provided by the 
Minister of Finance, as late as this morning both his department 
and his ministry refused to provide my office with complete 
information as to the nature of those projections or the 
assumptions on which they are based.
<P>
<B>(1620 ) </B>
<P>
	I wanted to elaborate a little on that problem. Before the 
election we were projecting that we are at a level of spending in 
terms of current programs in this country that is about 15 per 
cent above the level we can sustain in the long run. This is why I 
am so interested in these projections. We know from the data we 
are getting that this situation could not possibly have improved. 
We are concerned about this.
<P>
	In concluding the point I would like to make is that we can all 
rant and rave and rhetorically wave our hands-we are all 
politicians-about this situation being a problem, but if we cut a 
little fat, close a few loopholes, wait for growth or announce 
some strategic initiatives this problem will solve itself or it will 
not be as difficult.
<P>
	This has not been the experience of the past. It is not true. It is 
going to happen. We know the experience in other countries with 
these kinds of deficit situations. If we do not deal with it, if we 
do not do something about it, something will be done about it for 
us.
<P>
	I urge members on the other side to consider very carefully 
their objectives in this matter. I notice the minister has delayed. 
He is now saying that it will be next year's budget that deals with 
this. We do not have these kinds of timeframes or this luxury.
<P>
	If this government fails to deal with this problem it will not 
only fail our country but the government itself will fail. It will 
fail not only economically but politically as well. I ask the 
government to give very careful consideration to these matters.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to compliment the 
Reform Party speakers in their philosophy of bringing the views 
of their constituents on to the floor of the House.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="735"> 735 </A></B>
<P>
	We saw them try to do this in question period. I wish they 
would do more of this in their debates. I have been using that 
practice for the 10 years that I have been representing 
Parkdale-High Park.
<P>
	To begin input into this debate to help the Minister of Finance 
and the government reduce our public debt and deficit, I sent a 
questionnaire out to each household in Parkdale-High Park 
with a preamble about how Ottawa spends its money, where it 
gets its revenues and so on. I asked: ``Do you agree that deficit 
reduction is one of the top priorities for the federal 
government?'' The results are preliminary but already 88 per 
cent said yes. They agree that deficit reduction is one of the top 
priorities for the federal government in addition to job creation.
<P>
	The second question I asked was: ``Which of the following 
approaches would you support to help solve the deficit 
problem?'' I asked them to check: increased personal income 
taxes; decreased government spending; or, a combination. 
Eighty-one per cent said that they support decreasing 
government spending to help solve the deficit problem. If they 
agreed to a decrease in government spending, I asked: ``Are you 
willing to accept fewer government services in order to reduce 
the deficit?'' I am pleased to say that 84 per cent of my 
constituents said yes, that they are willing to accept fewer 
government services in order to reduce the deficit.
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member this. In his constituency 
which kinds of services would his constituents be willing to 
either eliminate or reduce? If we can do this in every riding, then 
we can help bring down the deficit and the public debt.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for his question.
<P>
	We too went through similar exercises not only in the party 
but in our constituency. I held very similar public meetings on 
this subject. The process was very similar to that outlined by the 
hon. member before I was being paid to be the member of 
Parliament. I am familiar with the process. The outcome of that 
which the hon. member had outlined was very similar to the 
kinds of results that I saw in my riding.
<P>
	At some of the public meetings we had I took the additional 
step of working through with the constituents who attended a 
line item review of the budget. We went over about 100 spending 
categories. Because I have done some study in this area I was 
somewhat familiar with some of this information. It would be 
very difficult for me to go over the whole program in the short 
time that I have but let me just elaborate in general terms.
<P>
<B>(1625 ) </B>
<P>
	Obviously we all know that the constituents expect there to be 
significant reductions at the top of government, led by 
ourselves. We have advocated some of these things on the floor 
of this House. Our caucus has advocated reducing some of the 
expenses around here. To some degree the Liberal Party has 
responded on these particular items and will be discussing this 
later today in the Board of Internal Economy.
<P>
	My constituents outlined a number of areas of administration 
of government services and programs where they would expect 
there to be a reduction in the whole area of bureaucratic costs. 
That is an area that the Bloc Quebecois is, of course, prone to 
talk about quite frequently. Obviously we are going to be 
looking at the Auditor General's reports. We are hoping that the 
government will look at the Auditor General's reports in 
implementing those kinds of considerations.
<P>
	The third major area where I think my constituents are 
prepared to see a large reduction and even elimination is the 
entire area of government involvement in business, both 
through direct expenditure as well as some of the tax concession 
programs. In our zero in three plan we had laid out a number of 
areas where we believe there should be the elimination of that 
kind of spending.
<P>
	Finally, in the area of social policy it has been my experience 
that when one lays the facts before the people, that nearly 
two-thirds of our current spending is in the area of social policy, 
they do anticipate there will be some reductions. The key is that 
the benefits be retained in the programs that are most valued by 
Canadians, like health care; that people who contribute to 
programs are able to receive those kinds of programs, like 
unemployment insurance; and, also that people who need those 
programs the most are able to receive money from those kinds of 
programs.
<P>
	I think if you take those three things into account, Mr. 
Speaker, you will see that even after those criteria there is room 
for reduction in the social policy area.
<P>
	I see that you want me to wind up and I apologize to the hon. 
member that I have not been able to explain in any more detail.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jane Stewart (Brant):</B> I wish to congratulate the 
Minister of Finance for recognizing that the success of our next 
federal budget will be as dependent on the quality of the process 
that we use to identify and implement our budgetary measures as 
it will on the substance of those budgetary measures themselves.
<P>
	Our Minister of Finance understands quite well that over the 
last number of years Canadians have come to feel very 
uncomfortable with the ways and means of government, and in 
fact this has translated into the inability of the previous 
government to implement effective and efficient government 
initiatives. Consider, for example, the GST.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="736"> 736 </A></B>
<P>
	We all know that if we are going to bring our financial 
situation into an acceptable state of control, we are going to 
need the combined and national commitment of all Canadians. 
It is not going to be good enough just for 176 Liberal members 
to say: ``We can make a difference''. We have to ensure that 
every single Canadian is committed to helping us bring down 
a $45 billion deficit and rein in a $500 billion debt.
<P>
	This debate today provides us with a good opportunity to 
ensure that we get the commitment of Canadians to manage our 
deficit and our debt in a humane and acceptable way that is 
consistent with getting them back to work.
<P>
	I applaud our Minister of Finance for his original speech, 
given on November 29 to the students at the Universities of 
Montreal and McGill where he committed himself and his 
ministry to an open and transparent process with no more private 
delegations. He wanted to hear what Canadians have to say. I 
congratulate him on the completion of four very good 
cross-country townhall meetings.
<P>
	The minister in doing this gave each and every one of us as 
members of Parliament an opening to do the same thing in our 
constituencies. I challenged the minister on that and asked him 
if he would not send a member of his ministry into my riding to 
hear what the people of Brant have to say on this very topic of 
budget management. I was not surprised and was very pleased 
that he responded very quickly in the affirmative. On January 6, 
1994, Mr. Karl Littler, a member of the minister's office, came 
to the riding of Brant and listened for three hours to what my 
constituents had to say on this topic. It is that information I 
would like to share with the House today.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	First of all, and it was not surprising, my constituents said we 
have to restore integrity in government. Otherwise meetings 
like the one I held and debates like this mean nothing. 
Fortunately, Mr. Littler's attendance at the meeting indicated to 
my constituents that this government does intend to do business 
differently and so we carried on with our agenda.
<P>
	My constituents said they wanted a clearer and a more 
understandable way of keeping on top of how the government 
spends its money and collects its revenues over the course of the 
year. They were extremely uncomfortable with the previous 
Prime Minister's response, or lack of response, to the now 
Leader of the Opposition's question during the leadership 
debate on the state of the nation and what the size of the deficit 
really was.
<P>
	We talked at length about the GST, about its failure and about 
possible solutions to it. By and large my constituents felt that a 
melding of the federal and provincial retail sales tax would 
make sense but small business warned us against implementing 
procedures that would negate the money, the time and the effort 
they  had already put into accommodating the goods and 
services tax to date.
<P>
	Other small business owners and the farmers in my riding 
indicated the importance of capital gains exemptions and RRSPs 
to them. For them they are the main tools, in fact, in many cases 
the only tools they have to provide and plan for their retirement. 
They understand changes may be necessary but they want them 
done in a fair and equitable fashion.
<P>
	Other members of my constituency, some who work in the 
real estate business, others who build homes and others who are 
looking to buy their first house asked that the minister consider 
continuing the home buyer's plan. At the point of our 
conversations they understood that plan was a no cost plan to the 
government and had in fact encouraged economic development 
in our community.
<P>
	I was interested by other constituents who spoke in support of 
arts and culture. One constituent in particular stated he believed 
that for every dollar spent on the arts $7 more were generated in 
spin-off purchases. It was suggested that a tax break for 
Canadians who choose to donate to the arts be created, 
something like what we have for Canadians who choose to 
contribute to political parties.
<P>
	We talked about a number of other things. There was support, 
for example, for a national debt reduction fund. There was 
support for an interesting idea where we might provide tax 
breaks to businesses that offer new, permanent and long-term 
jobs to the community.
<P>
	There were a number of very interesting ideas but the one 
which received the most debate, most conversation and the most 
support was one which was presented by an individual. He 
called it GAMI, a guaranteed annual minimum income.
<P>
	We have talked about guaranteed annual incomes for a 
number of years, since the 1960s in fact. Every time we take a 
look at our income support systems we think about a guaranteed 
income. The Croll Senate report on poverty talked about a basic 
income, as did the Castonguay-Neveu report in Quebec and 
later on the Manitoba basic annual income experiment. In the 
1980s the Macdonald commission and the Forget commission 
all talked about and gave real consideration to a guaranteed 
annual income.
<P>
	There are those who will say that this kind of negative tax 
strategy will not work, it will instil poverty across our nation. I 
believe there are strategies to avoid that and some of them are 
mentioned in the Macdonald commission report.
<P>
	There are others that say we cannot offer a guaranteed income 
to able-bodied Canadians because they will not work. I submit 
that Canadians will work. We found over the course of this 
election that Canadians want the dignity of work and a 
guaranteed income will not stop them from going to work.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="737"> 737 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	In fact data we are now analyzing from the Mincome 
experiment in Manitoba suggests there is not a really strong 
relationship between a guaranteed income and a refusal to work. 
It does not exist.
<P>
	Others will say we cannot afford that approach. Interestingly 
enough the gentleman who proposed the GAMI at our meeting 
was to my mind probably more a part of the right wing of the 
political spectrum than the left wing. He saw real opportunity to 
streamline the number of programs we have now to support 
Canadians and their income. He saw an opportunity to reduce 
the bureaucracies we have built up around unemployment 
insurance, old age security, WCB, some provincial programs as 
well.
<P>
	What I am seeing is that we may have a window here where 
the left and the right and where all provinces across this country 
may now be able to come together.
<P>
	I started my comments by congratulating the Minister of 
Finance on a step change in process toward budget consultation. 
I now ask him to consider a step change in the substance of what 
many of our programs might look at, the one that we spend a 
majority of our money on, income security.
<P>
	It will take some work and we will not be able to do it in the 
1994 budget but I believe as Liberals we have a mandate for a 
number of years and we do have to seriously consider the notion 
of a guaranteed annual minimum income.
<P>
	I have given you some highlights of the meeting I held in my 
constituency on January 6. In closing I would like to recognize 
that the citizens of Brant know that the minister has a difficult 
task ahead. They appreciated the opportunity to share their 
ideas, provide advice and direction.
<P>
	They hope and expect that he will listen to a number of their 
ideas and they also expect that those ideas which are not 
incorporated are talked about after the process and the reasons 
why they were not considered will also be shared. The process 
must continue. It must go on.
<P>
	This is the kind of process to which our government is 
committed. Certainly our minister has indicated that is the way 
it will be. I wish him well on the tough road ahead and would like 
him to know that the people of Brant appreciate his continued 
support and openness.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simon de Jong (Regina-Qu'Appelle):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
wish to congratulate the member for Brant for presenting some 
interesting ideas, particularly concerning some form of the 
guaranteed income. I think she will find that notion has wide 
support in this House. I hope that the Minister of Human 
Resources Development will look at the option as he reviews 
social policy as well.
<P>
	My question for the hon. member concerns the government 
and the Liberal Party's promise of solving the problem of the 
deficit through more employment. It is an argument I totally 
accept.
<P>
	Statistics Canada did a study as to the cause of the debt. I 
believe that study was done last summer. Statistics Canada said 
that of our accumulated debt, 50 per cent was due to interest 
payments, i.e. the high interest rate policies of the former 
Liberal government that the Conservative government 
continued. I believe 44 per cent was due to loss of income. The 
loss of income is due to the tax breaks of the former Liberal 
government that the Conservative government continued and 
only 6 per cent was due to increased government expenditures of 
which only 2 per cent was due to increased social spending. This 
is a study by Statistics Canada on the cause of the debt.
<P>
	We have to increase our revenues. In other words we have to 
plug some of the tax loopholes. I encourage the government to 
continue to look at that but also we have to get people back to 
work.
<P>
	The free trade agreement killed over 400,000 jobs. NAFTA is 
going to kill more jobs. Since coming into power the 
government has increased the tax on employment, discouraging 
employment by increasing the UI premiums. Second, it has 
ratified the NAFTA which is going to create more 
unemployment. How can the government in fairness state that 
creating more employment and therefore more revenues is its 
central concern when in fact the record so far indicates it has 
taken the opposite direction?
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Stewart (Brant):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to comment 
particularly on the unemployment insurance issue. I believe that 
the Minister of Human Resources Development has taken a very 
responsible approach to the UI increases. We have a debt in that 
bank. He took a minimum increase and froze it for two years. 
Hopefully our businesses can use that stability to help plan for 
the future.
<P>
	With regard to NAFTA, I think we can compete. In my 
community we are currently working very hard to develop new 
economic clusters we believe will revitalize our economy.
<P>
	I am certainly very much a part of the Liberal strategy that 
says debt and deficit management come from three areas, 
spending cuts, increased revenues, but most importantly 
economic growth.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke):</B> Mr. Speaker, I also 
want to make a comment and ask a question of the member for 
Brant. First I want to offer her my congratulations on her 
election to this place and for her speech and comments.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="738"> 738 </A></B>
<P>
	I want to get the reaction of the member for Brant on some 
information released yesterday by the Canadian Life and Health 
Insurances Association of Canada, which voiced some concern 
about federal taxation of group health and dental insurance.
<P>
	The information put forward yesterday was to the effect that 
the government is seriously considering taxing group health 
insurance and dental insurance. This insurance is paid by 
employers in a lot of instances for about nine million working 
Canadians. It benefits about 20 million Canadians, I understand, 
according to the information, families across this country who 
receive these benefits.
<P>
	My understanding is that this would be a pretty important tax 
grab. The association has offered some numbers from its 
research. It indicates that for a worker who has no dependents 
earning $25,000 per year the impact of this tax measure would 
be about $275 a year in additional income tax. It goes on to say 
that a family with one bread winner who earns about $40,000 a 
year would pay $425 in additional income tax on the same 
taxable benefit.
<P>
	I will just finish the quote: ``For a two income household with 
$80,000 a year it would be $700 more in additional taxes a 
year''. That is a pretty big increase, even for retired people.
<P>
	My question for the member for Brant is the following. If 
there is going to be a debate in this country about health 
insurance and how we apply it, and I understand that is what the 
government intends to do, would it not make more sense to have 
the people and employers involved in the industry participate in 
that debate before such a dramatic tax grab takes place that will 
affect 20 million people and nine million working men and 
women?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Stewart (Brant):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not pretend to speak 
on behalf of the Minister of Finance. I cannot say that is going to 
be part of the budget. I will only reiterate his comments that he 
will develop a fair and equitable budget. I have every confidence 
in his ability and his commitment to do that.

<P>
	No doubt everyone will understand that my first thoughts are 
of my wife, Evelyn and our three children, Mark, Laura and 
Carl. During my 13 years of service as an elected representative 
in the municipal government of London, Ontario and now as the 
member of Parliament for London-Middlesex, I have always 
enjoyed their full love and support. I wish to thank them most 
sincerely.
<P>
	As you well know, Mr. Speaker, the adventure of democratic 
politics is never a solo flight for no one achieves public office 
without the help of many people: family, friends and 
acquaintances alike. I wish to thank publicly in this House the 
army of dedicated volunteers who worked so indefatigably on 
my campaign and whose efforts produced the most decisive 
victory ever in the history of the riding of London-Middlesex.
<P>
	To all of the people of our riding, to the 54 per cent who did 
support me and to those who did not: I pledge to you my very 
best efforts to represent you at all times with honesty, integrity 
and hard work. I am indeed honoured to be your member of 
Parliament in this the 35th Parliament of Canada.
<P>
	My riding is most definitely a challenge to represent given its 
geographic size and the diverse heritage of its peoples. Indeed, 
in many respects it is almost a microcosm of Canada itself. 
Eighty per cent of our people live in the urban areas of east and 
south London, while the remaining 20 per cent make their homes 
in the very productive rural and agricultural settings of the four 
townships of Biddulph, London, West Nissouri and North 
Dorchester.
<P>
	Demographically, London-Middlesex is an interesting 
riding encompassing peoples of many cultures, languages and 
religions. Although primarily of a sturdy Anglo-Saxon 
character, it is home to such fascinating peoples as the many 
descendants of the historic Irish pioneers. After World War II 
many Dutch, Italian and Portuguese immigrants came to our 
area and worked very hard for a better life. Most recently, 
significant numbers of Arabs and Poles, as well as Croats, 
Caribbeans, Southeast Asians, East Indians and Chinese have all 
made their important contributions to our communities.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="739"> 739 </A></B>
<P>
	As is fitting in this great nation we call Canada, some of our 
people are French Canadians who, though not many in number, 
are both proud to be francophone Canadians and are determined 
that this blessed land must stay united.
<P>
	Economically, the range of activities in my riding includes 
many different types of farming on some of Canada's richest 
soil, a plethora of small businesses of every type imaginable, 
several major industries such as General Motors Diesel and 3M, 
and such important institutions as Parkwood Hospital, 
Fanshawe College and London's airport.
<P>
	It is in juxtaposition to this description of my riding that I now 
offer my synthesis of the opinions and concerns of my 
constituents as well as my personal views on the state of the 
economy and possible budgetary decisions to deal with the 
crisis.
<P>
	Having consulted widely with my constituents of 
London-Middlesex, which included a public pre-budget 
roundtable forum held in London last week along with my 
colleagues, the hon. member for London West and the hon. 
member for London East, I have received a very clear message 
that our government must do its utmost to encourage the 
creation of jobs while at the same time taking difficult decisions 
necessary to reduce the national deficit and debt. A balanced 
approach is the key to a true economic recovery.
<P>
	In the field of taxation, it is readily apparent to middle income 
Canadians that they bear an unjust share of the tax burden in this 
country. The majority of my constituents favour the elimination 
of tax loopholes for wealthy individuals and corporations in 
order to create a more equitable tax structure. Across the board 
tax increases however would be beyond comprehension at this 
time.
<P>
	It is a real concern to many that severe restrictions on RRSP 
contributions and the elimination in one fell swoop of the capital 
gains exemption could be unduly punitive and could actually 
slow our economic recovery.
<P>
	I have heard the clarion call to establish better priorities for 
government funding as part of the overdue effort to reduce the 
national deficit and debt. Surely no priority can be more urgent 
than the need to invest our tax dollars wisely in the children and 
youth of Canada. To sell young Canadians short is to condemn 
this nation to a future of mediocrity, to a future in which Canada 
would experience horrendous social problems.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	It is my personal view that one enormous problem dominates 
the economic landscape. That is the devastating unemployment 
crisis and the desperate need for new jobs. Yes, we must slash 
the deficit and the debt. Yes, we must make our system of 
taxation more equitable. But any so-called economic recovery 
which discards hundreds of thousands of Canadians onto the 
scrap heap of indefinite idleness is no recovery at all.
<P>
	A Liberal government true to its principles can never accept 
the economics of indifference which preaches that 5 to 7 per cent 
unemployment constitutes full employment. We must never 
write off even one of our fellow Canadians as a faceless statistic 
for whom we offer no hope. Like many of my hon. colleagues in 
this House I have seen the human face of these unemployment 
statistics day after day in my constituency office. It is a face 
etched with fear and despair. Women and men, young and old, 
the highly educated and the unskilled, too many Canadians are 
crying out for the dignity of daily work and a chance to earn a 
decent living for themselves and their families.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the cruel reality of our unemployment crisis 
offers no quick fixes, no easy solutions and no panaceas waiting 
to be discovered. But let us at least begin.
<P>
	As a Liberal, one of my fundamental beliefs is that 
government must play a role in partnership with the private 
sector if Canada is to pull out of this economic nightmare. To 
deny that is to deny the lessons of history. And so let us with 
heroic hearts and strong in will strive, seek and find a better 
economic course for all Canadians.
<P>
	In closing, as the member of Parliament for 
London-Middlesex, I pledge my best efforts to join in the fight 
to help create a new and better Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly):</B> Mr. Speaker, I heard the 
speech made by the hon. member opposite and I basically agree 
with him, except that I am about to turn 50 and all previous 
governments have invoked tax fairness to impose new taxes 
again and again to all taxpayers, always in the name of tax 
fairness.
<P>
	My question is twofold: first, tax fairness and, second, the 
creation of steady jobs. I remember that from 1982 to 1987, in 
Quebec, and the situation was probably the same elsewhere in 
Canada, we did not wait for the chicken to lay the egg: we went 
and got that egg while it was still inside the chicken. In other 
words, we found all kinds of incentives to stimulate the creation 
of temporary jobs. So much so in fact that recovery in the 
construction sector in Quebec is currently at an all-time high.
<P>
	Does the hon. member have a suggestion to promote the 
creation of steady jobs, and can he give us his views on tax 
fairness? I am particularly curious about lowering the ceilings 
for registered retirement savings plans, as well as eliminating 
the capital gains exemption. I wonder if the hon. member could 
answer that question.

still hear it, but not from many of the unemployed I might add. 
Frankly, I can say that having come from 13 years in municipal 
government it is applauded coast to coast to coast in this 
country by municipal leaders of every political stripe. So that 
is a major step in the right direction.
<P>
	Obviously we recognize that the private sector will and 
should create most employment in this country. The 
infrastructure seeks to look for a partnership with the private 
sector to help do that.
<P>
	In terms of the second part of the question dealing with tax 
loopholes, quite frankly the statistics will show that since 1984 
under the previous government those earning high incomes, in 
the top 3 per cent in this country, paid less in income tax. To me 
that is fundamentally unfair and immoral. It must stop. I am 
confident the Minister of Finance will do everything possible to 
address that what has to be the ultimate inequity.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to congratulate the member for London-Middlesex on his 
remarks, particularly to show this House that perhaps we are not 
going to hear the nonsense and clap-trap of the previous 
government about a jobless recovery because there is no 
recovery unless there are jobs for people and unless we can 
really have people back working again. I congratulate him on 
addressing that very profound question of jobs in our 
community and in our country.
<P>
	Would the member go beyond just simply saying that we do 
need jobs and really put that into action by having his 
government put forward specific targets for the reduction of 
unemployment which we could debate in this House? I would 
like to see this.
<P>
	I would like to know the member's reaction to having the 
government come forward and being accountable to the people 
by saying: ``Here is our target not just for the reduction of the 
deficit''-and I agree the deficit is a problem-``but here is our 
target to reduce unemployment. We are going to put it before the 
House, we are going to defend that target and we are going to 
have a debate on it''. Does the hon. member think that would be 
a useful thing for his government to do?
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Yukon for 
her kind good wishes, her remarks and for her question.
<P>
	I think that small <I>l</I> liberals, the two of us, are probably of very 
like minds on this very question. Sure, the deficit is important 
and has to be slashed. I fully agree that any so-called recovery 
which leaves hundreds of thousands of Canadians unemployed 
is simply not a recovery by my definition of the word.
<P>
	I fully support the idea that one ought to have specific targets 
to try to reduce that unemployment level just as our party has 
laid out specific targets in wanting to reduce the deficit. It is a 
logical suggestion and a good one. I will pass it on to the 
Minister of Finance.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dalphond-Guiral:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The hon. member for 
Laval Centre on a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dalphond-Guiral:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to inform the 
Chair that, from now on, members of the Official Opposition 
will make 10-minute speeches, followed by a 5-minute period 
of questions and comments.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Thank you. Resuming 
debate. The hon. member for La Prairie.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie):</B> Mr. Speaker, this debate 
on government finances is extremely important for all 
Quebecers and Canadians. I am particularly pleased to 
participate in this exercise and I want to take this opportunity to 
thank the Minister of Finance for having made this debate 
possible today.
<P>
	As the member for La Prairie, I have the honour of 
representing in this House the citizens of Brossard, Candiac, La 
Prairie and Saint-Lambert. These people are middle-class 
workers. They have worked very hard to get what they have and 
they often find it revolting to see political leaders and elected 
politicians unable to control the public debt and the budget. 
They are annoyed because, in many cases, they have saved every 
dollar by not going over their weekly budget and, more 
importantly by not relying on other people's money, money 
which is not theirs and which leads to debt and dependency, as is 
the case for Canada right now.
<P>
	The lack of control over government finance is reflected by 
the fact that from 1960 to 1994, the debt-to-GDP ratio in 
Canada went from 34.6 per cent to 71.8 per cent. This means that 
the debt increases faster than the government revenues which 
could be used to pay off that debt. While the debt-to-GDP ratio 
is an indication of the scope of the problem inherited, the 
evolution of the deficit versus the GDP enables us to find out 
when, over a period of time, the federal debt simply grew 
exponentially.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	Between 1970 and 1984, the deficit as a percentage of GDP 
rose from a negative balance of-0.3 per cent-in this case, a 
minus sign means a budget surplus so in Canada, in 1970, we had 
a budget surplus-to 8.1 per cent, which was exceeded only in 
1985. So in 1984, this percentage peaked at 8.1 per cent. 
Subsequently, the ratio gradually declined to 4.5 per cent and 
then rose to 6.2 per cent in 1994, under the new government. In 
other words, the Liberals have been mainly responsible for the 
deterioration of public finances in Canada. The Liberals are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="741"> 741 </A></B>
<P>
responsible for the ensuing expansion of the public  debt, and 
they mismanaged the impact of the oil crises in 1973 and 1980.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is aware of the need to revamp public 
finances. We must stabilize the debt/GDP ratio over time. 
However, we cannot increase the tax burden on a middle class 
that has already been severely affected by the recession and is 
particularly vulnerable during this period of slow and painful 
economic recovery.
<P>
	According to the Bloc Quebecois, to put the government's 
financial house in order means, first of all, introducing tax 
reforms that aim for greater fairness by eliminating tax 
loopholes enjoyed by taxpayers with high incomes. The hon. 
member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot spoke at length on the 
subject earlier today. Second, we must reduce government 
spending. We believe such measures would generate greater 
flexibility and a potential savings of $10 billion for the 
government. The aim of this budget policy is to avoid shifting 
the burden of federal deficit reduction to the provinces. Its aim 
is also to protect the neediest in our society and prevent any cuts 
in the budget envelope for social programs.
<P>
	The Bloc's budget policy wants to strike a balance between 
two priorities: job creation and revamping public finances. That 
is why we intend to allocate the $10 billion saved by cutting 
gross expenditures and tax spending as follows: $5 billion 
would be allocated to job creation and $5 billion to reducing the 
deficit.
<P>
	Our plan to reduce spending consists of two parts: first, a $3 
billion cut in the defence budget. The budget of the Department 
of National Defence for 1993-94 totals nearly $12 billion. The 
budget breaks down as follows: $9.1 billion for operating 
expenditures, $2.9 billion for capital expenditures and $356 
million in transfer payments. Our proposed spending cut 
represents 25 per cent of the current budget of the Department of 
National Defence.
<P>
	The remainder of our expenditure reduction policy is about 
eliminating waste and poor management. The hon. member for 
Joliette discussed this at some length this afternoon. 
Eliminating duplication of services by provincial and federal 
governments would, we believe, generate a potential savings of 
$2 to $3 billion, while duplication among various federal 
departments would also be a prime target. Operating 
expenditures of departments and federal agencies would be cut 
as well.
<P>
	Incidentally the government's gross operating expenditures 
totalled nearly $35 billion, or 27 per cent of gross program 
spending, in the 1993-94 Estimates. Some departments have 
relatively high operating expenditures: Public Works, 10 per 
cent; Transport, 6 per cent; National Revenue, 6.5 per cent; 
RCMP, nearly 5 per cent; Supply and Services, 3 per cent.
<P>
	Our policy for reducing operating expenditures also aims to 
increase the relative size of government capital spending in 
relation to operating expenditures. Capital expenditures help 
generate income for several years because these are 
investments. No more borrowing money to pay the groceries. 
We also have to change the nature of the government's capital 
expenditures.
<P>
	In the 1993-94 Estimates, more than 53 per cent of gross 
capital spending was for the Department of National Defence, 
mainly to purchase warships and weaponry. The Bloc Quebecois 
feels this kind of investment is not very productive.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	With respect to managing public expenditures, the Bloc 
Quebecois also advocates a thorough evaluation of government 
spending programs. Program evaluations address three needs. 
The information gathered is used, among other things, to help 
make decisions about resource allocation, to help Quebecers 
determine the value obtained from their tax dollars and to enable 
public servants to take responsibility for results rather than 
process.
<P>
	I would also like to point out that departments spent only 
$28.5 million of the overall government budget on the program 
evaluation function in 1991-92. The central branch reporting to 
the Office of the Comptroller General spent only $2.9 million on 
evaluation.
<P>
	It should also be noted that two major problems, one 
quantitative and the other qualitative, are associated with the 
evaluation of government programs. As for the quantitative 
problem, it is worth noting that in 1989-90 and 1991-92, 
expenditures related to program evaluation fell by 28 per cent. 
In fact, the number of program evaluations has been declining 
for the past seven years, that is since 1987-88. Since that time, 
99 program evaluation reports have been produced, whereas in 
1991-92, only 90 evaluation studies were produced. That is very 
few indeed and the number is steadily declining.
<P>
	Government expenditures for 16 programs totalled $124.5 
billion in 1991-92. Only two of these programs were the subject 
of a thorough evaluation. Not enough attention is paid to major 
programs. Evaluation studies conducted over a seven-year 
period covered approximately 24 per cent of the government's 
program expenditures in 1991-92.
<P>
	Thus, if we take into account expenditures on servicing the 
national debt, only 18 per cent of expenditures were in fact 
covered in the last seven years. Evaluations did not focus on the 
most expensive programs. It is estimated that the rate of 
coverage of programs with expenditures of over $250 million is 
less than half that of programs spending $250 million or less. In 
short, the number of evaluations is steadily decreasing. Very few 
have been conducted and those that have been cover programs 
with smaller expenditures.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="742"> 742 </A></B>
<P>
	As for the qualitative problem I referred to earlier, by 
locating the evaluation units in the departments, the immediate 
needs of managers take precedence over the needs of 
government and the interests of the general public. When 
questioned by the Auditor General, those responsible in the 
departments for the program evaluation function responded that 
in their view, the main purpose of an evaluation was to help 
management solve operational problems. Thus, they are 
overlooking the essential purpose of program evaluation which 
is to assess the efficiency of programs and call them into 
question if necessary, all in the interest of ensuring optimal 
resource allocation.
<P>
	It should be noted that this kind of information would be most 
useful to Parliament in helping it decide how best to allocate 
resources and to the public in helping it rate the government's 
performance. The fact of the matter is that evaluations cover 
only operational matters, not those aspects relating to the 
relevance or cost-effectiveness of programs.
<P>
	Evaluations cover only portions of programs or small-scale 
programs. There is no systematic process in place for evaluating 
programs affecting more than one department. We in the Bloc 
Quebecois find the situation within the federal government with 
respect to program evaluation totally unacceptable. The 
President of the Treasury Board and the Minister of Finance 
must take action as soon as possible to remedy the problem.
<P>
	The information that could be culled from well-produced 
program evaluations would be very useful to parliamentarians. 
Indeed, it would make it possible to identify successful 
programs which no longer produce the desired results and which 
could be replaced by more efficient ones.
<P>
	Given the size of the deficit and the to say the least anemic 
economic recovery, it is critically important that existing 
resources be allocated and utilized as efficiently as possible. 
Program evaluation becomes an essential exercise under the 
circumstances. Without effective program evaluation, the 
government is simply not in a position to allocate in the best 
possible way the financial resources it receives from the 
taxpayers. Parliamentarians are being asked to work in the dark 
and to allocate resources without knowing all the facts.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	According to a study made by the Auditor General, proper 
program evaluation can result in significant savings. For 
example, in 1990, the Department of Finance carried out an 
evaluation on the effects of the Cape Breton Investment Tax 
Credit. Since the study indicated that the program was not doing 
what was expected of it, it was abandoned. This tax measure 
involved more than $500 million in tax revenue foregone during 
the period it was in effect. The loss in revenue would have 
continued to accrue while this inefficient program was allowed 
to go on, which is why it was abandoned.
<P>
	The people would benefit from better program evaluation and 
would also be able to assess the performance of their elected 
representatives, which would help to improve democracy.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to say that, in order to avoid waste 
and to optimize the allocation of tax resources, the Bloc wants 
all programs to be subject to an evaluation process and the civil 
servants in charge of program evaluation to report directly to a 
Standing Parliamentary Committee on Program Evaluation. The 
officials in charge of these programs have to be accountable to 
Parliament and justify the allocation and use of public resources 
on their programs.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke):</B> Mr. Speaker, allow me 
to congratulate the hon. member for La Prairie on his comments 
and on his election. This is the first time I have the opportunity 
to do so since he became a member of this House.
<P>
	His comments on program evaluation are interesting. I urge 
him to pursue these issues with the chairpersons of the various 
committees, because these people can undertake program 
evaluations and they do so in a larger context than is possible for 
the Auditor General, and even with the departments themselves, 
as I and other members opposite have seen in the past; indeed, 
there are numerous opportunities to do so.
<P>
	In any case, I have a question for the hon. member and I would 
like to know the position of the Bloc Quebecois on a statement 
made yesterday by the Canadian Life and Health Insurance 
Association, which suggests that the federal government is 
considering taxing group insurance benefits, as well as health 
and dental insurance benefits. Such a measure would have an 
impact on some 20 million Canadians and would directly affect 
nine million workers across the country.
<P>
	Using its own data, the Association indicated that a person 
with no dependent and an annual salary of around $25,000 
would have to pay $275 more per year in taxes. A family earning 
about $40,000 a year would face a tax increase of $425. 
Similarly, a family with two salaries totalling $80,000 a year 
would have to pay $700 more in taxes if, in its next budget, the 
federal government decides to introduce this measure.
<P>
	I want to put this in the appropriate context, so that the hon. 
member for La Prairie can give me the Bloc Quebecois position 
on this issue. This measure would be introduced while we 
anticipate a very comprehensive debate on health care in Canada 
and, I suppose, on the role of the federal and provincial 
governments, the private sector, the taxpayers, and so on and so 
forth.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="743"> 743 </A></B>
<P>
	Does the member not find it alarming that this measure could 
have such serious consequences on the budget of every 
individual and family? Does he not find it even more alarming 
that the government is proposing a comprehensive debate on 
health care but would introduce such a measure before even 
holding that debate?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bélisle:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Sherbrooke for his question.
<P>
	The position of the Bloc Quebecois on this matter is that 
poorer Canadians are protected by universal social programs. 
People who want more protection can contribute to a private 
supplementary plan, and that is what they do. As I was saying 
earlier, my constituents are mostly middle-class people and 
they already are the most heavily taxed. By taxing those 
insurance premiums, the Liberal government would be 
increasing, in a covert way, the tax burden of middle-class 
Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	We, in the Bloc Quebecois, are totally opposed to this covert 
way of taxing even more heavily middle-class taxpayers who 
already carry most of the tax burden. There has been a lot of talk 
about tax shelters. Canadians with high incomes can use tax 
shelters to avoid paying thousands of dollars in taxes.
<P>
	The disadvantaged are protected by a series of social 
programs and, often, it is the middle-class people who find 
themselves in the middle of the social or economic pyramid and 
who have to shoulder all the burden. As I said earlier, we, in the 
Bloc Quebecois, are totally opposed to this covert way of taxing 
even more heavily those who already pay most of the taxes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> First of all, Mr. 
Speaker, let me say that the subject we are debating today is one 
of great concern to me. The present state of Canadian public 
finances threatens certain established social programs and 
affects individuals as well as businesses.
<P>
	One of the main reasons for this debate is the urgent need for 
action in that area. New policy directions must to be laid on the 
table. I would like to say that the decisions we will be making in 
the next couple of years will determine our future, especially for 
the people of my generation. In spite of the fact that, in some 
regards, we have enjoyed many services and a relatively 
comfortable life, what we have inherited has all the appearances 
of a heavy burden that does not make the future look very bright 
for us.
<P>
	When you combine this cumbersome debt with a tight job 
market for young people, you can easily understand part of the 
reason for their despair.
<P>
	I want the members of this House to know that it is through the 
eyes of the young generation that I will judge the actions of this 
government over the next few years. Its decisions will have to 
reflect a real concern for the long term.
<P>
	Pre-budget consultations have often given Ministers of 
Finance an opportunity to put forward, concerning their 
forthcoming Budget, ideas about which they had already made 
up their minds. Take the idea of eliminating the $100,000 capital 
gains tax shelter. Several people were able to take advantage of 
this shelter and have already reached the limit. So, they will not 
be the ones affected in the future, but rather it will be the young 
generation. Either this shelter will not be available to them or 
they will not be able to take advantage of it in the future.
<P>
	I simply want to make it clear who will in fact be affected by 
the proposed measures. We will be called upon to contribute 
significantly to solving the public finance problem in the future 
and we are prepared to do our share starting now, but there is a 
need to identify-and rightly so-who will be affected by the 
measures put forward.
<P>
	Moving to the main thrust of my remarks, three approaches 
can be contemplated to solve the public finance problem: 
expenditure reduction, higher revenues or lower refinancing of 
the debt. Of course, the best course of action would be a 
combination of these approaches. I will only deal with revenues.
<P>
	The Liberals, in their famous red book, and the Conservatives 
before them, based their deficit reduction estimates on the 
expectation that the economy would grow in the years to come. 
The Prime Minister referred to this during question period 
today.
<P>
	We are all looking forward to a recovery in the not too distant 
future, but it is far from certain that governments will be able to 
raise as much money as they expected during this growth period. 
Let me explain.
<P>
	In the past, a 1 per cent growth in the economy used to 
produce a 1.5 per cent increase in government revenues. Today, 
a 1 per cent growth in the economy or its leading indicator, the 
Gross Domestic Product, produces a mere .5 per cent increase in 
revenues.
<P>
	We can clearly see a big problem looming on the horizon. Let 
us take the current year. The Minister of Finance estimates that 
the current year deficit will be $12.4 billion higher than was 
forecast in the March 1993 Budget. It must be noted that 72 per 
cent of this deficit is due to an unexpected shortfall in revenue. 
An analysis of the first seven months of the year provides 
valuable insight. During this period, government revenues fell 
5.7 per cent, as compared to the same period last year. And there 
is cause for concern due to the fact that this drop occurred as the 
Canadian economy was recording a slight growth.
<P>
	Also, the 1993 Budget forecast that the growth in revenues 
was going to keep pace with the increase in the Gross Domestic 
Product over the following five years. I guess I do not need to 
tell you that much will have to be done to readjust these 
forecasts.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="744"> 744 </A></B>
<P>
	How can such a situation be explained?
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	Obviously, the first explanation that comes to mind is the 
extent of the underground economy. The Minister of National 
Revenue himself said soon after the election that he estimated 
this underground economy at $56 billion, a conservative 
estimate according to some analysts. The underground economy 
accounts for close to 15 per cent of economic activity and comes 
a lot closer to $100 billion.
<P>
	To illustrate how dramatic this is, last November Gallup 
asked Quebecers and Canadians whether they had participated 
in the underground economy in the last 12 months. In response, 
33 per cent of Canadians and 42 per cent of Quebecers admitted 
having paid cash to avoid paying taxes. Two words explain this 
reaction: fairness and equity. People feel that the way the 
government collects revenues is unfair and inequitable.
<P>
	Let us look at personal income tax: this year's receipts from 
personal income taxes are $1.1 to $1.5 billion lower than 
forecast in the 1993 Budget. People feel overtaxed. In the last 
few years, we have gone beyond tax effectiveness, especially for 
the middle class.
<P>
	The GST was the last straw. It is clear that government 
revenues can only increase through higher income tax levels for 
the middle class, directly or indirectly.
<P>
	The dissatisfaction of the middle class is understandable 
when we look at a few figures. In 1991, 368,000 people reported 
revenues of $60 billion, for an average personal income of 
$163,000, on which they only paid 18 per cent federal tax while 
the basic taxation level in this category is 29 per cent. On this 
point, the Bloc intends to press the government to eliminate tax 
shelters benefiting high-income taxpayers.
<P>
	Let us move on to the taxes on corporate profits. Revenues 
from corporate taxes are very sensitive to economic activity 
since corporate profits are less stable than personal incomes. 
This year's corporate tax revenues are about $850 million lower 
than forecast in the 1993 Budget. The Finance Minister told us 
during today's question period that the next few years will not be 
easy in this regard, since many businesses will be allowed to 
carry forward the losses incurred in the last few years.
<P>
	Individuals often complain that many companies in Quebec 
and Canada do not pay taxes on their profits. Let us look at 1987, 
a year of strong economic growth, when 90,000 Canadian and 
Quebec businesses made $27 billion in profits without paying a 
single cent in tax. That is one reason why Canadians are 
unhappy.
<P>
	To prevent such unfairness in the future, the government 
should impose a minimum tax on corporations. It would then be 
able to collect a minimum level of taxes from profitable 
businesses even if they try to avoid paying taxes through tax 
shelter strategies. A global solution to the debt problem calls for 
involving businesses in this collective effort.
<P>
	A few words on auditing. Auditing is one element of revenue 
collection that should be improved. A significant part of the 
economy avoids taxes because of fraud or of errors made by 
taxpayers in their tax returns. In fact, in a 1990 study the 
Department of National Revenue estimates at $1.2 billion the 
potential supplementary contributions. Additional audit 
measures taken in the past produced promising results. We 
should think about doing more in this respect in the future. We 
must not only reinforce auditing but also simplify taxation, 
which has become so complex that its effectiveness is affected.
<P>
	In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, to help the government avoid 
losing significant revenues due to incorrect or fraudulent 
returns, the Bloc Quebecois thinks that the Department of 
National Revenue should have better resources available to 
audit returns, as the Auditor General has been proposing in his 
reports for the last few years.
<P>
	I would like to say a few words on the infamous GST. The 
revenues from this source will be almost $1 billion lower than 
forecast in the 1993 Budget. Moreover, this tax is so complex 
that arrears will amount to between $800 and $900 million in 
1994 according to the data in the Auditor General's last report.
<P>
	The GST replaced another tax. Its advantage is that it is a 
value added tax. From an economic standpoint, this type of tax 
is more efficient as it does not affect the relative costs of 
resources to the same extent. Nevertheless, administering it is 
very complex, both for the government and for businesses, 
especially small ones. The fact that 576,000 registered GST 
collectors have not produced all their returns illustrates this 
point well.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	The Prime Minister promised to replace it with another tax by 
1996, but that target date is too far off. We must start to work 
now to replace it much sooner. People are expecting results on it 
quickly and we will have to act much more speedily. People are 
expecting results soon and the whole administrative aspect of 
this goods and services tax will have to be improved. We 
definitely intend to press the government to keep its election 
commitments and to keep them sooner.
<P>
	One final point on sources of revenue, namely excise taxes 
other than energy taxes. Of course, this means taxes on tobacco, 
alcoholic beverages and jewels. Everyone now knows the extent 
of smuggling. Although taxes on products which affect health 
are justified, cigarettes taxes and the whole tax system have 
contributed to creating a monster in our society today.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="745"> 745 </A></B>
<P>
	A fast way to end smuggling must be put forward and this 
solution must involve lower taxes. Control must also be 
tightened and the same standard of justice must apply to all. 
Nothing prevents the government from pursuing a plan to fight 
tobacco consumption and to discourage tobacco use especially 
among young people and even including this plan in its strategy. 
We must realize that the smuggling problem is very serious and 
does much to undermine the confidence people have in our 
institutions.
<P>
	In conclusion, the recovery will not do as much as believed to 
improve the government's finances. The reason is simple: the 
underground economy and people's lack of confidence in the 
whole system, the whole Canadian tax system. This 
underground economy is growing out of this lack of confidence 
and especially because of two words that I mentioned 
previously: justice and equity, on which a lot of work needs to be 
done in the future.
<P>
	The balance between individual and corporate taxation and 
between the middle and wealthier classes must be restored by 
abolishing unfair tax shelters which are often unproductive. 
Audit controls must be increased and tax returns simplified. The 
administrative difficulties with the GST must also be resolved 
quickly. Finally, the problem of cigarette smuggling must be 
ended once and for all.
<P>
	Our future and our social contract are at stake in the way the 
government collects revenue. Much of the mistrust of 
institutions, parliamentarians and people in authority and power 
is due to the unjust, unfair tax system. It is time to move and the 
government must improve efficiency in the management of 
public funds.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened carefully to the comments made by the 
member opposite, and even though I seldom agree with the Bloc 
Quebecois members, I must say that I share his feelings 
regarding the need to put a stop to smuggling. Needless to say 
that, as the member representing the riding of 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, which includes Akwesasne, I will 
fully support any measure which might be taken, and which I 
hope the federal government will take soon to eliminate 
contraband. I do hope we will convince those stubborn members 
of the Ontario Legislature that the problem is not one which 
exists exclusively in Quebec, or in a region of Canada called 
Quebec, to use the words of Fred Laughren, the Treasurer of 
Ontario.
<P>
	Two other comments were made by the hon. member and I 
want to ask him a question on those. The member referred to the 
issue of streamlining income tax returns. It just so happens that 
today I contacted Revenue Canada about something currently 
allowed in the tax return, namely the possibility of contributing 
or overcontributing to a registered retirement savings plan. As 
the hon. members know, we and our constituents all have the 
option of making an overcontribution of up to $8,000 to an 
RRSP. However, Revenue Canada has currently no  way of 
keeping tab of these overcontributions, unlike, for example, in 
the case of the capital gain exemption, for which a cumulative 
total is calculated, thus enabling Revenue Canada to know 
whether a taxpayer has used $25,000, $30,000, $35,000, 
$40,000 or more of the total tax-free capital gain. However, 
such control does not exist for overcontributions made to a 
registered retirement savings plan, and I wanted to point this out 
to the members of this House. As for simplifying tax returns, I 
think that rather than being an area requiring streamlining, it is 
one where we need to keep data which are not currently being 
kept.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	Finally, the hon. member opposite tells us that we cannot 
replace the GST in two years because it will be too late. Are we 
then to conclude that when this House asks its members to refer 
the GST issue to the Finance Committee, we can expect a quick 
and even a unanimous approval from the Bloc Quebecois, so that 
this review can be completed and a recommendation can be 
made as quickly as possible to the House?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brien:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his very long 
question.
<P>
	I would like to mention, first of all, that he said he agreed with 
me on the smuggling issue; I hope he agrees with me on the other 
points of my speech, particularly as regards tax breaks.
<P>
	The member said we should consider another very special 
measure, that is to keep a record of overpayments or 
overcontributions to RRSPs. As you know, it is for such reasons 
we have, for a long time, requested the creation of parliamentary 
committees who would study public expenditures, including tax 
expenditures. It would be a pleasure to hear such comments 
through these committees and to participate in the proceedings.
<P>
	The last point in the member's question dealt with GST. 
Naturally, we will be happy to proceed diligently, provided, and 
I want to stress this point, provided we work towards replacing 
this tax with one that will be more efficient, that will respect this 
and that will not be, contrary to what we heard during the 
campaign, a hidden tax which could be much higher.
<P>
	I ask the member, in that context, to convince his prime 
minister not to implement a hidden tax, but a visible one so that 
people can trust our tax system; if that is the case, the opposition 
will be happy to co-operate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak in this very important debate today. I have over 
the past couple of years had a number of meetings with my 
constituents in the Yukon during which we have discussed 
details of a budget and what kind of society and what kind of 
Canada we want to live in.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="746"> 746 </A></B>
<P>
	I want to make the point at the outset that a budget is more 
than simply figures. It indicates whether we will have the 
hallmarks of prosperity or whether we will have the seeds of 
economic stagnation.
<P>
	I have been here for pretty well all of the debate today and I 
remind members of this House that I have not heard anyone refer 
to the fact that we have to look at this budget in terms of being 
able to accomplish the tasks that are outstanding in Canada as 
well.
<P>
	Regarding the resolution this House took unanimously in 
1989 to eliminate poverty by the year 2000, I hope the House 
will rededicate itself to that goal and this budget will be the 
beginning of that. Also, to accomplish the goals to which we as 
Canadians and the New Democratic Party are committed which 
are to ensure that Canada's First Nations are truly and fairly 
dealt with and that there is funding available because it does cost 
money to complete the very important land claims and 
self-government negotiations which must take place in this 
country.
<P>
	On the specific areas of the budget there are three that I want 
to briefly touch on in the time that I have; namely, taxation, debt 
and deficit and employment creation.
<P>
	The first is a fair taxation system. The middle class is 
overburdened. We certainly do not need to see a whole raft of 
new taxes to cause further cynicism in our population about our 
tax system. To deal with that cynicism we also have to deal with 
the inequities and the fact that individual Canadians are now 
paying a far greater proportion of the tax revenue than 
corporations and that many wealthy individuals have the 
opportunity to avoid paying taxes.
<P>
	We urge the Minister of Finance to bring in a fair and 
equitable tax system. I want to give several examples of how 
that could be done. The first is in terms of closing costly tax 
loopholes and making the system fair.
<P>
<B>(1735 ) </B>
<P>
	The government can look at such things as the business 
entertainment deduction which costs hundreds of thousands of 
dollars to Canadian taxpayers. While some people cannot even 
afford a lunch, I am not sure that people should be privileged to 
be deducting their high cost lunches at taxpayers expense.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> A very good idea.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solomon:</B> Two martinis.
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLaughlin:</B> There are other such things that the 
government can do in terms of the family trusts, those trusts that 
allow the rich to shelter their income from the tax revenues. 
Clearly a fair tax system does not allow this.
<P>
	I must say in the last Parliament the members opposite in the 
Liberal government were not outspoken against the previous 
government's attempts and legislation to even extend the period 
of time that these family trusts would be exempt from taxes.
<P>
	I challenge the Minister of Finance to show a new path and to 
show that we are really prepared to deal with this element of tax 
fairness.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solomon:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLaughlin:</B> Certainly the area of tax expenditure that is 
not helping the majority of Canadians is that we should reduce 
the upper limits on the RRSP contributions. We feel the RRSP 
program is important but if we reduce the upper limitations 
which right now are basically directed to those making $90,000 
a year we would bring more fairness into that particular area.
<P>
	A minimum corporate tax is absolutely essential. We still 
have over 63,000 profitable corporations not paying one cent of 
tax. We cannot ask individuals to do more and continue to allow 
those profit making corporations to do nothing.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLaughlin:</B> On the debt and deficit question I think we 
must take a minute to look at how we got in this mess in the first 
place. As was said, we are doomed to repeat history if we do not 
pay attention to what has happened. It is true that in the 1970s 
many of the tax measures of the previous Liberal government 
did begin to create the inequities that we see and lead to this gap 
which meant that we began seeing an ever increasing debt.
<P>
	In the following years subsequent governments and the 
previous government over the last nine years implemented 
monetary policies which dealt only with controlling inflation, 
ignoring the effect on rising unemployment.
<P>
	They brought in a North American free trade deal and the free 
trade agreement with the United States which cost Canadians 
hundreds of thousands of jobs leading again to decreased 
revenues.
<P>
	Look at the monetary policy of the past government, the effect 
of bad trade deals on employment and decreased generation of 
revenue. It was disappointing that the Liberal government 
decided once coming into power that it would continue those 
two regressive monetary and trade solutions.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It embraced Mulroney.
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLaughlin:</B> At the same time after the Liberal 
government embraced the policies of the previous Conservative 
government in terms of trade and monetary policy, I want to 
remind the government that one of the things that lead again to 
increasing debt and deficit was the implementation of the goods 
and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="747"> 747 </A></B>
<P>
services tax at a time when we saw decreasing revenues from 
employment and high interest rates devastating the agricultural  
sectors, small business and on top of that they got the GST.
<P>
	We in this party have fought long and hard for tax fairness. We 
believe that the goods and services tax is certainly a tax measure 
which has not only not worked but has increased the economic 
recession that we are in at this time.
<P>
	Finally, on the whole issue of employment, without an 
employment strategy, without a clear industrial strategy we will 
never deal with the structural problems of debt and deficit. The 
fact that we see decreasing revenues is directly related to 
increasing unemployment statistics. Every unemployed person 
in this country costs the federal revenue $17,500 a year. If you 
take 1.5 million people unemployed that is something like $26 
or $27 billion a year that we are losing in revenue because of 
unemployment.
<P>
<B>(1740 ) </B>
<P>
	It is time for parliamentarians and this government to say that 
Canada cannot afford unemployment. That is what we cannot 
afford. The social and human costs are far too great and the 
economic costs are devastating this country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solomon:</B> Right on.
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLaughlin:</B> I therefore want to urge the government to 
implement programs that will be an investment in our future 
such as research and development, the education of our young 
people, retraining for those who are displaced in the work place.
<P>
	I would also say that we in our own job creation plan have 
supported an infrastructure program and think it is very 
important but there are two kinds of infrastructure. There is the 
physical infrastructure of highways, roads, municipal services 
and information technology, and there is also the social 
infrastructure. If we ignore the fact that the social infrastructure 
is a part of our economic system we will have missed the point.
<P>
	I urge the government to ensure that the social infrastructure 
of education and health care is maintained at a level which will 
be important for our country. On that point, I would like to 
specifically mention the need to go forward once and for all with 
a national child care program so that parents can work and the 
children will have an opportunity for the responsible care that is 
in the interest of our future citizens.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLaughlin:</B> There are many things that the government 
can do in this budget. We all must be cognizant of the reduction 
of expenditures. When it comes to following the Auditor 
General's report, I hope this government will do better than the 
previous one which seemed to simply ignore it. I urge the 
government to look at the recommendations in this report. They 
are very clear and can be acted upon now without further major 
study.
<P>
	We must look at expenditures. We have to be prudent in our 
expenditures. However, we must also balance that in a fair and 
equitable way for all Canadians. This government has an 
opportunity in this budget to lead a new way, not simply to 
follow the regressive ways of the previous government. I urge it 
to do so to give Canadians hope and to get Canadians back to 
work.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
leader of the NDP for her comments.
<P>
	I have great concerns because in the city of Saint John I have 
3,500 people who work at our shipyard building Canadian 
frigates for the government. That program will be winding down 
at the end of this year, 1994. On two occasions in the House I 
have heard my colleagues from the Bloc question the Minister of 
Transport, my friend from the province of New Brunswick, 
about the <I>Lucy Maud Montgomery</I> ferry and whether he was 
going to give that contract to the Davie shipyard which also 
needs work.
<P>
	I do not have a problem with this if the contract is going to that 
shipyard because its workers need jobs, but I have a great 
problem if there is not going to be a contract for the city of Saint 
John shipyard. If that is the case, then I would like to know from 
the Minister of Transport if the <I>Lucy Maud Montgomery</I> ferry 
will go out to tender so that our shipyard will be able to bid on it 
or if there is a special contract for the shipyard for the city of 
Saint John. If not, I have 3,500 people at the end of this year who 
will be looking for work and that is a major concern.
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLaughlin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would be happy to answer 
for the Minister of Transport. We used to sit very close together 
on this side of the House.
<P>
	I would like to address the very serious comments made by the 
previous speaker. While I will not answer directly the specifics 
that she raised, which is obviously for the government to 
answer, I would like to raise in part what she is referring to and 
has something to do with her issue and that is the whole issue of 
economic equity in this country and the fact that we are a large 
and diverse country with large rural populations as well as urban 
populations. It must be indicated to Canadians in the budget that 
the government has a true concern for every region of this 
country. We in the north often feel we have been left out. I know 
many areas of the country feel that way, that there is a lot of 
attention on central Canada and not so much on other parts of the 
country. It will be extremely important that the minister show 
through this budget that the government wants to see fairness 
and equity in economic development in every part of this 
country, rural and urban.
<P>

<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I found myself strangely agreeing with some of the comments 
made by the hon. member for Yukon, which did surprise me.
<P>
	However, there are a couple of points I would like to make. 
First of all, it was mentioned by the hon. member that it cost 
$17,500 to have someone unemployed. I would hasten to point 
out we know by statistics that it costs $60,000 for the 
government to create a job that will employ that same person.
<P>
	With regard to national child care, I would like to ask the hon. 
member if she is suggesting a multi-tiered system which she 
abhors so much in the medical system in child care or, 
conversely, is she suggesting that we should have a national 
system which will allow the people she is concerned about not 
paying their fair share, the rich, and allow them to drop their 
children off so that those who really need help can have theirs 
free instead of helping only those who need it.
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLaughlin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I presume the member is 
referring to a child care system that is universal and accessible. 
Those two hallmarks are extremely important in any kind of 
child care system.
<P>
	We have proposed a national child care system that would be 
participatory between the federal government, the provinces 
and territories and those using child care service. I think that is a 
fair and equitable way to do it.
<P>
	The hon. member who said he finds himself surprised to agree 
with me will want to also agree that the children of this country 
deserve a chance from this House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Robert Gauthier (Ottawa-Vanier):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the few minutes I have, I would like to talk about 
efficiency and effectiveness in public administration.
<P>
	I tabled today, as hon. members know, a Bill which would 
allow the Auditor general of Canada to prepare ad hoc reports on 
audits conducted by his office. At the present time, the Auditor 
general can only table an annual report. We know that it usually 
is a substantial tome which captures the interest of the media for 
about 24 hours, 48 hours at the most, and is then forgotten. Very 
few people are following up on the recommendations made with 
respect to the management of public spending.
<P>
	Yet, those reports contain many recommendations to improve 
public administration and save substantial amounts of money 
for Canadian taxpayers. If Bill C-207 tabled today is passed by 
this House, it could strengthen government administration. It 
will be more efficient and more effective if the House of 
Commons and the general public are better informed, on a 
timely basis, on the problems encountered by a large and 
complex administration like the federal government.
<P>
	This pre-budget debate provides us with an opportunity to 
talk about economic recovery, job creation and deficit 
reduction. Some argue that in order to reduce the deficit, we 
have to cut spending drastically. The Reform Party wants a 6 per 
cent cut, an amount which would have, in my opinion, a serious 
and negative impact on the poor, the elderly and the less 
well-off.
<P>
	Others believe that a reduction of the deficit can only be 
achieved by increasing revenues and creating jobs. I will talk in 
a moment about solutions which seem appropriate to me in order 
to reduce the deficit.
<P>
	I am among those who believe that in the present situation, we 
must increase revenues to create jobs and ease our financial 
problems.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	If we want to get rid of the deficit and the debt, without 
compromising existing benefits and disappointing Canadians, 
we must act quickly.
<P>
	As we all know, the federal debt now exceeds $500 billion; it 
represents 70 per cent of the GDP. This year only, servicing the 
public debt will probably cost more than $40 billion or 6 per cent 
of the GDP. The debt management program, the largest the 
government administers, costs $40 billion. The amount of 
taxpayers'money used to pay off what we borrow drains the 
economy, there is no doubt about that. Because of the debt, we 
cannot afford to take advantage of many opportunities for 
growth. The billions of dollars we spend on the debt could be put 
to a much more productive use. Hence, the urgency to balance 
our budget.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I believe we can grow out of our deficit. We can get out of our 
financial and fiscal difficulties through growth. Tough decisions 
will be needed. We have to be more efficient so we can be more 
competitive.
<P>
	We are re-evaluating some existing programs at this time. 
Social programs are under scrutiny. Our defence and foreign 
policy programs will each be under public review soon. Why not 
evaluate some of our fiscal programs? Why not look at all 
government programs to ensure that they are efficiently 
provided and just as importantly they are effectively reaching 
the goals that were set by Parliament when we adopted those 
programs?
<P>
	Our debt management program, the largest program this 
government administers, has never been evaluated as to its 
efficiency or effectiveness. This huge program should be 
critically examined by Parliament as soon as possible.
<P>
	I can speak with some knowledge of the subject because I 
chaired the public accounts committee for about three years. We 
continually came back to the House and said it was absolutely 
essential that a program the size of the debt be managed as 
efficiently and effectively as possible. We recommended the 
program be subjected to that kind of program evaluation. It has 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="749"> 749 </A></B>
<P>
not  been and I ask the government to listen attentively to this 
recommendation.
<P>
	We should examine the type of instruments we use to borrow; 
Canadian funds versus foreign funds, long term versus short 
term. We dipped into the employee pension funds last year to the 
tune of $75 billion. This year we borrowed $7.2 billion to pay off 
our deficit.
<P>
	Is it the appropriate thing to do? Is it efficient? Is it effective? 
I do not know. I know we are doing it. I would like to have the 
House look at this program and evaluate it as to its efficiency 
and effectiveness.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We must review the government's fiscal expenditures, all of 
them, and assess how appropriate they are. Some of them have 
become tax loopholes costing the federal government several 
billions of dollars. Due to such shortfall in tax revenues and 
public mismanagement, honest taxpayers are paying 
increasingly higher taxes and receiving decreasing services.
<P>
	I hold federal public servants in high esteem. I have a lot of 
respect for the loyalty and commitment of federal public 
servants who, as we know, were mistreated by the previous 
government for several years.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	To increase the productivity of public servants we must 
empower them with authority, give them clear objectives, 
effective policies, which will then give us an efficient 
administration. We must insist on program evaluation in an 
aggressive manner, to identify and eliminate or improve 
programs that are less than efficient and do not respond to the 
needs of Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	There are two ways of reducing public expenditures. On the 
one hand, the government could cut expenditures by a certain 
percentage across the board, regardless of consequences, as the 
Reform Party is asking. Personally, I call that the easy but stupid 
way out.
<P>
	On the other hand, the government could and must evaluate 
the appropriateness of its programs and activities.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	For a long time I have supported the principle of program 
evaluation. It makes it possible to know whether the raison 
d'être, the goals, anticipated and actual results and program 
designs are satisfactory.
<P>
	If one does not do this then we are a bunch of navel gazers and 
will not succeed in bringing better administration to this 
country. When such evaluations are made public they increase 
the accountability of this House with the people of Canada, with 
government officials, by allowing the Auditor General to 
publish regular reports as he should to give all of us more 
information as to the administration of public funds.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	It is essential in the context of budgetary restraint that we 
have in place a good program evaluation of our administrative 
practices. It is one of the best ways to improve the allocation of 
ever scarce resources. I am not the only one who is saying this. It 
is in the report of the Auditor General, and I invite members to 
read it. That may be difficult because it is a lengthy document 
but it is worth while for any new member of Parliament at least 
to try. The report will tell you where we are going and how the 
administration of this government or the past government has 
been lacking in certain areas. It is not always easy. It requires 
time but I would recommend that members do read the report.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Managing the debt presents specific problems. As a 
percentage of the GDP, government revenues dropped from 18.1 
per cent, in 1991-92, to 17.6 per cent, in 1992-93. Such a 
downturn is due in part to a decrease in revenues from personal 
and corporate income taxes.
<P>
	Personal income tax accounted for 48 per cent of all revenues 
in 1992-93, compared to 50.2 per cent in 1991-92.
<P>
	Instead of cutting public expenditures blindly, the 
government should protect its tax base by evaluating the 
efficiency, appropriateness and raison d'être of all tax 
expenditures and eliminating tax loopholes.
<P>
	Before assessing how pertinent tax expenditures are, we must 
first ascertain whether or not they are having the desired effect. 
For example, in 1992, the Auditor General reported that 
multinationals were abusing the rules allowing them to take 
home profits tax-free thanks to tax havens. Hundreds of 
millions of dollars were lost from corporations operating abroad 
and bringing back non-taxable dividends. We said then that this 
loophole should be eliminated. I hope it will be.
<P>
	In its twelfth report, published last year, the Public Accounts 
Committee, which I chaired, recommended that the Finance 
Department review the list of designated countries. It also asked 
that we examine if it would be appropriate to transfer home, tax 
free, any income of subsidiaries or divisions operating in these 
tax havens.
<P>
	The list is very long. Some 25 countries are identified as tax 
havens. When we asked them to define a tax haven, they said it 
was a developing country. Two former committee members will 
be my witness on this. Do you know what a tax haven is? Any 
developing country. Switzerland a developing country? Sure! 
Bermuda a developing country? Why not? This is total 
nonsense. Mr. Speaker; we must examine this list, we must 
tighten up our practices. We must be serious in the evaluation of 
government programs.

minutes left for questions and comments provided you end your 
speech.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier (Ottawa-Vanier):</B> I have so much to say. The 
Department of Finance should explain what constitutes income 
from active business carried on by a corporation. I wish 
someone would give us a clear and precise definition of what the 
Department of Finance means by a tax loophole, of what they 
mean when they talk about income from active business carried 
on by a corporation as opposed to ``passive business''. I know 
this is complex, but these are all food for thought if we want to 
really understand our duty as politicians, as members of 
Parliament who must manage public affairs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simon de Jong (Regina-Qu'Appelle):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened attentively to the remarks of the hon. member for 
Ottawa-Vanier. I know the member well and I appreciate the 
work he has done in the House.
<P>
	I would like to put forward a notion and wish to have the 
reaction of the hon. member. This House has passed legislation 
on environmental review assessment. Before the government 
undertakes any major piece of construction there is an 
environmental review so that we know the impact it has on the 
environment.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	I have maintained in the past that before we present the budget 
or any changes in social policy that we have a human assessment 
review. Modern social statistics indicate that if poverty goes up 
and unemployment goes up, so do suicides, so does crime, so 
does alcohol dependency, et cetera. Therefore we could figure 
out the human costs. Before there are changes in social 
programs by a budget, should there not also be a human social 
assessment that would clearly lay out that if that measure 
produced so many more unemployed we would have so many 
suicides, so many more people in jail? In other words, lay out 
what the social costs will be before government undertakes any 
measure such as a budget.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier (Ottawa-Vanier):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
the question which is an interesting one. We are dealing with a 
budget which in all honesty must be seen under current 
constraints. The government must protect its taxpayers. I 
understand that. However, there is value in what the member has 
just said, that there are social costs. Everybody must pay their 
fair share. What I was trying to address when talking about 
efficiency and effectiveness deals with the problem he just 
raised, that is, if everybody paid their fair share we would have 
no problems putting forth good, solid social programs, health 
care programs and good day care programs.
<P>
	What is happening right now is that too many people are 
getting away with not paying their fair share of taxes. That is 
causing the rest of the population which is honest and pays its 
fair share a lot of problems. That is why we have a large deficit.
<P>
	The underground economy is a problem we should address. 
The way they get away with not paying any taxes by using all 
kinds of loopholes must also be looked at seriously and these 
loopholes must be closed.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guy H. Arseneault (Restigouche-Chaleur):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I take part in this historical 
debate today. Before starting my remarks however, I would like 
to congratulate you, Mr. Speaker. I am convinced that, under 
your direction, the House of Commons will be run in such a way 
that the faith of the people of Canada in their government and in 
this institution will be restored.
<P>
	I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the residents 
of Restigouche-Chaleur for their show of trust. I am grateful to 
them for renewing my mandate and I look forward to 
accomplishing great things with them in the years to come, not 
only for Restigouche-Chaleur, but also for Canada as a whole.
<P>
	I want to thank the Minister of Finance for his speech this 
morning and for holding this debate. This kind of consultation 
reflects a major change in how power will be exercised under a 
Liberal regime as opposed to another one. I welcome such a 
change and hope that there will be many more debates like this 
one in the future.
<P>
	A strong economy is the very foundation of a strong society. 
But how can we have a strong economy when we are facing 
numerous challenges as a nation and have many interconnected 
problems to resolve?
<P>
	Soon after coming into power, this government took major 
steps relating to infrastructure and residential renovation. By 
the way, I would like to mention the excellent work my 
colleagues have done in quickly implementing these major 
programs.
<P>
	Yet, much remains to be done. The federal debt and deficit are 
stifling this country's potential. I think that no one here can deny 
that. It is on the process of deficit reduction that we disagree.
<P>
	I would like to remind the Minister of Finance of a few crucial 
words, and I quote: ``Deficit reduction is not an end in itself. Its 
rationale is to improve productivity, real wages, and living 
standards of our children and their children. If the measures to 
cut deficits actually diminish GDP, raise unemployment, and 
reduce future oriented activities of government, business, and 
households, they do not achieve the goals that are their raison 
d'être: rather they retard them.''
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This quote is from Nobel prize winner James Tobin and 
appeared in the Liberal red book.
<P>
	I urge the minister to take a balanced approach in reducing the 
deficit. The deficit cannot be further reduced on the backs of the 
middle class. Furthermore, any move toward further drastic 
expenditure cuts will undoubtedly lead to increased 
unemployment.
<P>
	As part of a balanced approach the Minister of Human 
Resources Development began the process of renewing 
Canada's social safety net yesterday. Today's debate is an 
important step in renewing our budgetary process.
<P>
	I would suggest to the minister that we take steps toward total 
tax reform. The GST did not bring balance to the Canadian tax 
system. Today the money that runs this government is coming in 
a disproportionate manner from the taxes paid by the middle 
class.
<P>
	Over the course of the past decade the percentage of taxes 
paid by the middle class has risen dramatically while the taxes 
paid by corporations have declined. Moreover, the taxes paid on 
investment income have all but disappeared.
<P>
	What kind of message is this sending to the Canadian public? 
It says that the most expensive way to make a living is to have a 
job working for someone else. It is time for everyone to pay their 
fair share of taxes. Corporations can no longer expect to gain 
from the numerous benefits of doing business in Canada without 
contributing to the system.
<P>
	I would suggest that the minister take steps toward the 
institution of a minimum corporate tax. When one mentions a 
minimum corporate tax the business community cries that such 
a tax would make the cost of doing business in Canada 
unreasonable and therefore force it to relocate.
<P>
	These are empty threats. Over half of the total untaxed profits 
in 1987 were derived from the top 145 corporations which 
reported annual profits of $106 million on average, while 2,000 
firms earning on an average of $1 million accounted for 80 per 
cent of untaxed profits.
<P>
	These companies are reporting profits, huge profits at that, 
and they refuse to pay their fair share of taxes.
<P>
	I urge the minister to take steps to end this practice. A 
minimum level of taxation would go a long way toward 
resolving our deficit problems. May I add there are some 
individuals out here as well who pay no tax whatsoever and 
again we should look at making sure they pay their fair share of 
taxes as well.
<P>
	I would also like to remind the minister that the big losers in 
this recession have been the very future of our nation, our youth.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="753"> 753 </A></B>
<P>
	The jobless rate among youth is unacceptably high. While 
some of the jobs lost by youth over the past few years have been 
recovered nearly 60 per cent of these new jobs were part time.
<P>
	Our education programs must prepare our youth for the 
challenges that lie ahead. We must prepare them to face the 21st 
century. We must provide them not only with the knowledge and 
skills to meet the challenges that lie ahead, we must provide 
them with the hope of a better future.
<P>
	The steps the government has made toward the formation of a 
youth apprenticeship program and a Canadian youth corps are 
important in this regard.
<P>
	We must continue to increase the literacy and numeracy skills 
of our young people. We must work to ensure that there is 
increased co-operation between all levels of government and 
the establishment of national educational standards.
<P>
	We must remember that our youth will be the driving force 
behind the economic recovery and we must provide them with 
the tools to effectively and successfully meet this challenge.
<P>
<B>(1845 ) </B>
<P>
	I realize that the Minister of Finance has been handed a 
difficult task. Expectations are high. I and the citizens of 
Restigouche-Chaleur understand that there are no easy 
solutions. We believe in a balanced approach, an approach that 
recognizes that the deficit must be reduced, but only in a manner 
that is compatible with putting Canadians back to work.
<P>
	We believe in the evolution and renewal of our social 
programs so that they remain responsive to the needs of 
Canadians. We believe in major tax reform, a reform that sees 
fairness and equity as the basis of all future fiscal and monetary 
decisions by government.
<P>
	Finally, we believe in our ability as a country to overcome our 
challenges and build an even better future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with a great deal of interest to my colleague who has outlined a 
number of proposals that I think would be very constructive and 
I am sure that they will be considered by the Minister of 
Finance.
<P>
	I have known the hon. member for a number of years. He has 
worked diligently over the years in trying to be productive and 
positive and constructive in this place and I think that he has 
contributed a great deal in his pre-budget debate that we are 
having in the House of Commons.
<P>
	However, I just want to throw out a couple of other things that 
I think would aid not just the region but aid nationally in our two 
pronged approach. One is, obviously, to create jobs and to 
stimulate the economy through the budget that will be coming 
down. Another is to try as best as we possibly can to tame that 
demon that is called the national deficit and spiralling debt.
<P>
	One of the things that I think clearly could be done, and my 
colleague here who is chair of the Atlantic caucus might wish to 
comment, is to have the Minister of Finance address the real 
problems affecting the competitiveness of the port of Halifax. 
That will impact on the entire Atlantic region and will create 
jobs all throughout the economy.
<P>
	The problem with the port of Halifax and its competitiveness 
is not the port itself, it is the rail line which goes up through 
Nova Scotia, through New Brunswick and into Quebec. Over the 
last number of years we have seen that rail link become less 
competitive. The rates have not gone down, they have gone up. 
The on time delivery, the length of time that it takes have all 
impacted in a very major way on whether we have competitive 
businesses in Atlantic Canada and whether the port of Halifax 
would be poised to take advantage of the new global trade 
routes.
<P>
	In the past I have raised in this House, and it was supported by 
members of the Atlantic Liberal caucus in opposition, that the 
Minister of Finance or the Minister of Transport of the day could 
look at two very simple things that would have a major impact 
on the efficiency and effectiveness of rail transportation in 
Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	After all, if we do not have viable modes of transport in 
Atlantic Canada we will not have industry. It is as simple as that. 
We are not close enough to our markets.
<P>
	One of the things that we have suggested is that the Minister 
of Finance look at the possibility of accelerating the rate of 
depreciation for new rolling stock. That would put Canadian 
railroads on an even footing with American railroads. It is 
budgetary. It is a fiscal measure that can be taken that does not 
really cost money but which could have a major impact on the 
competitiveness of products travelling over the rail lines in 
Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	The second thing we could do, clearly, is to look at the 
avoidable costs of rail transportation. We need viable rail 
service in Atlantic Canada to be competitive. One of the things 
that has been suggested by the Atlantic Provinces 
Transportation Commission is that the federal government 
remove the excise tax on diesel fuel used for the transportation 
of goods by rail in Canada.
<P>
	Those two measures alone, which we begged the previous 
government to look at, would increase in a substantial way the 
competitive movement of goods through the Atlantic provinces, 
not just into Quebec and central Canadian and western Canadian 
markets, but down into the midwestern markets.
<P>
	I would ask the member who has just given his speech, and a 
very good address, if he could comment about those types of 
things, those regulatory changes which in a major way could 
have an impact on the viability of competitive industries, not 
just in Halifax, not just in Dartmouth, but in his area as well in 
New Brunswick.

<P>
<B>(1850) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Arseneault:</B> Mr. Speaker, I say to everyone listening that 
the hon. member for Dartmouth presented his case very well in 
opposition and in government. He has been a very forceful 
speaker and forceful lobbyist. I do not know if I can use that 
word; it is not really the right word to use. He has worked very 
hard for the port of Dartmouth and for his constituents. Time and 
time again I have sat through national caucus and Atlantic 
caucus. I have been in the House when he has asked numerous 
questions. He has made numerous speeches. He has the port of 
Halifax at heart as do all of us in Atlantic Canada. We are all one 
region. What happens in one part of the region affects the other 
economically.
<P>
	Transportation is vital to Atlantic Canada. It is vital to the 
port of Halifax. I would have to go along with the member and 
say I agree wholeheartedly with his assessment of transportation 
in Atlantic Canada. I wholeheartedly agree with his assessment 
of rail transportation.
<P>
	In northern New Brunswick rail transportation is very iffy at 
this point in time. I feel confident we will be able to maintain it. 
We have a mining area and we have ports. I think the suggestion 
of the hon. member that the rate of depreciation with regard to 
rolling stock be increased is a very good. It would make us more 
competitive with the U.S. The removal of the excise tax on 
diesel fuel whenever anything is transported via rail is also a 
good point. I hope the Minister of Finance will take them into 
consideration.
<P>
	I would like to mention another point in closing. If no one else 
has a question perhaps the member could comment on it as well. 
I am referring to the establishment of a strategic procurement 
plan where the government, rather than give out contracts carte 
blanche, would try to use the plan to stimulate the economy, to 
see if companies would put money into research and 
development as a result of receiving contracts or make money 
available in venture companies as a result of receiving 
government contracts.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
begin by complimenting the government on its use of 
pre-budget conferences in the House of Commons. A debate 
like today is an attempt to open up the budgetary process to 
Canadians and House members. I realize there are problems 
with two-way communication because the government cannot 
do what everyone says, but the process will be a real sham if the 
finance minister suffers from selective hearing to justify his 
budget.
<P>
	We look forward to his budget which will be the proof of his 
ability to listen and to keep his promises. Because previous 
Liberal and Conservative governments have neglected the 
deficit and the growing burden of debt for so long, the easy 
options for correcting the problem no longer exist.
<P>
	As a constructive alternative today I forward the idea that less 
means more. Less taxation means more revenue for government 
and commerce. Less taxation means more money in the hands of 
people who know how to spend it better. Less government 
spending means more revenue can be applied to the debt. The 
vehicle through which the government can achieve economic 
revival is a new simple, visible and proportional tax which will 
also eliminate the need for the GST.
<P>
	The need for tax reform is obvious. The Minister of Finance 
has said that many Canadians ``have withdrawn their consent to 
be governed and are demonstrating that by resorting to the 
underground economy and refusing to pay taxes''. The 
government is losing billions of dollars on an underground 
economy which is valued at $60 billion to $80 billion because 
the public has lost confidence in the government's ability to 
manage money, resources and live within its means like 
taxpayers have to do.
<P>
	Even the Prime Minister himself has acknowledged the fact 
that our present system is not working. This is not surprising. 
The present tax system is too complicated, too high and too 
unfair. These factors in combination with consistent 
government overspending are stifling our economy. The current 
government is presently acting as though there is a revenue 
problem, not a spending problem.
<P>
	However when we examine the facts we find revenues in 
excess of $126 billion. Total expenditures excluding the interest 
payments on the debt are less than $126 billion. It is the interest 
on the debt that creates the deficit. Does that sound familiar? 
Interest expenses on federal debt now total 33 cents of every tax 
dollar.
<P>
<B>(1855) </B>
<P>
	I submit it is the debt and the interest expense to service the 
debt that put in jeopardy the viability of existing programs. 
Therefore we should not be adding to the debt annually at a rate 
of $35 billion to $45 billion.
<P>
	We have misspent and overspent money for the last 25 years. 
Since 1968 we have spent more money each and every year than 
was brought in. We cannot survive like this. Creditors are 
watching this 35th Parliament very closely. The problem needs 
solving now, not next year.
<P>
	It is my belief that to stimulate the economy and to increase 
revenues for government, lenders, investors and consumers 
must possess a larger pool of disposable income. If the current 
government continues to take more money out of the economy 
through higher taxation, it will in actual fact serve as a deterrent 
to the economy creating higher unemployment and keeping us in 
this recession much longer.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="755"> 755 </A></B>
<P>
	That is why I recommend the implementation of a flat tax 
on individual and corporate income. A creation of a flat or 
proportional tax is a way to increase constructively the revenue 
side of the budget, remove incentives for an underground 
economy, restore fairness and, most important, stimulate 
economic growth which is a priority of the Liberal red book.
<P>
	This concept is not new to the House or the government. The 
member for Broadview-Greenwood who supports a single or 
flat tax wrote: ``Lower marginal rates and more take home pay 
would be an incentive to work harder and smarter. The new 
incentives plus elimination of avoidance and evasion would lead 
to this tax taking in more revenue, even with this lower rate''.
<P>
	The objective of this tax would be threefold. First, it would 
simplify current complicated tax forms so that all Canadians 
could understand them. This would increase savings for the 
Department of National Revenue in the collection of taxes and 
the monitoring of all personal and corporate tax exemptions.
<P>
	Second, it would restore equity into the tax system 
eliminating the perception that one group of taxpayer is 
favoured over another.
<P>
	Third, it would restore integrity and bring effectiveness to the 
system by eliminating the need for so many tax concessions and 
loopholes, an objective that was also stated today by the finance 
minister.
<P>
	The finance minister said today that he planned to build 
equity into the budgetary process. He then proceeded to commit 
the Liberal government to the preservation of the current social 
system without reducing any expenditures on it and hinted that 
he planned to close tax loopholes and exemptions.
<P>
	Our social programs are gold plated Cadillacs we cannot 
afford. They can be replaced with a less expensive model 
without hurting the efficient delivery of the same social 
programs. The finance minister stated that Canadians can expect 
another deficit in the range of $40 billion.
<P>
	Once again for the 26th year in a row government will spend 
more money than it brings in. When will it stop? There is no 
commitment by the government to balance the budget or cut the 
deficit. One does not build equity as the finance minister wants 
by continually adding to the debt.
<P>
	Should the finance minister be serious in his comments that 
he is seeking input on how to balance the fiscal scales, here are 
some suggestions. First, he could target social spending to the 
truly needy and perhaps eliminate OAS payments to seniors 
whose household income is in excess of the national household 
average of $54,000. The saving would be $2 billion to $3 billion.
<P>
	Second, he could make UI self-sustaining, not by increasing 
premiums but by tightening benefits and eliminating payments 
to abusers and seasonal workers whose incomes are above 
$54,000 per year. The saving would be $3 billion to $6 billion.
<P>
	Third, he could eliminate subsidies to businesses, 
megaprojects and regional development programs. The saving 
would be $1 billion to $3 billion.
<P>
	Fourth, he could cut the Department of National Defence 
budget by 6 per cent. The saving would be $660 million.
<P>
	Fifth, he could privatize crown corporations and apply the 
sale proceeds to our national debt. The saving would be $2 
billion to $3 billion and perhaps a reduction of the debt by $5 
billion to $10 billion.
<P>
	Sixth, he could rationalize spending on government programs 
to generate growth and confidence in the economy and eliminate 
the money guzzling programs in government operations. The 
saving would be $600 million, plus or minus.
<P>
	Increased taxation and a reliance on infrastructure spending 
alone will not significantly reduce the deficit or encourage a 
economic recovery. Make work programs do not create long 
term jobs. They are simply another way to spend taxpayers' 
money.
<P>
	When the money runs out for the contractors and construction 
workers under the Liberal plan, the jobs will stop. Taxpayers 
will then be left with an even bigger debt to be serviced through 
increased taxation. What if the interest rate goes up? How will 
we service that debt? Where will the money come from? 
Canadians are still paying for programs created by previous 
governments during the seventies and eighties. The federal 
government's responsibility is to create a healthy economic 
environment that favours investment, encourages initiative and 
risk taking, and protects the environment.
<P>
<B>(1900) </B>
<P>
	It is widely known that outside investors prefer to do business 
where governments are fiscally responsible. This is why the 
government must get a firmer handle on expenditures, not just 
raise taxes.
<P>
	Alberta Treasurer Jim Dinning said recently: ``If you put 
more money into government hands they don't save it; they 
spend it''. If the purposes of taxes is to provide peace, good 
order and good government in Canada then let us do it and let us 
not just talk about doing it.
<P>
	In conclusion I hope the Liberal definition of fairness in the 
taxation system does not mean let them overtax everybody.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to ask but one question and I will do it briefly 
because I see other colleagues want to raise some as well.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="756"> 756 </A></B>
<P>
	The hon. member who has just spoken will realize that the 
Liberal Party formed the government because it had the largest 
vote of any other party in the last federal election. During that 
election the Liberals stated that we wanted as a first priority 
to create jobs. We put forward a job creation plan in the short 
term to boost the economy immediately, the infrastructure 
program. We laid out our long term program: the youth corps 
and more apprenticeships, ensuring that small and medium 
sized businesses have the climate to permit them to create jobs 
as they have during the last decade. They create over 85 per 
cent of new jobs.
<P>
	I have a specific question. Is the hon. member now 
questioning, subsequent to the election, the wisdom of Canadian 
people in having elected the Liberals as a majority government? 
We said that jobs were our first priority. Is he suggesting, now 
that we have been elected, that we should now change that? He 
did say, if I recall correctly, that we should not be spending on 
the infrastructure program because it would simply increase the 
debt and it would not really make any significant difference. His 
leader made similar comments. Whose side is he on? Is it the 
people's side or his party's side?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, in response to the hon. member, I 
would like to clarify a couple of points the member asked about.
<P>
	I did not say that we did not support or justify spending on 
infrastructure. The government has $126 billion. It should 
priorize spending. If it means including infrastructure, by all 
means it is the government's responsibility now to decide how 
that money is spent efficiently and effectively.
<P>
	What we are talking about and are concerned about is 
increasing the revenue take through increased taxes. If the 
government wants to balance the budget by increasing the 
revenue just through that infrastructure program, it is not 
enough to generate new tax dollars to cover increased costs.
<P>
	With respect to another point, we also want to create jobs as 
does the Liberal Party, but our philosophy or suggestion is that 
jobs are created by the private sector which does a much better 
job. We should redistribute the wealth and put it back in private 
sector hands, not keep the money in government hands which 
has proven over and over again for the last 26 years that it does 
not know how to create long term meaningful jobs. All it knows 
how to do is take in money and mess it up. We would like to put 
that money back where it should be.
<P>
	The hon. member asked a tricky type of question regarding 
whether I supported the will of the majority of the Canadian 
public. We all know how the electoral system works. We all 
know how they got their majority. We all know where they got 
their majority.
<P>
	Many people in the country also support our point of view. It 
is not just that the Liberals have carte blanche. It is also their 
responsibility as government to listen to some constructive 
alternatives and to listen to some constructive suggestions. 
Members of the opposition are here to help them improve their 
programs. If they do not do that and if they just dictate to us, 
they will breach their commitment and responsibility just as the 
previous government did and will end up with the same fate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, let me start by saying that I agree with the hon. member 
who just spoke about the urgent need to act. He made a number 
of suggestions and while I do not necessarily agree with them, I 
do nonetheless find many of them to be interesting.
<P>
<B>(1905) </B>
<P>
	Perhaps I could add to this by saying that what really matters 
is not necessarily reviewing all social programs or adding to the 
tax burden, but rather taking advantage of this pre-budget 
period to review expenses carefully. On this point, I would like 
to draw the attention of the House to three areas in which, in my 
opinion, significant waste occurs.
<P>
	With respect to manpower, among other things, government 
duplication costs Quebec $250 million annually. The same holds 
true for regional development where fixed costs are estimated at 
$26 million.
<P>
	Lastly, there is much duplication as far as officials are 
concerned in the fields of education and social affairs. I believe 
it is important for the federal government to seriously consider 
withdrawing from these areas. Tangible savings would be 
achieved and the goal of increased efficiency would be 
achieved.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I feel that was a supportive comment 
by the hon. member and therefore I do not feel I have any need to 
add to his comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, before I begin my remarks I would like to thank the 
government for this apparently unprecedented pre-budget 
debate. May I commend the government for holding this 
discussion. It is an example of a more open consultative process 
which I hope will lead to a better budget than Canadians have 
recently been accustomed to.
<P>
	The finance minister will hear advice from all corners of this 
place during the debate. This advice will include the thoughts of 
2.5 million Canadians who voted for Reformers sitting on this 
side of the House. We will be expressing the concerns of all 
Canadians who believe that their tax money is not being spent as 
wisely as it could be. I ask the minister to act on these concerns 
when preparing the budget document.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="757"> 757 </A></B>
<P>
	The introduction of a budget is one of the most important 
functions a government performs. The budget is an outline of 
the government's fiscal plan for the country in the coming year. 
It directly affects every other government program, service and 
initiative by the way it distributes tax dollars. For this reason 
the consultative process must balance the needs and wants of 
Canadians with their ability to pay for those needs and wants.
<P>
	When preparing a budget a government must do two things. 
First the government's primary task is to lay out a plan which 
allocates the hard earned money Canadian taxpayers have 
entrusted to them. This must be done in a way to deliver federal 
services and programs in as fair and economical a manner as 
possible.
<P>
	The second consideration is one that often gets forgotten. The 
government must also treat future generations of Canadians 
fairly. It must ensure that their opportunities and quality of life 
are not hindered by the millstone of massive debt. It is unfair 
and immoral for us to spend money on ourselves today and leave 
the bills for our children and grandchildren to pay tomorrow.
<P>
	All Reformers have a mandate from Canadians to reduce the 
tax burden through controlling government expenditures. I have 
chosen today to comment about federal agriculture expenditures 
because agriculture is the primary industry in 
Kindersley-Lloydminster and, indeed in much of Canada, 
because the production of food stuffs is vital to adequately 
sustain over five billion human beings, many of whom depend 
on food produced by Canadian farmers.
<P>
	The purpose of funds earmarked for agricultural support 
should be primarily to assist agricultural producers who through 
no fault of their own find themselves financially disadvantaged. 
There are at present almost 50 different agriculture support 
programs and initiatives. They are far ranging and include loan 
guarantees for farm improvements and marketing 
co-operatives, a special Atlantic livestock initiative, a national 
farm business management program, a provincial potato 
diversion program, the southwestern Ontario soil and water 
quality enhancement program as well as the national soil 
conservation program, the Canadian agri-food development 
initiative and economic regional development initiatives.
<P>
<B>(1910 ) </B>
<P>
	There are even some in my province of Saskatchewan; a 
Canada-Saskatchewan partnership agreement on rural 
development, a Canada-Saskatchewan partnership agreement 
on irrigation based economic development.
<P>
	We have not even heard of most of these programs. They are 
not very well known and we are not sure of their actual value. 
The administrative costs of running so many different and 
sometimes overlapping or outdated programs is staggering. 
Over $3 billion per year is spent by the Ministry of Agriculture 
of which almost $900 million is spent on operating and capital 
costs alone.  These figures do not include the additional $728 
million spent under the Western Grain Transportation Act.
<P>
	This appallingly high level of overhead signals waste and 
mismanagement. By consolidating those 50 programs and 
initiatives into just a few, the government could probably save 
over $400 million and provide better support to the industry as a 
result.
<P>
	We must expose the myth that more money spent always 
results in more effective programs. In the case of agriculture it is 
not only possible to provide better support with fewer dollars 
but it is essential to the long-term sustainability of the industry, 
given the financial shape of the government. We must be 
continually vigilant to ensure that whatever programs we 
establish today will be economically viable tomorrow.
<P>
	Reform of agricultural programs is essential because we must 
be able to defend the cost of agricultural support to taxpayers, 
consumers, and future generations. Support programs that 
protect farmers and producers from situations beyond their 
control are defensible and desirable for the maintenance of our 
agricultural industry.
<P>
	Defensible support programs include, first, an actuarially 
sound federal-provincial-producer funded crop insurance 
program to protect the farmer from natural disasters such as 
floods, frosts or droughts. I urge the Minister of Agriculture to 
review the program at least in my province of Saskatchewan 
where increased premiums, lower coverage and truckloads of 
bureaucratic red tape are ruining the program. For the record I 
also want this government and all Canadians to know that 
Reformers supported the crop insurance program in the last 
election and campaigned to strengthen it.
<P>
	Second, we need an income stabilization program to help 
protect farmers from market cycles inherent in an open market 
environment. This shared federal government-producer 
program should have universal application and be based on the 
whole farm level rather than being commodity specific. 
Producers in the supply managed sectors should have access to 
this program as tariffication has been introduced. This program 
has the additional benefit of helping farmers make the transition 
into retirement, as remaining funds could be transferable to an 
RRSP account if the government does not dismantle the RRSP 
program.
<P>
	A third program promoted by Reform is a trade distortion 
adjustment program designed to compensate exporting 
producers as a direct countermeasure to foreign subsidies. The 
program should include an automatic triggering mechanism and 
be based on the historic volume of exported products. Such a 
program would not require producer premiums and should 
ensure timely payouts within the same market period. We 
suggested taking funds from the ill-designed GRIP program and 
the slowly eroding Western Grain Transportation Act and 
thereby provide a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="758"> 758 </A></B>
<P>
tool to  beleaguered producers that is superior to anything 
available today at no more cost to taxpayers.
<P>
	Reformers believe that if these improved programs are 
targeted to those producers most in need there will be many 
benefits. First, support dollars that are strategically targeted 
increase their effectiveness manyfold. Second, by delivering 
support more directly to the farmer rather than through a large 
bureaucracy the money gets where it is needed faster. Third, 
reduced overhead costs frees up more money for those in need.
<P>
	This is but one example of how the government can increase 
the effectiveness of a program for those who need it and at the 
same time reduce the burden on the taxpayers.
<P>
	If we can save dollars in something so basic and important as 
the Department of Agriculture surely there are many other 
government departments where substantial savings could be 
made. The department of aboriginal affairs for instance could be 
similarly realigned. Fewer dollars appearing in the budget could 
still mean more money in the hands of our aboriginal people. 
Another example is the Department of Multiculturalism and 
Citizenship. Justifiable functions of that department such as 
citizenship registration and human rights protection could be 
transferred to more appropriate departments such as 
employment and immigration and justice respectively. In this 
way almost the entire cost of a government department can be 
saved at the same time as continuing to deliver defensible 
services.
<P>
<B>(1915) </B>
<P>
	In conclusion, I would repeat that if within the Ministry of 
Agriculture we can increase program effectiveness and save 
$400 million by reorganizing the programs, surely there are 
economies to be made in all other departments as well.
<P>
	Once again I want to congratulate the government for holding 
this debate. I urge the Minister of Finance as well as the Minister 
of Agriculture to consider these suggestions carefully. I have not 
made these suggestions for partisan reasons or for party 
bragging rights when progress is made. I have made these 
suggestions for the good of Canada not only today but for future 
generations as well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to the comments of our colleague. He 
referred particularly at the beginning of his remarks to cutting 
and eliminating some loopholes in the tax system. He gave a few 
examples.
<P>
	I seem to remember only a few days ago the leader of his party 
talked about getting assurances from the government that a 
measure that existed for utility companies in his province 
whereby they did not have to pay taxes would be retained. I find 
the discourse rather interesting in that regard.
<P>
	I want to ask him about another so-called loophole, at least in 
the eyes of some, not me. I consider the lifetime capital gains 
exemption of $500,000 on the disposition of farmland to be a 
very valuable instrument. It is a form of pension for farmers as 
they accumulate wealth gradually. When they dispose of their 
assets they are able to keep those funds without taxes. This is 
much the same way that people accumulate by making tax 
deductible contributions toward their pension fund if they are 
teachers, factory workers or what have you.
<P>
	Does this capital gains exemption fit into one of the loopholes 
to be abolished? Does my colleague agree with me and hopefully 
with all the officials of the finance department who may be 
listening to us making these remarks now that it should be 
retained for the benefit of farmers so they can have what is the 
equivalent of a pension plan for the agricultural community?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome the hon. member's 
comments.
<P>
	He may have a couple of speeches confused. In my address I 
did not address the tax loophole issue although that certainly is a 
concern that I, many other members and also Canadians have.
<P>
	With regard to his comments regarding the $100,000 or 
$500,000 capital gains exemption, our party has looked at those 
programs as well as the RRSP program as being an effective tool 
to help Canadians to plan security for later years in life so as not 
to be a burden on Canadians through needing assistance in other 
areas.
<P>
	I feel quite comfortable in saying that our party would be 
fairly supportive of maintaining the $100,000 tax exemption for 
persons and also the $500,000 tax exemption for farmers which 
as the hon. member points out has been an effective tool to 
provide for their security in later years, once they are not 
actively in business and have sold or transferred their operations 
to family.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simon de Jong (Regina-Qu'Appelle):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
first I wish to congratulate the member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster especially on the fact that he 
brought forward the position of the Reform Party on agriculture.
<P>
	I also come from Saskatchewan where agriculture still 
remains our most important industry. There is a lot of coffee 
shop talk about what the Reform platform on agriculture really 
means. Today I heard more detail about the program of the 
Reform Party concerning agriculture.
<P>
<B>(1920 ) </B>
<P>
	I entirely agree with the hon. member that much of the 
existing systems should really be wiped out. They are a 
bureaucratic mess. They create more uncertainty for many of 
our producers in trying to figure out whether they should apply 
or whether they qualify. Quite often they do not know until the 
next crop year. It just creates a whole bunch of uncertainty.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="759"> 759 </A></B>
<P>
	Part of the problem with the existing system is that it really 
rewards the bigger producers. Approximately 75 per cent of the 
tax dollar that goes into agriculture goes to around 25 per cent 
of the producers. When the payments are based on seeded acres 
or on so many bushels then the bigger the one is, the more 
subsidy and support one receives.
<P>
	We feel that to maintain a viable rural community one has to 
maintain the medium sized family farms. That is why our 
election proposals had a basic cost of production for a certain 
number of bushels. If one was bigger the rest was done at his or 
her own risk.
<P>
	Does the Reform Party also encompass the notion of a cap to 
ensure that the tax dollar that goes to agriculture gets more 
evenly distributed among all of the producers?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Regina-Qu'Appelle for his comments and also his question. If 
he had followed our election campaign positions on agriculture 
and other issues he would be aware that Reformers promoted the 
targeting of funds in a way most beneficial to producers. We 
expanded that in a larger way. We even suggested that by 
targeting funds for social programs we might be able to salvage 
them rather than see them eroded by the government's inability 
to sustain them because of lack of funds with a growing debt.
<P>
	I concur with the member's suggestion that some of our 
programs right now are badly managed and very little thought 
has been given to how effective they could be. For instance, 
some of our agriculture programs are not good for the 
environment. One instance is the Western Grain Transportation 
Act which has no cap on it. Someone produces canola at $12 a 
bushel and receives the same benefit from that program as 
someone who is growing wheat and struggling at $2 a bushel.
<P>
	What we are suggesting is a trade distortion adjustment 
program that would target those funds to producers who are hurt 
by the trade war and thereby sustain their economic viability.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Francis G. LeBlanc (Cape Breton Highlands-Canso):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, since this is my first real address since the opening 
of the new Parliament, I would like to begin by congratulating 
you and your colleagues on your election and appointments to 
the speakership. I pledge my entire co-operation with you in the 
sometimes difficult job that you have in maintaining the order 
and decorum which is so necessary for parliamentary debate.
<P>
	I would also like to express my thanks to my constituents in 
Cape Breton Highlands-Canso for renewing their confidence 
in me on October 25. Whether or not they supported me, I would 
like to pledge to my constituents that I will work as hard as I can 
on their behalf in this House of Commons and also within the 
party of government over the next four years.
<P>
	I am always moved and deeply touched by the support, 
comments and requests for assistance which I receive from my 
constituents. It has been a source of learning and inspiration for 
me over the last four years to have been able to be their member 
in Cape Breton Highlands-Canso. I really want to express that 
once again.
<P>
	I want to comment on the new mood of co-operation and 
constructive debate which has characterized this House. It has 
been a very pleasant change from the previous Parliament to see 
from all sides of the House such an expression of earnest 
willingness to participate in sincere debate. We can give a lot of 
credit to our friends on the opposite side of the House, 
particularly the new members who have shown in a very 
impressive way their determination to address the problems we 
faced in the past in the House of Commons of not showing the 
voters that we were serious about the business for which we 
were elected.
<P>
<B>(1925) </B>
<P>
	I welcome the motion of the Minister of Finance and his 
decision to open the budget process to a broad range of 
consultation across Canada and also to have the process in this 
House. It is a new endeavour for this government. It also reflects 
the new mood of consultation and willingness to work with 
members of Parliament and Canadians which has characterized 
this administration from the beginning.
<P>
	I believe it is already bearing fruit in terms of the mood of 
Canadians and the fact that Canadians can see that the difficult 
years are behind them. That mood of confidence is starting to 
reflect itself in the economic indicators and in the spirit of 
confidence which is occurring throughout the economy. I hope 
that will make the tough decisions which the Minister of Finance 
has to make over the next few weeks a little easier.
<P>
	Obviously the most serious and difficult problem presently 
facing the Minister of Finance and the Canadian economy is the 
high deficit of the federal government, as well as the deficits 
faced by Canada's provinces. It has been a serious handicap for 
the Canadian economy. Reducing that deficit has to be a priority 
of the Government of Canada and of the Minister of Finance and 
it is.
<P>
	As the minister mentioned earlier today this problem cannot 
be addressed in isolation. The budget cannot deal with the 
question of raising taxes or drastically cutting expenditures 
without regard for the need to produce growth and jobs in the 
Canadian economy. Nor can the Minister of Finance address the 
deficit on the backs of the most disadvantaged Canadians. It has 
to be addressed over the longer term.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="760"> 760 </A></B>
<P>
	We have to begin with this budget. We have to produce 
measures which will increase growth and increase the revenue 
generating capacity of Canadians so that the deficit can be 
brought down as part of the growing Canadian economy. That 
is the underlying message which should be conveyed to the 
Minister of Finance as part of his budget preparation process.
<P>
	With respect to the basic decisions of tax policy which 
inevitably will form part of the budget, I want to associate 
myself with those who would stress the need to simplify the tax 
system and eliminate the many loopholes and overlaps which 
exist in the federal tax system and to work toward a more simple 
tax system.
<P>
	I am very sympathetic to the work which has been done by my 
colleague, the member for Broadview-Greenwood, in moving 
toward the single tax. The extra revenue derived from a very 
steep regressive tax system, one that is so full of loopholes that 
it pays people with higher incomes to avoid the tax, is not 
serving Canadians well. Without mentioning any specific areas I 
urge the Minister of Finance to consider tax simplification as an 
objective of his tax policy measures.
<P>
	Important as they may be, there will be more in the budget 
than simply tax and expenditure measures.
<P>
<B>(1930 ) </B>
<P>
	This budget as the first budget for the next term of this 
government has to lay the foundation for growth in Canada. As 
part of the way of doing that it will have to deal with the many 
areas of government policy that have in one way or another 
restrained growth for example through excessive taxes on small 
businesses or through the many complicating features of such 
programs as unemployment insurance.
<P>
	I understand and am very pleased to be part of the committee 
that will examine the whole range of social security reform in 
Canada including the unemployment insurance system. I 
believe there is work to be done in that area to make those 
programs more streamlined, more simplified and less inhibiting 
on growth and job creation.
<P>
	Young people in many parts of Canada are finding themselves 
lured into traps through regulations in the Unemployment 
Insurance Act that encourage and lead them away from seeking 
higher education and into positions or jobs which are dead end. 
It even encourages businesses to provide those kinds of jobs 
because it is advantageous. We have to work toward eliminating 
these disincentives in that program and in other similar 
programs in order to encourage the kind of creation of 
employment and the kinds of jobs Canadians will need in the 
future.
<P>
	However that is only part of the equation. Another part of the 
equation has to be to work toward fostering the industries of the 
future. The government has a very active role to play in this. In 
creating those industries of the future the government has to 
make sure that all parts of Canada are included.
<P>
	Because central Canada has been the focus of the 
manufacturing industries in Canada it is very easy to forget the 
east and the west. I come from the east where the economy has 
depended on resource industries which everyone knows have 
been devastated.
<P>
	The fishery is a primary employer in my own constituency. 
Over the last four years it has been devastated. Forestry is a 
resource industry in Canada which has been undergoing very 
difficult times in my constituency.
<P>
	The government has to promote measures that will help 
Atlantic Canada be part of that economy of the future so that it 
will not always consider itself a have-not region of Canada. On 
that point there are measures that this budget can do to begin that 
process.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
commend the hon. member for his speech. I certainly agree with 
him that we need to take a close look at reforming the taxation 
system. I also commend the member for 
Broadview-Greenwood for his work on the single tax. I think it 
is a great way to go.
<P>
	I also agree that we have to take a look at reforming 
unemployment insurance. There are many disincentives to work 
in the program as it is presently constituted.
<P>
	My question for the hon. member has to do with 
infrastructure. He mentioned that he was supportive of the 
government's infrastructure program. Does he think that the $6 
billion that will come from taxpayers for the infrastructure 
program is going to be more wisely spent by the government 
than it would be by taxpayers, investors and small businessmen?
<P>
	<B>Mr. LeBlanc (Cape Breton Highlands-Canso):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the infrastructure program that this government has put 
into place is exactly the right stimulus to the economy at the 
present time. It will create jobs now and increase confidence 
precisely in those communities where that confidence is most 
needed.
<P>
<B>(1935 ) </B>
<P>
	It will have a spin-off effect. The income from the jobs in 
those communities which will be created in building 
infrastructure will end up in the pockets of taxpayers. It will be 
recycled in those communities, not by themselves but they will 
begin a process of building those communities, so that they are 
more competitive in the future.
<P>
	That is the point of that program. By itself, it will not get us 
out of the recession but it is an important initiative and an 
important immediate term measure as part of the government's 
recovery plan.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with a great deal of interest to my colleague from Cape Breton 
Highlands-Canso.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="761"> 761 </A></B>
<P>
	In the last number of years he contributed a great deal on our 
side when we were in opposition. He ensured that there was a 
sense of realism in the debate we were having on economic 
matters specifically dealing with taxation reform, fundamental 
restructuring of the economy and things like unemployment 
insurance changes. He also ensured that when we led off that 
it was not just a lot of bravado coming from the opposition.
<P>
	I am very pleased to see that he will be making a major 
contribution as we set out to restructure social benefit programs 
as outlined by the minister.
<P>
	I want to pick him up on a point. It is very clear that there are 
two problems that face the government today. One of the 
problems is in expenditure. If one looks at the graphs over the 
past 20 years, one will see that the percentage of dollars spent 
overall by the government on programs is actually decreasing.
<P>
	Contrary to what members of the Reform Party and others 
may think, government spending is not out of control. 
Government spending seems to be well in control. The problem 
appears to be the second problem, that is revenue generation.
<P>
	Over the last number of years we watched as successive 
governments, even Liberal governments a few years ago, 
tinkered with the tax system. It seems that every single time that 
we try to make some modest changes to the tax system we end up 
by downloading on to the middle classes.
<P>
	Many would believe that the recession is stubborn and that we 
are not coming out of it very quickly because the tax burden has 
been shifted too heavily on to the consuming classes. I would 
like to support what he said about the efforts of the member for 
Broadview-Greenwood to put forward at least a proposal that 
seems to go in the right direction with the single tax.
<P>
	I would like to ask my colleague if he believes that type of 
program without any tax increases would lead to the federal 
government taking in the amount of taxes that it currently does 
with the economic activity that is going on. Does he believe the 
single tax system would lead to less tax evasion which we have 
now seen by witness with growth of the underground economy?
<P>
	<B>Mr. LeBlanc (Cape Breton Highlands-Canso):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there is no doubt that there would be much less tax 
evasion and less tax avoidance with a simpler, more 
comprehensive tax system.
<P>
	Indeed that is the system which we started with in the early 
1960s with the Carter commission and its proposals for reform 
in the Canadian tax system. Progressively over the years, we 
have got away from that.
<P>
	What the member for Broadview-Greenwood and others 
who are advocating a simplification of the tax system in various 
ways are saying is that by making the tax system more 
comprehensive we can lower the rates and burden on the middle 
class and all Canadians.
<P>
	As well, we can eliminate a lot of unproductive activity which 
goes into avoiding taxes and which costs the economy much 
more than the revenue lost by taxation. It costs the economy jobs 
and real economic activity.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Rideout (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Natural Resources):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is always a 
pleasure to rise in the House and be given an opportunity to 
expound on one's views.
<P>
	This is a particularly unique circumstance to have an 
opportunity to talk about the budget and the process in advance 
of the budget. Usually we were taken by surprise and then had to 
react afterwards. I congratulate the Minister of Finance and the 
government for having the courage of its convictions to make 
Parliament a working Parliament rather than a rubber stamp.
<P>
<B>(1940) </B>
<P>
	I think the budget process also provides an opportunity to 
re-evaluate how government works. It is not just numbers. It is 
the whole concept of what government is all about. As I listened 
to the debate today I heard a lot of really good ideas, some good 
suggestions, some crazy ones, but all in all some good 
suggestions as to how we can make government work better.
<P>
	I do hear from the Reform Party this idea that cuts are the only 
answer; the only solution is to cut, cut, cut. There are other 
opportunities available to us. My colleague from Dartmouth 
alluded to it.
<P>
	We have to re-invent how we run government. We also have 
to look at the top line of the balance sheet once in a while to see 
how we can make the country more productive, the economy 
more productive, and thereby make government more 
productive with an inflow of revenue.
<P>
	In my view, the critical role of government is summed up in a 
recent publication entitled ``Re-Inventing Government''. It 
makes a point which I think is something we should consider. It 
states: ``The word governance is from a Greek word that means 
to steer. The job of government is to steer, not to row the boat. 
Delivering services is rowing; government is not good at 
rowing''.
<P>
	What we have to do is provide the general direction, the 
guidance, the approach. I am going to talk about a few of those 
things and some of the concepts that may be a little unique or 
may not.
<P>
	For an Atlantic Canadian this is a crazy thing to say, but I 
think we have to look at the idea of getting out of the 
grant-giving business and government's role in trying to foster 
economic growth by grants, loan guarantees, interest 
deferments and things of that nature. If the enterprise cannot 
stand on its own without those supports it is going to die soon 
after they run out.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="762"> 762 </A></B>
<P>
	We have to take a look at how we do government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The government should reassess its mission and look at the 
best way to fulfil that mission. All governments must work 
together to eliminate overlap.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We see a lot of duplication between the provinces and what we 
do. That is one of the areas we have to look at in re-evaluating 
government and reinventing it.
<P>
	We have to look at some things here on the federal scene that 
perhaps will make a difference. We have to make government 
more competitive. Perhaps we should force government 
departments to bid on work that they now get automatically 
because they are government. Let government departments 
compete with the private sector and see whether we can get a 
better bang for our taxpayers' dollars.
<P>
	We should also take a look at the budget and ask why we 
tolerate this incessant spending from February to the end of 
March: ``Make sure that all of the money is gone. We don't want 
one penny left in our budget''. Perhaps we should put into the 
system a rule that says: ``If you don't spend all the money in 
your budget this year you can still keep it. You will be 
responsible for justifying where you're going to spend the 
money but you don't have to blow it all in February and March. 
It will still be available to you next year''.
<P>
	As we look at expenditures and the Auditor General's report 
which criticizes how the government spends money, the 
directions in which the money goes and how we have one 
boondoggle after another, perhaps for a change we should also 
ask the people the government serves whether they were served 
properly. If they were not, then maybe we should start 
re-evaluating what government is doing and perhaps the people 
who are doing it.
<P>
	I think it would be interesting to know what the satisfaction 
level is with the clients of the government, namely the citizens 
and the enterprises, those that are dealing continually with 
government and those only once in a while. Rather than looking 
at the dollars and cents and where we could cut all the time, 
perhaps we had better look to see whether we actually do deliver 
a good service.
<P>
	We have to start investing in our small and medium sized 
businesses and look at new ways to do things. I previously said 
that I think we should get out of the grant business. That is a 
process that we will have to wean parts of the country off. In the 
long run if we set up venture capital systems throughout Canada 
that will be the best system.
<P>
<B>(1945 ) </B>
<P>
	I want to offer an example of one that can work, in my view. It 
is going to require some tax changes and it is going to require 
some courage, but it is one I think we can use as a model 
proposed by an entrepreneur in Moncton, Dick Carpenter. He 
has suggested that we put together a meeting place for people 
who want to invest money, people who have ideas but need 
money to get started because the financial institutions will not 
finance them. What we want to do is set up a situation in which 
the people who want to loan money will receive a tax credit.
<P>
	That requires a change in the tax system for provinces and for 
the federal government. Those funds that would be introduced 
into the system of venture capital would also be shored up by 
agencies like ACOA or western diversification. Therefore the 
person who makes this investment in the venture capital 
organization would not run the risk of losing everything. There 
would be the benefit of a tax credit and a shoring up of part of 
their investment by ACOA. What that will do is make ACOA a 
backstop rather than leading the process. In my view, that is a 
way for us to proceed.
<P>
	I am very limited in time, so I want to move very quickly to 
another area of interest to me and that is in my role as 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Natural Resources.
<P>
	What we do not realize in this country because we are always 
tied into new knowledge based technology and all of those 
exciting things that go with it, is that the resource industries of 
this country provide a million jobs and affect about 500 
communities of this country. In 1992 natural resources 
accounted for 14 per cent of the GDP and generated $69 billion.
<P>
	If one looks at the statistics, the trade surplus that we talk 
about in international trade, is in large part supported by the 
natural resources sector. The foundation of the economy of this 
country over the last 100 years is still there providing that 
foundation.
<P>
	We have to be sure, in the changes that we make in the budget 
and in the directions that we proceed, we remain world 
competitive. We acknowledge the environment, safeguard our 
natural resources and the way that we utilize those resources so 
that we are providing sustainable development. We also have to 
stop, and stop quickly, the flow of capital out of this country to 
other countries. Canadians are not investing in our natural 
resources. They are investing in the natural resources of other 
countries.
<P>
	We have to change the tax system to allow Canadians to invest 
and re-invest in the natural resources of this nation. At the same 
time we have to put those dollars and cents into research and 
development relating to natural resources so that we can market 
that technology in the rest of the world.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="763"> 763 </A></B>
<P>
	Again, we have to look at fine-tuning our tax system so that 
research and development by the private sector is encouraged 
through the benefits of tax credits and those types of things.
<P>
	Rather than focus entirely on cuts and on the negative, let us 
focus on the positive. We have a great country with great 
resources and a great knowledge base. We have an opportunity 
to move into the 21st century as a dynamic economic force. If we 
sit with the naysayers who say: ``No, we cannot; we must cut; we 
are going to fail'', then we are going to fail.
<P>
	I believe in this country. I believe that this budget process is 
going to put us on the right course.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member's speech made me think about the 
issue of natural resources. I must say that I agreed with him, but 
I wish that we could find a way to ensure that the productivity 
gains made in recent years and which will be made in the years 
to come as a result of the use of equipment are channelled back 
to the forestry workers, because today, machines are being used 
to cut far more trees and far fewer workers are needed to operate 
this equipment. However, the resulting productivity gains stay 
in the companies and are not reinvested in workers who are laid 
off and often left to subsist on unemployment insurance or 
welfare.
<P>
	I think the budget should contain mechanisms, through the tax 
system or otherwise, for putting workers back to work. For 
instance, in the forestry industry, some people do not get 
retraining, and not everyone can be retrained for high tech jobs. 
There will always be people who prefer and in fact have the 
ability to work in forestry operations.
<P>
<B>(1950) </B>
<P>
	Again, I agree with the hon. member who just spoke that it 
would be useful to find ways to involve these workers in the 
industry, so that the forest is given a chance to regenerate and 
become the forest of the future that can fulfil our requirements. 
Today, with our huge lumber exports to the United States, we 
may run out at any given time, and that is something we have to 
plan for.
<P>
	The hon. member also made an interesting point when he said 
it might be a good idea for the federal and even the provincial 
government to withdraw from certain tax areas and let local 
governments manage local facilities. And of course in my case, 
the example that comes to mind is the wharves. It does not make 
sense for a wharf 300 kilometres from Quebec City and 800 
kilometres from Ottawa to be managed by officials who have 
only seen photographs and plans and are not familiar with the 
day-to-day concerns and the importance of this infrastructure 
for the community. I ask the government to consider whether it 
would be appropriate to withdraw from an area where it cannot 
really play an effective role, and I also refer to what the previous 
speaker said.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rideout:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question. It highlights a number of points without going to great 
lengths in order to permit other questions.
<P>
	In his second question he is talking about harmonization. As 
we look at the overlap occurring in government we are presented 
with an excellent opportunity to start to harmonize the tax 
system, harmonize the regulations, harmonize in a number of 
areas. If we did this, we could really do some very good things.
<P>
	I am saying that maybe we can look at opportunities which 
will see the federal government getting out of certain taxing 
areas and the provincial government taking over. He mentioned 
the forestry industry and forestry in general. I have to wonder 
whether we need two departments, a federal department of 
forestry and a provincial department of forestry. In that sense, 
maybe we have to look at a more efficient way of dealing with 
those types of circumstance.
<P>
	All resource based industries create a large amount of 
employment. I do not think there is any question about that. The 
issue is what is the best way to make our forestry industry 
competitive. It will mean, in all candour, more mechanization. 
More research and development will take place in that area so 
we can compete on a world-wide basis.
<P>
	We have to look at ways to better utilize our forests. We must 
create a larger forestry industry and create employment that way 
rather than just creating employment and making our forestry 
industry, in effect, uneconomical. We have to find the right 
balance.
<P>
	I thank the hon. gentleman for his suggestions. I am sure the 
Minister of Finance will respond to those as well.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to take this opportunity to discuss a very significant aspect 
of the subject before the House today, and I am referring to the 
close relationship that exists between the economic situation, 
public finances and international trade.
<P>
	I think we cannot overlook the fact that the disastrous state of 
Canada's public finances has an impact on the competitive 
position of Canadian and Quebec companies on foreign markets. 
I will therefore attempt to put the problem of our public finances 
and the federal debt into an international perspective.
<P>
	Canada's net public debt is now over 70 per cent of our Gross 
Domestic Product. This ratio is well above the average for the 17 
industrialized countries in the OECD. Furthermore, 25.8 per 
cent of the securities issued by the Government of Canada to 
finance its deficit are held by foreign interests.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="764"> 764 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1955) </B>
<P>
	This means that annually, we pay more than $10 billion in 
interest to our international creditors. The problem is therefore a 
major one, something which a number of financial institutions, 
including the International Monetary Fund, have indeed pointed 
out to us. On February 11 last year, the IMF submitted a 
confidential report to the Canadian government on the country's 
economic situation and especially on the problems of the public 
debt.
<P>
	Among other recommendations, the IMF advised Canada to 
deal with this problem, which was seen as giving rise to grave 
concerns about the state of the Canadian economy. The tenor of 
this report should surprise no one, since this was the IMF's third 
warning to Canada about its public debt.
<P>
	The federal and provincial governments borrow massively on 
the domestic market, pushing up interest rates and thus 
depriving Quebec and Canadian companies of the capital they 
need to renew their production infrastructures and invest in new 
and more efficient production processes.
<P>
	Furthermore, to make them more attractive to foreign 
investors, Canadian Treasury Bills must bear higher interest 
rates, thus pushing up the value of the Canadian dollar on 
international money markets and undermining the competitive 
position of Quebec and Canadian products on international 
markets.
<P>
	Restoring our control over Canada's recurrent deficits would 
help provide companies with the capital they need, at a lower 
cost, to modernize their plant and would make the Canadian 
dollar more competitive with the currencies of our principal 
trading partners.
<P>
	If the public debt problem makes our companies less 
competitive on international markets, conversely, international 
trade may prove to be one of the solutions to this problem.
<P>
	In fact, Canadian exports rose dramatically during the first 
ten months of 1993. There is every indication that this increase, 
which was 16 per cent over 1992, should make this a record year 
for Canadian exports of goods and services.
<P>
	It is important to realize the direct impact of exports of goods 
and services on the creation of jobs and the creation of wealth. 
According to recent studies referred to the Quebec bureau of 
statistics, every $10 million increase in exports generates more 
than 100 direct jobs. Moreover, these $10 million would include 
more than $6 million in added value.
<P>
	There is no doubt about the correlation between exports 
growth and improvement of public finances. When exports 
grow, so does employment, therefore we see a decrease in public 
spending for social programs like unemployment insurance, 
welfare or health care, as well as an increase in revenues due to 
the greater number of employed people who pay taxes.
<P>
	The government should see international trade as a factor 
essential to economic growth, and this is especially true in a 
country like Canada which derives a quarter of its GDP directly 
from exporting goods and services. I should point out that the 
Quebec economy is also largely dependent on exports of goods 
of services which account for almost 16 per cent of its GDP.
<P>
	The warm welcome given to free trade with the United States 
and then the North American Free Trade Agreement in Quebec, 
by federalist as well as sovereigntist supporters, should surprise 
no one.
<P>
	Quebecers understand that only the access to larger foreign 
markets will guarantee economic development to a small 
society of 7 million.
<P>
	In that regard, the lack of enthusiasm for these trade 
agreements in English Canada seems rather strange. It is easy to 
see, as the data on recent export increases and on their positive 
impact on our economy clearly show, that better access to 
dynamic markets is a source of increased wealth for our country.
<P>
	Therefore, government must examine without delay what 
measures to implement in order to promote international trade. 
They must, among other things, review in depth all assistance 
programs for small and medium-sized businesses which are the 
driving force of all economic activity in Quebec and Canada and 
the main source of job creation.
<P>
	That review must be made with a constant view to eliminating 
the multiple overlappings and duplications that exist between 
federal programs and those of some provinces. We must 
optimize resource distribution according to the real needs of 
businesses. Those provinces who wish to do so should manage 
these resources directly in a way that will ensure they are best 
adapted to regional economic realities.
<P>
	On the other hand, the government must ensure that business 
assistance programs take into account the service sector which 
is increasingly important in the context of international exports.
<P>
<B>(2000) </B>
<P>
	In conclusion, we must, once again, question the 
government's strategy and ask Parliament to participate in this 
new debate on public finances. We must, of course, welcome 
this new approach adopted by government which is a sign of 
increased openness and of greater respect for democracy.
<P>
	However, given the scope of the financial disaster at the 
federal level, and given the determination shown by the Liberal 
Party during the election campaign, we had the right to expect 
the government to launch a much larger consultation process. 
Under such circumstances, it would have been appropriate to 
take measures more in line with the seriousness of the situation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="765"> 765 </A></B>
<P>
	We would have liked the government to follow through with 
the request presented by the Bloc Quebecois several months 
ago, asking it to set up an ad hoc parliamentary committee to 
carry on an item by item review of federal tax and budget 
expenditures. The Reform Party, through the member for 
Calgary North, answering a question I asked her on January 21, 
and earlier today, through the member for Lethbridge 
answering a question from my colleague for 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, already indicated that it was willing 
to participate in such a process.
<P>
	With such unanimity, the government had the opportunity to 
undertake a consultation of a magnitude yet unknown in the 
history of this country and ferret out all sources of waste, costly 
overlapping and excessive spending.
<P>
	That exercise would have allowed the government to avoid 
having to consider easy solutions, such as increasing the already 
excessive burden on taxpayers or cutting social programs.
<P>
	Instead the government chose the easy way out: business as 
usual! Yet, if I remember, this government was not elected for its 
lack of courage and determination. Nobody expected that it 
would quietly carry on a traditional policy of day to day 
management.
<P>
	The government's answer to the proposal made by the 
opposition is that it would table the budget in a few days. Be that 
as it may, we will wait for the budget, but make no mistake, we 
will be ready for it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am glad 
to see the spirit of cordiality that we started off with was evident 
in the member's speech.
<P>
	I would hasten to say at the outset that this government does 
not believe it is business as usual. We have suffered through nine 
years of Tory mismanagement of the economy. We have seen a 
government induced recession. All of the policies of the last 
government were supported by the current leader of the Bloc 
Quebecois who is now the Leader of the Official Opposition.
<P>
	Some of the new members on this side the House find it very 
difficult to listen to lectures from the Bloc Quebecois about 
what is wrong with Canada. They talk about how the economy 
has been mismanaged and that if they had their way things 
would be better.
<P>
	I would like to indicate to the member opposite that many of 
his colleagues, indeed the only colleagues he has who have any 
experience in the House with the exception of one, sat as 
members of the Conservative government. Time after time when 
debates took place in the House those same members, when they 
were members of the Progressive Conservative Party, supported 
the very policies that have got us into the mess that we are in 
today. I understand he is a new member here. He has some very 
forceful points of views and I am pleased he  put them in debate 
today but he has to recognize that you cannot have your cake and 
eat it too.
<P>
	The individuals in this place that are the biggest proponents of 
the Bloc Quebecois are the same ones that ran on the Tory ticket 
in 1984 or 1988. Indeed some were in the cabinet of the previous 
government that voted for all of those measures, that saw not 
just the province of Quebec's economy go downhill but the 
economy of every province in this country go downhill.
<P>
	I want to tell the hon. member it is not business as usual. This 
government was elected because it offered some hope and it 
offered some hope for every province in Canada.
<P>
	I can speak quite eloquently about the problems in Atlantic 
Canada. They are tough and they are bad but I know that the 
vision, the policies and programs we have heard from this side 
of the House, and indeed the way we are approaching 
governance by open debates like this, show that times are 
different.
<P>
	This is a different House. It is a different government. We 
have support from nearly 70 per cent of the electorate even in the 
province of Quebec.
<P>
<B>(2005 ) </B>
<P>
	I would suggest to him that this is the beginning of a 
productive time. If he listens long and hard I think he will find 
out that the processes and policies that are in the best interests of 
Quebecers are the same processes and policies that are in the 
best interest of Nova Scotians, Newfoundlanders, people from 
the Northwest Territories and British Columbia. They are 
policies that are good for Canadians.
<P>
	I would close by asking the member why he believes, and I am 
sure that he believes strongly in his views on separation for the 
province of Quebec, that the pursuit of separatism, because it is 
not sovereignty association, it is separatism for the province of 
Quebec, is in the best economic interest of the people of Quebec 
when he knows full well it will lead to international instability 
in the investment market and it will probably lead, at least in the 
short term, to job losses for Quebecers as well as other people in 
Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bergeron:</B> If you allow me, Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
have time to answer everything my hon. colleague just said.
<P>
	First, I note with undisguised pleasure that every time we 
make statements, he and I are always together and I wonder if 
that will go on for long. I do not find it unpleasant, I must tell 
you, but I do find it interesting that the member lost his cool a 
little and immediately tried to defend his government. Could it 
be that his government has something that needs to be defended?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="766"> 766 </A></B>
<P>
	Also, my hon. colleague spent much of his speech explaining 
that some members of our party were once with another party 
that they left, I must remind my colleague, because perhaps 
they learned something after they had joined it. We should not 
keep going back to that because the fact that they are now 
sitting on this side of the House, under the Bloc Quebecois 
banner, means that they have done some thinking and that they 
realized something which has taken them further in their 
thinking about the political and constitutional future of Canada 
and Quebec.
<P>
	I would remind my colleague that the government which got 
Canada onto this debt treadmill is not the Conservative 
government which he complains about having had to put up with 
for nine years; it is the Liberal government which preceded that 
Conservative government.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bergeron:</B> Someone just questioned my right as a 
parliamentarian here to express my opinion on issues affecting 
the economic future of Canada, and thus Quebec, because 
Quebec is still part of this country called Canada.
<P>
	I find it offensive that the member should have questioned 
Bloc Quebecois members' ability to speak in the House on the 
economic future of this country. We have the right, and if you 
paid attention for a few moments to the speech I made, you may 
find in it some good ideas for putting Canada back on track. 
Perhaps you should reread it.
<P>
	Furthermore, I would point out that my colleague's argument 
had little or nothing to do with my speech and I must deplore 
that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans):</B> Mr. Speaker, as my 
colleagues have pointed out, the current economic situation in 
Quebec and Canada is far from encouraging. The unemployment 
rate exceeds 11 per cent and the federal deficit is growing 
steadily. These figures reflect an increasingly unacceptable 
reality: poverty has got its claws into the middle class now and 
there is no doubt that action is urgently needed.
<P>
	In a context of scarse financial resources however, 
government action must be carefully targeted to achieve 
maximum effect.
<P>
	As my colleagues said, the federal deficit results both from a 
structural problem and a-
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, could you ask the hon. member for Kingston and 
the Islands to go and sleep it off somewhere else. For a 
member-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Lots of before-dinner drinks and 
after-dinner drinks.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I know that members 
sometimes wish to discuss among themselves but in this case, I 
do not know.
<P>
<B>(2010) </B>
<P>
	Since the members in question have left I ask the hon. member 
to continue his speech.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond:</B> So, Mr. Speaker, the federal deficit is the 
result of a structural problem as well as of particular economic 
conditions. I will concentrate on this aspect.
<P>
	The deficit resulting from economic conditions is enormous. 
It represents roughly half of the federal deficit. We must react 
right now if we do not want to jeopardize the future of our 
children. We must invest in projects which will foster permanent 
employment, as well as in promising sectors which will put our 
creativity to full use. We must take advantage of our expertise 
and of the relative lead which we were able to develop over the 
last few decades. We must promote projects which will give 
Quebec and Canada an international prestige that will allow 
them to export their technologies.
<P>
	Economic recovery is based on projects geared to the 
industrial sectors which hold the most promise for the future. 
The Bloc Quebecois proposes a project which meets those two 
criteria: the development of a high speed link along the 
Quebec-Windsor corridor.
<P>
	The Liberal government is aware of how important it is to 
invest in infrastructure programs in order to foster growth and 
employment. The Bloc Quebecois is also of that opinion. 
However, our concept of infrastructures is wider than that of the 
Liberal government which seems content with upgrading the 
road system. We recognize the importance of maintaining and 
repairing roads everywhere in Canada and in Quebec. Canada is 
a vast territory and it is absolutely necessary for it to have a 
quality road network to reduce transportation costs.
<P>
	However, the upgrading of the road system will be totally 
insufficient to sustain economic recovery. Road maintenance 
does not generate permanent employment. The high-speed train 
or HST is an example of the type of investment needed.
<P>
	A high-speed link along the Quebec-Windsor corridor would 
cost close to $7.5 billion over ten years. It would be financed at 
70 per cent by the private sector, while the remaining 30 per 
cent, or approximately $2.3 billion, would be provided by the 
Quebec, Ontario and federal governments. By getting involved 
in the HST project, the government will help generate a $5.3 
billion investment from the private sector in the Canadian 
economy, not to mention the indirect benefits of the project.
<P>
	During the construction period, tax revenue generated by the 
project would reach $1.8 billion. This means that the financing 
of the project would be quickly made up for. This federal 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="767"> 767 </A></B>
<P>
investment would not increase the national debt and would 
allow us to make VIA Rail a  profitable venture. The HST would 
create close to 120,000 person-years employment, of which 
80,000 would directly be generated by the construction of the 
link and related equipment. Moreover, there would be 40,000 
new jobs upstream and downstream of the project.
<P>
	In 1991, the task force on a high-speed train linking Quebec 
and Ontario, which was co-chaired by the hon. Rémi Bujold, the 
former Liberal member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, made an important 
pre-feasibility study. Wide public consultation revealed that the 
communities affected by such a project support this initiative.
<P>
	The crucial impact of the development of such a corridor on 
the national economy was mentioned on several occasions, as 
well as the need to make the cities in that corridor more efficient 
so that they can succeed in a competitive market.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois proposes the development of an 
environment-friendly technology. Even at 300 km/h, the HST 
burns almost half as much energy per passenger as an 
automobile, and four times less than a jet used to transport 
people.
<P>
	The use of a high-speed train would reduce government 
expenditures. A high-speed train would be a much cheaper way 
of providing inter-city passenger service than would the 
expansion of the country's road or air network. Rationalizing 
government spending is a critical factor in the economic 
recovery.
<P>
<B>(2015) </B>
<P>
	In a country as vast as Canada, the government must have an 
efficient public transportation policy. At a time when the 
government is thinking about dismantling the rail system in 
Canada, it cannot get around replacing it by a technology better 
suited to the challenges of our society.
<P>
	The spin-offs of the high-speed rail project will help drive 
local economies. The European experience has shown that a 
high-speed rail venture stimulates job creation and economic 
recovery. High-speed rail attracts hotels, office buildings, 
convention centres, restaurants and other commercial or 
tourism operations.
<P>
	During the election campaign, the current Minister of Finance 
acknowledged Montreal's inadequate industrial infrastructure 
and pledged to focus on ways of remedying the situation. The 
Minister of Finance diagnosed the problem as follows: 
Montreal's industrial infrastructure is outmoded and fragile and 
is not being replaced by new, dynamic and technologically 
advanced manufacturing firms. What is the government waiting 
for to follow through on its diagnosis? The Minister of Finance
<P>
is now in a position to perform the surgery that can cure the 
patient.
<P>
	The government must respect the public's priorities. It must 
reduce the defence budget by at least 25 per cent and invest some 
of this money in projects that will be useful to society. The end 
of the cold war and the crisis in public finances do not justify 
directing funds to the military.
<P>
	The $12.3 billion defence budget for 1993-94 represents a 3 
per cent increase over 1992-93 levels. Is the federal government 
prepared to make a commitment to the people that it will slash 
the defence budget substantially and redirect the money to 
high-tech civilian projects? Is the government prepared to help 
companies such as MIL Davie in Lauzon become less dependant 
on military projects and convert their operations to civilian ship 
building projects?
<P>
	The high-speed train represents a major industrial investment 
for Canada and Quebec. Our standard of living and our 
competitive position depend on decisions that are being made 
right now. We cannot mortgage our future by postponing the 
introduction of the high-speed train. The clock is ticking and 
time is not on our side. If governments take immediate action, 
we will have a strategic head start on the North American 
high-speed rail market. Twenty similar projects are in the 
development stages in the United States, where the market is 
estimated at more than $200 billion over the next 15 to 20 years. 
If we are the first ones in this market, our companies will be the 
ones to benefit from exports of this technology.
<P>
	The Canadian government must demonstrate that it has vision 
and it must get the economy working again by implementing 
innovative projects.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simon de Jong (Regina-Qu'Appelle):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with interest to the member advocating a high speed 
train between Quebec City and Windsor. I am certainly a strong 
supporter of the high speed train form of transportation. 
Ecologically and economically it makes so much more sense.
<P>
	My concern in part is that the members of the Bloc envisage a 
separation between Canada and Quebec. My question to the 
member is would he feel that the government would be loathe to 
enter into long term, capital intensive projects in Quebec that 
might become difficult to resolve if there were separation? It is 
similar to a couple going through a divorce. Do not enter into 
new mortgage agreements and invest a lot of capital in long term 
projects. Would the member not agree that perhaps the 
uncertainty of the future relationships between Canada and 
Quebec might slow down the construction of a high-speed train 
between Quebec City and Windsor?

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guimond:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would have been surprised if 
that issue had not been raised in this debate.
<P>
	First of all, we must set things in the proper context. Every 
year, Quebec taxpayers pay Ottawa $28 billion in taxes. I hope 
that no one is operating under the illusion that, when the federal 
government invests in projects in Quebec, it is out of sheer 
benevolence. Benevolence it is not; they are simply giving us 
back some of our money. So, let us just be clear about that.
<P>
	So, until further notice, until the people of Quebec have 
democratically decided whether to have a country of their 
own-and we are sure they will-until then, there is no reason 
not to go ahead with projects such as the high-speed train and I 
do not see why this train could not travel across two countries, as 
is the case in Europe and many other countries. The train would 
travel across Quebec, for the portion of the line between Quebec 
City and Rigaud, then from Rigaud to the border with the 
neighbouring country, Canada, in the province of Ontario. From 
the border to Windsor, it would travel across another country. I 
do not think that the future of Quebec lies in the feasibility of the 
HST project. I think that arrangements could be made, as they 
were in Europe.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North):</B> Mr. Speaker, as we 
approach this year's tabling of the budget the government is 
faced with a tremendous debt which has surpassed half a trillion 
dollars and a record deficit of nearly $46 billion. Given the 
magnitude of these numbers this government's fiscal and 
budgetary policies will impact many generations to come.
<P>
	In the words of Mr. Leonard Cohen, we have a wonderful 
opportunity to steer this ship of state to the shores of need past 
the reefs of greed. It will take wisdom, courage and firm resolve 
to steer a course which will benefit Canada and be equitable to 
all Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Before going any further, I would like to congratulate the 
Minister of Finance for his pre-budget consultations with 
Canadians representing various views as well as with the 
members of this House. If we are to steer Canada in a new 
direction, we will need the support of all Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Over the past few years we have been told by some 
economists, bankers and business leaders that we can no longer 
afford the quality of life Canada has attained. This may be true. 
But should Canada abandon its commitment to its social 
programs, programs which are the envy of the world? Is our 
fiscal deficit the result of our aspiration to be a just and 
compassionate society? I think not.
<P>
	I believe that by fine tuning and adjusting social programs, by 
plugging tax loopholes and by creating and maintaining 
incentives for all Canadians to work and contribute to our 
economy we will increase revenues and address the deficit and 
the debt.
<P>
	I said earlier in this House that I believe we have a revenue 
crisis and not a spending crisis. A symptom that this is a revenue 
crisis is the way Canadians perceive Canada's tax system.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	There is an unprecedented lack of trust in our tax policies 
among Canadians, as reflected by the increase in popularity of 
the underground economy, and particularly cigarette smuggling, 
following the introduction of the GST. If we want the Canadian 
people to obey the law, they have to be convinced that these laws 
are fair and equitable.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Patrick Grady's 1992 study clearly demonstrates that the tax 
burden has not been shared fairly in the past decade. Lower 
middle income families have borne the brunt of tax increases. 
An average Canadian family earning between $45,000 and 
$75,000 has had to pay an average of $1,900 more in taxes than 
they did a decade ago. However, the amount of tax increases 
paid by income earners making $150,000 or more has been 
$3,782. According to the author, this amount is much less in 
proportion to the middle income Canadians.
<P>
<B>(2025) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is important to compare the proportion of taxes paid by 
individuals and corporations. Personal income tax is the biggest 
source of federal revenue, accounting for almost 50 per cent of 
total revenue. This proportion is bigger today than in the last two 
decades.
<P>
	Meanwhile, corporate taxes are at their lowest level ever. 
They now account for 7 per cent of federal revenue compared 
with about 15 per cent in the 1970s.
<P>
	While personal tax levels have kept growing in the last ten 
years, corporate levels have fallen from 36 to 28 per cent.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We must also examine the tax exemptions and deductions 
available to these corporations and wealthy Canadians. There 
exist loopholes associated with off-shore affiliates of Canadian 
companies, the family trust rules, deductions of limited 
partnership losses and non-taxation of lottery and gambling 
winnings.
<P>
	Business people are allowed to claim 80 per cent of the cost of 
entertainment and meals. If this were reduced to 50 per cent, 
business would still receive a tax deduction. In addition, 
restaurant, hotel and resort businesses would continue to receive 
the revenue generated by these deductions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="769"> 769 </A></B>
<P>
	There have been suggestions that this budget should reduce 
the amount of RRSP contributions. I do not support this 
proposal because I feel it would be a disincentive to the 
self-employed small business persons and professionals. These 
are the people who will provide the jobs called for in our 
election platform.
<P>
	Also we hear that the Canada pension fund as is presently 
structured may not be able to provide for the retirement needs of 
Canadians. Therefore it makes little sense to restrict Canadians' 
ability to provide for their own retirement. We must also 
remember that the RRSP contributions are only tax deferrals and 
not complete tax avoidance.
<P>
	I have already written to the finance minister asking him to 
extend the RRSP home buyers plan. The program has been very 
successful in enabling first time buyers to purchase a home that 
they otherwise would be unable to acquire. The RRSP home 
buyers plan has had and would continue to have a tremendous 
affect on our country's economic renewal. We must take into 
account that the immediate costs incurred by the federal 
government for this program will undoubtedly be offset in the 
long term.
<P>
	I have cited some examples of revenue losses which must be 
corrected to bring fairness to our system. However we must also 
recognize that government can and must operate more 
efficiently in delivering services. The Auditor General's recent 
report underscores the need to evaluate every department and 
program. This should be done to fetter out unnecessary spending 
and waste while maintaining the integrity of these programs.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Simcoe North constituents tell me they want changes to our 
tax system and a full review of our social programs without a 
reduction in the quality of services.
<P>
	I think this government has recognized that the problem lies 
with our tax system and that our social programs must be 
renewed. I am happy to know that the government will take 
action.
<P>
	The throne speech clearly stated that our priority must be job 
creation. This approach is essential if we are to put our fiscal 
affairs in order and successfully bring the deficit down to an 
acceptable level. By putting people back to work we will not 
only save on unemployment insurance and welfare but also 
broaden our tax base.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In conclusion let me summarize what I suggest we need and 
what we do not need. We need to remember that job creation is 
this government's number one priority. We need more people 
paying taxes and not people paying more taxes. We need plans 
and incentives for those currently unemployed to gain 
meaningful employment. We need to examine the privileges and 
tax loopholes currently enjoyed by the wealthy while 
maintaining incentives for business to remain competitive and 
provide employment. We need to remember that  our social 
programs require constructive reassessment to make them 
realistic and responsive to those in need.
<P>
<B>(2030) </B>
<P>
	We do not need a slash and burn approach that would 
ultimately deny social services to the poorest and most needy 
citizens in this country. We do not need reactionary simplistic 
solutions to complex problems. We do not need to abandon our 
liberal roots of tolerance, fairness and compassion by reacting 
in a knee-jerk fashion to neo-Conservative agendas.
<P>
	I know we can bring in a budget that will promote wise and 
careful spending while increasing revenues by broadening the 
tax base to include Canadians moved from the ranks of the 
unemployed to employment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
to the hon. member very carefully and I must say that, on several 
points, he seems to agree with what I said in the speech I 
delivered in this House earlier today. First of all, he said that we 
are faced with a revenue problem, and I wholeheartedly agree 
with him. He used the words fairness and equity, which are key 
words in our taxation system. And I also agree with him on that.
<P>
	He talked about the need to reform our tax system, not by 
targeting the middle class which is the driving force behind the 
economic recovery and which directly supports the economic 
cycle, but by increasing the tax base to reach those who do not 
pay their fair share of taxes. I would like the hon. member to 
comment a little further on this.
<P>
	There is another issue I want to raise. In his speech, the hon. 
member did not mention spending cuts. Does that mean that he 
thinks the present level of federal spending cannot be reduced 
and that a revenue-based approach is the only way to put public 
finances back in order?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. DeVillers:</B> The comments I made about the careful 
review that is required in federal spending has been highlighted 
in the Auditor General's report. If the hon. member will recall 
those comments I think they are the ones he is seeking 
clarification on on the reduction in spending. There are many 
programs with lots of room to cut spending while maintaining 
the integrity of the programs themselves, ensuring that we do 
not diminish the services for the most needy among our citizens.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jean Payne (St. John's West):</B> It is a pleasure for me to 
participate today in this most important pre-budget debate. I 
would like to begin my remarks by saying that this debate shows 
the government's commitment to listen to the opinions of 
Canadians as well as to make Parliament a more relevant 
institution.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="770"> 770 </A></B>
<P>
	The budget being prepared by the Minister of Finance will 
be the most widely discussed budget in history. The previous 
government left the country in a desperate financial situation. 
Their economic policies increased unemployment and caused 
corporate profits to decline. As revenues declined, spending on 
items like unemployment insurance and social assistance 
increased.
<P>
	With a budget deficit of $46 billion, Canadians and this 
government are faced with some very difficult choices. Do we 
raise taxes, reduce spending, cut services, or let the deficit 
increase? Whatever decisions are made, they must be fair to all 
Canadians in all regions.
<P>
	The people in St. John's West are facing a number of 
challenges. Unemployment is very high, business confidence is 
low, the fishery continues to decline and people are burdened 
with personal income taxes.
<P>
	The crisis in the east coast fishery is a problem for all 
Canadians. It is not just a concern for Newfoundlanders. The 
fisher people and plant workers are not to blame for the situation 
they find themselves in. The previous government mismanaged 
the resource and pulled the rug out from under the people who 
depend on the fishery for a living.
<P>
<B>(2035 ) </B>
<P>
	As people adjust to the new realities of the fishery they need 
support. The former government set up a short term assistance 
program that is due to run out in a few months. What people need 
is a co-ordinated, long term assistance plan that will meet the 
needs of those involved in the industry.
<P>
	The people affected need income assistance to compensate for 
some of their lost income. Useful retraining programs are a must 
for those who choose to leave the fishery. As well, more research 
on conservation and certain harvesting methods is necessary to 
ensure the future health of the entire industry.
<P>
	The half-measures taken by the previous government simply 
will not do. I am confident the ministers of fisheries, human 
resources and finance will design programs that meet the needs 
of Newfoundlanders and still keep within the government's tight 
financial situation.
<P>
	There has been a lot of talk recently about tax increases and 
broadening the tax base. Increasing the tax base is not a tax grab 
by government. It is a way to ensure that all Canadians pay their 
fair share of taxes.
<P>
	For the past few years Canadians have seen their incomes 
decline and taxes increase. Consideration should be given to 
measures to ensure that wealthy individuals pay a fair share of 
taxes. RRSPs are a common tax loophole that many people will 
take advantage of. While governments should encourage people 
to save for their retirement, it is a fact that the more money they 
have the more likely they are to make use of RRSPs to reduce 
their taxes. Tax reductions for RRSPs should not be  eliminated, 
but we should look at lowering the ceiling and reducing the tax 
break to those who are better off.
<P>
	The number one priority of the budget must be job creation 
and measures to put Canadians back to work. The people of my 
riding are eager for the infrastructure program to move into high 
gear. I applaud the Prime Minister and the Minister responsible 
for Infrastructure for their efforts in getting this off to a quick 
start. However there is a greater need for job creation.
<P>
	The federal government can do a great deal to stimulate job 
creation directly. It cannot create every job we need. That is 
where small businesses come in. Small business is the engine of 
the economy. Unfortunately the previous government did a 
terrific job of hurting small business owners and keeping them 
from doing what they do best, creating jobs.
<P>
	A mixture of the GST, high interest rates, tight credit and 
problems with the Small Businesses Loans Act put a crunch on 
small businesses, preventing them from expanding or hiring 
new employees.
<P>
	Our new government needs to address these problems. Small 
businesses need an understanding federal government. 
Businesses need access to capital to fund product and market 
development. The GST must be replaced with a tax that is easier 
for businesses to collect and that reduces the growing 
underground economy. Only when small businesses find their 
feet will the economy really begin to pick up.
<P>
	All measures of the budget should be designed to increase 
employment. When people start working once again they will 
start paying taxes again. The biggest problem faced by the 
government is not where to cut or increase taxes. The biggest 
problem is the lack of people working and paying taxes. Instead 
of people drawing from the system, we need to have them paying 
back into the government purse.
<P>
	The finance minister has a difficult job ahead as he tries to 
balance the need of Canadians to work and the government's 
need to reduce the deficit. The constituents of St. John's West 
are watching. I know the minister will do his best to strike the 
balance that is necessary to get this economy rolling once again.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question for the member concerns her comments on RRSP 
limitations. She spoke in favour of reducing limits for 
Canadians with above average incomes.
<P>
	Does it also follow that the member believes retired 
Canadians who have above average incomes should not receive 
old age security benefits? If not, why not?

<P>
<B>(2040 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Payne:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am of the firm conviction that 
anybody who is receiving above average incomes or pensions 
should not be permitted to dip into the government purse.
<P>
	I am not quite certain at this stage how the Minister of Finance 
is going to deal with this situation but, if in fairness to all 
Canadians it means having to claw back pensions from those 
people who are receiving above average income either by 
pensions or otherwise, it is my firm belief we should look at it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> Mr. Speaker, I congratulate 
the member for St. John's West on a fine speech.
<P>
	I note that she said there was a lack of people working and 
paying taxes and that in this country we have tax consumers and 
tax producers. She also spoke about the problems with small 
business.
<P>
	However I find that very little was put forward as proposals to 
address the problems we have. I hear so much about how we 
must do this, how we must do that and how we must do 
something else. I hear that we have an abundance of unemployed 
and a lack of jobs available. I hear that we have too many people 
on welfare and not enough people working.
<P>
	I am looking for some real answers as to what the hon. 
member would propose to get Canadians back to work and to 
bring the deficit down in order that we can look forward to some 
kind of reasonable future for our children.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Payne:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question. I believe the Minister of Finance has made a fine start 
in the development of the infrastructure program he has put 
forward.
<P>
	As I said in my maiden speech earlier this week, the people in 
my riding are very happy with the infrastructure program that 
has been put forward.
<P>
	Again I say to the hon. member that in order to reduce the 
deficit I believe we need more people working, more people 
paying taxes than taking out of the government purse. The way 
to do that is to increase employment and the infrastructure 
program is certainly a good jump start in that respect.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before continuing with 
debate, I would like to preface my remarks by reminding all 
members that as your presiding Speaker at this time I am in your 
hands.
<P>
	However I would like to make you aware that I have a list 
outstanding of nine speakers consisting of two government 
members, two members from Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition, 
four members from the Reform Party and one Independent.
<P>
	I would be prepared at 10 p.m. not to see the clock but I would 
not want to extend today's sitting beyond this list of speakers. If 
I could add to my suggestion that if you were to forgo the five 
minutes of questions and comments for the remaining nine 
speakers for a total of 90 minutes, it would bring us to the end of 
the day at 10.10 p.m.
<P>
	I am your hands and I am seeking your direction and your 
consent, if possible.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat):</B> Mr. Speaker, I give my 
sincere thanks to the government for permitting this precedent 
setting debate.
<P>
	During this pre-budget debate I rise to offer an analysis of the 
government's infrastructure program that will add $2 billion to 
federal government spending. During the election campaign and 
in the throne speech the Liberal rationale for the infrastructure 
program was twofold. First, this jointly funded program would 
create jobs. Second, it would encourage public investment in our 
roads, sewers and public buildings, all of which would increase 
the nation's productivity and therefore our competitiveness.
<P>
	Together these measures are supposed to jump start our 
economy. I would argue however that this rationale is deeply 
flawed. I would argue that this program is not only premised on 
faulty assumptions. I would also argue that its design is 
coercive, inefficient and unfair in nature.
<P>
	Let us look at the assumption that this program will create 
50,000 to 60,000 new jobs. As the government has already 
admitted it has not taken into account how many jobs will be lost 
by raising taxes to pay for this $6 billion program.
<P>
<B>(2045) </B>
<P>
	This program betrays the government's belief that it will use 
that $6 billion more efficiently than taxpayers, than investors 
would use it, despite the mountains of evidence indicating that it 
just is not so.
<P>
	I can guarantee the House that the owner of a small business 
would not charter a jet to fly to Boston and New Orleans for 
$172,000 if he could get a commercial flight for $5,000. The 
Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs has demonstrated 
in an exaggerated fashion what happens on a smaller scale a 
thousand times a day in government.
<P>
	Instead of taking that $6 billion out of the hides of taxpayers, I 
urge the government to leave that money where it is. The small 
business owners, taxpayers and investors will spend that money 
a lot more efficiently and effectively than government ever 
would.
<P>
	Another assumption the government makes is that we are 
somehow lax in funding infrastructure in the country. This is 
despite the fact that public infrastructure spending increased 40 
per cent between 1986 and 1993 to $17.5 billion.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="772"> 772 </A></B>
<P>
	Meanwhile private infrastructure investment last year was in 
the tens of billions of dollars. This was an investment that 
businesses were counting on to pay some immediate dividends, 
or else they would not have spent the money at that time.
<P>
	However the same cannot be said of the infrastructure works 
program. It will only fund new projects that until now municipal 
governments were not planning, presumably because they were 
not the best use of taxpayers' money, or in the case of repairs and 
upgrading because the roads or sewers still had a few more years 
in them. Perhaps it was because new taxes would have to be 
raised to fund them which would enrage taxpayers who are 
already overtaxed.
<P>
	We should have deferred to the good judgment of the 
municipalities. Instead the government's infrastructure works 
program coerces the provinces and municipalities into joining 
the program and requesting funds for projects that may or may 
not need doing. After all, if a municipality does not participate 
then the federal tax dollars that come out of that jurisdiction 
would just fund the next municipality over. Thus local 
municipalities are pressured into participating.
<P>
	When the federal government tells the other levels of 
government that the only way for them to get a dollar is to spend 
a dollar, we have a taxpayer's worst nightmare. Sadly this is not 
the only design flaw with this program. Although this program 
is supposed to create 50,000 to 60,000 jobs the government does 
not, to my knowledge, have any way of monitoring how many 
jobs will be created or whether these jobs will teach new skills or 
will lead to permanent employment.
<P>
	As the government knows, the Auditor General has been very 
critical of past government programs that spend millions and 
millions of dollars but never check to see if those programs are 
actually accomplishing their objectives. I hope some day the 
government can enunciate its plan for monitoring the progress 
and income of its infrastructure works program.
<P>
	I am also concerned that this project will perpetuate the 
problem of dependency on government, a problem that has 
become the hallmark of Canada's social programs. On one hand, 
the government is saying that it wants unemployed Canadians to 
get their skills upgraded so that their long term job prospects 
will be improved. On the other hand, it is enticing them to go to 
work for two years on a dead end job creation project, a project 
that in all likelihood will leave them unemployed in two years 
with no new skills to show for it.
<P>
	I am also concerned that the control over this program is so 
loose that we see projects like the Quebec City Convention 
Centre getting the go-ahead before any criteria are even 
established. Again it causes me to question the government's 
implicit contention that the minister for infrastructure knows 
better than taxpayers how their money should be spent.
<P>
	The government's infrastructure works program will kill 
more jobs than it creates. It coerces other levels of government 
into participating and encourages unnecessary infrastructure 
investment. It lacks clear measurable objectives. It is 
susceptible to political pork barrelling. It provides a 
disincentive for unemployed Canadians to seek training and 
long term employment. It drives up taxes and impedes our 
ability to tackle the root cause of unemployment and slow 
economic growth. I refer of course to the deficit and the debt.
<P>
	I quote now from the Investment Dealers' Association 1994 
pre-budget submission:
<P>
<B>(2050 ) </B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Keynesian agenda is no longer a viable option. Indeed, even if one 
abstracts from the deficit and debt problem, it is difficult to reconcile increased 
government spending with a rebound in economic growth. Government 
expenditures have already reached unprecedented levels, with spending 
accounting for about 40 percent GDP, and yet economic activity remains in the 
doldrums. In this regard the proposed $6 billion infrastructure program, while 
boosting overall productivity, would have a minimal effect on stimulating 
growth.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Government expenditures must be viewed within the context of government 
finances which have run amok. The stimulative Keynesian impact of higher 
spending is overwhelmed by commensurately higher taxes to blunt a 
deterioration in finances, or higher interest rates in response to larger budget 
deficits. Never before has fiscal policy turned completely on its head to the 
extent that policy initiatives must be considered in terms of their impact on 
government finances to the exclusion of everything else.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The other day the finance minister offered to give the leader 
of the Reform Party a lesson in economics. On behalf of our 
leader I will gratefully decline. Instead we will take our 
guidance from a small business owner who attended the finance 
minister's pre-budget consultation conference in Calgary on 
Saturday. Vicki Dutton told the minister and the conference you 
cannot tax a country back to health.
<P>
	I would argue that simple truth is worth all of the finance 
minister's elaborate theories ten times over.
<P>
	We should abandon the infrastucture works program 
immediately and begin the overdue process of cutting 
government spending.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, let 
me compliment the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance 
for initiating what I hope will be a new approach to putting 
Canada's financial house in order.
<P>
	The budget is the most influential of all government 
documents because it affects the lives of all Canadians more 
deeply than anything else. It contains the vision and the 
direction of government and provides the means of 
implementation of those programs. Therefore it is particularly 
important that we recognize the Auditor General's admonition 
in this regard when he said a compelling need is required to 
reconcile the convention of budget secrecy with open 
consultation and debate.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="773"> 773 </A></B>
<P>
	The taxpayers' interests must be protected and who is in a 
better position to do so than the taxpayers themselves?
<P>
	In the pursuit to open up the consultation process and improve 
economic health we have turned toward big, small and medium 
sized businesses for answers. In this regard I wish to direct the 
attention of the House toward the management of government 
grants and contribution programs.
<P>
	At this crucial time it is necessary that we ask ourselves 
whether this traditional means of supporting the economy 
continues to be the most efficient. Are the billions of dollars 
spent to support these programs used in the most efficient 
manner? Are Canadians getting the best value for their tax 
dollar? I submit, no.
<P>
	As an example, let us go back to October, 1986. The 
government of the day through the Federal Business 
Development Bank, signed a share subscription agreement that 
provided $79 million of equity to a publicly held company as 
part of a multi-million dollar plant modernization project. A 
similar investment of $55 million was made by the province of 
British Columbia, representing $134 million in government 
funding for the first stage.
<P>
	In total, $161 million was spent on stage one with only $27 
million subscribed by the company.
<P>
	In December 1992 the company advised the government that 
it would not be able to meet its obligations by the December 31, 
1992 deadline. To date the government, through the Federal 
Business Development Bank, has not received any dividend 
payments or redemption of any of its shares. The investment 
before the company declared it could not meet its deadline was 
written down to zero in March 1992.
<P>
<B>(2055 ) </B>
<P>
	Did we receive the best value for our money? No. Did the 
contribution of funds generate revenue? No. Were the interests 
of the taxpayers protected? Certainly not.
<P>
	Quite clearly, the government and taxpayers took most of the 
risk and saw no return.
<P>
	Whether one agrees or not with the various government 
programs, the process is not effective if it allows the 
government to undertake the major risks with little or no risk on 
the part of the companies involved. Canadians cannot afford 
these kinds of losses. They only add to the already large deficit. 
It is time that the government allows big business to grow up. It 
is time that we recognize big business will take its own risks if 
government provides the right climate. Big business can get in 
step with the new information based economy without subsidies 
provided by the taxpayers' money.
<P>
	Where can Canadians get the most value for their money, and 
how can they use that money to create employment?
<P>
	Small and medium sized businesses are the backbone of 
employment in this country, providing well over 80 per cent of 
all the jobs for Canadians. It is not done easily.
<P>
	When I talk to business people about the difficulties of 
operating their businesses, they tell me there are two major 
problems. First, tax burdens make it increasingly difficult to 
operate, to expand and to employ people. Second, they lack the 
knowledge about programs and assistance available to them. 
Given that small and medium sized businesses employ most of 
Canada's work force, create new jobs and help to build strong 
communities, it is unthinkable that this sector must suffer from 
an inordinate level of taxation which inhibits growth and thus 
employment.
<P>
	We must recognize that small and medium sized businesses 
will be the primary sources for employment of those Canadians 
who have lost their jobs because of downsizing. Small and 
medium sized businesses will put Canadians to work in new 
occupations. Success in these new jobs will require that both 
employer and employee work together to develop the skills 
necessary to accomplish that transition.
<P>
	The major factor for success of this re-employment strategy 
will be a reduction of the tax burden to the small and medium 
sized business. A reduced tax burden will do much more to 
stimulate the economy and reduce the deficit than broadening 
the tax base.
<P>
	The second major problem for small and medium sized 
businesses and the one which relates directly to my discussion 
here this evening is the lack of knowledge among these business 
people about government programs and assistance.
<P>
	Allow me to run through some of the current government 
programs designed to assist Canadian business people.
<P>
	Among them are the Small Businesses Loans Act, Community 
Futures including business development centres, 
self-employment assistance and the Community Initiatives 
Fund, the Small Business Financing Program and the Regional 
Assistance Program including western economic 
diversification, the Atlantic Canada Opportunity Agency, the 
Federal Office of Regional Development (Quebec), and the 
Federal Economic Initiative for Northern Ontario.
<P>
	Under research and development we have the Industrial 
Research Assistance Program, the Scientific Research and 
Experimental Tax Credit Program, and the Technology Inflow 
Program.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="774"> 774 </A></B>
<P>
	Under export assistance we have the program for export 
market development, the Industrial Co-operation Program and 
the Export Development Corporation.
<P>
	Under programs for aboriginal Canadians we have the 
Canadian Aboriginal Economic Strategy, Aboriginal Business 
Development, the Aboriginal Capital Corporation and the Joint 
Venture Program.
<P>
	That is but a sample of the programs available. I have here in 
my other hand 13 pages and each page has approximately 10 
different kinds of program descriptions from one department. In 
some cases, as many as three departments operate and 
administer a single program.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, if you were a business person which way would 
you turn, which program would be best suited to your business? 
Is it not possible that more than one of these could provide 
assistance?
<P>
	A preliminary conclusion would suggest that there is an 
overlap of function and that the potential for bureaucratic 
competition exists. Can a business benefit from only one 
program or can the same business benefit from a variety of 
programs simultaneously? Is it any wonder that there is 
confusion? Can we be assured that this system in making 
efficient use of taxpayers' money will exist in this budget?
<P>
<B>(2100 ) </B>
<P>
	Whether a business is big or small the fact is that the old way 
of creating a climate for business success is not the most 
efficient. Grants and contribution programs must be 
re-evaluated in terms of need, purpose and administration.
<P>
	It will be the first step in opening up the budget process as we 
have seen it here today for consultation and debate and making 
the necessary improvements that will ensure that we use our 
resources more efficiently so that taxpayers' interests are 
protected. Canadians have found ways to cut costs and put their 
respective financial houses in order. The government must do 
the same.
<P>
	It needs an ambitious budget that demonstrates it is master of 
its financial house. Then big, small and medium sized business 
will triumph in their pursuits of economic success and Canada 
can move forward into the new knowledge and information 
based economy with confidence. That is our challenge. Let us do 
it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leonard Hopkins (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I want to make a novel suggestion to the finance 
minister and it is one that has proved its worth in the past and I 
am sure it will work today.
<P>
	I remember when I was going to elementary school during 
World War II and they had what was called war saving 
certificates. You brought 25 cents to school whenever you could 
afford it and they put a 25 cent stamp in your book. When you 
had $4 worth of stamps you tucked them away and in a certain 
period of time you got $5 back. A lot of the kids right across this  
country bought war saving certificates throughout World War II 
and they felt they were helping Canada.
<P>
	I am going to suggest to the finance minister today that we use 
the same system for young people across the country, 
elementary and high school age, and for older people as well if 
they wish to buy back Canada certificates.
<P>
	When I say buy back Canada certificates I am thinking of the 
debt that we have with foreign countries. In order to cut down 
the debt that we owe abroad, these buy back Canada certificates 
can be applied to the national debt to pay off foreign countries. 
Grandmothers and grandfathers can buy a $20, $50 or $100 buy 
back Canada certificate and give it to a youngster for his or her 
birthday or whatever. Any Canadian can invest in them.
<P>
	In other words, it will go the year round. It is not just a certain 
period when you buy savings bonds. It will go the whole year. 
Let them buy these and it will instil in every young Canadian, 
every child, an attitude of Canadianism. ``I am a Canadian 
citizen. I am contributing to this country. I am buying back 
Canada. I am buying back Canada's debt from foreign 
countries.'' They are looking to their future. They are building 
their financial future.
<P>
	I think it would catch on and it would make every Canadian a 
part of a Canadian solution. It would help every Canadian 
contribute toward the national debt, bring down the deficit and 
feel that they are part of the action. In this way we will be 
helping senior citizens who are in need because their pensions 
can still come through.
<P>
	I had a lady phone me this morning from Deep River who was 
very concerned about her pension because she knew this 
discussion was going on in the House today. I told her I would 
bring up that item on her behalf. She is the type of senior citizen 
who did not have a chance to have a contributory pension during 
her lifetime and worked hard. Those are the people we have to be 
thinking about at this time.
<P>
<B>(2105 ) </B>
<P>
	Medicine in this country is for everybody, not just the sick. 
We should be looking after ourselves through preventive 
medicine. I went on for years not looking after myself. I worked 
15 and 16 hours a day, travelled all weekend, seven days of the 
week on this job. I never paid any attention to the fact that my 
father and his brother had heart problems and that some uncles 
on my mother's side of the family had heart problems. When I 
left the farm I kept on eating in the same manner I had been when 
I was working actively every day at physical work.
<P>
	As a result I ran into problems. The good medical care of this 
country helped put me back on my feet after a triple bypass 
operation, after a triple vessel cleaning. The doctors and nurses 
were wonderful. We have outstanding medical care in this 
country and we have to support these people.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="775"> 775 </A></B>
<P>
	How can we support medicare? By looking after our own 
health, by looking after our own diet. It is not only after we 
have had an operation that we should look after our diet. It is 
up to every Canadian from the youngest to the oldest. By 
looking after our own health and putting some discipline into 
our every day life can be preventive medicine. Every one of 
us should be paying attention to that.
<P>
	At a Heart and Stroke Foundation dinner on the weekend I 
paid tribute to Dr. Wilbert Keon who is the head of the 
University of Ottawa Heart Institute and Director General at the 
Civic Hospital in Ottawa. This man was born in a small 
community just across the Ottawa River and up a bit from 
Petawawa where I live. He spent years in medicine. He 
dedicated his training to becoming a heart specialist and he did.
<P>
	However, after Dr. Keon received his training at Ottawa 
University, he received help from Canadians so he could become 
a great heart specialist. He did not take off to the United States 
where he could demand the biggest buck going. He did not head 
off for Britain or some other country to make big money. He 
stayed right here in the Ottawa Valley and contributed to 
Canada. He is probably the top heart surgeon in this nation right 
now. He has trained many others. A top heart surgeon at a 
hospital in Edmonton trained under Dr. Keon here in Ottawa.
<P>
	This is the kind of loyalty that Canada needs from 
professionals today, people who are going to stay here and put 
their life and soul into their work the way Dr. Keon did. To me 
that is the mark of a great Canadian. We need more like him. The 
staff around him is so oriented to thinking of the family.
<P>
	People think the National Defence Medical Centre in Ottawa 
is only there for national defence personnel. Canadians who are 
in the trade business, Canadians who are diplomats, every 
Canadian soldier has the right to go there for their operations 
and they do. However, the operations for the Heart Institute take 
place at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute at the Civic 
Hospital. They do the work and send the patients back for 
post-operative care. Those people are wonderful.
<P>
	We sometimes get very down. We cut this program or that 
program. There are other ways of cutting programs. I mentioned 
one tonight, preventive medicine, when talking about looking 
after ourselves better than we do. Diets are not just for people 
who have had problems. They are for people who are still 
healthy, to keep them healthy and to keep them out of the 
medical system.
<P>
	People think that research and development is something that 
is very expensive. They cannot see any immediate returns from 
it so they get upset and say it is a waste of money.
<P>
<B>(2110 ) </B>
<P>
	I wish to say a few words about Crown corporations. Atomic 
Energy of Canada Limited is one of my favourites and I talk 
about it often in this House.
<P>
	The Canadian public has invested $4.7 billion in Atomic 
Energy of Canada Limited since 1952. But do you know what the 
return is on its research? A recent Ernst &amp; Young report stated 
that the return to the Canadian taxpayers was over $23 billion. 
That is a good investment. If you could get that return on every 
investment you made it would be great.
<P>
	I was part of the legislative committee that steered Bill C-13 
through this House and through the committee system. It dealt 
with the sale of Nordion International. Nordion provides 
radioisotopes to hundreds of hospitals across this country. We 
had 90 per cent of the world's market captured. Today what has 
happened? The previous government in 1989 sold Nordion 
International to a private concern. Now it is in a big dispute over 
the contract because AECL says it cannot provide the 
radioisotopes for the price the contract provided and the other 
company wants AECL to live up to the contract. Today we are in 
a position where hospitals in this country may end up with a 
shortage of radioisotopes.
<P>
	I am going to leave it there because it is a subject I could speak 
on for the next hour. However, I wanted to highlight that 
radioisotopes today are becoming a very serious issue. Research 
and development on the medical side is becoming a serious issue 
and we have to invest if we want that four and fivefold return on 
R and D in this country. It has to happen.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Fontana (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, let me begin by congratulating you on 
your appointment. I also want to take this opportunity to 
congratulate my colleagues who were returned and the new 
Liberal team. I believe they won the trust and confidence of the 
people and that is why we are on this side of the House, 
hopefully to do something about the problems we have been 
talking about tonight.
<P>
	I want to take this opportunity to first thank my family and the 
volunteers on my campaign. More important, I want to thank the 
people of London East who saw fit to return me to this House for 
another term. I am truly appreciative.
<P>
	Being on the opposition side the past four or five years was a 
very frustrating exercise and one that sometimes was not as 
joyful as one would want. I would like to think that this debate 
tonight is our change in direction. I want to take this opportunity 
to thank the Minister of Finance and our Prime Minister who 
have demonstrated two things in these past weeks, that we do 
really want to consult because we have a common mission here. 
We were all elected to this House by people who believed that 
we have the answers to the problems. Regardless of what side we 
are on and of what political stripe, we are all here to do the 
nation's business.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="776"> 776 </A></B>
<P>
	The government has demonstrated that it really wants to work 
with everyone to accomplish the great task before it. We have 
had an open debate on peacekeeping in Bosnia, the cruise 
missile and the social nets. Today we are talking about the 
budget before the fact. I have never experienced that before in 
five years. We could only react to what the former government 
had done and therefore it was very frustrating.
<P>
	I was rather surprised by some of the remarks I heard tonight. 
Coming from an opposition that wants to play a constructive 
role they tended to be rather negative. Had I been given the 
opportunity of telling former Prime Minister Mulroney and his 
gang-
<P>
<B>(2115) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Michael Wilson.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fontana:</B> Michael Wilson. Some input before the budget, 
boy I would have jumped at the opportunity.
<P>
	Yet tonight I hear nothing but more of the same old thing from 
a party that said it was going to come here to change things. I 
will not get too partisan. Perhaps some of them are listening.
<P>
	The ship of state is in trouble. Canadians want change. On 
October 25 they threw out a government that was not responding 
to their needs. They want men and women who are determined to 
change things from the way they were.
<P>
	We are still in the midst of an economic disaster in this 
country where we have 1.6 million people unemployed. We have 
455,000 permanent full-time jobs that have been lost. Part-time 
jobs have increased to 840,000. We have two million Canadians 
visiting over 300 food banks each and every day. Youth 
unemployment is over 18 per cent. Among female lone parent 
families 62 per cent have incomes below the poverty line.
<P>
	We have a mission. That is to think about each and every one 
of those 29 million Canadians who look to us to try to solve these 
problems. I could blame it on the former government that moved 
the debt from $120 billion to $500 billion. I could blame it for 
leaving us with $46 billion deficit.
<P>
	However what do we accomplish if we look back at 
yesterday? Our mission is to look forward to tomorrow. I believe 
that collectively we can. Collectively we can put our minds 
together and work in the new spirit of parliamentary reform now 
that the committees are struck, now that we have this debate and 
now that we have heard from people in our ridings as to what the 
proper medicine for this country is.
<P>
	Last week my colleagues and I had our pre-budget 
consultation in London, Ontario. We invited people to come 
forward with their views as to how the government should run its 
affairs, how it should put its house in order and what their 
priorities were. They told us.
<P>
	Hon. members have probably heard the same thing. I know 
that the finance minister heard the same thing at his 
consultations. Canadians in London, Ontario are not any 
different from those out west, in Quebec or in Atlantic Canada. 
They want good government. They want honest government. 
They want a government that will solve the problem of the 
deficit.
<P>
	We know we have a crushing debt and deficit. Yes, we have to 
cut programs that are useless. We have to streamline the process 
so that each and every dollar we spend counts, so that it helps 
people and does not enslave them.
<P>
	Yes, we have to make changes to our social programs, our net. 
The safety net must not only catch people but it needs to be a 
trampoline that pushes people back up to take advantage of the 
opportunities that are there.
<P>
	That safety net is important. One only has to look at our 
society and compare it to that of the United States. In our 
country 85 per cent of people who need help get help from their 
government. In the United States 25 per cent of people who need 
help get help from their government. Look at its crime statistics. 
Look at the problems it has in health care. Look at the problems 
it has with its infrastructure and in its cities. Look at the social 
problems that country has.
<P>
	I believe we have succeeded in creating a great country by 
working together. In 125 years we have managed to become one 
of the economic powers of the world with one of the highest 
standards of living in the world. That did not come easy. That 
came from the dedication and hard work of a lot of people 
working together to create this great country.
<P>
	That is what we have to do starting today along with the other 
members of this House. We need to create jobs. People on 
October 25 told us that jobs were their number one concern. 
People need to work in order to look after their families.
<P>
	That is why we are committed as a government to creating 
jobs through infrastructure programs, through the residential 
rehabilitation program, to investing in small businesses to give 
them opportunities. We must invest in their minds and talents 
because we know that small businesses will create 85 per cent of 
the jobs in this country. However we need to get the capital for 
them, the affordable long-term capital and the support of the 
banking institutions for them to allow them to grow and prosper. 
If they do, people will work. Young people will have hope and 
opportunities. Women who want to get into the work force will 
also have opportunities. But we have to support small business 
and this government is committed to doing that.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="777"> 777 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(2120) </B>
<P>
	We also must look at ways of living within our means, of 
looking at the expenditures and renewing our pledge to social 
programs. There is nothing wrong with saying that we believe in 
supporting people, because our job here is to protect people, 
especially those who are not in a position to look after 
themselves as much as they would like. We have a social 
responsibility to every Canadian.
<P>
	The budget is a blueprint not only for our economic views but 
also for the kind of society we want to build. Yes, we know the 
horror stories and we hear of wasteful spending, but there are 
ways of saving money and we are committed to doing that.
<P>
	I will say that in my riding the people said yes to no more 
taxes. They all agreed they were already over-taxed. The middle 
income group is now paying for the top and the bottom and they 
cannot afford to do so. They want us to streamline it and make 
sure every dollar counts. They want us to create jobs. They want 
us to invest in people, in training and retraining programs. They 
want us to invest in small business. They want us to invest in 
research and development and work in true partnership with the 
universities, the private sector, labour and government, all 
working together to forge a new society.
<P>
	I believe that is what Canadians expect of each and every one 
of us. This government is committed to doing that, to putting our 
financial house in order, but more important to investing in 
people because if we have people working, deficits go down, not 
up.
<P>
	That is the Liberal message and we hope that the opposition 
and all parties in this House will work with us to help build a 
better country.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, since this is my first speech in the House of 
Commons, let me first of all thank the women and men of 
Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead for their support in the 
election on October 25, 1993. On the American border in 
southeastern Quebec, Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead is a 
rural riding with great economic, industrial, agricultural and 
tourist potential.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In the Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead riding there is an 
important English speaking community, not living outside the 
French community but side by side fully respecting who they 
are.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead is much more than a mere 
electoral district established by law. Its people are proud and 
hard-working and, like many others in Quebec and Canada, they 
are likely to be affected by the economic policies and decisions 
that will soon be made in the first budget tabled by the Liberal 
government. My constituents recently told me that they are 
skeptical and concerned about the sorry state of the 
government's  finances. I must admit that I share these fears and 
these doubts. Indeed, many signs suggest that the budget which 
will soon be presented will just be more of the same. That is very 
disturbing, because we need change. We must react to a deficit 
which has reached gigantic proportions. This year's deficit is 
more than 6 per cent of the gross domestic product.
<P>
	What is even more worrisome is that a steadily growing share 
of our debt is financed by foreign funds. This reduces the 
government's room to manoeuvre and mortgages the future of 
generations to come. In fact, the federal government has quite 
simply lost control of its debt and large amounts are being used 
to pay interest on borrowed capital. This money is not invested 
in economic recovery. I will come back to this point.
<P>
	In the past, the federal government tried to control its deficit 
by reducing spending through cuts in social programs and in 
transfer payments to the provinces. A cut in transfer payments 
would, in an indirect way, reduce the federal contribution to the 
social programs provided by the provinces.
<P>
<B>(2125) </B>
<P>
	Also, the government has increased its tax revenues by taxing 
more heavily the middle class. These measures are inequitable 
and should no longer be resorted to.
<P>
	We recognize that the deficit is a major problem which has to 
be addressed urgently. Nevertheless, the government cannot cut 
social programs when unemployment is at 11.2 per cent, and 
even 12.8 per cent in Quebec, and when the number of welfare 
cases is growing as lay-offs continue.
<P>
	Although experts say that the recession is technically over, 
the recovery is painfully slow. The people of this country would 
like to see tangible signs of economic recovery. In fact, they are 
losing hope and faith in their government, if they have not 
already done so.
<P>
	The various Canadian governments promised year after year 
to sort out overlapping jurisdictions, to solve unemployment 
problems and put an end to the erosion of our standard of living, 
but they never delivered. This is irrefutable proof that the 
federal system cannot be changed. In this regard, the 
Bélanger-Campeau Commission stated in the conclusion of its 
report: ``The relationship between Quebec and the rest of 
Canada, within the present political system and constitutional 
framework, has reached an impasse.'' This was confirmed by 
the referendum on the Charlottetown Accord. For the future, the 
present government is offering very few worthwhile 
alternatives.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="778"> 778 </A></B>
<P>
	But what is even worse is that the last 30 years of centralizing 
federalism have created a debt of over $500 billion due to the 
government's lack of initiative and financial mismanagement.
<P>
	The logic of successive federal governments was to make this 
federation that was envied all over the world work at any cost. 
What they forgot to tell people who believed that the country 
was prosperous and stable is that this wealth and national unity 
only existed in the books of those who wanted to artificially 
preserve the federation without taking into account the price 
that future generations would have to pay.
<P>
	The effects of this mismanagement of public funds by the 
federal government are huge and negative, both for Quebec's 
economy and the economy of the rest of Canada, because the 
country's debt has also reduced Quebec's financial leeway. So, 
Quebec has been long contributing and is still contributing 
considerably to Canada's debt financing. The cost of this federal 
debt is astronomical for Quebec and the whole of Canada. This 
phenomenon is all the more frustrating that the decisions which 
caused these federal deficits were all taken by federal 
governments and, more often than not, they infringed upon 
provincial jurisdictions with the stated objective of putting 
Quebec in its place.
<P>
	But let us see how much this federal debt can cost Quebec's 
Treasury. The calculation is very simple: the total interests paid 
on the debt are roughly equal to Canada's annual deficit, which 
is over $40 billion. During a Canadian Broadcasting 
Corporation's special program on the debt, someone said that 
interest paid to foreign lenders was $28 billion. And using that 
as an example, I will simply say that the $28 billion given to 
foreigners in interest payments on the debt means a share of 
about $6 billion for Quebec and that is approximately the 
amount we pay in unemployment insurance benefits.
<P>
	All that money leaving the country helps to create jobs and 
support social programs outside Quebec. In fact, it is money the 
federal government sends outside Canada in our name while 
Quebec, more often than not, is in minority at the Canadian table 
where all great decisions are made.
<P>
	Quebecers have clearly showed during the last federal 
election that they had enough of their representatives defending 
the interests of their Canada-wide parties instead of defending 
those of Quebec. They decided they should send to Ottawa 
representatives who promised to speak loud and clear when the 
government makes decisions contrary to the best interests of 
Quebec.
<P>
<B>(2130) </B>
<P>
	And I admit it must be disturbing for the federal 
establishment so used to Quebec members abiding by Canadian 
policies. The era of subservience is over for Quebec. The time 
for shady deals behind caucus doors is gone. We have a country 
to build and we will take whatever measures are necessary for 
Quebec to become a  sovereign and prosperous state, with full 
control of its economic levers and full respect for its partners.
<P>
	But before Quebec rises to full sovereignty, the federal 
government will have to act quickly if it wants to save our social 
programs.
<P>
	To conclude, I would like to say a couple of words regarding 
income security program redesign. This is an example of 
overlapping which, if avoided, could save a lot of money. This 
week, the minister of Human Resources announced, in his 
speech on social programs, a far reaching reform of social 
security, including of course, unemployment insurance and old 
age security. Whether you want it or not, when you embark upon 
negotiations regarding social security, you have to talk about the 
Constitution since it is an area of exclusive provincial 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I will end by saying that we must indeed tackle 
the deficit which is endangering our future, but that we must do 
it while preserving our social safety net which provides those in 
need with the basic minimum.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the arts and culture industry plays an important role in 
the Canadian and Quebec economy. According to a UNESCO 
study, a $1 billion investment in this sector generates several 
billions of dollars in economic activity over two years.
<P>
	The vitality of this sector depends on its craftsmen and 
women. Through their work, their imagination, their passion, 
these people enable producers and cultural industries to provide 
us with a range of cultural products: books, sound recordings, 
radio, television, films, videos, paintings, plays, dance and 
other forms of expression that nourish and define us.
<P>
	The film and television association is right in reminding us: 
``With the exception of the United States, no western country 
has succeeded since World War II in developing strong national 
cultural industries without active, growing and multiform state 
support. Despite the efforts made, maintaining strong national 
cultures and identities has become more difficult than ever with 
the globalization of markets increasingly dominated by the big 
transnational conglomerates''.
<P>
	The association goes on to say: ``Unless they react with 
vigour and imagination, national states may be powerless to stop 
the gradual disintegration of their cultures and identities to be 
replaced by a single transnational culture and be forced to 
witness the slow disappearance of what made human cultures so 
precious: their diversity. It is therefore essential that the 
government pay particular attention to this sector in preparing 
its next budget''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="779"> 779 </A></B>
<P>
	Let us look at some figures on the arts and culture industry 
to realize how much they contribute to the Canadian and 
Quebec economy. In 1990-91, this industry injected into the 
economy a total of $22 billion or 3.7 per cent of the GDP. The 
Canada Council made the following statement: ``Recent 
comparisons with other industries show that arts and culture 
contribute more to the GDP than agriculture, mining and 
forestry''.
<P>
	The arts and culture industry helps to create 500,000 direct 
and indirect jobs. Employment in this sector has gone up by a 
phenomenal 122 per cent since 1971, while the average growth 
rate in other sectors of the economy over the same period was 58 
per cent. This means that in 20 years employment in the arts and 
culture industry rose from 1.8 to 2.5 per cent of the Canadian 
workforce. The federal Treasury alone collects some $650 
million in annual taxes from cultural industries.
<P>
<B>(2135) </B>
<P>
	Finally, creating one job in the cultural sector costs about 
$20,000 compared with $100,000 for light industry and 
$200,000 for heavy industry.
<P>
	However, this information can hide the fact that most of the 
artists, creators and craftsmen active in the arts and culture 
industry live in poverty. In 1986-87, Jean-Guy Lacroix 
surveyed 6,170 artists and creators in the field of music, theatre, 
dance and writing and found that the vast majority were 
experiencing considerable economic hardship. Their average 
income was $8,170. Seventy-eight per cent of them earned less 
than $10,000, 15.3 per cent lived above the poverty line, and 
only 2.8 per cent had incomes above $50,000.
<P>
	Moreover, the employment status of artists and creators is 
precarious as they mostly work on a part-time or contractual 
basis, which means that they constantly face an uncertain future, 
since their self-employed status makes them ineligible for 
unemployment insurance.
<P>
	Cultural and artistic industries have two main characteristics. 
They are risk sectors and are vulnerable to imports, especially 
imports from the United States.
<P>
	Since these industries are chronically underfunded, if projects 
are to get off the ground, regardless of the field, the producer 
needs to put together the necessary funding. Succeeding in this 
endeavour is quite a feat and as everyone knows, many 
worthwhile projects never see the light of day for lack of 
funding.
<P>
	This vulnerability to artistic and cultural imports is confirmed 
by the $4.4 billion trade deficit recorded in 1991. It should be 
noted that this is a trend. In fact, the trade deficit recorded by 
artistic and cultural industries is growing every year. Since 
1988, it has increased by 12 per cent.
<P>
	Yet, consumers are asking for more. In 1991, the people of 
Canada and Quebec spent $35 billion on cultural products. The 
Canada Council reports that, since 1982, while overall 
consumer spending has increased by 7 per cent, the increase in 
the area of arts and culture has  been 9 per cent. This means that 
more and more Canadian and Quebec products must be supplied 
to meet consumer demand and eliminate the deficit in the trade 
balance for that area. I must remind the hon. members that it 
costs less to create employment in that sector than in any other 
economic sector, hence the importance of investing in cultural 
industries.
<P>
	The previous government made cuts in the cultural and 
communications industry without thinking about the long-term 
effects of its action. They are even suspected by some of having 
tried to challenge the principle of government support to the 
cultural industry.
<P>
	Between 1984 and 1992, while overall government 
expenditures increased by 41.9 per cent, the GDP rose by 52.7 
per cent and inflation climbed 36.6 per cent, the portion of the 
federal budget allocated to culture increased by only 3.7 per 
cent. This apparent increase actually translated into a 24.2 per 
cent decrease in constant dollars. By the way, most of the cuts 
affected the CBC.
<P>
	Finally, further cuts are planned, based on the 1993 budget, at 
the rate of 10, 10, 15, 20 and 20 per cent for the five years 
remaining.
<P>
	This is clearly the work of a short-sighted government, 
especially when we know that the government recovers almost 
every penny invested in that industry.
<P>
	Granted, the government has very little financial flexibility. 
Where then can we find the necessary funding for the cultural 
industry in Quebec and Canada?
<P>
<B>(2140) </B>
<P>
	For its part, Quebec has long demanded respect for its 
exclusive jurisdiction over culture. In the field of culture, 
Quebec can no longer afford having two departments, two 
councils for the arts and literature, three film development 
agencies that provide grants and whose officials do the same 
work and even contradict one another at times.
<P>
	What the federal government is now doing is outside any 
sub-agreement between Canada and Quebec. The agreement on 
cultural facilities expired in March 1991. Without consulting 
the Government of Quebec, Ottawa is giving grants left and 
right for cultural facilities projects, while leaving it to Quebec 
to pay their operating expenses.
<P>
	However, the Harpin Report submitted to Quebec's Minister 
of Cultural Affairs is clear on this point. It said: ``We can 
conclude that the two levels of government clearly overlap in 
the area of program structures, clients served and even 
legislative and fiscal measures. We can even say that 
duplication leads to one-upmanship''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="780"> 780 </A></B>
<P>
	So one of the first ways to free up funds is to end the overlap 
and duplication, to give Quebec back its jurisdiction over 
culture and to include the funding that goes with it.
<P>
	In the meantime, we want the government to cancel its 
decision to reduce funding for the Canada Council and Telefilm 
Canada by 10 per cent and also to cancel the $250 million in cuts 
planned for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.
<P>
	Finally, if through some misfortune, the measures 
implemented by the previous government were to be 
maintained, the Official Opposition would ask for the 
development of a program especially geared to members of 
cultural industries. These people who, so far, have been living 
mainly off their passion, must not be the victims of the 
clear-cutting measures taken by the government; the latter must 
provide them with the means to overcome the crisis which it will 
impose upon them.
<P>
	Performers make us dream; they make us cry; they make us 
laugh. Creators constantly surprise us and stimulate our 
imagination. I ask the government to not let them down. Nobody 
can afford that.
<P>
	For all these reasons, the Minister of Canadian Heritage must 
not be content with maintaining the status quo. He must take the 
initiative and explain to his colleague the Minister of Finance 
that artistic and cultural industries need active, growing and 
multifaceted support from the government, because the 
decisions made today will shape tomorrow's society and will 
determine, to a large extent, our collective future.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> Mr. Speaker, first let me 
express my appreciation to the government and the Minister of 
Finance for this historic debate.
<P>
	Let this moment not pass without my saying that this debate is 
hopefully the first step on a road leading to real contributions 
with parliamentarians in the financial and budget planning for 
this nation. Therefore, while I doubt that we will solve all the 
problems today I do hope that the Minister of Finance will 
repeat and expand this exercise in the years to come.
<P>
	This country has been blessed with a great abundance of 
natural resources. We have forests that provide lumber and 
wood products around the world, we have vast prairies that feed 
millions beyond our shores and we have renewable and non 
renewable energy resources that are the envy of the world.
<P>
	We have natural resources far in excess of any other country 
in the world but unfortunately we also have something else far in 
excess of what we deserve and that can be described in three 
words: debilitating deficits and debt. Not only have we 
squandered the resources that have been ours but we have 
squandered the resources that rightfully belong to the 
generations that will come after us. To say it bluntly we are up to 
our neck in debt.  As of today there is no plan or consensus on 
how we are going to overcome this national disgrace.
<P>
	The federal debt is now 70 per cent of the gross domestic 
product and the annual deficit of the federal government as the 
minister said today is 6.2 per cent of the gross domestic product, 
not to mention the provincial deficits on top of that. The interest 
on the federal debt now consumes 31 per cent of total federal 
government revenues and I quoted the Auditor General's report 
in my reply to the speech from the throne when he said that hard 
choices lie ahead.
<P>
	Recognizing these hard choices I issued a challenge to the 
Minister of Finance to balance the budget by the end of this 
Parliament. We have a crisis on our hands and the Minister of 
Finance has a choice in this budget. He can dare to be great or he 
can play it safe down the middle with more taxes and a little less 
spending which is a timid, anaemic approach to the problem.
<P>
<B>(2145 ) </B>
<P>
	The Minister of Finance has a hard choice to make. I think it is 
a simple choice. He can choose mediocrity or he can choose to 
rise above mediocrity to reach beyond himself and lead this 
nation out of a dark tunnel of deficits and debt into the sunshine 
of renewed prosperity.
<P>
	History has always given the accolades to the leaders who rise 
to the challenge and buries the rest in footnotes beside the 
ignominy of their failure.
<P>
	There is a parallel that some may refute but which is worth 
considering today. At the end of World War II the federal 
government had an accumulated debt equal to 108 per cent of its 
GDP. Soldiers were returning from the war without jobs. 
Unemployment was high. Industry was going through a rapid 
transformation as defence industries scaled back dramatically 
and in may cases closed down completely.
<P>
	While it turned out to be the dawn of an era of unprecedented 
growth and prosperity, who would have known that in 1945?
<P>
	The government basically had one thing going for it and that 
was the savings of the cost of the war effort which today we 
would call the peace dividend.
<P>
	At that time also Europe had to be rebuilt and was rebuilt 
under the genius of the Marshall Plan.
<P>
	The financial future must have looked bleak to the federal 
government of 1945 but it used the peace dividend to generate 
lasting jobs and wealth throughout the country. That prosperity 
seemed to be assured and never ending. When we look at the 
statistics we find it came to an end in the early 1970s when Mr. 
Trudeau and his Liberal government were running this country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="781"> 781 </A></B>
<P>
	Mr. Trudeau had a vision of what he called the just society 
that would eliminate poverty and inequality in this land. The 
cost of eliminating poverty is equal to the price of success in 
the long run.
<P>
	Mr. Trudeau and his Liberal government introduced generous 
welfare programs, social programs, and benefit entitlement 
programs that discouraged many from working. He paid for 
them all with borrowed money.
<P>
	The point is that he paid for them all with borrowed money. In 
so doing he created a debt society and not a just society. I do not 
think the taxpayers would have been nearly as accommodating 
had they been given the bill at that time. The seeds of our present 
dilemma were sown when program spending blossomed to 125 
per cent of all government revenues and when you add interest 
costs on top of that total expenditures rose to 155 per cent of all 
government revenues.
<P>
	I referred to my parallel of today's problems with those facing 
the government at the end of World War II. Federal debt was 
intolerably high, unemployment was a major problem, industry 
had to restructure but at the end of the war there was a peace 
dividend.
<P>
	Today we need the money that can be saved from the 
restructuring of our social programs to set this country on a 
course leading to renewed prosperity. In other words, we need a 
deficit elimination dividend.
<P>
	Using information from the Auditor General's report in the 29 
years from 1946 to 1975 the GDP of this country increased 12.5 
times from $12 billion to $152 billion and during that same 
period the federal government debt only doubled from $13 
billion to $27 billion.
<P>
	I believe that if the Minister of Finance makes serious cuts in 
government spending and makes a serious commitment to 
balancing the budget by the end of this Parliament then the 
private sector will pick up where the public sector leaves off and 
will create thousands of long term wealth producing, tax paying 
jobs in a similar vein to the 1950s and 1960s.
<P>
	This time around at the end of the cold war it is the economies 
of eastern Europe that have to be rebuilt. China and the Pacific 
Rim countries can absorb all our exports that are competitively 
priced. Mexico, which is now part of NAFTA, should be 
considered a consumer of our products as its standard of living 
rises rather than our competitor.
<P>
	Our technological advantage can be the driving force of that 
economic growth and renewed prosperity.
<P>
<B>(2150 ) </B>
<P>
	If we put our trust in the entrepreneurial spirit of Canadians 
there is more opportunity for job creation in this country than 
there are Canadians to fill the resulting jobs.
<P>
	Remember that the Auditor General said that hard choices lie 
ahead. I also think of Shakespeare and his advice to the minister 
of finance. He said there is a tide in the affairs of men which, 
taken at the flood, leads on to fortune.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Finance rise to the challenge and commit 
this Liberal government to amending the errors of the previous 
governments and commit to balancing the budget by the end of 
this Parliament or will the minister dwell in the land of 
mediocrity and give us a few more taxes and a little less 
spending while we watch his vision cause this country to slide 
down into the realm of third world economies?
<P>
	In the last election the Reform party laid out a clear and 
simple plan to balance the budget in three years. Now that we 
have been told that the deficit is significantly worse than we had 
imagined last fall I have given the Minister of Finance room to 
manoeuvre. While the choice is his, the bad news is that he will 
only have one chance to make that hard decision, which is that 
when he introduces his budget later this month I hope he can rise 
to the occasion and earn his place in history as the Minister of 
Finance who brought this country through the dark tunnel to the 
sunshine of renewed prosperity.
<P>
	I can be done. It has been done before. Therefore, I do look 
forward to his budget later this month.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simon de Jong (Regina-Qu'Appelle):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to participate in the debate. There is 
much to say and little time in which to say it, so I will 
immediately get to my points.
<P>
	First, as a New Democrat I abhor the fact that every year some 
$40 billion in public revenues goes to interest payments. I have 
called it a transfer of wealth to the wealthy of momentous 
proportions. Who gets the $40 billion every year? A certain 
percentage goes to average Canadians. The vast majority goes to 
banks, financial institutions and the very wealthy and 
increasingly to offshore financial institutions.
<P>
	If it just went to ordinary Canadians I would have no problem. 
However, the fact is that it is a transfer of wealth to the very 
wealthy.
<P>
	The CCF party that originated the NDP had this to say in its 
Regina manifesto, a statement made in 1933, and I quote from 
this: ``All public debt has enormously increased and the fixed 
interest charges paid thereon now amount to the largest single 
item of so-called uncontrollable public expenditures. The CCF 
proposes that in future no public financing shall be permitted 
which facilitates the perpetuation of the parasitic interest 
receiving class''.
<P>
	No wonder NDP or CCF governments have always balanced 
their budgets, particularly when you look at the history of both 
CCF and NDP governments in Saskatchewan under Tommy 
Douglas, Woodrow Lloyd, Allan Blakeney and now Roy 
Romanow. It is a recognition that interest payments are a 
transfer of  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="782"> 782 </A></B>
<P>
wealth to the wealthy and inhibit the government from fulfilling 
its proper duties.
<P>
	How did we get ourselves into this mess? What I am missing 
in this debate is a proper analysis of how we got over $500 
billion in debt. In 1991 Stats Canada issued a study. Stats 
Canada claims that 50 per cent of that $400 billion debt at that 
time was due to interest payments, 44 per cent of it to decreases 
in revenues and only six per cent to increases in government 
expenditures of which social programs were only two per cent.
<P>
	In other words, the increase in social spending is only 2 per 
cent of the national debt. The former speaker from the Reform 
party claims that we are living beyond our means and our social 
programs are too rich and that is why we are in debt, I beg to 
differ. Compared to other OECD countries Canada is the second 
lowest on what we spend of our gross domestic product on social 
programs, less than Holland, Italy, Ireland, Germany, Spain or 
Greece. We spend less as a percentage of our gross domestic 
product on social programs. The interest payments are 50 per 
cent of it. The high interest rate policies were started by a former 
Liberal government and continued under the former 
Conservative government. They escalated into momentous 
proportions. There was a 44 per cent loss of revenue.
<P>
<B>(2155) </B>
<P>
	There were two reasons for that as a Statistics Canada study 
shows. One was that the tax breaks the Liberals gave to the very 
rich in the 1970s were continued under the Tories. That 
accounted for a big hunk of the revenue loss. Then along came 
the free trade agreement with the United States which cost us 
over 400,000 jobs so we now have 400,000 people not paying 
income tax. The combination of high unemployment and tax 
loopholes to the very rich created the loss of revenue.
<P>
	I underline again that it is not increases in government 
expenditures, particularly in social programs, that have created 
the debt. It is the neo-conservative agenda of the Ronald 
Reagans, the Margaret Thatchers, the Brian Mulroneys and the 
Grant Devines. No wonder under the neo-conservative 
governments we see increases in debt.
<P>
	Mr. David Stockwell of the United States, who was the budget 
director of Ronald Reagan, openly admits that they deliberately 
increased the deficit so that it would justify later cuts in social 
program funding. That is the agenda of the neo-conservatives. It 
is working because governments now being strangled by this 
growing debt and deficit have to cut back. Where do they cut 
back? They cut back on the poor, on the sick, on the children and 
on the social programs. The cutbacks are going to occur on the 
backs of the victims. They did not create the deficit or the debt 
but I am afraid they will be paying the price.
<P>
	What are some of the alternatives? I do not believe the 
proposal of the Reform Party of zero in three years makes any 
sense. It never tested the proposal through an independent firm 
or put it through an economic model like Informetrica. In fact it 
predicted that over 300,000 jobs would be lost if zero in three 
was put into effect.
<P>
	The Reform platform never talked about the loss of that 
revenue and how it would have further added to the deficit. 
There was a bit of mischief in the figures that were floated 
around when it comes to zero in three. The economic impact of 
taking $40 billion out of the economy in a three-year period was 
never factored in.
<P>
	The truth of the matter is that there is no simple, easy solution. 
There is no magic wand that in three years time it is going to be 
prosperity and happy days will be here again. It is not going to be 
that simple. To believe so is to be naive or to lie.
<P>
	When we go back to the origins of why the deficit is there the 
answer to the solution lies in the Statistics Canada study. We 
must keep our interest rates down. Our long term interest rates 
are still too high. When we look at historical parallels every time 
the world has experienced high interest rates we have ended up 
in huge recessions and depressions.
<P>
	Statistics Canada showed that we must also address the 
revenue side by getting fairness in the tax system, not by doing 
what some would suggest. Instead of adding further tax loads to 
the middle class and to the poor, how about the very, very rich. 
Over $140 billion in profits have gone untaxed in the last nine 
years, $140 billion in profits that have not yielded one cent of 
tax. Why are they not totally outraged in the House at the 
unfairness of it? This is creating the deficit that is resulting in 
cutbacks to the social programs and educational opportunities. 
That is the outrage.
<P>
<B>(2200) </B>
<P>
	Surely another area has to be employment. When Canadians 
are out of work Canada does not work. Things like the free trade 
agreement with Mexico and increasing the tax on employment, 
which the increase in the UI payments surely were, are 
counterproductive. They do not create jobs.
<P>
	I am not opposed to free trade agreements. The European 
model makes certain there was a level playing field in terms of 
social programs, environmental programs and labour costs. That 
makes sense, but we are now being reduced to the lowest 
common denominator. Common sense will tell us that at least in 
the short term we will lose more jobs in a period of time when we 
cannot afford it.
<P>
	Perhaps somewhere in the future we will benefit from the free 
trade agreements. Certainly in the immediate sense I believe 
every economist agrees that we will be losing jobs. That is at a 
period in time when we cannot afford to lose any more jobs.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="783"> 783 </A></B>
<P>
	Another suggestion I heard that made a lot of sense was the 
one of the member for Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke. The 
debt and the deficit in the country are killing our social 
programs and our public sector. That is a threat as serious to 
our way of life as was the last war. It is that serious. It will 
affect the health, welfare and future of generations of 
Canadians to come. There is absolutely no doubt about it.
<P>
	Why not call upon Canadians of goodwill as we did in the last 
war when we issued victory bonds? We could have boy scouts, 
girl guides and every public spirited interest group trying to sell 
and promote these bonds so that we can buy back the debt. At 
least the debt would be here, not offshore.
<P>
	I heard somebody earlier in the debate say that we will be 
spending from $40 billion to some $50 billion on interest 
payments this year. That is money out of the pockets of 
Canadian taxpayers. Some $28 billion of it will go offshore. 
That is a total drain on and waste of the energies and the 
lifeblood of Canadians. We cannot continue this way. It is 
destroying us. Let us buy back our foreign debt so that it will be 
paid to Canadians and benefit Canada to some degree.
<P>
	In conclusion I wish to say that for myself the issue of the debt 
and deficit is not a right wing one. It is an issue that should 
concern anybody and everybody who favours the public sector 
playing an important role in the social well-being of our society. 
As Mr. David Stockwell, former budget director of Ronald 
Reagan, is now saying, I believe the neo-conservative 
deliberately created the debt to kill the public sector.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, our health care system is one of the best things 
provided by our great country and Canadians attach a great 
importance to it. Without health, enjoyment of life can be 
greatly diminished. The protection of our health is dependent 
upon two major elements: the responsibility that each one of us 
has to adopt healthy habits, and our national health care 
program. The government cannot do much about the first 
element, but it can do something about the second one.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As a physician and a consumer I believe the Canadian system 
of health care is indeed the best in the world. It is one of which 
other countries are envious and one in which any Canadian in the 
country can get the best of medical care free of charge.
<P>
	At the foundation of the system lies the Canada Health Act 
which is based on five tenets: universality of care for all 
Canadians, comprehensive coverage of all essential services, 
reasonable access by both providers and users, portability of 
benefits from one province to another, and the administration of 
health care on a non-profit basis.
<P>
<B>(2205) </B>
<P>
	The provinces and the federal government both share the 
management of payments. The care however, and the 
management of the whole system falls under the provincial 
jurisdiction. The federal government now provides 
approximately 25 per cent of the necessary funds so long as the 
provinces administer their health care plans in accordance with 
the Canada Health Act.
<P>
	Over the last decade we have seen the emergence of a 
mounting fiscal crisis. If unchecked it will ultimately lead to the 
collapse of publicly funded health care in Canada.
<P>
	The largest crisis which many of my colleagues have 
mentioned today is the mounting debt and deficit. In this 
country federally we have gone from $125 billion in 1980 to 
over $500 billion this year.
<P>
	The amount of revenues that are required to service this 
obscene debt load has increased. Roughly in 1984 we were 
paying about 28 cents out of every dollar for interest payments. 
Now it is running around 33 cents. If our spending goes on as it 
is going on at current levels, in the year 2000, 40 cents out of 
every dollar will be used merely to service this debt. This means 
we have less and less money to spend on social programs such as 
health care.
<P>
	Another interesting fact that people may not be aware of is 
that the amount of money the federal government spends as a 
percentage of total program spending has actually declined 
since 1970 from 10.9 per cent to 7.6 per cent. This means that the 
federal government itself is spending less and less money on 
health care regardless of anything else.
<P>
	I am not taking into consideration the provincial fiscal crisis 
which is also going to impinge on the ability of governments to 
fund health care.
<P>
	At the same time that the governments have been reducing 
their spending on health care, there is the other side of this 
equation. That is that the costs of medical care in this country 
are escalating dramatically. In fact they are going up over four 
times the rate of economic growth. This situation will only 
worsen in the future. There are many reasons for this such as an 
ever increasing aging population that consumes over 70 per cent 
of the health care dollar; technologies of intervention and 
equipment which are getting more and more expensive all the 
time; and new diseases such as AIDS which are very expensive 
to treat are raising their ugly heads. For all of these reasons and 
many more it is clear that health care in Canada is living not just 
on borrowed time but on borrowed money.
<P>
	The health care crisis is a result again of dwindling funds and 
escalating costs. The problem is clear. The federal government 
continues to hamstring the provinces and is preventing them 
from getting their health care under control by using its fiscal 
contribution to the provinces as a wedge that will prevent them 
from enabling us to continue with publicly funded health care.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="784"> 784 </A></B>
<P>
	This as one can see is an unsustainable system. We must do 
something about it because it will ultimately contribute to the 
demise of health care in this country and to the suffering of 
Canadians. Is this a lost cause? No, it is not. There are a number 
of things we can do.
<P>
	We must freeze federal spending for health care at 1993 
levels. We need to modify the Canada Health Act to stop 
penalizing the provinces when they try to get their health care 
under control.
<P>
	This suggestion is in a provincial jurisdiction but I am saying 
it for the record so that we can address it. We need to strike a 
committee to define what essential health care services are that 
will be covered across the country from coast to coast and we 
should delist other ones. Delisting services would be those 
services that would not be considered essential health care for 
Canadians.
<P>
	We can make consumers more accountable. The current 
system encourages waste and will lead to unnecessary cost. 
Some suggestions have been bantered around and it is up to the 
provinces to decide on modest user fees and the use of 
deductibles. Remember, if we can save publicly funded medical 
care in this country, no one will go without essential health care 
services.
<P>
	As a physician, one of the reasons I got into this was to 
preserve the system that we have in Canada. We do not want to 
get into a system like we see in the United States which I 
personally think is reprehensible.
<P>
	We also need to inform the public of the cost of medical 
services. Perhaps we can do this with a statement of accounts at 
the time of consumption or perhaps annually or bi-annually. We 
also need to put a greater emphasis on health care education, 
particularly at the early grade school years. This will pay off in 
spades later on. I can guarantee that.
<P>
	We also need to address health care professionals and we must 
educate them more, myself included, as to the cost of 
technologies and intervention. By and large we have not done a 
good enough job of that.
<P>
	I would also allow the provinces to enable health care 
professionals to run privately funded services. This would serve 
two purposes. It would decrease the horrible waiting lists that 
we now have and ultimately it would be a win-win situation for 
all people those who would go private and those who would go 
public. People under that circumstance would get their health 
care services a lot quicker than before which would mean less 
pain and suffering. People would go back to work sooner and it 
would be far more beneficial for the economy, not to mention 
the insurance companies whose premiums would go down.
<P>
	The current hodge-podge two-tiered system of rationing that 
we have is the last futile attempt to correct a system that is 
broken and will soon sink under its myopic tenets and fiscal 
mismanagement.
<P>
	The second topic I would like to speak about briefly in view of 
the Auditor General's report is how we administer foreign aid. 
We can look at the CIDA disaster in conjunction with this.
<P>
	Some fundamental changes have been considered and I would 
like to suggest a few of them today.
<P>
	First, no government to government aid as much of this 
money lands in the Swiss bank accounts of despotic third world 
rulers. As a result of that the heads of many of these states are 
some of the richest people in the world.
<P>
	Second, dispense aid directly to projects on the ground 
administered by foreign aid workers in conjunction with local 
peoples.
<P>
	Third, focus on helping people to help themselves.
<P>
	Fourth, concentrate on small projects that incorporate and are 
sensitive to local customs and practices. Expensive mega 
projects are usually expensive mega failures.
<P>
	Fifth, focus on projects that involve family planning and birth 
control. Perhaps the greatest threat to the welfare of all peoples 
on this planet is the population explosion. We are rapidly 
outstripping our ability to provide for ourselves and are 
straining our resources to their maximum and laying waste to 
the environment.
<P>
	I would not encourage foreign aid as a lever in developing 
nations as it only affects those most in need.
<P>
	Make no mistake that what happens in other parts of the world 
will one day land on our doorstep one way or another. That is 
inevitable.
<P>
