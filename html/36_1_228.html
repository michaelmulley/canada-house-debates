hundreds of people in Peterborough, Kingston and other parts of 
southern Ontario who are concerned about the 18,000 Canadians who 
suffer from end-stage kidney disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners point out that those on kidney dialysis and 
those who have had successful kidney transplants recognize the 
importance of the bioartificial kidney approach to the treatment 
of kidney disease.  The petitioners also point out that there are 
inadequate kidney treatment facilities across the country and 
they call upon parliament to work and support research on the 
bioartificial kidney which will eventually eliminate the need for 
both dialysis and transplantation for those suffering from kidney 
disease.

present the following petition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The undersigned residents of Canada draw the attention of the 
House to the following:  that the current immigration sponsorship 
requirements are very high for an average person; that 
specifically maintaining an adequate income to support an 
immigrant is excessive for one person to bear; and that Canada is 
a multicultural country and immigrants are a great contribution 
to multiculturalism in Canada.  Therefore, the petitioners call 
upon parliament to ask the Department of Citizenship and 
Immigration to review the existing income requirements to allow 
all potential sponsors to not be unduly burdened by them and 
request that more than one person be allowed to sponsor the same 
individual and share the responsibility of financial support for 
that immigrant.

Speaker, on November 23, 1998, I placed Question No. 169 on the 
order paper.  The question asked how many gun smugglers and 
illegal gun traffickers have been identified, prosecuted and 
convicted in Canada using the gun registration system. 
In accordance with Standing Order 39, I asked for a written 
answer within 45 days.  My constituents and I have now been 
waiting 169 days.  Why can the government not answer my questions 
in 45 days as it promised?   When can I expect an answer to 
Question No. 169.

</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in the area of petitions, we are running at well over 
90%, having received several thousand petitions.  In the area of 
questions, we are running at 75%.  Some questions involve 
questioning every department of the government and some questions 
only involve questioning one department of the government.  I 
assure the member I will follow up on Question No. 169. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that excuse would not 
apply to this next point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 9, 1998, I placed Question No. 185 on the order 
paper asking for a list of contracts between the government and 
the consulting firm KPMG, Peat Marwick Thorne.  Again, in 
accordance with Standing Order 39, I asked for a written answer 
within 45 days.  I have now been waiting 156 days. I have been 
waiting three times as long as the standing orders require. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do I have to raise multiple points of order to get answers 
to my written questions?  The government is really interfering 
with my ability to do my job.  When can I expect an answer to 
Question No. 185?   A real serious pattern has developed here. 
The government should answer within 45 days and it is not doing 
so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have listened very 
carefully to what the member has to say.  I will certainly look 
into the whereabouts of the response to Question No. 185. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Shall the remaining 
questions stand? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>REPORT STAGE 
</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from May 11 consideration of Bill C-78, an act 
to establish the Public Sector Pension Investment Board, to amend 
the Public Service Superannuation Act, the Canadian Forces 
Superannuation Act, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police 
Superannuation Act, the Defence Services Pension Continuation 
Act, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Pension Continuation Act, 
the Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act and the Canada 
Post Corporation Act and to make a consequential amendment to 
another act, as reported (with amendments) from the committee; 
and of Group No. 2. 
<P><A NAME="LINK34"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> Before we get 
into debate I would like to read this into the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to advise the House that an error has been found in the 
research underlying the ruling on the report stage amendments 
proposed for Bill C-78. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As usual, when we considered the report stage amendments being 
proposed, we relied on the printed copy of the bill to provide 
the context for that study.  In this particular case the first 
reading copy of Bill C-78 dated April 15, 1999 mistakenly omits 
the royal recommendation which accompanies the bill.  Yesterday 
we noticed a discrepancy between the printed Bill C-78 and its 
listing on the Order Paper that correctly shows the bill 
accompanied by a royal recommendation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the record shows that a royal recommendation is attached 
to the bill and this is invariably a key factor in considering 
the admissibility of amendments, I asked that my original ruling 
be reviewed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Citation 596 found on page 183 of Beauchesne's sixth edition 
states that the royal recommendation lays down: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—once for all...not only the amount of the charge, but also its 
objects, purposes, conditions and qualifications. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Citation 698 found on page 207 of the same work states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An amendment is out of order...if it extends the objects and 
purposes...in the Royal Recommendation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, because of well established precedents I have concluded 
that Motions Nos. 24, 25, 27 and 29 standing in the name of the 
hon. member for Scarborough Southwest and seconded by the hon. 
member for Calgary Centre are not in order and will be dropped 
from the order paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I regret this confusion and I wish to apologize to the House and 
particularly to the hon. members for Scarborough Southwest and 
Calgary Centre for this unfortunate situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I find it rather distressing that you would seek to rule 
out of order several motions that have been made to amend this 
bill because it did not carry the royal recommendation at the 
very beginning.  Yet you have allowed the bill to stand because 
the royal recommendation has been added at a later date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you mentioned that when the bill was first 
tabled it did not carry a royal recommendation but that was added 
at a subsequent point after these amendments were tabled, by the 
way I understand your ruling. Therefore, I think— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  If I may interrupt, 
no, that is definitely not the case.  I hope that was not the 
impression made when I read the ruling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The royal recommendation was in place.  It was our error in not 
picking that up later that allowed the amendments to stand.  The 
amendments should not have been accepted because the royal 
recommendation was attached to the bill from the very beginning. 
The error rests with the Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will now proceed to debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I stand here 
to finish my speech which I started the other day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, now the heat has been really turned up. What is 
happening is absolutely shameful. The government is ramming 
through legislation which does not bear the support of members of 
the public. 
It does not bear the support of the members most affected by 
this.  The government is just shamefully using time allocation so 
that there will be no time for people to even talk about it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sure, we can talk about it here, but those blinking Liberals 
over there— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Yes, blinking.  I just called them blinking 
Liberals, that is all I said.  There is nothing bad about that. 
It is as bad as I can get under the rules of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have all of those members standing up on command today, 
except for one, saying, “I do not want to disobey my party 
orders.  I'll just vote for it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have come to the conclusion that these members do that because 
their own pensions depend on this.  Let us stop and think about 
this.  If a member wants to be eligible for that gold-plated MP 
pension plan, which past Conservative, Liberal, NDP and Bloc 
parties set up, voted for and accepted, the member must serve for 
six years.  If members disobey party orders in their first term, 
the Prime Minister, in exercising discipline, could simply say 
that he will not sign their nomination forms.  This basically 
means that they would not get re-elected.  They could also put 
their own MP pension plan at risk if they disobey the party 
orders. Consequently, because we have a majority government, we 
have absolutely no way of stopping legislation which is clearly 
bad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this particular bill we have motions brought forward in part 
of the MP pension plan and other plans that say that the 
government will just simply take the money back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know why the Liberals want time allocation.  I know why they 
want to jam this through by the end of the week.  I know why they 
do not want anyone to talk about it too much.  It is because of 
all the seniors who are affected, all the civil servants who are 
affected and all the taxpayers who are affected by this.  None of 
them will have an opportunity to actually organize and get their 
opposition to the bill heard here before it is a fait accompli. 
That is absolutely shameful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not surprised that the Liberals are doing it.  I remember a 
bank robbery in Edmonton not long ago.  They had a getaway car 
because when people take money that does not belong to them, they 
do not want to hang around too long.  Obviously these guys want 
to grab the money and run, otherwise someone might catch on to 
it. It is absolutely ridiculous what the Liberals are doing. If I 
were a Liberal I would be hanging my head in shame at this stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are debating the motions in Group No. 2.  A lot of people do 
not realize that the motions in Group No. 2 are meant to sustain 
the current definition of family and marriage as it has long been 
held through centuries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has presented a bill which takes away $30 
billion from the people to whom it belongs and is also sneaking a 
revision into the bill of the definition of spouse.  Instead of 
calling it a surviving spouse, the government has subtly changed 
it to survivor.  The survivor of course is whoever one chooses, 
but the bill attempts to jam through that partners in a conjugal 
relationship can also be survivors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How the dickens are the Liberals going to find out who is in a 
conjugal relationship?  I will give members an example.  It just 
so happens that my son, when he was at university for three 
years, shared housing costs with another young lad.  They cared 
for each other and shared expenses, but I absolutely and 
positively assure members that there was no conjugal 
relationship.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What if one of them had died during the time when they were 
sharing this apartment?  There could have been a benefit 
involved, but not in this particular case because this involves 
pensions.  However, now that I think about it, I guess my son did 
have some credits under the Canada pension which this could apply 
to.  He could say that they were in a conjugal relationship.  How 
would anyone be able to prove otherwise?  Will the Liberals stand 
on command next week if a motion is put to the House to install 
video cameras in everyone's bedroom so we can see if they are 
conjugating.  This is so ridiculous and offensive.  Furthermore, 
it is in opposition to what almost every MP in the House voted 
against. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the six years since we have been here we have had a number of 
occasions when these exact questions on same sex benefits have 
been asked.  I remember way back when one of the Bloc members had 
such a motion, 10 Liberals stood in favour of it while everyone 
else was either against it or absent.  Only 10 Liberals voted for 
it.  Why are they now for it?  It is because their pension plan 
depends on them voting for this one.  They are told how to vote 
and they simply comply.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
member for Elk Island was getting quite vociferous, and rightly 
so.  He was trying to point out that the government, through Bill 
C-78, is overturning all the norms of society.  It is allowing 
through the back door changes affecting same sex marriages and so 
on. It is becoming a term that is used in society every day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I arrived at my desk this morning I had a government 
response to a petition that I tabled in the House some time ago 
regarding marriage and so on.  Let me read the government's 
response.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The term “marriage” in Canada is clear in law and is defined as 
“the union of one man and one women to the exclusion of all 
others”. There is no need to either enact this definition in 
legislation or to amend any existing legislation. The definition 
of marriage in federal law is not in a statute passed by 
Parliament, but is found in what is called the federal common law 
dating from 1866 British case of <I>Hyde and Hyde v. 
Woodmansee</I>, L.R. l P. & D. 130.  This case has been applied 
consistently in Canada and states that no marriage can exist 
between two persons of the same sex, and is void <I>ab initio</I>, 
similar to “marriages” made within prohibited degrees of 
consanguinity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government remains committed to supporting Canadian 
families and there are no plans to legislate a change to the 
definition of the term “marriage”.  The definition of marriage 
is clear in law in Canada and has been successfully defended 
before the courts as the union of two persons of the opposite 
sex. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government says it is committed to maintaining marriage as 
it is seen in the eyes of the Canadian people, but through the 
back door it is ignoring marriage and is now into conjugal 
relationships and cohabitation.  What this long sentence means is 
that any kind of sexual relationship, perverted or otherwise, is 
now deemed to be the norm and will therefore qualify for survivor 
benefits under this pension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have thought that the government, which is here to 
represent the Canadian people and uphold the laws of the land and 
which tells us that marriage as defined is the law of the land as 
accepted by all Canadians, is allowing that venerable, holy 
institution of marriage to be watered down, defiled, changed and 
become anything whatsoever. 
That is a serious affront to many Canadians across the land and 
to the sanctity of their marriage.  As it states here, a marriage 
is the union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all 
others.  However, in the eyes of the government that no longer 
matters.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a serious problem with single parent families in the 
country.  A large percentage of them are poor and rely on some 
form of government assistance.  Research is now telling us that 
children brought up in a single parent family may not develop as 
well emotionally as children growing up in a two parent family. 
We are now being pressured by same sex couples to adopt children. 
We now have same sex couples demanding the right of marriage. We 
see the definition here saying that they want the same rights as 
everybody else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to recognize that people of the same sex form 
associations and live together as couples, but let us not call it 
marriage by any stretch of the imagination.  The government is 
failing Canadian society when it allows the encroachment of the 
idea that any kind of relationship can be called marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about survivor benefits under pension plans for 
the civil service.  When an employee, who was living with someone 
or was married, died in his or her old age what would happen to 
the person's survivor?  Our society said that the survivor should 
be cared for.  However, we are now questioning the definition of 
a survivor.  Anybody who has any kind of a relationship with the 
retired employee seems to be now called a survivor provided there 
is some kind of conjugal relationship going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for Elk Island pointed out, will we be installing 
video cameras in every bedroom?  Are we going to have sex police 
around to check on whether there is some kind of conjugal 
relationship going on or not.  I do not know.  The government has 
never said and I do not think it intends to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we had the lawyer from the Department of Justice and 
Treasury Board before committee last week—the bill is being 
rushed through by the way—I asked about the common law conjugal 
relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know this is a sensitive and delicate issue that one does not 
normally talk about in public, but we do have to get the facts on 
the table.  If two people are living common law and that common 
law relationship ceases to exist before one of the persons dies 
then there will be no survivorship entitlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I put forth the scenario of a retiree whose health is gone.  One 
person is living in a nursing home and the other person is living 
at home.  They are not cohabiting and they may not cohabit for 
several years because the health of the retiree is completely 
gone.  One has to assume there is also no conjugal relationship. 
Therefore, under the law, as proposed by the government, the 
survivor would not qualify, even if the couple had been living 
together for 40 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I posed that point to the lawyers.  They told me that the courts 
would probably be lenient and recognize it.  Again the House is 
deferring to the courts to write the laws that we know, as we 
stand and debate the bill, are flawed and deficient.  Under the 
above circumstance, that couple would have no protection at all. 
The government knows it, we know it and the lawyers know it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government does not know how to deal with the issue because 
it is kind of technical and complex.  At the same time, it wants 
to extend survivor benefits to virtually every kind of 
relationship we can think of.  It wants the courts to figure it 
out.  We complained in the House about the courts dictating to 
parliament and about abdicating our responsibility to write 
legislation that is clear, definitive and which makes it obvious 
what is meant.  I think the bill is absolutely terrible.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be debating other issues in a few minutes when we move 
on to the financial side of the bill.  However I wanted to put on 
the record that the government says it is clearly committed to 
upholding marriage.  By its omission and commission it is 
circumventing the whole institution of marriage.  It is not 
upholding it.  It is allowing it to be overwhelmed by people who 
do not understand the sanctity of marriage.  Therefore, we have a 
problem in the land, led by a government which does not stand up 
for principles any more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our great society was built by people who came here for freedom 
and opportunity.  They have prospered and lived together in the 
sanctity of marriage.  They have raised families.  They did a 
wonderful job of building the country from nothing.  Because the 
government has no desire to uphold the principles people have 
been living by for generation after generation, we are seeing the 
erosion of our standards.  We see that through its back door 
attempts at eliminating and undermining the sanctity of marriage. 
That is why we are opposed to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very disappointed in your ruling a few minutes ago, Mr. 
Speaker, on the disallowance of the motions.  I understand the 
point you are coming from; it is just rather unfortunate that the 
wrong bill was used.  In closing, I hope the government would 
withdraw the bill and rethink the whole issue. 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in the next few moments I will express my concern as 
well with this group of amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is bringing in through the back door what it does 
not have the courage to do openly.  It is becoming more and more 
obvious as we look at this group of amendments that there is a 
real problem.  I have a hard time understanding how the Liberals 
can sit in their seats and calmly observe and accept the whole 
process that is taking place because of its serious implications. 
They are faced with the questions we are asking, which I will 
summarize in a few moments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to defend the definitions of marriage, spouse and 
the traditional family.  Unfortunately the Liberal government 
says one thing and does the opposite.  I have listened to what 
government members have said.  They have used the excuse that the 
courts made them do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who makes the laws in the country?  Is it not supposed to be 
parliament?  If it is not the people through their elected 
representatives making the laws in the country, we have a problem 
and we had better change the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals say that they are defending the family, except when 
they will not fight court cases that undermine it.  That is at 
the root of this problem.  The Liberals say that they are all for 
strengthening the family, except when they bring in laws to 
redefine it.  I say that facetiously because they say one thing 
and do another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-78 is yet another example of the Liberal government 
redefining marriage and spouse in federal legislation, thereby 
undermining the definition of the family which has served society 
so well for thousands of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-78 would not only extend survivor benefits to married 
couples, as it should be, but survivor has been redefined to 
include couples who cohabited in a relationship of a conjugal 
nature for at least a year before the death of the pension plan 
contributor.  I found the word conjugal 19 different times in 
Bill C-78.

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the government it does not matter whether one is a 
husband or a wife of a pensioner.  If one is having sex with a 
government employee over a period of a year and that person dies, 
one is entitled to his or her pension benefits.  That is what the 
legislation clearly says.  That is what we will be approving in 
the House when we vote this evening on these amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are promoting a system whereby government benefits 
will be allotted on one's sexual relationships, and not on 
whether or not one is married.  Is not ironic that the party of 
Pierre Trudeau who said that the government has no business in 
the bedrooms of the nation, is now willing to extend benefits 
because of what happens in the bedroom?  What has happened in the 
last 20 or 30 years? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party believes in the institution of marriage and 
would vigorously defend it in Canadian law.  Reform policy 
defines marriage as: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the union of a man and a woman as recognized by the state, and 
this definition will be used in the provision of spousal benefits 
for any program funded and administered by the federal 
government. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we stand for and that is what we believe in. 
Opening up public benefits to conjugal relationship will create a 
nightmare.  I want to conclude with four questions which must be 
answered by the government before it passes the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, how will the government determine if a relationship is 
conjugal in nature?  My colleagues have asked questions about 
whether it will put a camera in the bedroom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, how will a survivor prove that his or her relationship 
with the dead pensioner was indeed of a conjugal nature?  How 
will the survivor prove that when it comes to a court case or to 
claiming the benefits?  What will the survivor do?  Will our 
government now go into the bedrooms of the nation to determine 
whether or not there has been a conjugal relationship? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, why has the government shifted from a clearly defined 
test of legal marriage to a relationship that is open to anyone's 
definition and therefore abuse?  We now have a clearly defined 
definition of marriage.  Now it will do away with that and go to 
anyone's definition of it.  This will open the door to tremendous 
abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, and maybe the Liberals never even thought of it, how 
many survivors will there be?  The spouse and one, two, three or 
more lovers who claim to have had a conjugal relationship with 
the pensioner?  How many people will start claiming after the 
death of someone that they have had a relationship of a sexual 
nature with that person? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will be a dream world for lawyers.  I can just see the court 
cases coming forth as all these people claim that they slept with 
a person for a year.  Another person will say “so did I”, and 
so on.  It is absolutely ridiculous what the legislation does and 
what it creates.  Before we go any further I call upon the 
government to answer those four questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Is the House ready

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, basically the motions in 
Group No. 3 relate to the concept of good governance.  This large 
section of Bill C-78 deals with the privatization of the civil 
service pension plan, out of which the government will take $30 
billion.  We say that it has no right to that money, but it seems 
that the government is going to ram this bill through parliament 
so it can get the cash.  That will still leave $100 billion in 
the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the next number of years the money will be converted from 
where it now sits, which is in government debt.  The civil 
service pension plan carries approximately 25% of the government 
debt of $579.3 billion.  This money will be invested in the 
private sector through private capital markets on the Toronto 
stock exchange, as well as around the world if the government 
continues to relax foreign content rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we have a plan of that magnitude one of the fundamental 
things we must put in place is the concept of good governance; 
rules and requirements to ensure that the fund is safe and 
secure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several witnesses appeared before the committee from the capital 
markets and the equity markets, professional people of great 
repute.  They told us about good governance and how to manage 
this money to get a reasonable return on behalf of the investor 
without rolling the dice and perhaps losing the lot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concept of good governance ensures that the proper checks 
and balances are in place so that no one can run away and bet the 
bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raise the issue of the pension fund in Orange County, 
California, which was a very large pension fund of about $9 
billion, only one-tenth the size of this plan.  One manager of 
the fund thought he was so smart that he could play the futures 
market, he could play hedge funds, he could make a great career 
for himself by getting a phenomenal rate of return on the 
investment.  One day he woke up and found he had bet the wrong 
way and had broken the bank.  He had pushed the whole pension 
plan straight into bankruptcy because he had the authority to 
make investment decisions without the proper checks and balances 
and supervision to ensure that did not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of Barings Bank, one of the great venerable banks of 
London, England.  It had been around for the better part of 200 
years, perhaps longer.  It had been around a long time by 
ensuring good governance, respectability, and not assuming too 
much risk as the order of the day.  Two hundred years is a good 
long time to thrive, prosper and to continue to do business. 
That bank expanded around the world.  We remember the rogue 
dealer in Singapore who single-handedly destroyed the institution 
in a matter of weeks because he bet the wrong way and senior 
management, the auditors, the board of directors and the 
shareholders were not supervising him closely enough.  He broke 
the bank all by himself through lack of good governance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year in New York there was a capital hedge fund which just 
about upset the entire capital markets of the free world because 
it found it had bet the wrong way on Italian bonds versus Russian 
bonds and so on, trying to grab that extra one-tenth of 1% or 
maybe one-hundredth of 1%, which would be big bucks when dealing 
with tens and hundreds of millions of dollars.  They bet the 
wrong way and it just about broke them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ensure that this plan has good governance and the 
witnesses before the committee said it is absolutely imperative 
that we have good governance.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall one witness who said that his company had a large 
client.  They were handling a very significant amount of cash and 
investments on behalf of this large client and had been given 
almost unfettered rein and authority to invest any way they 
wanted on behalf of the client.  He felt that good governance was 
so important that he imposed upon himself a semi-annual audit; 
not an annual audit, a semi-annual audit; not just of the funds 
under his administration, but of the procedures, the processes, 
the checks and balances that he had in place to ensure that 
decisions were sound, reasonable, rational and could be defended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are putting in place a board of managers which will be 
nominated by various people.  I suggested that the auditor 
general be the auditor for the special audits that this bill 
requires once every six years; not every six months as the 
witness before the committee imposed upon himself, but once every 
six years.  A lot of money could be lost in six years.  Once 
every six years there is to be a special audit; not just a 
financial audit, but an audit of procedures.  Who better in this 
country has the resources than the Auditor General of Canada who 
does value-for-money audits of large government departments and 
so on? Who better than he to do the intense analyses of 
procedures, processes, checks and balances to ensure that this 
fund has the integrity to handle $100 billion?   What did the 
government say?  “We do not want to hear about motions that 
introduce better governance”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I said “Let us take some time to talk about governance and 
understand what kind of processes have been built in”, the 
government was not interested.  It said “Let us move on.  Let us 
vote this through.  It is a done deal.  Next clause, please”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A great deal of supervision will be required for $100 billion of 
taxpayers' money and civil service employees' money which will be 
invested in capital markets.  I have very serious concerns about 
whether we will have the proper governance procedures in place. 
What can I say?  One day we may wake up and, like the Barings 
Bank or the Orange County pension fund, find out it is gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we will ask:  What happened?  Who is to blame?  The 
government will point its finger at some manager, the board of 
directors, the auditor or the internal accountant and say “You 
are to blame” and he will lose his job.  I submit that the blame 
lies here if that ever happens because we were not prepared to 
examine the governance issues and put them in place to guarantee 
that we have the best possible governance for one of the largest 
pension funds in North America.  We have abdicated our 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was speaking a few minutes ago on the issue of morality and 
now I am talking about financial accountability.  The government 
is not prepared to put the processes and the rules in place to do 
the best it can with money which rightfully belongs to the 
people.  What can I say? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to be able to debate this all day.  I would like to 
be able to talk to the auditor general and the investment 
community, ask them what we should be doing and incorporate that 
into the bill, but the government will not give us that 
opportunity.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, here 
I am back today, once again, with the famous Bill C-78. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a huge bill, with over 200 pages, which will affect 
hundreds and hundreds of thousands of employees in the public 
service.  I have the bill here.  It is clearly a huge document.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government of the Prime Minister and member for 
Saint-Maurice is imposing closure—four hours to deal with such a 
huge bill—true to the Liberals' democratic style. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will allow the President of the Treasury Board and 
member for Hull—Aylmer to appropriate the surplus in the 
pension fund of 275,000 employees, just as this very same 
government has taken the $21 billion surplus in the employment 
insurance fund by digging into the pockets of those with the 
least, those working on hourly wage, by making it harder to 
obtain EI and by artificially creating revenues because 
contributions are too high compared to the benefits the plan 
pays out. 
So, surpluses were created, and the finance minister, the ships 
minister, took $21 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, the President of the Treasury Board is preparing to take 
$14.9 billion from the public service pension fund, $2.4 billion 
from the employees of the RCMP and $12.9 billion from the 
pensions of the Canadian armed forces, our military.  This adds 
up to $30.2 billion.  Bill C-78, which will probably be passed 
this afternoon, will allow the President of the Treasury Board 
to take $30.2 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This affects 275,000 contributors.  Of course, those who 
contributed in the past are now benefiting from the plan. 
There are 160,000 retirees and 52,000 surviving spouses 
receiving benefits.  These 212,000 people receive monthly 
payments totalling $3.1 billion annually, while 275,000 
contributors pay $1.8 billion into the plan.  The difference 
between what the plan takes in and what it pays out is $1.3 
billion annually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But, if the present surplus of $30.2 billion were well managed, 
it would bring in more than what the government pays out in 
monthly benefits.  Public service, armed forces and RCMP 
employees could be given a premium holiday lasting a number of 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree that this would not be a smart thing to do.  But, and I 
am being perfectly honest here, I do not trust the government. 
I have seen how it treated the hourly workers of this country in 
its reform.  I have seen how it treated the BC mine workers, who 
were laid off on November 1, 1997.  Its track record is not 
good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is worse, this sends a clear message to the private sector 
that it can follow the lead of the government and the President 
of the Treasury Board and illegally help itself to the surpluses 
in employee funds.  This is the message this government is 
sending the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is precisely what happened to former BC mine workers, when 
their employer helped itself to part of the money in their 
pension fund, leaving some of them with a very small pension 
after 30 or 35 years of work.  This is the sort of government we 
have.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In a 1998 press release, Treasury Board stated and I quote: “The 
President agreed with a number of the recommendations of the 
special advisory committee... [which] was the result of four 
years of dedicated work by union representatives, pensioners and 
government employees”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have a minister, who stated in February 1998 that he 
agreed with a number of the recommendations of an advisory 
committee on the Public Service Superannuation Act established 
by the government, not even recognizing the negotiations 
suggested in its report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The President of Treasury Board is trampling roughshod over 
these recommendations and doing what he pleases. 
Gangway, he is coming through.  And he will get his hands on a 
surplus to which he is not entitled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time, there are no provisions for the over $30 
billion that is excess to expenditures, and Bill C-78 enables the 
government to get its hands on a surplus the ownership of which, 
while not clearly defined, is morally the property of employees 
and ex-employees, i.e. pensioners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is going to get its hands on the dough, and then what it is 
going to do with it?  It will probably argue that it invested it 
to reduce our collective debt.  Once again, a small group of 
people will be footing the bill for all Canadians, just like the 
hourly-paid workers of this country, who make excessive 
contributions to employment insurance and receive very little in 
the way of benefits, while the employment insurance fund has 
generated a surplus in excess of $21 billion over four years. 
The government stole this surplus to reduce the collective debt 
and create budget surpluses for the minister of ships, thus 
allowing Ottawa to spend money in provincial jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government did the same thing with the millennium 
scholarship program and a $2.2 billion budget. It also showed 
disrespect for Quebec by giving the four Atlantic provinces 
close to $1 billion in compensation for collecting the GST, 
while Quebec, which has been collecting the GST since 1991 under 
an agreement signed by Robert Bourassa and Prime Minister 
Mulroney, did not get one single dollar. This is what we call a 
double standard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Bill C-78, contributions would be deposited in retirement 
funds and then transferred to the Public Sector Pension 
Investment Board. 
Who will manage the board? The appointment process will be very 
similar to that used for the Senate. The appointees, who will be 
responsible for managing and administering this fund, will be 
friends of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The President of the Treasury Board will establish an advisory 
committee of eight persons. He will, of course, appoint eight of 
his friends, who will make a list of candidates—again chosen 
among the minister's friends—from which the board's 12 directors 
will be selected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is how the Prime Minister appoints his friends to the 
Senate and to the superior court. The former president of the 
Liberal Party of Canada was just rewarded by being appointed to 
the bench in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister appointed to the Senate the opponent of the 
Bloc Quebecois leader in the last general election, Liberal 
candidate Aurélien Gill, for having been defeated by my 
colleague. 
He was rewarded for his sacrifice by being appointed to the 
Senate until the age of 75.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
glad to have a chance to join in the last dwindling minutes of 
the debate on Bill C-78. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As those in the House realize, in the last hour we have seen 
closure moved yet again. We are not going to have an opportunity 
to go into the bill in nearly the depth that it certainly 
warrants. This is getting to be a real pattern.  We have heard 
speaker after speaker comment on the fact that it is getting to 
be far too easy for the government to use closure and time 
allocation.  They used to be very rare occurrences, but they are 
being used more and more frequently. Every time it meets the 
Liberals' expedient needs they have no qualms whatsoever about 
doing this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This whole bill had its origins in a failure of the government 
to be able to negotiate a settlement with the unions and with the 
bargaining agents who have control over the pension plans.  Now 
it is failing to use the democratic process to achieve its means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have always been of the mind that if your ideas have merit, 
they should be able to stand up to fair and honest debate and you 
will win the arguments.  If the ideas come from a point of view 
that has more merits than the other arguments, then what would 
you be afraid of?  The only time you should run from a free and 
open debate is when you know there is not a great deal of 
substance on your side of the argument.  Then you have to take 
actions which I consider to be cowardly and circumvent the 
democratic process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are dealing with the amendments in Group No. 3. We have 
spoken to Group Nos. 1 and 2.  Group No. 3 gets into some of the 
minutiae and detail dealing with the governance of this new 
public sector pension investment fund.  This in itself could take 
up months and months of debate because a lot of things have been 
left unresolved in the bill as it stands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going to have a 12 person board governing hundreds of 
billions of dollars of investment being openly invested in the 
free market.  We have not really scratched the surface as to what 
impact that is going to have on the financial community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where are we going to invest this money?  What kind of brokerage 
fees are we going to pay?  What are the brokerage fees on a $100 
billion being invested and reinvested every day?  I have heard 
estimates that it might be $500 million to $700 million a year in 
brokerage fees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What firm are we going to use to convey these transactions? What 
is the risk or the possibility of conflict of interest if we are 
going to be wielding that kind of clout financially?   If there 
are 12 people on this board who is to say they do not have some 
remote relationship with one investment firm or another?  Do they 
sit on another board of directors as well as the public sector 
pension investment fund?  The conflict of interest possibilities 
are enormous.  We should have dealt with that at great length and 
very carefully before we jumped into this whole idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be voting in favour of Motion No. 16 which was put 
forward by the Reform Party. It deals with the fact that the 
minister under this bill has enormous powers moved into his camp, 
things that used to be resolved in the House of Commons. The 
minister can now arbitrarily make changes to the rates of 
contribution to the pension fund. This is something that the 
House of Commons used to do.  It used to have to be tabled here 
and be debated here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also a breach of trust.  I do not think it is 
unparliamentary to say it is a breach of trust.  There has been a 
longstanding pact between the bargaining agents for the public 
sector unions and the government that if they took pensions off 
the bargaining table at negotiating time, the trade-off would be 
that they would never ever unilaterally alter the terms and 
conditions of the plan without bringing it to the House and 
without debate, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals said they would not do it. 
That hearkens back to the early 1960s and Walter Gordon, and 
maybe the current Prime Minister was part of that caucus. Those 
are the people who made the deal back then.  There is a 
historical record with this labour pact that this would not 
happen.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now they are instituting the very thing they promised they would 
never do.  They are incorporating it into Bill C-78. The minister 
will unilaterally and arbitrarily alter the terms and conditions 
of the public sector pension plan because it is given that that 
right will in fact be his under this bill. Motion No. 16 seeks to 
remedy this one flaw of the many flaws in Bill C-78. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot talk about this bill without talking about the public 
sector in general.  We all know this bill will take the $30 
billion surplus and all future surpluses out of the public sector 
pension plans. I have said this before, but to deduct something 
from a person's paycheque for a specific purpose and then to use 
it for something entirely different is at best a breach of trust. 
I could go further with the worst case but I will not say what it 
could be if I really took it to its logical conclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will the impact be on the public sector when it finally 
sinks in?  In the fullness of time when seniors, pensioners and 
retirees have had a chance to look through Bill C-78, these 200 
pages of verbiage, what will the effect be on the public sector 
and the people paying into the plan?  It will be another dent in 
the morale of the public sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Productivity is the big buzzword these days.  The Minister of 
Finance, the Minister of Human Resources Development, the 
Minister of Industry, all they want to talk about is the 
productivity in the workforce.  I can tell the House something 
about productivity and morale in the public sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Public servants have had blow after blow after blow to their 
morale and I would argue to their productivity or their ability 
to function. It used to be that if people took a job in the 
public sector they would probably take less money than in the 
private sector, but they could feel good about a couple of 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They had a pretty good idea that some job security was 
associated with it. They probably had some comfort there.  That 
went out the window when the government started cutting, hacking 
and slashing the public sector.  There were 50,000 employees out 
on the street with no job security anymore.  That protective 
umbrella is a thing of the past. They did not have the job 
security but they were making an okay wage.  Then there were six 
years of wage freezes.  Six years without a wage increase and 
they fell way behind the private sector.  If they started out on 
par, they fell way behind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are 50,000 fewer people to do the same amount of work. The 
work does not go away.  They are working harder and their wages 
are frozen.  They can barely function because the government has 
taken out that whole middle band of skilled people, but they can 
still take some comfort in the fact that they have a pretty good 
pension.  That gets used against them at the bargaining table. 
The employer says, “Yes we are paying you less money, but you 
have this great pension”. Now for the unkindest cut of all, the 
government is going after that too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What else is there to feel good about working in the public 
sector with all these things being chipped away bit by bit until 
now when morale has never been lower, when any kind of pact that 
might have existed in the post-war years between labour and 
management is gone?  It is eradicated.  The deal has been broken. 
It has been violated.  I would argue that we are looking at real 
chronic long term problems in the public sector and this is one 
more example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to come back to the idea of the motions in Group No. 3 of 
dealing with this massive fund, the public sector pension 
investment fund.  That is a lot of power, $100 billion.  Twelve 
individuals from all walks of life, ordinary Canadians will be 
the trustees of this enormous fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be no joint labour-management trusteeship as with 
most pension funds I have had any dealings with.  Most employee 
benefit plans have some kind of joint labour-management 
trusteeship.  Then at least the employees or the beneficiaries of 
the plan have some say in how these things are invested and 
directed. This bill calls for none of that and there is no 
opportunity for them to take part in the governance of the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are no stipulations about what kind of investments will be 
acceptable. We are arguing through some of our amendments that it 
should be an ethical investment fund at the very least.  We do 
not need to take less money to have an ethical investment fund. 
Frankly the ethical investment plans in the private sector are 
doing as well or better than the conventional financial 
instruments.

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a couple of stipulations.  We wanted to make sure that no 
investments made by this fund would be involved in any 
environmental degradation.  I think that is pretty safe.  Most 
Canadians would not want their pension plan polluting Lake 
Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want the pension plan investing in any industry that 
uses child labour or follows labour laws that are substandard or 
do not match Canadian standards.  Most Canadians would agree with 
that.  No Canadian has any appetite for the economic exploitation 
of children.  Why do we not have an ethical plan that stipulates 
these things?  What about tobacco?  Do we want a pension fund 
that invests in tobacco and is pushing smoking on our kids? No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The plan falls short in any stipulation of ethical investments. 
Many of the motions in Group No. 3 are very valuable and we look 
forward to voting on them later. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am very pleased to speak to Bill C-78 before the House today 
and the changes it makes with respect to pensions and other 
matters.  It is important to have this kind of debate so all 
Canadians can understand fully what we as a government are trying 
to accomplish in this all important area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk a bit about the area of investment of funds and 
management of surpluses with respect to the bill.  As we have 
heard repeatedly in the House, and I think it is worth repeating 
once again, as a government we are trying to improve the rates of 
return and reduce pension costs.  That has been noted in a way 
which is very meaningful for everyone who will be impacted by the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past Canadian taxpayers have covered the deficits in the 
plans, but the legislation will now authorize the government to 
debit the existing surplus of $30 billion over a period of up to 
15 years.  I think that is in keeping with what the majority of 
Canadians want to see happen. It is important that we underscore 
that yet again today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the independent board of directors will be 
authorized to manage future surpluses either by reducing 
contribution rates or by withdrawing amounts from the pension 
funds.  Based on the board being put in place, it is important to 
note as well that it is certainly in keeping with overall 
government policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about same sex survivor benefits.  As members 
know, pension survivor benefits will be extended to same sex 
partners.  Federal employees who have same sex partners should 
have access to the same pension entitlements and be subject to 
the same obligations as their colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that there is no radical agenda at work 
here.  The amendments do not redefine marriage, for example.  Nor 
do they legalize same sex marriage.  That is not what is at play 
here.  It does not do much good to have members in the House 
indicate that this is the case.  It is not and it is important 
that we speak on the record accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are simply keeping federal pensions in line with court 
decisions and trends elsewhere in the public and private sectors. 
Provincial pension plans in Nova Scotia, British Columbia, 
Ontario and New Brunswick have been similarly amended as have 
those offered by companies such as Sears, Dow Chemical, Shell, 
Levi Strauss and others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The courts are not setting the agenda.  That too is important to 
understand.  We believe it is for the courts to make rulings and 
for the government to make policy.  This is appropriate 
legislative action then to eliminate a provision which has been 
identified as discriminatory by the courts.  It has been 
estimated that the amendment will see an increase of less than 2% 
in the number of persons entitled to survivor benefits under the 
plans.  The cost has been estimated at approximately $5 million 
per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also recap, based on retirement and other benefits, that the 
retirement benefits will be calculated on the average salary 
during the best consecutive five years rather than the current 
six.  Life insurance benefits under the PSSA will be improved, 
including a 25% reduction in premiums.  Though not part of this 
legislation, a dental plan will be established for pensioners by 
Treasury Board after consultation with employees and other member 
representatives. 
It is important to have that on record in a clear and concise 
fashion which Canadians can and will understand.

least one year at the time of the plan member's death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The courts have been very clear on the issue of discrimination 
based on sexual orientation.  They have indicated that 
discriminatory language must be removed.  Under Bill C-78 words 
referring to the opposite sex have been taken out.  This is in 
keeping with recent court decisions on the issue of providing 
employment related benefits to same sex partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A key decision in the federal court in Moore and Akerstrom 
directed Treasury Board as the employer to extend benefits to 
same sex partners in the same manner as it did to opposite sex 
partners living in a common law relationship.  Treasury Board 
could not create a separate category for same sex partners 
because that would have the effect of perpetrating harmful 
stereotypes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So it is that Bill C-78 contains neutral language which draws no 
distinctions between same sex partners living together and 
partners of the opposite sex living together, while maintaining a 
distinction between married spouses and individuals living in a 
common law relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-78 strikes a balance between the courts and what they 
have said, what is necessary with respect to the Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms, and what is required to maintain the 
distinction between legally married spouses and two people living 
in a common law relationship.  The definition of a survivor in 
Bill C-78 follows the guidance provided by the court on precisely 
this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I elaborate further on the use of the word spouse.  It is 
preferable from a drafting point of view to avoid cumbersome 
constructions such as repeating the words spouse and common law 
spouse in the statute.  The use of the word spouse as is 
currently used is appropriate in the case of same sex partners as 
it would misrepresent their relationship as per Iacobucci in Egan 
and Nesbit.  A term defined such as survivor in Bill C-78 keeps 
the drafting simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to speak as well on conjugal, the recognition of common 
law relationships for the purpose of survivor benefits.  It has 
been a feature of the public service pension plans for many 
years.  These types of relationships are also recognized in other 
legislation both federally and provincially such as the Income 
Tax Act and family law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Generally speaking legislation does not refer to a common law 
relationship.  As a rule legislation sets out the test that has 
to be met in order to establish the existence of such a 
relationship.  It is important to highlight that the courts have 
provided direction by setting out the recognized elements of a 
common law relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Factors looked at by the courts include various elements of 
cohabitation and conjugality such as a commitment of the two 
individuals to each other and financial contributions to the 
necessities of life, et cetera.  They looked at the attitude and 
conduct of each of the partners toward members of their 
respective families, how the families behave toward the partners, 
and how the partners present their relationship to the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, when a word has been considered by the courts, what has 
been judicially said is incorporated into the meaning of the word 
as used in the legislation.  Courts have extended the meaning of 
conjugal to cover individuals living in a common law relationship 
and more recently have extended the meaning to include same sex 
partners living in a common law relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Rosenberg, a decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal on 
provisions of the Income Tax Act dealing with the registration of 
pension plans, the court amended the definition of spouse which 
refers to a person living in a conjugal relationship with the 
taxpayer to include same sex partner of the taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provisions of Bill C-78 refer to “a relationship of a conjugal 
nature” in order to capture the judicial meaning of conjugal in 
reference to same sex partners while ensuring the bill does not 
go beyond what the courts have said. 
For these reasons it is necessary to define the word conjugal in 
the legislation in this manner.

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>From a legal point of view physical intimacy is not considered 
the essential element in establishing the conjugality of a 
relationship.  Rather, from a legal point of view the courts have 
focused on the existence of a committed monogamous relationship 
in assessing whether a conjugal relationship exists.  It is in 
keeping with Bill C-78 and provides that only one person living 
in a common law relationship with a plan member will be 
recognized at the time of the plan member's death.  There are no 
provisions for the payment of more than one survivor benefit to 
more than one common law partner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to look at the Supreme Court of Canada decision in Egan 
and Nesbit, a very important decision and one that we in the 
Parliament of Canada are now obliged to follow and to recognize 
in terms of what it represents.  It is important to note that 
under the finding of discrimination five justices of the Supreme 
Court of Canada in four separate sets of reasons found that the 
definition of spouse infringed section 15 of the charter based on 
sexual orientation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I note that this is a very important issue and 
certainly one that we as a government take very seriously.  In 
the great scheme of things and in the great balance of fairness 
and equity, it is important we make sure that Bill C-78 is put in 
place in an effective manner in keeping with what Canadian 
society is all about.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
always good to speak in the House when you are in the chair, so I 
wish I could say it was a pleasure to be here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a beautiful day in Ottawa.  There are people in tour buses 
and school buses visiting the House of Commons and the Parliament 
of Canada, the centre of democracy in the country. Groups of 
school children and people from all over come here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are we doing?  What did we do an hour ago?  The government 
moved a motion to restrict debate on a bill as important as this 
one.  That goes against everything that the country stands for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes against some gentlemen I talked to last week in my 
office in Lethbridge.  They would have liked more time to have 
input into the decision being made here today because they are 
part of the group of pensioners being governed by this law.  They 
felt they were being shortchanged by not being able to have the 
input they wanted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today is the 52nd time the government has moved closure.  I can 
remember when the Liberals were on this side of the House in 
opposition and how they used to rail against the government 
moving closure.  Yet they seem to make it one of their everyday 
tools.  As important as the bill is, one would think some time 
would have been given in the parliamentary timetable to debate it 
properly and not to bring in closure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-78 and the amendments in Group No. 3 that we are 
specifically debating at this point will change how the 
government can deal with the pension plans of the public service, 
the RCMP and the Canadian forces.  This huge group of people has 
worked very hard in support of the country in all aspects.  They 
need to be recognized for the work they have done.  They should 
be able to retire in some form of security.  When they see a 
government sitting on a huge surplus and projecting huge 
surpluses for the next number of years reaching out to grab $30 
billion surplus out of their pension fund, they get somewhat 
nervous, and rightfully so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would a government sitting on such a huge surplus want 
another $30 billion?  Has it told us what it will do with the 
money?  Will it pay down the debt?  Will it pay the unfunded 
liability in the CPP that has built up?  It has not told us that. 
That is what makes the people who have paid into these plans all 
their lives and are counting on them to carry them through their 
golden years somewhat nervous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will give the government the right to seize the $30 
billion surplus. 
It will establish a public sector pension investment board.  That 
needs some looking at as well.  It is yet to be seen if the House 
will have a say over how that board is structured and who is 
going to be on it, or if it is just going to be another 
government patronage group.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Employee premiums will increase from 30% to 40%. The employees 
are going to fund 40% of this plan, beginning in 2004.  How does 
the government feel that it is entitled to the entire surplus? 
That needs debate.  If the government was responsible or the 
taxpayers were responsible for the entire contribution, then 
fine, but they are not.  The employees are contributing as well 
and they do not feel that the government has a right to take the 
entire surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion put forward by the Reform member for St. Albert would 
force an act of parliament to be passed in order for changes to 
be made to the contribution rate of the public sector pension 
plan, which currently is in the hands of Treasury Board.  I 
believe that is a very good motion.  I hope it will receive 
support from the House because decisions that are made to deal 
with the pension plan should be made by the House, not by the 
President of the Treasury Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason for that is because of our constituents.  When my 
constituents come to me for answers about what is going on with 
their pension fund, how can I respond to them if the decisions 
have not been made by the House but by a member of cabinet? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of these issues need to be addressed.  More and more we are 
seeing the purpose of the House eroded by closure and decisions 
being made outside the House rather than by the elected people of 
the country.  The government member who spoke before me mentioned 
a definition of spouse, a definition of survivor, that was 
decided by the courts.  More and more we are seeing the 
government leaning toward the courts to make the tough decisions 
which need to be established by law and should be established 
here after public debate.  That comes into this whole issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons people are concerned about this is, if the 
government balanced the budget on the backs of the taxpayers, why 
is it looking at $30 billion?  What does it want it for?  Why is 
it so eager to get its hands on it?  It seems that if people pile 
up more than $2 in one spot the government looks for ways to grab 
it away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider our health care system.  We have 180,000 people 
who are on waiting lists for health care in the country.  As a 
country we put $800 less per person into the health care system 
than our American counterparts.  We definitely have developed and 
the government is supporting a two tier health care system that 
is not necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, the government is sitting on a huge surplus and it wants 
another $30 billion from this pension fund.  Why are some of 
these things not being done?  The waiting time for Canadians to 
receive health care is increasing.  The length of time to see a 
specialist is increasing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This all comes back to the fact that there have been severe 
funding cuts to health care, while at the same time the 
government is sitting on a surplus.  It is looking at every 
corner of its mandate to find pools of money that it can pull 
back, but not explaining to Canadians and to the House exactly 
what that money is going to be used for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is all part of the equation which boils down to the problem 
that we are having with Bill C-78.  The whole idea of bringing 
issues such as these to the floor of the House to be debated is 
part of what we are discussing today.  The government has 
introduced closure and members who wanted to have a chance to 
debate this bill will not have that chance.  People who want 
information from this government will not receive it.  Therein 
lies the problem.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the member for St. Albert who has worked so hard on 
all of these issues and put forward some very good amendments.  I 
would certainly hope that members of all parties in the House 
would have a look at the amendments and consider the fact that 
the amendments we are proposing would make this bill far better 
than it is.  They would give some accountability through this 
place, through elected members of parliament, to the people of 
Canada.  If nothing else, the issue of accountability and the 
issue that decisions should be made here, not elsewhere, is very 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say to the people of my riding and certainly 
right across Canada who are members of this pension plan and who 
are concerned with what is going on that they can rest assured 
that this party, regardless of the outcome of the vote, will keep 
an eye on the government and keep its feet to the fire to make 
sure that this pension plan is solid and will be there to help 
them through the rest of their lives.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles-A. Perron (Rivière-des-Mille-Îles, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to speak this morning to Bill C-78 with some sadness and 
some bitterness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadness, because the government this morning, through the 
government House leader, took a most, if not the most, 
undemocratic step one can take in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadness, because all the Liberal members voted in favour of this 
closure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a minute of my time to pay respect to this 
rapidly disappearing democracy, a minute of my speaking time so 
all the elected officials in this House may reflect on the 
effects of abusing democracy in this manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Perhaps the hon. member could tell us 
whether he wishes to continue his speech or whether he has 
finished for the moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can continue certainly afterward, if the hon. member wishes, 
but he may speak only once to each group of amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles-A. Perron:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will continue my speech, but 
I believe silence says a lot.  It is a means of expression. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask your permission to finish my minute of silence.  It 
had lasted barely some 15 seconds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> This is not usual practice.  Usually the 
Speaker calls for a minute of silence on the death of someone, 
but not during a debate.  I do not think it is appropriate, and 
I hope the hon. member will resume his remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the point my colleague is trying to make today about 
democracy taking a back seat is a very important one.  This is 
not the first time this has happened.  There have been at least 
50 other such occasions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is my colleague's request in order, under House procedure?  His 
allotted time is his.  He has ten minutes.  We are told that we 
have ten minutes in which to express our views. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One means of expression is the spoken word and the other is 
silence.  I would like a ruling on this and whether it is 
acceptable, under parliamentary procedure, for my colleague to 
say nothing for one minute.  That is one form of expression. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The Chair has recognized the point, but I do 
not think it is usual to have one minute of silence during a 
speech.  The point of a speech in the House is to express an 
opinion.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member wishes to stop speaking for ten minutes or 
one minute or even 30 seconds during the time allotted him to 
speak, he may do so with the unanimous consent of the House, but 
I think one would normally make a speech in the time allotted. 
That is why I have indicated to the hon. member that, if he 
wishes to resume speaking, he may now do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite him to go ahead, or I can seek the unanimous consent of 
the House for the hon. member to observe a moment of silence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that agreed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel:</B> Mr. Speaker, with all due respect, we are 
given to understand that there is freedom of expression in this 
House. Seeking the unanimous consent of the House for the point 
my colleague wishes to make is a bit like seeking its approval 
for what he will say and the approach he will take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that, from now on, what we want to say in the House 
must first be approved by a majority of members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The purpose of expression in this House, as 
I have indicated, is to make speeches, and the hon. member has a 
right to do that.  I do not believe it is normal to have moments 
of silence during a speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One cannot, for example, ask for 10 minutes in which to say 
nothing.  The member must speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is entitled to do this, and there is no 
unanimous consent in the House for him to do otherwise.  I 
therefore invite him to continue.  I have already made a ruling 
on this issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder. Did my colleague use language that was in contempt of 
parliament?  No.  Did my colleague use props to illustrate what 
he was saying?  No.  Is my colleague inappropriately attired, 
and thus deserving of expulsion from the House?  No.  Did my 
colleague use unparliamentary language which could offend the 
institution?  No.  Does my colleague have a right to express 
himself?  Is there a translation problem if my colleague decides 
to remain silent for a minute? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. I have already made a ruling 
on this point and I believe we now need to continue debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this House is to hold debate, and there is time 
allocated for that, not for silence.  If he wants to remain 
silent, let him do that in his seat, or in the lobbies, but in 
the House we are here to debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, you have said that the purpose of 
this House is to debate.  How then can it be that you prevent my 
colleague from taking a minute of silence, because you claim it 
prevents debate, yet when the government introduces a gag 
motion, which deprives us of our right— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please.  The hon. member knows very 
well that the Speaker is not here to answer questions.  I am 
here to rule on points of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already given my ruling and I ask the hon. member for 
Rivière-des-Mille-Îles to continue his speech without raising 
any further points of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Speaker.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was never my intention to treat this House as a circus or a 
place of ridicule.  I have too much respect for the people here 
to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us turn now to Bill C-78.  I would like to provide a bit of 
background.  The President of the Treasury Board created an 
advisory committee on the Public Service Superannuation Act to 
look at pensions within the public service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This committee carried on consultations for four years.  It 
comprised members of the government, public servants and 
representatives of employee and pensioner associations. 
Everyone contributed effectively to this committee.  The 
President of the Treasury Board recognized the 
committee's effectiveness. 
We will recall that the president said in February 1998, 
“that the government had accepted a certain number of the 
committee's recommendations”.  These words speak reams. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why then, a few years later, did this government make an about 
face?  It totally changed its position.  It did so simply 
because the President of the Treasury Board sat down at the 
table in cabinet, and the finance minister, also called the 
ships minister, saw an opportunity to get hold of some money so 
he could boast about his government's good management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister finds it tempting to take from a fund of nearly 
$30.2 billion the government does not contribute to anymore. 
This fund is made up of the public service, RCMP and Canadian 
forces pension funds, which have built up a surplus of $30 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation will allow the government, and particularly the 
Minister of Finance, to take this $30 billion and say “Look how 
good I am. I have achieved a zero deficit. Look how great it 
is”. The government has made a habit of doing that. Remember the 
siphoning of money from the employment insurance fund. Remember 
the transfer cuts imposed on the provinces by the Minister of 
Finance and this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Remember that, in the health sector alone, the government has 
cut over $20 billion in the transfers to the provinces. Now, a 
few years later, it is boasting and saying “We will reinvest 
$11.5 billion of your money, the money that we siphoned off. 
But we will be the ones investing your money”. The 
government siphoned off $20 billion and is now reinvesting $11 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is outrageous because, without telling anyone, this 
government decided to change the formula that determines 
equalization payments. The new formula will use a per capita 
basis, which, again, will create problems for the Quebec 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the new formula, Quebec will get less than 8% of these 
$11.5 billion, while Ontario's share will be very close to 47%. 
Talk about fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us now take a look at what Bill C-78 does. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1250"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT26"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT26"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1250

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bill C-78, the government has had another brilliant idea, 
which is to form a sort of management committee to administer 
the $30 billion surplus in the fund.  The committee will be 
appointed by the President of the Treasury Board, and the unions 
and retired employees will have no say.  This committee will be 
packed with friends of the government, those who contribute to 
its campaign fund, and those to whom it owes favours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is oddly reminiscent of the other agencies this government 
has had the bad habit of establishing, such as ADM, the Canada 
Customs and Revenue Agency, the Canadian Wheat Board, and Nav 
Canada, among others.  When there is a problem with these 
agencies and we ask a question in the House, what do the members 
opposite say?  They say that they have created an agency that is 
responsible for its actions and that the directors are old 
enough to manage the taxpayers' money.  This money is being 
managed by people who are not accountable.  It is a disgrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would like to remind the House that, this 
morning, we have witnessed something very sad, as we do here all 
too frequently.  Once again, I am bitterly disappointed at what 
is happening to democracy in this country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
with a degree of sadness that I rise to speak to the amendments 
in Group No. 3, Motions Nos. 16, 39 and 47 at report stage of 
Bill C-78. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I am sad is that individuals who are at home watching 
this series of speeches will be thinking that there is serious 
ongoing parliamentary debate to ensure that the right thing is 
being done with respect to this piece of legislation, in 
particular with these Group No. 3 amendments.  I am sad to say 
that again the government has resorted to closure.  Again the 
democratically elected individuals in the House are not able to 
properly debate this very important issue we have at hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are primarily talking about the pensions of our valued civil 
servants whether they be in the RCMP or other areas.  The average 
pension of these individuals is in the neighbourhood of $9,000. 
The government under the guise of this legislation will say that 
it is managing its resources in a more prudent fashion.  We know 
that the government may be looking at potentially garnishing the 
accumulated surplus in these funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will revert to Group No. 3 as it is imperative that we refer 
to the amendments. Motions Nos. 16, 39 and 47 in Group No. 3 
would give the power to set pension contributions to parliament 
rather than to the President of the Treasury Board.  This is a 
small step toward restoring part of the role parliamentarians 
should play in Canada, but it does not address many of the more 
serious deficiencies in Bill C-78. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, this bill does not make a strong enough link 
between the actuary of the fund, that is, the CPP actuary, and 
the board that will oversee the investments of the fund.  In 
fact, nowhere in Bill C-78 is it specified when and how often the 
actuary will meet with or make a report on the fund to the board 
or to the government.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The President of Treasury Board will have incredible powers 
under this legislation with the ultimate power to set 
contributions and benefit levels.  Imagine the following 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government of the day decides it will have an election in a 
year or two.  It wants to offer the voters some election goodies 
in the platform.  Essentially the government wants to buy the 
votes of Canadians.  A nice quiet and discreet way of stockpiling 
a little dough for just this occasion would be to set a pension 
contribution rate slightly higher than the rate really needs to 
be.  In a year or two the government would have hundreds of 
millions of dollars to throw around.  The best part is that 
nobody would have seen the government building up this nice 
little slush fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-78 will allow the government to withdraw the current 
surplus of over $28 billion from the fund over a period of up to 
15 years.  Any future surplus can also be withdrawn from the 
fund, or the government may reduce employee or employer 
contributions. What are the chances the Liberals will do the 
right thing with these surpluses? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993 the Liberal government has continuously taken more 
from Canadians while giving less in return.  Tax revenues are at 
a record high and government services are at a record low. From 
1993 to 1998 the government took in an extra $35 billion in tax 
revenues but at the same time cut $20 billion from health care 
and education transfers, the priorities of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no mechanism in Bill C-78 for parliament to hold the 
government accountable for these surplus withdrawals.  Let us 
look at what is currently happening with the EI fund.  The 
government takes in over $7 billion annually within the EI fund 
than the program actually consumes on an annual basis.  With this 
track record, I am fearful for the Canadian taxpayer that Bill 
C-78 will permit the government to do this with another fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently pension and CPP contributions are linked and capped at 
7.5% of salary for public servants, the RCMP and the Canadian 
forces.  Bill C-78 will de-link these contributions and allow for 
CPP contributions to increase until 2003 while pension 
contributions will remain frozen at 4%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After 2003, pension contributions are expected to increase so 
the employees' contributions rise to 40% of total contributions. 
This means that public servants, the RCMP and Canadian forces 
personnel could see pension and CPP contributions rise steadily 
over the next five to 10 years. This could seriously erode the 
progress the Canadian forces made in their quality of life salary 
increases announced recently, and I will commend the government 
for taking that step in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-78 establishes a public service pension fund investment 
board similar to the Canada pension plan investment board.  The 
fund will now invest in the stock and bond markets rather than 
the Government of Canada bonds it now invests in.  In fact, 
maximizing returns is written into Bill C-78 which is a good 
idea.  This will help the pension fund achieve higher returns and 
allow for lower contributions in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The pension fund however will be subject to the current rules 
regarding foreign assets, that is, the fund can only invest up to 
20% of the assets in foreign property.  This will have two major 
impacts for employees and pensioners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their savings will not grow as fast as they otherwise could if 
there were less restrictive rules on foreign content. When this 
fund has assets in the $100 billion to $120 billion range, it 
could end up costing nearly $250 million in forgone wealth 
accumulation because historically Canadian markets have not 
performed as well as the American and European markets.  Even 
most of Asia has done better than Canada despite the recent 
crashes and meltdowns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second impact of the 20% foreign content rule relates to the 
ultimate size of this fund.  In not too many years the fund will 
account for a substantial portion of the stock markets in Canada. 
How will it be able to buy and sell companies without disrupting 
the markets? Managers of mutual funds in the $1 billion to $2 
billion range say that they have problems buying or selling some 
stocks because their actions cause significant variations in the 
price of a stock.  Imagine the effects of a fund worth over $100 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another problem not addressed in this legislation is that of the 
RCMP.  The RCMP's pension funds will be invested in this fund as 
well, but the Liberals as far as I can tell have not thought 
about some of the problems that might arise from this fact.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would happen if the RCMP began investigating a company that 
was part of its pension fund?  If the officers had to choose 
between shutting down the firm due to illegal activities and 
turning a blind eye because $5 billion or $10 billion of their 
retirement money was at stake, what would they do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can think of the example of YBM Magnex.  It was found to be 
linked to the Russian Mafia.  It was delisted from the stock 
exchange and by some mutual companies, and individual investors 
lost millions of dollars in their portfolios. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current Liberal government seems to have an insatiable 
appetite for money, no matter where the money comes from, 
taxpayers or government employees.  Bill C-78 will concentrate 
the power of cabinet ministers and further erode the role of 
parliamentarians.  If the government truly wanted to maximize 
returns for retirees, it would increase the allowable limit on 
foreign content in the bill and all other pension and RRSP 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the Liberal track record to date of record levels of tax 
revenue, government expenditures being consistently higher than 
estimated, and erosion of government services, Canadians will 
surely pay more and get less. 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to 
speak to Bill C-78.  I commend the Bloc Party for attempting to 
have moment of silence for the death of democracy this morning. I 
thought it was a very good tribute.  I stand and applaud the Bloc 
for that.  Although I may not agree with the Bloc in much of its 
politics, the fact is that it is right on with this one.  It is 
the death of democracy in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over 50 time allocation or closure motions have been brought 
forth by the government since 1993.  Bill C-78 is over 200 pages 
thick with legislation, some of which contains serious public 
policy.  It affects over 1.8 million Canadians currently working 
for the federal service and those who are retired.  It also 
affects every Canadian from coast to coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask again why the government is ramming the legislation 
through.  The only answer is that it has an awful lot to hide and 
it just cannot get its hands on that money fast enough.  It just 
has to have it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure the House of the difference between an NDPer and a 
Liberal.  We will walk down the street and see a quarter on the 
ground.  An NDPer will pick up that quarter and give it to a 
street person.  A Liberal will pick up that quarter, pocket it 
and not share it with anyone.  That is the problem.  That is the 
difference between the New Democratic Party and the Liberal 
Party.  It is as clear as night. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform and Conservative members are rightfully upset by the 
bill.  We must understand that all the Liberals are doing is 
reforming Tory policies.  If Canadians want true democracy in the 
country, they should elect a full house of New Democrats from 
coast to coast to coast, provincially and federally.  Then we 
would have some solid democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-78 affects every Canadian.  I do not think the Liberals 
have thought this one through.  It will come back to haunt them 
in spades.  They are ramming it through when the newspapers are 
full of items like Kosovo and other issues.  They want it through 
the House by early June.  Then they will go away and say “look 
what we have done, folks”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is my prediction of what will happen six months prior to 
the next federal election.  The Right Hon. Prime Minister will 
step down.  His finance minister may win the nomination to be the 
Liberal leader.  He will then come to my riding, or a Reform 
riding, a Conservative riding, the riding of my colleague from 
Winnipeg Centre or the riding of my colleague from Halifax West, 
with $30 billion from the EI fund.  Probably the surplus in the 
pension fund will be $35 billion at that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He will have about $65 billion in his pocket and he will ask 
everyone what they need.  If they need a road, it will be done. 
If they need another prison, it will be done.  If they need tax 
breaks, it will be done.  Those things will be done on the backs 
of the workers, just as the Liberals did with the EI surplus. 
They took $11.5 billion over five years and dedicated it to 
health care. 
That was the money of employers and employees.  Now they will do 
the same with the surplus in the Canada pension fund.  This money 
does not belong to them.  It belongs to the workers who worked 
hard for it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons we have such a wonderful country is our 
public service.  Our military men and women throughout the world 
work hard on behalf of Canada.  What has been their answer to 
them for their efforts over the years?  More taxes for one thing, 
absolutely.  Now they are grabbing their pensions and next year 
or the year after they will have to pay more into their pension 
plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I may stand corrected on this one point, but this does not 
affect MPs, members of parliament.  I am not sure on that.  I 
will have to check into it.  If it does not, obviously it is 
another scandal we will have to go after the Liberals for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of all PSAC workers in Nova Scotia and across the 
country, on behalf of the RCMP, and on behalf of the military 
personnel at Shearwater base in my riding, whom my wonderful 
colleague from Halifax West, our defence critic, knows very well, 
what the government is doing to their pension plans is an 
outrage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What an absolute disgrace that Liberals treat our military 
personnel, civilian workers and public service workers in that 
fashion.  They are treating them with absolutely no regard at 
all.  A classic example was the recent pay equity decision.  They 
will fight pay equity tooth and nail.  In most cases they are 
offending the women of the country by not honouring their 
commitment to pay equity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that it was the Liberals who said in 
opposition that when they formed the government they would honour 
the commitment to pay equity.  They went back on their word.  I 
cannot say they l-i-e-d, but that is exactly what they did.  They 
went back on their word. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member 
cannot bring in through the back door what the hon. member cannot 
bring in the front door.  We ask the hon. member for 
Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern Shore to retract the word 
l-i-e-d. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I absolutely retract it 
and apologize to you and the House for spelling out that word. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The facts are still the facts.  This is precisely what the 
Liberals are doing.  They say one thing in opposition and now 
that they are in government they completely reverse their 
proposal.  No wonder the Reform, the Bloc, the Conservatives and 
the New Democrats are so angry with them.  No wonder even some of 
its backbenchers are so angry with the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will come back to haunt the Liberals big time.  Mark my 
words.  They have an opportunity right now to retract Bill C-78 
and take it back to the drawing board.  The next time, if they 
want to do anything with it, they should talk to the people most 
affected by it: public service workers, the RCMP, the military 
and the people who work in the House of Commons.  They are the 
ones to whom the Liberals should be talking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on and on and on.  I can give many examples of how 
deplorable government policies are toward working people.  Bill 
C-78 is just a classic example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following on the heels is Bill C-32, the CEPA amendments.  Mark 
my words, the Liberals will invoke closure on that one as well. 
There were over 800 amendments to that bill.  Bill C-78 should 
have many more amendments to it but they were not allowed.  I 
have always said that the Liberals believe in a capitulated 
democracy:  one can say and do whatever one wants as long as one 
does what they tell one to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not take up much more time of the House.  My voice is 
starting to wane after wailing about the government for over two 
years.  I ask the government to retract Bill C-78 and never to 
invoke closure again on something as important to the Canadian 
people. 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords—Lloydminster, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise to reiterate some of the points 
my colleague from Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern Shore 
made so well in the last few minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the Liberals for giving me the opportunity to say a few 
words today about Bill C-78.  Without their dedication to 
limiting democracy we might even have a few more words to say. 
This is about 50-plus times we have seen closure in the House. It 
makes us wonder about the capitulated democracy which was talked 
about earlier.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning we saw a bit of tinkering with some very good 
amendments that needed to come forward.  We heard quotes from the 
member for Waterloo—Wellington and his quote was— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  It must be made very 
clear that the government did not tinker with the amendments that 
came forward.  I made it very clear when I made the ruling this 
morning that it was an error made by the Chair.  It had nothing 
to do with the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz:</B>  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for clarifying 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Waterloo—Wellington talked about some of the 
amendments which redefine spouse, survivor and so on.  He 
indicated that parliament was merely keeping pace with court 
actions.  That was quite a statement.  On this side of the House 
we would call that judicial activism.  The government of the day 
abrogated its responsibilities on politically correct or 
sensitive issues to the unelected courts.  It is back door 
democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will refer to some comments made on Tuesday by the member for 
Mississauga West.  At one point he said the $30 billion pension 
surplus was generated primarily through good management of the 
pension fund.  That is a real oxymoron when it comes to 
government generated returns on anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder how he would define the $13 billion taxpayers had to 
put into the fund at one point to make up for shortfalls, or the 
fact that the surplus was the result of a disastrous economic 
philosophy in the 1980s to fight inflation with high interest 
rates and wage freezes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he also think it is good management, especially in light of 
future possibilities of shortfalls or setbacks in financial 
markets, for his government not only to arbitrarily seize a $30 
billion paper surplus but also to have used accounting tricks to 
date to drain off $10 billion before now? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He claimed yesterday that his government should identify 
surpluses in each and every plan, in each and every department, 
supposedly to pay down the debt.  We know it will not go there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There may be merit in doing that, but what is the government 
doing instead?  I direct the member to the budget figures which 
show a $4 billion overdraft on the spending projections and a 
debt frozen at $580 billion into the foreseeable future.  If the 
shuffling contingent of Liberal backbenchers from Ontario had any 
clout or economic sense, they could convince their future leader 
to freeze spending and actually reduce the debt rather than let 
it sit there like a leech sucking the lifeblood out of the 
Canadian taxpayer.  It amounts to $42 billion a year in interest 
payments and it is not going down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-78 deals with a very contentious issue for which 
governments across the country have never shown much enthusiasm. 
Who owns any pension surplus?  Since employers and employees 
contribute to the original funds it would seem fair to divide it 
between the two parties somehow.  An alternative could be to 
reduce the contributions and/or raise the benefits, or perhaps 
arrange for some kind of one time payout to both side, something 
that is equitable.  The federal government says no.  It has its 
hands on the purse strings and claims the spoils for its own 
purposes, whatever they might be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite have tried to question our integrity on this 
side for not wanting to back the government on this matter, but 
let us look at what it is really doing.  It froze wages for six 
years so that anybody still in a particular job classification 
has not had a raise for a while.  That depresses the liability 
for their ultimate pension level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 we recognized a growing surplus sitting on the 
government books, certainly not sitting in a vault somewhere. 
There is no cash pool somewhere as some would have us believe. 
The wizards at finance waved their magic pencils and turned red 
ink to black.  Some $10 billion in liability disappeared without 
debate or vote, or any consultation with the people involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite will rightly give us credit for being in favour 
of reducing government liabilities, but the way to do it is not 
in the backroom, without consultation and, worst of all, in a one 
shot deal which does not get to the root of what is wrong with 
government, excessive spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see the finance minister raid the so-called EI fund.  We see 
him lay claim to the public pension surplus.  We see him prebook 
future expenses to hide taxpayer surpluses today. That is not the 
way to balance the books.  That is not fair because he will run 
out of unguarded accounts to claim.  Inevitably there will be 
dips and bumps in the road that will cause our economic 
performance to fluctuate in the days ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What if the interest rates rise as they seem poised to do in the 
States?  The burden represented by that festering debt will grow 
in leaps and bounds just when the North American economy slows 
down, as it surely will.  At that point will the Liberals be 
prepared to give up their support for porno films and kite flying 
projects? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even with Bill C-78 on the order paper the finance department 
projections leave the $580 billion debt untouched.  In other 
words, it has not committed to subtracting this $30 billion 
windfall.  Left as it is, interest payments drain over $40 
billion from the government's books every year before it has paid 
for a single mile of road or another hospital bed that is so 
badly needed. 
That is not prudent or responsible.  The fundamentals are not 
right.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite will claim that the pension surplus will be 
devoted to debt reduction but we have no assurance of that. We 
suspect the $30 billion will be used to finance pre-election 
goodies and canoe museums.  The Liberals have to admit their 
track record would suggest that this is a more likely outcome 
than debt reduction or that much cried about tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition parties have put forward over 50 amendments to 
bring accountability and openness to the process of reforming the 
public service pension system.  Let us be clear on this.  The 
pension system was out of date and the unions and the pensioner 
associations agreed that something needed to be done.  I am sure 
they can see that it was time public service employees accepted 
their share in CPP premium increases and re-balanced that 
proportion between the public pension and the government pension 
premiums. I understand that the employee representatives also 
agreed on the mandate for the new pension investment board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question before us is not is it good or bad to have a new 
investment regime for public service pensions or is it good or 
bad that it should be done by an arm's length investment board. 
The question before us is simple.  Has the government been open 
and up front about how it has managed the previous system?  I do 
not think so.  Has it developed the best possible new system and 
is it entitled to walk away with $30 billion to squander on 
programs that it likes?  I do not think so and the majority of 
Canadians agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party, particularly through the strenuous efforts of 
the member for St. Albert, has tried to wrestle this massive bill 
into some sort of responsible direction.  Our amendments would 
bring accountability to the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, we recommend that the board of directors of the new 
investment board maintain contact with the actuaries of each fund 
under their management.  It sounds like a simple business 
procedure.  We want appointments to the board as well as those to 
the investment committees to be tabled in the House.  We want to 
delete the clauses which allow the government to make off with 
the surplus in the first place.  We also want a separate act to 
set the contribution rate for the RCMP superannuation fund, not 
have it determined behind closed doors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have a problem with the vague and unnecessary 
interference with personal relationships.  A number of amendments 
in Group No. 2 refer to the problems that will arise as this 
government fumbles its way toward accommodating special interest 
lobbies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have attempted to socially engineer the public 
service pension system by introducing the vacuous term, survivor, 
249 times in this bill.  They also introduced the qualification, 
relationship of a conjugal nature, to modestly describe same sex 
partnerships.  Who will keep score?  How will we stay on top of 
that?  Or at least that is what we are left to assume.  The 
terminology is vague and will no doubt open up a whole new can of 
worms when some other groups decide they have been left out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been estimated that the cost of recognizing same sex 
partners in Bill C-78 will be quite small, but this is not the 
issue.  If the government wants back into the bedrooms of the 
nation that it supposedly vacated 20 years ago under Prime 
Minister Trudeau, then it should bring the issue to the floor of 
this House, not the courts.  It should offer genuine and open 
debate and create legislation that addresses what needs 
addressing, not drop confusing hints and ambiguous references in 
this omnibus legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party recommends the surplus be left where it is to 
smooth the transition to a new and better administered pension 
system than we presently have.  We are in favour of reduced 
government liabilities and better returns for our Canadian 
pensioners, but we cannot support slippery, open-ended and 
underhanded methods of financing re-election campaigns that we 
see in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague from Medicine Hat has said in the past on the EI 
grab, why does the finance minister not just leave the money 
where it is, put his hands where we can see them and back away 
slowly?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, what has been 
happening here these past few days is utterly deplorable. I said 
these past few days, but I could have said these past few months 
or these past few years, because the opposition has been 
subjected to closure more than 50 times. We are no longer in a 
parliament where we can speak freely. We cannot even express 
ourselves through silence, because of an earlier ruling by the 
Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we want to talk, we are denied the right to do so. We are 
not allowed not to talk, and we are denied the right to talk 
long enough to make a thorough examination of the bills before 
us. 
What has been happening here these past few months and these 
past few years—in fact, since the Liberals took office—is 
absolutely appalling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Liberal Party was in opposition, it said exactly the 
same thing we are saying today. Does this mean that, once in 
office, a party tends to forget everything it said previously? 
There is no chance the Bloc Quebecois will ever be in office in 
Ottawa. That is why we can debate issues very openly and we can 
say there is a limit to how far one can go in showing so little 
respect for democracy.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to mention the tyranny that exists in committees 
where, once again, government members form the majority. We are 
constantly being told that there will be a time limit, that the 
committee will take only so much time to do such and such a 
thing. The minister will appear, but will not be able to testify 
for very long. This is what I call the tyranny of the majority. 
It is sad that there are not more government members here today, 
because I would like them to hear what I have to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also thought the government House leader was extremely 
arrogant this morning, when he moved time allocation. 
He was smiling and laughing because he had just gagged the 
opposition so that we would not have all the time required to 
speak out on a bill of such fundamental importance as this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are not two kinds of MPs.  There ought to be just one 
kind.  We have all been elected by our constituents, but some 
assume additional rights over the others.  I am referring again 
to what I call the tyranny of the majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to pause a moment now, if I may.  I do not want to 
use unparliamentary language, and what has taken place here is 
too irritating.  If I may, I will put my papers into order a bit 
and start up again in a minute.  I find what has taken place 
here deplorable and I would not like to get carried away.  If I 
may, I will take a minute to calm down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members are well aware that we do not have to put up with 
the state our colleague is in.  One is not allowed to do 
indirectly what one cannot do directly.  When someone's papers 
are mixed up, and it takes a minute to get them straight, and 
that same person was the one who asked just now for a minute of 
silence, we are nobody's fools, at least not on this side of the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like us to continue, because I want to hear the 
speeches. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  From time to time I 
am sure there are many members in the House and certainly many 
Canadians who would think that perhaps more silence from this 
chamber would be a good thing.  The hon. member for Saint-Jean 
has 10 minutes of debate.  Provided the debate goes forward, I 
think we should allow the hon. member for Saint-Jean to organize 
his thoughts as he sees fit.

solicitude.  Unlike the member for Bourassa, you can understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a person does not want to start using unparliamentary 
language, he is sometimes better off taking a break. I have 
calmed down now.  I thank you for your decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, we have two motions before us.  There is Motion No. 16 
calling on parliament to pass an act of parliament if it wishes 
to change the contribution rate to the employee pension fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> When is he going to stop talking? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am having trouble 
concentrating because of the member for Bourassa's continual 
interruptions. 
Could you caution him so that I might continue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is one other way the tyranny of the majority is exercised 
in this House.  When opposition members are speaking, we are 
continually being interrupted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
They are preventing me from speaking.  I too can speak while he 
does.  I am simply following his logic— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> No, you do not have the floor. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Bourassa will have an occasion to participate in the debate and I 
am sure other members would welcome that lucid participation. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I hope the points of order my 
colleague from Bourassa raised are not going to cut into my 10 
minutes of speaking time.  If my colleague interrupts me for 10 
minutes, I hope I  will still have my time to speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was talking about the importance for parliament of having a 
new approach when the time comes to deduct money for employee 
pensions.  Although this amendment was not introduced by the 
Bloc Quebecois, it is extremely important.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Up to now, everything that went on with the pension fund was out 
of parliament's control.  When the government decides, for 
example, as the President of the Treasury Board did, to play 
around with it a bit, it causes distortion.  Canada's parliament 
is never involved in the approach and the arrangements for 
consensus on what people should contribute weekly to their 
pension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is particularly deplorable as well is that these people, 
who have contributed to the accumulated surpluses we have now 
have annual incomes of some $9,000.  We are not talking about 
huge fortunes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, I understand that the Liberal Party wants to go 
after these people. 
These people do not contribute to the Liberal Party coffers like 
the big multinationals, the major banks and big business.  The 
Liberals give big business a sort of total absolution, they try 
not to bother it too much.  However, those who have had to pay 
from the start, as I said in my first speech, are the employees 
of the federal public service, women in the federal public 
service, who have been denied pay equity.  It is also the people 
on employment insurance who have paid for the fight against this 
government's deficit and debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one who quite neatly hides behind the President of the 
Treasury Board—the Minister of Finance. 
We never see him taking part in debates when it comes time to 
siphon off some money so that the government can then say how 
wonderful the Minister of Finance is for putting Canada back on 
track, reducing the deficit and starting to pay down the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It forgets to say that this has been done at the expense of 
unemployed workers.  It forgets to say that women are the losers 
in the pay equity battle.  It forgets to say quite a bit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing we have noticed is that the minister always sends 
others to the front lines.  The Minister of Human Resources 
Development will be sent out to cut EI payments.  The President 
of the Treasury Board will be sent after this amount. 
We have talked about robbing, raiding, taking over, and we have 
used parliamentary terms like siphoning, but we have stopped 
short of unparliamentary language.  I could have crossed the 
line a while ago, but for your wise ruling, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point of Motion No. 38, by the Bloc Quebecois, is to have 
the Income Tax Act apply.  Under the Income Tax Act, when there 
are surpluses in certain plans, the government may decide what 
to do with them, as provided in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the plans are listed in the Income Tax Act.  There are one, 
two or three exceptions, those before us today. 
At the time, it was agreed, and this is provided for in the act, 
that the armed forces, RCMP and public service pension funds 
would not be in the Income Tax Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, we simply want to find a way to deal with the surpluses and 
make sure that the Income Tax Act applies. This is merely a 
question of fairness, and it also shows the employees' good 
faith. They say “We want to go back to the act of 1985, and not 
just for the benefits. We want to take it as it is. We also want 
our pension plans to be listed in the Income Tax Act, which 
provides for a mechanism when a surplus becomes significant, so 
as to avoid having excessive surpluses”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to conclude with a motion. I move: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That all government members, whose government imposed a time 
allocation motion on the review of Bill C-78, be prevented from 
speaking during today's debate on this bill. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> Does the hon. member have 
the unanimous consent of the House to move his motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> No.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I find it hard to understand 
how a government that uses closure could then say “We used 
closure, you can no longer talk, but we will do the talking 
now”. Before closure, government members are silent. The 
opposition must do all the work. Then, when the government 
imposes closure, its members want to do all the talking. I think 
a review of House procedure is in order. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to be able to address the concerns we have regarding 
Bill C-78.  These concerns are being brought forward as we 
discuss the amendments to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The important principle that we must first look at before we 
discuss the amendments is how the process is being abused on this 
particular issue.  The government has chosen to move closure 
after only a few hours of debate on a bill that is important to 
all of us.   The Liberals are also trying to shift the debate by 
suggesting that the unions want the entire $30 billion surplus in 
the pension fund.  We know this is not the case.  The facts of 
the case are quite simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This fund belongs to the members of the plan.  Any surplus 
should be used for the benefit of the members and others 
affiliated with the plan such as retirees and widows.  This would 
be a very desirable use for the surplus.  However, the government 
wants to grab the money, put it in its coffers and say it has 
wrestled down the debt, but it will have been done on the 
backs of those who need the plan, those who have contributed and 
worked hard.  It will be done in the same way the EI fund was 
grabbed and taken away from those who are unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unions are not trying to stuff their pockets, but the 
government is certainly trying to stuff its pockets.  The unions 
want to improve benefits for their members, for the start-up 
costs in the future and for any changes to the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We realize there are 670,000 members of the plans affected. The 
allocation of the surplus needs to address the contributions of 
these members who have contributed to the plan.  We often hear 
the government say that the taxpayers own this money and that it 
is the taxpayers it must protect.  The people who contributed to 
these plans are also taxpayers and we must look at their benefits 
and their rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important point that is being missed is that a very 
established principle is being undermined by this action.  Under 
the Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985, a principle was 
established that the use of a surplus should be determined by 
two-thirds of the plan members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-78 and the Liberal's time allocation contradicts this 
principle.  It takes away the principle of ownership of surplus 
of funds which is inherent in both public and private pension 
plans.  It takes away the right of the pension plan members to 
determine what should be done with their surpluses.  This is a 
shift in the way pension surpluses would be dealt with and it 
should be of great concern to all Canadians in both the private 
and public service pension plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fundamental principle of agreement of all plan members is a 
principle that must be upheld.  This is really a democratic 
principle.  People should have the right to say what they feel 
should be done with the surpluses in their pension plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are certainly some questions that need to be answered as 
we look at this whole issue.  What possible justification can 
Liberals claim for shutting down democratic debate in parliament 
on a bill of this magnitude?  We have seen it happen over and 
over again.  We come to the House with an issue of very great 
importance to all of us and before we have a chance to debate it 
thoroughly and go into detail about it, the government calls for 
closure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why has parliament not had adequate opportunity to consider the 
effects on the economy or the effects on the public programs by 
taking the action it is taking? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This action is being taken at a time when our country is engaged 
in a war overseas in Kosovo, when matters of the highest order 
are consuming the public's attention and parliament's attention. 
It is at this time that the government seems to be trying to slip 
this complex legislation through.  The government is trying to 
get this legislation slipped through the House while Canadians' 
attention is diverted elsewhere.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who are we affecting with this legislation?  We are affecting 
the Canadian military, the people who are fighting over in 
Kosovo.  While they are away fighting, the government is back 
here grabbing the surplus from their pension funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also affecting the RCMP, the people who we entrust to 
keep law and order, to put their lives on the line fighting crime 
and to do all kinds of things to protect society.  While they are 
protecting society, who is protecting their pension fund? It is 
certainly not the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Caught with its hand in the cookie jar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle:</B>  A hand in the cookie jar, that is 
exactly what is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who is protecting the interests of the public servants, the 
people who work faithfully day in and day out trying to give 
effect to the laws and programs that parliament decides upon?  It 
is certainly not their employer, which is the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a lot of concerns about this particular legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the government recognize that the bill represents a shift 
in the way pension surpluses will be dealt with?  It is setting a 
precedent not just for the public sector but for the private 
sector as well.  Employers right across the country will soon be 
looking at the surpluses in the pension plans of their employees 
and deciding that they can perhaps take those to accommodate for 
business losses.  Why not?  The government has set the precedent 
by doing exactly that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the government consider an individual's pension to be part 
of the wage packet?  This again draws our attention to pay 
equity. What has the government done there?  It is withholding 
money that is due to its employees, money that has been ruled on 
by a human right tribunal and money that has been determined to 
be rightfully that of the employees.  The government is again 
failing to come to an agreement to settle those issues.  This is 
just a continuation of that pattern.  We have very great concerns 
about the approach that is being used by the government in this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at some of the people who are suffering the most 
from this:  widows, survivors and people in the low income 
bracket. The government talks about needing this money or wanting 
to take this money to improve things.  Why not improve the 
pension benefits for those who are receiving benefits? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently the average pension for a woman with 20 years service 
is $9,600 a year.  We know that $9,600 goes nowhere today. What 
is the government doing?  Instead of saying “We've got a surplus 
and we should try to improve those benefits”, it is saying 
“Let's take these benefits away, put it in our general coffers 
and pay down the debt”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the government not agree that much of the surplus was 
accumulated because of the wage freeze for the public sector 
employees and the delays in paying pay equity?  Does it not agree 
that this meant that many people received lower than expected 
pensions?  Does the government not agree that allowing the 
federal government to take the surplus means that employees must 
pay twice? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would like to say a theme that I constantly say 
in the House.  When we are dealing with matters of this 
importance, we should always be asking ourselves how we would 
want to be treated if we were in the same situation.  We should 
ask ourselves if we are treating people with respect and dignity 
when we do things that take away their right to have a say over 
their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we guide ourselves by the principle that we should not do 
something to others that we would not want done to ourselves, I 
am sure that we would have a much better approach in terms of 
governing the country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, once again I have to address the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a sad occasion as far as I am concerned when a property 
rights bill that I brought before parliament has fallen by the 
wayside.  However, I will save that matter for another day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that the longer the Liberals are in power, the more 
often we have to point out that this is a sad day for democracy 
in Canada.  Bill C-78 is another one of those sad days for 
Canadians under this arrogant, self-serving Liberal regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians do not have to believe me.  All they have to do is 
listen to the words of a pension plan expert. 
On May 2, Mic Cohen of the actuarial consultants William Mercer 
Ltd. was quoted in the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> as saying: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The handling of this bill is symptomatic of the government's 
failure to come clean with taxpayers and negotiate with its own 
unions.  It's a sad commentary on democracy.  When the government 
isn't prepared to agree, it bullies its way.  Now I think they 
are doing all the right things to fix the plan but the process 
stinks.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the actuary from William Mercer. The process 
stinks.  It stinks to high heaven.  The Liberals make it stink 
even worse by invoking closure or time allocation in the House to 
arbitrarily take away $30 billion from a pension fund surplus 
that rightfully belongs to both public servants who paid into 
their own pension plan and the taxpayers of Canada who paid the 
other share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I notice there are smiles and grins across the way.  This is a 
serious situation for the people involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is saying that the 670,000 employees and 
pensioners who are covered by this plan do not have a say in how 
the surplus will be managed or spent.  By limiting debate of this 
200 page monstrosity in the House of Commons and through 
committee, the government is also saying that it does not want 
the taxpayers to find out what it is doing with the share of the 
surplus paid into the pension plan by taxpayers.  It has hidden 
it.  The government is not disclosing what it is doing with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> also quoted another pension expert, 
pension lawyer Fiona Campbell.  She said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is unprecedented.  I'm not aware of pension legislation 
of this magnitude in both what it's trying to do and how quickly 
it's being done with no input from the people affected. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We just witnessed, even after this quotation, that the 
government has invoked closure on the bill.  It is limiting 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The <I>Citizen</I> article went on to say that Ms. Campbell is 
worried that the government's actions may allow other employers 
to lobby for changes that will allow them to get at pension 
surpluses when they need some cash.  Is this the tip of the 
iceberg?  Is this just the beginning?  If it is this easy for the 
government to just run roughshod over the rights of Canadians, 
when will it do it again and who else will take that as a 
precedent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is this so worrying?  It is because for the first time the 
government will have the power to change premiums or benefits 
without seeking parliamentary approval. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the government need this unprecedented power?  Why do 
so many bills rammed through the House create new powers for 
ministers to bypass parliament? The absolute power by the Prime 
Minister and his cabinet make a mockery of democracy except at 
election time.  I guess the logic of the cabinet is why bother 
going through the trouble of running a bill through the House of 
Commons when we can just pass one bill to give us the power to 
bypass parliament from now until forevermore.  This is called 
enabling legislation.  It enables the government to bypass 
parliament and put to regulation whatever it wishes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back in April of 1997, I wrote an article called “Power Grab”,

revenue from its employees.  In essence, it gives them the power

govern pension surpluses in federally regulated industries and 
then pass Bill C-78 which gives the government total control to 
do anything it wants with the pension surpluses?  Why? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One more question.  Why did the government not put the same 
provisions from the Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985 in Bill 
C-78?  Why?  Because it has the absolute power to do anything it 
wants.  And we all know that absolute power corrupts absolutely. 
To cap it all off, the government has made sure the secrets of 
how it handles or mishandles pension surpluses remain secret. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-78 denies the auditor general's conducting an audit of 
the board's investments.  The pension investment auditors will 
not have the power to report to parliament and the board will be 
exempt from access to information laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A couple of hours ago I asked the government some questions. 
They are on the record.  I do not think I have to repeat them. In 
fact I do not have time to repeat them.  It is refusing to answer 
these questions.  We are supposed to have a debate here and not 
only does the government invoke closure on this and limit the 
debate, but it does not even answer our questions.  It does not 
even have the courtesy to reply to the very serious questions we 
ask. I have just asked another series of questions.  I think it 
is about time the government came down off its high horse, became 
a little less arrogant and responded to our questions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I stand 
to speak against the amendments in Group No. 3. Each one is a 
frivolous amendment and does not help either the interests of the 
employees or the interests of the taxpayers as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind my colleagues that whenever there is a deficit in the 
pension plan, it is the responsibility of the government to make 
up for the shortfall.  The government is guaranteeing that the 
pension fund will remain there for the employees in the public 
sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand what the fuss is all about.  Even what we 
have before us is pure estimation that the liability of the 
government will be close to $96 billion over the next number of 
years, while the pension fund has been estimated at $126 billion. 
If there is a problem tomorrow, who is going to make up for the 
shortfall?  Is the opposition going to write a cheque to pay for 
the shortfall? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After all, whose money is it anyway?  Who has contributed to the 
pension fund in the first place?  The employees put in up to 
about 7.5% and the government matches the balance.   There is one 
thing for sure.  If the percentage of contribution is 70:30, 
60:40 or 50:50, right off the bat one would say if there is a 
surplus, that surplus should be shared equally by the employees 
and the employers. 
That is in theory if that is the case.

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have something completely different.  We have a 
situation where the government is absolutely on the hook, no 
matter what, under any circumstances.  If there is a shortfall, 
if there is a problem, the government will have to come up with 
the shortfall.  It will have to ensure that every public servant 
is guaranteed to have his or her pension for as long as they are 
eligible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is sound, good economics.  That is sound, good social 
policy on the part of the government to do what it is doing and 
frankly what it should have done a long time ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with those in the community who are asking for 
clarification in terms of what it is we should do from here on 
in. That is exactly what Treasury Board is trying to do with this 
proposed legislation.  It is trying to clarify things once and 
for all so there will be no grey area whatsoever.  We know what 
we have at this point, we clear it out and we start down the road 
again. As a result of that, everyone will know what his or her 
responsibilities are. Everyone will know what his or her rights 
are.  We will move forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To stand and say that the $30 billion belongs to the employees, 
I think is being unfair to the taxpayers of the country.  They 
were the ones in the first place who put out the cash, including 
the employees of the government, including those who are eligible 
for the pension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly, if we were to look at the proposal by the minister he 
has been quite forthcoming and pragmatic in his approach in 
trying to deal with some of the issues that have not been dealt 
with over the years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To say that we have something which in our estimate could be $30 
billion and we have to jump in and put our hands on it is unfair. 
It is totally uncalled for. In fact this money, as the 
government is planning to do, should remain in the public coffers 
because it belongs to the public. The employees of Canada should 
be guaranteed security and a right to access their pensions, and 
they are.  No one is taking anything away from them. It is the 
opposite.  There have been a number of improvements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The President of the Treasury Board has gone out of his way to 
accommodate those who are calling on the government to have a 
proper mechanism to equally and collectively manage the funds and 
the pension benefits. If someone were to say, “I will call for 
better management and administration of the public service 
pension fund, a joint administration of that”, we are quite open 
to it.  What some colleagues on the opposite side of the House 
are asking for is absolutely ridiculous and no one in their right 
mind on either side of the House would go for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are unnecessarily delaying the passage of the bill by putting 
amendments that have nothing to do with the facts.  A good number 
of those amendments are based on fiction and on wild imagination 
that somewhere somehow this money belongs to someone.  Yes it 
does.  It belongs to us collectively as taxpayers.  It also 
belongs to the public servants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one is saying it does not belong to the public servants, but 
it belongs to the public servants as taxpayers of the nation and 
not as individuals. As individuals they are entitled to their 
pensions no matter what.  No one is going to take more than what 
they are entitled to and no one is going to take less than what 
they are entitled to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To that extent I am at a loss to hear some of my colleagues 
calling for things that are unwarranted, uncalled for and asking 
the government to do things.  It is irresponsible to ask for 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The President of the Treasury Board is doing the absolutely 
responsible and right thing.  I commend him for that. I would 
like to see the proposals he has implemented as quickly as 
possible so the representatives of the employees and the 
government can work together collectively in a partnership to 
better manage the pension funds for generations to come.

has moved closure on will affect Canadians from coast to coast

bill will cause more confusion, more anger, more disappointment

I can guarantee that simply because the Liberals are letting 
through the side door and the back door and through the roof what 
they are saying up front.  It is a camouflage bill.  It totally 
distorts something which is true and historic to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have presented hundreds, not dozens but hundreds of petitions 
to the House which this bill completely ignores.  I want to use 
an analogy.  In the town where I lived as a boy there was a store

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have recently learned that at the Calgary Foothills hospital 
there are procedures being performed known as genetic

routinely induces premature labour of mothers whose unborn

attention or nourishment. In one case an attending nurse has 
described how an apparently viable baby was left for some 12

As a result, they have had to fight for wages that truly reflect

suggested a few years ago.  They are professionals, dedicated and 
committed to the well-being of human kind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nurses everywhere have been made to suffer as a result of 
government cuts to health care.  They suffer from workload 
fatigue and are stressed from worry over how to deliver quality 
care with limited resources.  They are denied job and economic 
security by the casualization of nursing positions.  Is it any 
wonder we are facing a nursing shortage? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments and employers have a responsibility to foster 
environments and work conditions that promote a quality of life 
for nurses.  That is a sure way of increasing entrants into

recruiting nurses and, finally, of retaining nurses.

<P><A NAME="LINK90"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we were 
saddened yesterday to learn of the untimely death of Mr. Marcel 
Pépin, ombudsman for the CBC French network. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After an illustrious career at <I>Le Droit</I>, <I>La Presse</I> and <I>Le 
Soleil</I>, Marcel Pépin gained still more recognition as the first 
chairman of the Commission d'accès à l'information du Québec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After heading Radio-Canada's radio news services, he went on to 
become vice-president of French-language radio, and then ombudsman 
in 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just recently, Ombudsman Marcel Pépin gained attention for his 
painstaking report in response to a complaint against 
Radio-Canada by the Office of the Prime Minister of Canada 
concerning the events surrounding the Asia-Pacific summit in 
Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marcel Pépin was passionately interested in politics and an 
independent soul.  He was a staunch and untiring defender of the 
freedom to inform and the right to be informed, as well as a 
great believer in the importance of maintaining a relationship 
of independence and non-interference between journalists and 
those in power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marcel Pépin, you will be greatly missed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this week, 
the Canadian and Quebec governments met and put aside their old 
jurisdictional quarrels to properly welcome Kosovar refugees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For over a month now, these refugees have been experiencing the 
pain of having been forced out of their homes, villages and 
homeland. Deprived of shelter and exhausted, thousands of people 
still managed to reach refugee camps. Canada then invited some 
of them to settle here, and quickly provided humanitarian and 
material assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This week, the Quebec government announced the concrete measures 
that it will take to welcome Kosovar refugees. These efforts on 
the part of the Canadian and Quebec governments make all 
Quebeckers proud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We wish a warm welcome to these women, men and children, and we 
hope they can resume a normal life here, in peace and serenity, 
while waiting to go back to Kosovo.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, on behalf of 
the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, I am pleased to 
recognize Quebec family week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this week, whose theme is “My family, my roots: a 
lifelong strength”, is to invite Quebeckers from all origins to 
celebrate the strength of their family network, to renew 
privileged relations with their close ones, and to cultivate 
family spirit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this international year of older persons, let us rediscover 
the value of intergenerational contacts and relations. Whether 
we are talking about adoptive or natural families, the family 
remains a powerful lever, an infallible denominator to which we 
go back at one time or another during our life, to find 
strength, love and support, and to give back some meaning to our 
life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage all families to celebrate the strength and richness 
of the family unit, and I hope that this week will be one of 
harmony, mutual support and solidarity between generations.

I am pleased to announce the election of Milton Wong as

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>IMPAIRED DRIVING 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK101"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
drunk driving kills thousands of Canadians every year, twice as 
many as homicides.  Thousands more are injured.  Yet the 
government is introducing only half measures to deal with this 
tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reports indicate that the government is against the police using 
hand held sensors to detect drunk drivers.  Apparently it would 
rather stick to the good old usual smell your breath, walk a 
straight line approach that is not exactly science. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the justice minister against police using this reliable 
tool to fight drunk driving? 
<P><A NAME="LINK102"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member undoubtedly 
is aware, the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights has 
been studying the issue of impaired driving for some time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact I anticipate a thoughtful and detailed report in which 
members of the official opposition have participated.  When I 
receive that report I will review it and I will respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier in this week in the House, all of us 
understand the scourge of impaired driving and we will do what we 
can to prevent it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK103"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
studying and reports will not save lives.  We are going into 
summer and we know that is a horrible time for carnage on our 
roads with drunk driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless the government acts now we will probably continue to see 
the death rate rising as a result of drunk drivers.  There is no 
time for political delay.  We need tougher laws now.  We have 
studied and we have reported long enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the justice minister commit now to passing new tough 
anti-drunk driving legislation before the House rises for the 
summer? 
<P><A NAME="LINK104"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I have already indicated on 
this matter, I await the report of the Standing Committee on 
Justice and Human Rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand members of the official opposition have been 
working on this report.  I actually think it would be somewhat 
contemptuous of me today to pre-empt the work of that committee. 
I look forward to receiving it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK105"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
we were asking for a commitment before the House rises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing we talked about in that report, and one of my 
colleagues brought it forward in the first place, was that we 
needed to lower the blood alcohol level from .08 to .05.  That is 
the standard in 10 European countries and Australia.  It seems to 
be working.  Transport Canada said that if we lowered the limit 
to .05 it would save more than 500 lives a year.  I dare say that 
would be worth it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me ask a question of the justice minister again.  Why will 
she not take the advice of her own government officials and the 
standing committee and commit to getting this thing done before 
summer so we would save lives? 
<P><A NAME="LINK106"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I have already said twice 
today, I look forward to receiving the report of the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Human Rights.  I will take very 
seriously that which is recommended by the standing committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK107"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is interesting to hear the minister.  She said 
three times that she anticipates the report, that she awaits the 
report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we were asking some reporters this morning about where they 
got the leaked report, they said they received it from the 
minister's office.  It was a senior Southam reporter who said it 
was leaked from the minister's office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's staff has seen the report.  They know we have a 
unanimous report of the committee.  All parties have agreed.  We 
do not totally agree with everything that is in the report but we 
said we would compromise.  A half a loaf is better than no loaf 
at all.  We want the report to be in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister commit to tabling a bill, when we come back 
after our recess next week, which we will pass quickly in the 
House? 
<P><A NAME="LINK108"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not know from where the 
hon. member gets his information but he should check it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact I have not seen the report.  I have to say I find it 
deplorable that there are those who choose to treat the House of 
Commons with contempt and leak the contents of a standing 
committee report.  Because I respect the House of Commons I will 
wait to receive the report and I will respond at that time.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, this is not about a leaked report.  This is about 
drunk driving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister knows her staff has told people.  They have been 
involved in this.  We did not leak the report.  We do not leak 
reports like the other side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is about drunk driving.  The government has delayed it 
since the hon. member for Prince George—Bulkley Valley brought 
it into the House in 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister commit to bringing a bill to the House which 
we will support and pass in one day when we come back after our 
recess next week? 
<P><A NAME="LINK110"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, what I commit to do upon 
receipt of the standing committee report on impaired driving is 
to review it very seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have said before in the House that all of us on this side take 
the scourge of impaired driving very seriously.  I look forward 
to the work of the Standing Committee on Justice and Human 
Rights.  I know it has worked very hard on this report.  Hon. 
members of the opposition have worked very hard.  When the report 
is tabled in the House, I will respond.

<P><A NAME="LINK112"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Prime Minister has often said that he has final responsibility 
for the integrity of his cabinet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to Canada's information commissioner, the Minister of 
Human Resources Development deliberately contravened the Access 
to Information Act, an act of parliament, for political ends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Prime Minister think a minister should be able to 
contravene an act of parliament with complete impunity? 
<P><A NAME="LINK113"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am satisfied with the explanation the minister gave yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a sharp increase in the number of access to 
information requests.  Responding to all these requests takes 
time and staff.  Unfortunately, there was a delay.  It was not 
caused by the minister.  Nothing can therefore be held against 
the minister. 
<P><A NAME="LINK114"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
is an all too convenient excuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the <I>National Post</I>, the commissioner said he had to 
threaten to go to the federal court to have the minister's 
office release the information that it had received 74 days 
earlier for authorization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the Prime Minister accept his minister's explanations 
that the error was an honest one, when the information 
commissioner had to throw his weight around and even threaten 
the minister with legal action before he would finally conform 
to the legislation? 
<P><A NAME="LINK115"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, this is completely 
inaccurate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No investigator ever came to my office with any request 
whatsoever.  I categorically deny it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a tempest in a teapot.  The whole thing is absolutely 
clear and transparent.  The files were given to the journalists 
as requested.  The opposition is saying my office held them up. 
The files were in my office for 12 working days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, the opposition is saying that my office delayed them 
because I did not want this to come up during the debate in the 
House.  The debate took place in early February, and the file 
arrived in my office on March 24. 
<P><A NAME="LINK116"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister often refers to his ethics 
counsellor as the ultimate tool to evaluate the behaviour of his 
ministers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have a situation where, in the opinion of the information 
commissioner, the Minister of Human Resources Development 
violated an act of parliament to protect himself from political 
damage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the defence strategy used by the Minister of Human 
Resources Development is to feign indifference and to plead 
carelessness, would the Prime Minister not be well advised to 
submit this case to his ethics counsellor? 
<P><A NAME="LINK117"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the commissioner never said that 
I violated the act. This is totally absurd. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The word “defy” was used in reference to my office. There is 
some confusion in the letter between my department and my 
office. My office received the document on March 24, while the 
debate took place in the House during the first week of 
February. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a tempest in a teapot created by people who are looking 
for winning conditions for a referendum, people who are 
systematically harassing Quebec ministers in this government. 
This is a case of Quebeckers going after Quebeckers, as has been 
the case all too often in our history.

BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the information commissioner is not a 
Quebecker. He is a person mandated by the federal government to 
do a job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the Prime Minister has a tendency to protect his 
ministers excessively, as was the case with the former solicitor 
general, who revealed confidential information while travelling 
on an airplane. However, what the Minister of Human Resources 
Development has done is much more serious. He violated the act 
for a political gain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the Prime Minister protect a minister who violated an 
act of the federal parliament for over two and a half months, 
and who only complied with that act under extreme pressure, 
under the threat of legal proceedings? 
<P><A NAME="LINK119"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first, I again categorically 
deny that a commissioner's investigator came to my office. This 
never happened. The fact that the <I>National Post</I> wrote this does 
not mean it is true. Bloc Quebecois members should learn that 
the <I>National Post</I> is not the most reliable source of information 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the information commissioner said the law may have been 
defied in my office. The fact is that the file arrived at my 
office on March 24, while the debate had taken place in the 
House during the first half of February. This is a tempest in a 
teapot. They are desperately trying to achieve the winning 
conditions for a referendum that three quarters of Quebeckers do

</I></B></P><P align=left>The matter of reserves restructuring has to be noted in the 
context that we are still operating under the same reserves

the recommendations that are in the report.  I am so pleased to 
hear that.  That is just what he said.  He is not going to cut 
the reserves whatsoever.  Is that what the minister is telling us 
today?  Because how could he possibly consider the cuts that are 
recommended in that report which would absolutely devastate the 
reservists in Canada?

reserves.  However, there are a lot of other recommendations that 
deal with modifications, updating, reform for the reserves and 
re-roling of a number of the units.  I consider all of those 
proposals to be valid for examination and I will examine all of 
them.

the public as much as possible ahead of time”, stated retired 
supreme court Justice La Forest.

averse to public scrutiny and accountability?

backing of Canadians, especially in this era of increased 
judicial activism.  What is it about a parliamentary review of

that the official opposition continues to try to undermine 
important federal institutions like the Supreme Court of Canada. 
The official opposition quotes numbers from various studies. 
What it does not tell us is that in fact in those same studies 
Canadians have told us that they have overwhelming confidence in 
the Supreme Court of Canada as an institution of impartiality and

Mr. Speaker, first I want to underscore that last year the Canada

the minister responsible, I do not think the member would want a 
situation where the minister decides what films and what books

said that there are “problems in compliance, weaknesses in 
program design”—which is the problem here—“and instances of 
poor control”. In other words, taxpayers' money is being spent 
where no one ever intended it to be spent, and these films are a 
prime example.  Even the minister said that she is concerned 
about the government funding for this kind of movie.

filmmakers who were helped last year by the Canada Council.  I 
can underscore for the hon. member that the Department of

are written by the Canada Council precisely because successive

<P><A NAME="LINK171"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, back 
in 1949, the Canadian Constitution, then known as the British 
North America Act, was amended by the addition of Newfoundland's 
Terms of Union with Canada.  That amendment is now known as the 
Newfoundland Act, and section 44 says that Canada will provide 
for the maintenance in the province of Newfoundland of 
appropriate reserve units of the Canadian defence forces which 
will include the Royal Newfoundland Regiment.  That is in the 
constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister not agree that a constitutional amendment 
would be needed to eliminate the Royal Newfoundland Regiment 
which is actively being considered by DND? 
<P><A NAME="LINK172"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not proposing any amendments to the 
Constitution or any amendments to the Newfoundland Act.  I am 
merely looking at a proposal that comes from a number of 
reservists themselves and people who are looking at reforms to an 
institution that has not been changed since the second world war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have indicated previously, I will look at all those 
recommendations and any other recommendations.  I am certainly 
not proposing any reduction in the size of our reserves or the 
size of our military overall, or anything that would involve 
anything akin to what the hon. member is talking about in terms 
of the change in the Newfoundland Act. 
<P><A NAME="LINK173"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, let 
me remind the minister that a constitutional amendment would be 
needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though Newfoundlanders make up a disproportionately large 
percentage of the Canadian Armed Forces, our per capita share of 
defence spending is lower than the Canadian average.  That means 
we receive less than our fair share of the economic benefits 
associated with the presence of military units in our province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of National Defence talks about elimination.  What 
about amalgamation?  If the minister decides to amalgamate the 
forces, would he not agree that a constitutional amendment would 
be needed? 
<P><A NAME="LINK174"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not proposing any constitutional 
amendments.  The member is talking about a very hypothetical 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think Newfoundlanders can be proud of what they contribute to 
the armed forces of the country.  They contribute in great 
numbers to both the regulars and the reserves.  They have a proud 
tradition and a proud history, both under Newfoundland prior to 
1949 and since becoming a part of Confederation.  I want to 
maintain that great pride they have and which we should all have 
in their contribution.

<P><A NAME="LINK199"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, as we were getting close to question period I was 
attempting to draw an analogy of this bill to a storefront.  On 
the storefront it says “Men's clothing”, but there are side 
doors and back doors.  The main business being done in that 
building is bootlegging.  We will call this building the 
government building. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to show the House what has happened.  I have received 
hundreds of petitions from my constituency concerning the term 
marriage and for every one of those petitions I have received 
this response from the government:  “The term marriage in Canada 
is clear in law and is defined as the union of one man and one 
woman, to the exclusion of all others”.  That is what the 
government is saying at the front door.  However, the bill we are 
discussing will change the meaning of marriage forever and ever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government goes on to say:  “There is no need to either 
enact this definition in legislation or to amend any existing 
legislation”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the government makes that statement, while it appears to 
be maintaining the definition of marriage and while it appears to 
be saying that it will preserve it forever and ever, this bill 
will clearly destroy the meaning of the term marriage forever and 
ever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will go down as the bill which, when put on the 
storefront, says marriage, but through the back doors and the 
side doors it is anything but. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many questions that have to be answered.  When this 
bill is proclaimed, think of the hundreds of thousands of people 
who will be able to claim spousal benefits from life insurance 
policies who are in a relationship which is not based on what we 
consider to be a marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government cannot even ask this question.  What about CPP 
death benefits?  To whom will they go?  Anyone will be able to 
challenge the current existing laws relating to the Canada 
pension plan, and they will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is probably the most serious bill that has come before the 
House in years. 
It is the beginning of the destruction of what we have had in 
this country from the beginning of time.  This bill will destroy 
our heritage.  This bill will destroy the terminology of 
marriage.  Make no mistake about it, this bill will destroy the 
very moral fibre of this country.  This is not a laughing matter. 
The government is going to have to answer to Canada. 
Unfortunately, Canadians will not see the ill effects of this 
bill for a few years.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the government's definition of the relationship of what

government propose to ensure that only those individuals who are 
engaged in a relationship of a sexual nature will get the 
surviving benefit?   The question has been asked, but it has not 
been answered.  How will the individual prove that the 
relationship is indeed a true relationship?  Who is going to 
prove that?  Canadians need to be worried about this.  It is not 
so much my concern, it is a concern for my grandchildren and for 
their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have come through a great era in the building of this

that is held high and dear by Canadians.  Shame on the

</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are pension benefits extended solely on sexual activities? 
No one on the other side will answer the question.  Those members 
do not care.  What the government puts on the front door is not 
what is going in the side door and it certainly is not what is 
coming out.  Shame on the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will we now have sex inspectors to verify activity?  Just think 
of that.  That will take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hundreds of acts will be modified by this bill through the back 
door.  The government may say that marriage will never be 
changed, but this bill will change it.  The government knows 
that, so it brought in closure.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-78 represents another stepping stone toward that goal. 
Bill C-78 will allow the federal Treasury Board to deal with 
existing surplus in the superannuation accounts of the Public 
Service Superannuation Act, the Canadian Forces Superannuation 
Act and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Superannuation Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Funds from these pension plans will be directed at paying down 
Canada's $583 billion debt.  The pension plan now has a balance 
of $119 billion from years of contributions and interest 
payments.  The federal governments actuaries, however, estimate 
that only $94 billion is needed to pay the pension benefits of 
all existing and retired public servants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the public accounts of 1996-97 the Auditor General of Canada 
pointed out that the accounting for employee pensions should be 
carefully re-examined and changed.  This is exactly what Bill 
C-78 addresses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's current economic success is due to sound economic and 
fiscal policies and the hard work and sacrifice of Canadians.  In 
just four years we have eliminated a budgetary deficit which 
stood at $42 billion in 1993-94.  In fact our first surplus in 28 
years of $3.5 billion was recorded in 1997-98 and went to pay 
down the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last federal budget the government put forward its debt 
repayment plan to address our national debt.  The government will 
continue to present two year fiscal plans based on prudent 
economic planning assumptions.  The first fiscal plan will 
continue to include a contingency reserve as a buffer against 
unexpected financial pressures.  The current plan contains a 
contingency reserve of $3 billion a year.  When the contingency 
reserve is not needed, such as last year, it will go directly to 
paying down the public debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the federal budgets of the government, 
legislation such as Bill C-78 would go to bringing down our 
national debt further.  I am surprised that the Reform Party does 
not support the bill.  I would have thought that a party so 
ardent about pinching pennies would stand up against the chance 
to put a solid concrete contribution of $30 billion toward 
reducing our national debt.  I would like to know where the 
consistency is in terms of its policies on this issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Montreal <I>Gazette</I> stated the federal approach to

management but also a perfectly defensible use of the pension 
surplus.

said that time was ripe for the government to privatize the 
pension fund.  With the deficit under control, he said, the 
government no longer needed to borrow from the plan.  Mr. 
Hamilton argued that the government had public opinion on its 
side to use the surplus to pay down the debt.  Public servants 
pay high premiums for their pension, 7.5% of their salaries, but 
they also have one of the best pension plans in the country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Any surplus must be shared equitably by the employer (the

forcing a decision at the Supreme Court level on “ownership” of

professional and legal experts in the pension field and has been 
advised that, on the basis of current legal jurisprudence, the 
employer can decide how to dispose of the surplus.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Guy as well as many others have raised concerns to the 
effect that Bill C-78 might lead to shortfalls in the pension 
plan.  There are provisions in the bill to address these 
concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-78 proposals will allow for the establishment of an 
appropriate reserve to smooth any adverse effects in future 
actuarial assumptions.  This is the same amount that is currently 
provided under the Income Tax Act for other employers, up to 10% 
of the pension liabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, the legislation does not require surpluses to be 
withdrawn all at once.  Rather they can be debited over a period 
of up to 15 years.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has always been committed to the pension 
plan.  The current superannuation account was established by law 
to assure the employees that the government recognized its 
obligation to pay their pensions.  If any shortfall or deficit 
exists between the amounts in the pension account, the government 
must make additional contributions to cover that shortfall.  It 
has done so on many occasions in the past.  The government has 
always assumed 100% responsibility for any funding deficits, that 
is all the risk that arose in the federal public service pension 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the question of whether the government is setting a dangerous 
precedent by taking the surplus and applying it, clearly there 
are few plans primarily in the public sector where both surpluses 
and deficits are shared by the employer and the employees. 
Entitlement to surpluses excluding withdrawals is actually based 
on specific provisions in the pension plan text.  Again Bill C-78 
is adding such a provision to the public sector plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-78 represents the government's commitment to putting our 
fiscal books in order while protecting the pension plan.  It 
represents a strong commitment to taking Canada out of debt. By 
passing the bill we can take one more step toward a healthier 
fiscally sound future and, as the Toronto <I>Star</I> so rightly 
pointed out, reduce our debt and interest payments which in turn 
would allow us to focus on other Canadian priorities:  health 
care funding, more money for children's benefits, for seniors 
programs, and for an overall better quality of life for all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not taking money away from Canadians.  We are actually 
judiciously addressing our financial and fiscal responsibilities. 
We are making sure that all those involved in the pension plan, 
both those who are currently working and those who are retired, 
will get every cent.  As has been pointed out in the House, the 
plan is even being enhanced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I urge my colleagues on all sides of the House to consider 
this point very carefully when they vote later this evening.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would be delighted if you came to visit my 
riding. Seeing all the regions and all the regional county 
municipalities is something you will never forget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to speak to the motions in Group No. 3. I 
remind the House that time allocation has been brought in with 
regard to this most important piece of legislation. This bill 
deals with the use of billions of dollars, and yet the federal 
government has decided to limit the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems rather inappropriate that, while the federal government 
has moved time allocation, some members of the government 
majority would be using up the time we have left, even though 
the government felt it was not necessary to take all the time 
needed to analyze this bill. This situation is somewhat ironic, 
and I will come back to that at the end of my speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I think it is important to adopt the two amendments in 
the group we are now debating because it would at least improve 
the bill somewhat, without necessarily making it acceptable. 
There are many other amendments that would be essential, but at 
least these would be a significant improvement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, Motion No. 16 proposes that the contribution rates be set 
out in an act of parliament to ensure that the government cannot 
do whatever it wants in the future. When it changes the 
contribution rates, it will be required to introduce a bill in 
parliament to that effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Knowing what the federal government has done with the employment 
insurance fund, the rationale behind this amendment is easy to 
understand. Year after year, it receives about $19 billion in 
premiums and spends between $12 and $13 billion. This means 
that, each year, the federal government uses between $5 and $6 
billion for purposes other than those provided for in the act, 
for example to pay off the debt or to finance other types of 
spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people pay their employment insurance premiums, it is very 
clear that they want adequate protection. Right now, they have 
the worst of both worlds. 
They pay too much in premiums and they do not have adequate 
protection in case they become unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want the same situation with regard to pension plans. 
The proposed amendment is aimed at making the government 
accountable to parliament for any changes it wants to make to 
contribution rates.

<A HREF="#LINKT56"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other amendment, Motion No. 38, is designed to prevent the 
accumulation of very large surpluses so we do not end up in the 
kind of situation we are in today. When there is a large surplus 
in a pension plan, there are always two options: reducing or 
suspending contributions, or improving the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without this kind of safeguards, the federal government will 
have total discretion. It will be able to do whatever it wants 
with this money, and contributors will not have the impression 
of getting adequate benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between 1924 and 1998, federal contributions represented only 
some 48% of all contributions made over 74 years.  People 
wanting sufficient control over their money put in 52%, the 
lion's share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government took this money.  I think the arguments 
made by my colleague on the majority side are inadequate.   It 
is not because the government has money available and the need 
to repay a debt that it is necessarily entitled to take this 
money from a fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is taking money from the employment insurance and the pension 
funds.  The funds were not collected for this purpose. 
The government must assume its responsibilities and ensure the 
solidity of the employment insurance plan so that it truly meets 
the objectives is was designed for.  This goes as well for the 
pension funds.  These are not cash cows.  The intent of our 
amendment is to correct this situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We therefore have two amendments intended to improve the 
situation and to try to have sufficient minimum control over the 
surpluses.  That does not mean that it will become acceptable 
form the entire bill.  The government opposite was highly 
criticized.  It manages in a very egotistical and personal 
fashion the funds that belong to all those who contribute to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also in the process of defining the ground rules for the 
future and, in this regard, I think it important that the bill 
be reviewed, that there be a series of amendments making it more 
acceptable and, ultimately, if ever the goal of legitimate use 
of contributors' funds is attained, the House could always 
debate whether the bill was acceptable or whether more changes 
were required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's decision to impose a time limit on debate is 
ridiculous. These are decisions involving billions of dollars. 
Individual members are being denied an opportunity to speak. 
Moreover, majority members, who were told by the government that 
there would be time allocation, voted in favour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This gives them the chance to take up the time of those who 
might have suggestions for improving the bill.  The Liberal 
majority is contradicting itself. 
On the one hand, it voted to impose time allocation and, on the 
other, it is taking up debate time when it itself felt that the 
debate should be wrapped up as quickly as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that the government should at least have had the decency 
not to have any speakers, given its desire to bring the debate 
to a speedy conclusion, and given that opposition members have a 
great many points to make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's logic is questionable, particularly as they are 
a bit short on arguments.  Clearly, this is a decision that was 
imposed by cabinet and that is based on the same logic as the EI 
decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are trying to tap into as many sources of funds as 
possible, in order to amass as much money as possible, 
regardless of its source, regardless of the fact that it might 
belong to someone else, regardless of the fact that it belongs 
to the contributors into the employment insurance fund, the 
employers and employees, or, in the case of the public service 
pensions, the federal government employees who are seeing 
billions of dollars getting away from them and into the hands of 
the government, to be used for purposes other than the one for 
which they were intended.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a rather frustrating debate.  It is also one that will 
surely lead people to pass judgement on this government.  When 
they have to assess the government's track record in the next 
federal election, they will have to keep in mind that the 
government has decided to use the surplus in their pension funds 
for purposes other than those for which they contributed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They will be able to send a message to the government, one that 
will be richly deserved. 
In the end, it would lead the government to show a greater sense 
of responsibility and to make sure that when it must provide 
sound management it does so with the money available and by 
monitoring spending, not by taking money elsewhere to make up 
for ineffective monitoring in its own jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons, unless the two amendments in that group 
are adopted and substantive changes are made to the bill, the 
Bloc Quebecois will vote against the bill. We do hope, however, 
that the amendments in the group now under consideration will be 
approved by the majority. These two amendments would go a long 
way to making this bill more acceptable. I am asking the 
government majority to adot them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would like to get the unanimous consent of the 
House to move the following motion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That all government members, since government has imposed time 
allocation on consideration of Bill C-78, at report stage, be 
prevented from speaking during today's debate on this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise today to speak to Bill C-78, the public 
service pension plan act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Oak Ridges talked about how the government 
had every angle covered when it wrote the bill and how nothing 
could ever go wrong.  I point to the Canada pension plan and 
successive governments saying no problem, don't worry, be happy; 
nothing can go wrong with the Canada pension plan.  Those were 
smooth assurances to soothe the fear of taxpayers, to soothe 
fears of actuaries and to convey hope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we see the plan increasing the amount of pension 
contributions every year until it is up to almost 10%.  That is 
hardly the kind of action which engenders a lot of confidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have proudly characterized themselves as deficit 
slayers, but it takes real creativity to call themselves deficit 
slayers given the record of the Liberal government.  In the 
context of this important debate on Bill C-78 it is time to set 
the record straight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the budget debates and in the many kind words the 
Liberals spoke about themselves thereafter, I happened to hear 
the Minister of Health on TV saying that two years from now we 
would have real money for health care in Canada.  I wonder if 
anybody thought what two years from now would mean to the Liberal 
government.  It means, of course, an election.  It will need all 
kinds of money to put that health budget before Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not complaining about health spending.  In fact we have 
called for increased spending, but to hold it off for two years 
so that it can raid this pension and end up with the money for it 
seems to be kind of cynical.  If I am rather cynical about it, I 
think it is understandable.

<A HREF="#LINKT58"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any deficit that the Liberals have eliminated has not been 
through genuine cost reduction but through direct tax increases 
on the backs of Canadians and the raiding of public funds.  First 
the Liberals chose the Canada pension plan.  It took a number of 
years to bring it practically to its knees.  Goodness knows 
whether the planned increases in premiums will make enough of a 
difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employment insurance premiums are held at far too high a level 
while people on employment insurance are struggling to make ends 
meet.  This just does not seem to be the way a government that 
cares for its people, as the Liberal government says it does, 
does things.  Now it is turning to the public service pension 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite all of this the debt is still far too high.  Taxes are 
far too high.  In light of this $30 billion take the finance 
minister still refuses to give Canadian taxpayers a tax break. 
All these raids on the backs of Canadians, combined with high 
marginal rates and bracket creep, give us the highest taxes of 
any country in the G-7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is next?  The Liberals have established themselves as the 
most creative break and enter artists of our day.  This audacious 
legislation is a good example.  This is a break-in through the 
back door by way of legislation rather than through the front 
door by way of negotiation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about what the Liberals are proposing to do with 
the public service pension plan.  In that regard Bill C-78 
amounts to nothing more than another creative Liberal tax grab. 
They have been slowly liquidating the surplus in the pension plan 
over the past few years.  That is just one of the ways they have 
been able to balance the books.  It is not by cutting spending 
but by raiding surpluses and taxing Canadians higher and higher 
year after year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another claim the government makes is that it has been fiscally 
prudent, but the truth is that the finance minister is improving 
the health of the federal government's finances, among other 
things, by dipping into civil service pension piggybanks.  Since 
1996, I say rather cynically, $10.1 billion has been saved by not 
making interest payments on the actuarial surplus.  On another 
point which has nothing to do with fiscal prudence the civil 
service is overlooked in the disposal of excess funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These types of actions by the Liberals are not only becoming 
more common but are more than ever being seen for what they are: 
morally reprehensible behaviour on the part of the Liberal 
government.  Yet the government attempts to justify its actions 
in the name of deficit reduction.  The great scandal in this 
regard is that it is not at all about deficit fighting, as the 
Liberals would have us believe.  Rather, it is about their 
continuing quest for a stream of taxes on overburdened taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly taxpayers are the odd men out in this equation.  Taxpayers 
own the surpluses in the public service pension plans.  Taxpayers 
in the past have covered $13 billion worth of shortfalls in the 
public service pension plans.  Taxpayers will be on the hook for 
future deficits.  Therefore taxpayers must be protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The simple fact is that the surplus in the plan should be left 
alone.  The Liberals should just take their hands off it.  The 
government should not be using it for any other purpose than to 
ensure the plan remains solvent now and in the future.  The 
bottom line is that any surplus in a pension plan should not be 
available to any employer, government or private.  It should 
remain in the plan for the benefit of current and future retirees 
and act as a cushion against future deficits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will turn now to a discussion of some of the amendments 
dealing with the issue of conjugal relationships.  These 
amendments are in response to lower court decisions which see 
certain benefits such as pension survivor benefits currently 
afforded to married and common law couples being extended to same 
sex relationships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The central issue surrounds the definition of spouse.  The 
government has rightly affirmed the traditional definitions of 
spouse and marriage.  It is important that we begin with the 
proper definitions.  According to the <I>Oxford English 
Dictionary</I>, a conjugal relationship is one of marriage or the 
relationship between husband and wife and conjugal rights are 
those rights, especially in reference to sexual relations, 
regarded as exercisable in law by each partner in a marriage.

<A HREF="#LINKT59"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Spouse and marriage have been given special status in Canadian 
law because of their distinctive characteristics and unique 
contribution to Canadian society.  It is important therefore that 
the current definition of spouse be retained and that an 
appropriate range of benefits and obligations be afforded the 
marital relationship, really the marital home.  However the 
criteria proposed in Bill C-78 for extended survivor benefits are 
unacceptably vague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill defines a survivor as either one who is married to the 
contributor or one who can establish that he or she was 
cohabiting in a relationship of a conjugal nature with the 
contributor for at least one year immediately before the death of 
the contributor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conjugality is one of several criteria which establish that 
benefits and obligations for heterosexual conjugal relationships 
are among all forms of domestic partnerships unique in their 
capacity to procreate children.  It is this kind of relationship 
that routinely involves the caring for and nurturing of children. 
As the House knows there is a cost incurred through child 
rearing.  Benefits have been extended to the spousal relationship 
to enhance the stability of the family relationship, as well to 
recognize the long term commitment and interdependence of the 
relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within Bill C-78 is the intent to extend benefits to same sex 
couples.  When considering benefits for domestic relationships 
other than a spousal relationship, is sexual activity an 
appropriate criterion on which to extend benefits?  What about 
other long term relationships of financial or emotional 
interdependency which do not involve sexual activity? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new definition in Bill C-78 could include roommates who are 
sexually intimate once in the course of a year long cohabitation, 
yet exclude an unmarried adult brother and sister or two adult 
sisters who have lived together in a household for many years and 
are dependent one on another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the federal government plans to extend benefits beyond 
spousal or marital relationships to other types of relationships, 
it should consider the original rationale for giving the benefit 
to determine the basis on which non-spousal relationships should 
qualify.  Furthermore, broad public debate should take place 
first before changes are made in a piecemeal fashion, the way the 
Liberals are doing with the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see again the government blindly going ahead with a policy 
that is not only questionable but completely unjustified since no 
debate has yet taken place with respect to altering the 
definitions of spouse and marriage as they are held within the 
law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the government expands or changes the definition of 
spouse or marriage there must first be a proper debate in 
parliament and among all Canadians on such an important issue. We 
know that a strong majority of Canadians uphold and affirm the 
traditional definition and concept of marriage.  The government's 
attempt to define conjugal relationships and explain who 
constitutes a survivor is a mess and impossible to determine from 
the wording in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing I find it interesting that the Liberals have recently 
begun a survey to understand why there is such low morale in the 
public service and why in the west people feel alienated from 
them.  They are schizophrenic.  What the Liberals are doing in 
the bill is only typical behaviour for them and offers the answer 
to their own question.  Is it any wonder Canadians are 
increasingly skeptical of the government?

Mr. Jones wrote “I am a retired police officer and if passage 
of this bill will negatively impact upon my pension plan or 
pension plan surplus, do not allow the bill to pass”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He sent along a copy of an ad that has been placed in one of the 
Toronto newspapers by the Public Service Alliance of Canada and a 
number of other union organizations.  Who knows, there might have 
been some financial contribution from some party in this place, I 
say to the members of the New Democratic Party. 
The ad says “It is about the heist of the hard-earned dollars 
set aside by workers for their retirement benefits”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is guaranteeing their retirement benefits in this 
plan.  The government is putting the pension for the public 
service employees into a state where exactly the opposite of what 
is being said in the advertisement is the case.  The pension plan 
is not being threatened in any way whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ad goes on to say that experts—and of course they do not 
say who they are; they might be certain opposition critics—warn 
that this legislation could set a dangerous precedent and 
encourage private employers to do the same thing. What is not 
pointed out is that any private sector pension plan must conform 
to the rules of the Income Tax Act.  One of the rules says that 
the surplus buildup can be no greater than 10% and once it 
reaches 10% it must be dealt with in some way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It makes sense to bring what is a very generous and well 
earned—I would not take anything away from the public service 
employees—pension plan into compliance with the Income Tax Act. 
It is a secure pension plan backed by what could obviously be one 
of the most secure institutions in our land, the Government of 
Canada. It is a very secure bill.  In reality it does not conform 
to the rules under the Income Tax Act.  This bill will allow the 
cabinet, the governor in council the flexibility to ensure that 
it does conform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say to Mr. Jones and all the retirees out there, do 
not be misled by the rhetoric in this place or by advertisements 
that tell a little bit of the story. This is not an attack or a 
grab in any way on the security of the pension plan that Mr. 
Jones and his other retired colleagues enjoy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If government members were not allowed to put facts like that on 
the table, if we were to acquiesce to the members opposite and 
simply sit here and say nothing, then the kind of information 
that is being perpetrated in this ad in a close to fraudulent 
manner would simply be added to.  People would get upset and 
rightfully so if they really thought that the government was in 
some way attacking their pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are dealing with amendments in Group No. 3. The pension plan 
is secured and primarily funded by the taxpayer.  Yes, the 
workers make a contribution, but the vast majority of the 
contributions made into this pension plan are made by the 
taxpayer, not by the worker.  Of course I do not see that in the 
ad and I do not hear it in speeches by the opposition members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The contribution rate to the pension plan is roughly 70:30 with 
70% being contributed by the government, which is the taxpayer. 
In fact, if we were to extrapolate the existing pension plan over 
the next one and a half years, that contribution rate would 
change to 80:20 unless we did something about it. Does it seem to 
make sense that when an employer is contributing between 70% and 
80% of the money that secures the pension plan and the employee 
is contributing 20% to 30%, that somehow that equates to an equal 
contribution? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the argument members of the NDP would put forward, that 
this is the money of the workers and somehow it would be 
increased wages if it was not put forward in a pension 
contribution.  They know that is not true.  They know that these 
contributions were fought and won at the bargaining table.  I do 
not have a problem with that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say that if we are to allow the curve to continue to 
where the employer will be making an even more inordinate 
percentage of the contribution toward these plans, then the 
taxpayers would have a right to ask us, as a government, why we 
are doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot compare this in any way whatsoever to a private sector 
pension where the contribution rates are much more likely to be 
on a 50:50 basis rather than this large discrepancy.  To compare 
this and to get people upset in thinking that this is the thin 
edge of the wedge and all the private sector companies that 
provide pension plans for their workers are going to threaten the 
security of the pension plan is fearmongering.  It is misleading. 
It is putting out information that is not based on fact or 
truth. It is a serious bit of unfair propaganda being put before 
the retired people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is probably one of the most distasteful things about this. 
The opposition and some of the unions, the leadership not the 
rank and file, are putting out information that is getting people 
worried.  Those people are relying on their pensions.  Maybe they 
are a little bit worried about their economic situation.  They 
have had to go through an enormous change.  They are no longer 
earning a full salary and are now living on a pension. It is a 
time of life when they should be able to feel some comfort in my 
view.  They should not feel that they are under siege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For individuals here or in the labour movement to get people 
upset in some attempt to mobilize what we would fondly refer to 
as grey power is a misuse of the political process.  It is an 
unfair tactic that they are using in getting these folks upset. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is it is vitally important that members on this side 
speak.  I have no problem and would never suggest that members 
opposite should not partake in the democratic process in this 
place.  When there is a bill or a resolution on the floor, 
whether or not there is time allocation, we all have a 
responsibility. I represent retired federal workers.  I have a 
responsibility to tell them how I see this bill, to tell them why 
I support this bill, and not to simply sit here and allow those 
folks to mislead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the amendments by the hon. member for St. Albert deals 
with the issue of requiring contribution rates to be in an act of 
parliament.  This is a move that the opposition, primarily the 
Reform Party, is attempting to bring in to this place so that 
every bit of regulation, every bit of dotting the <I>i</I>'s and 
crossing the <I>t</I>'s, must be a full-fledged debate in 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that the process calls for the big picture.  The 
legislation is to be debated, passed and enacted by parliament 
and the regulations are to be handled by the staff of the 
Government of Canada.  We know that and we it is appropriate.  To 
do it the way the hon. member is suggesting would create a 
gridlock.  It would make it impossible to make the changes that 
we think are vital to secure the future of the pension plan for 
all public sector employees.

so one-sided, so lopsided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the motions brought by our Bloc colleagues 
saying that those who stood up and voted to limit debate should 
forgo their right to debate, make a lot of sense. The Liberals 
use their majority to limit debate and then they use up the time

represent some common sense and fairness here.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk a bit about the amendments which are proposed in 
this group because they have to do with the actuarial evaluation. 
What the Liberal government is missing entirely is the unfairness 
of what it is doing.  The Liberals get up, they crow and puff up 
their chests like colourful peacocks trying to attract mates and 
they say that they just cannot do anything wrong, that they are 
guaranteeing these pensions so the people have no complaint. That 
may be true.  However, they fail to recognize what a surplus 
means.  It means that the amount of money paid in over the last 
10, 15, 20, 40 or however many years since a person has been an 
employee was too high.  Moneys are put in by the employer, which 
is the taxpayer, and the employee, the person in the plan.  In 
other words, they have taken more money from them than they 
should have to sustain the plan.  That is totally obvious.  If it 
were not the case, there would not be a surplus.  To whom does 
that money belong? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have all of these different questions being asked.  Some say 
20%, some say 30%.  I suppose what we should do is think about 
things like the MP pension plan to which the taxpayer contributes 
about 80%.  The employees are the members of parliament and the 
senators.  When given the opportunity in the last parliament, all 
but one Reformer opted out of the plan because we said that it 
was just not right.  This bill also addresses the plan for 
members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have the numbers at my fingertips and I suppose that I 
should if I am going to talk about this.  However, if we look at 
all of the money in this so-called fund, my conjecture is that 
the MP pension plan has already taken the total sum down. 
Ordinary civil servants and other members of the so-called 
ordinary working class have paid in more than they should have to 
compensate for the members of parliament who are in this plan.  I 
am not sure that it is all in the same fund and whether it is 
accounted for that way, so I need to be a little careful, but 
certainly in terms of the taxpayers' interests in the matter that 
would be the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a situation where we need to answer, before we get into 
any of this, a fundamental question.  Who should pay for the 
livelihood of a person who has gone into retirement?  That is the 
fundamental question which has never been answered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years we have had different plans.  I remember when I 
was a little itty-bitty kid.  That was a long time ago.  Members 
will not believe it but I turned 60 this week, so when I say 
“when I was a little itty-bitty kid”, it was a long time ago. 
I remember my grandfather skimping and saving to put money into a 
retirement fund.  He said:  “Mom and I will not always have the 
ability to work and earn money, so we had better put some away so 
we can look after ourselves”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ironic that when he finally did retire the Liberal 
government at the time brought in a pension plan which had some 
rules.  It turned out that my grandfather was ineligible because 
he had made the mistake of not spending his own money.  He had 
saved too much.  As a result, he was not eligible for the 
supplemental benefits the government was offering.  His looking 
after himself turned out to be a disadvantage.  He would have 
been better off to have spent more money on his family, on 
himself and his wife. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was a case where a person put money away.  Many Canadians 
have a mixture.  Probably all of us in this place have RRSPs, in 
addition to a pension plan in which we participate.  I am one of 
those who at this stage has only an RRSP, but I do anticipate 
getting a small pension from the place where I worked when I 
finally retire.  I am not getting that pension now, even though I 
would be eligible for it, but sometime in the future when my job 
here is done, 20 or 30 years from now, I expect to get some money 
from that.  It represents money that I put in, but also money 
that my employer put in.  I hope that money will be there, 
according to the contract.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals regularly say that the people who are in the plan 
will get their money.  That is not the question.  Of course they 
will get their money, but the Liberals like to talk about it 
because it totally deflects from the question of the surplus. 
The surplus exists because the people have paid too much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I gave a speech a long time ago on a bill that came from the 
Senate which had to do with winding down pension plans and 
dealing with surpluses in pension plans in the private sector. 
It was a bill in which even our Minister of Finance had a 
fiduciary interest.  Indirectly he has divested himself of these 
interests, temporarily, while he is a cabinet minister.  I 
believe he must have done that.  However, in the end that 
legislation will affect him because the shares in the company 
continue to grow and there was a surplus of over $110 million in 
the pension fund of his own company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were forced in this place to pass legislation that affected 
him, which said that an agreement would have to be reached 
between the two parties that paid into the fund, the employer and 
the employees.  Quite clearly that is not bad legislation because 
if the employer said it wanted 100% of it the employees and the 
retirees would not agree and it would not happen.  The employer 
would not get 100%.  If the employees said that they wanted 100%, 
the employer would say no and there would be no agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly they would move to the middle.  We, on the assumption 
that they would reach a deal somewhere around 50:50, said that 
the Minister of Finance had the potential of gaining $50 million 
from that legislation.  We raised a little stink about it.  We 
said that the Minister of Finance should not have sponsored the 
legislation in the House since he could potentially benefit from 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is no different from the issue we have here.  We are 
talking about pension money that is set aside to pay the pensions 
of civil servants, people in the armed forces and the RCMP.  I 
will accept from government members that people will get the 
pension they are anticipating because it is a defined benefit. 
Sure, they will get it, but what about the fact that both the 
taxpayers, the government as the employer, and the employees have 
paid too much into it and we have this $30 billion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I outright reject the government's move to say that is all 
right, it will just take all of it.  All of the money does not 
belong to it.  It is not all taxpayer money.  I concede that some 
of it is.  The proportion has to be worked out.  That can be done 
by actuaries very accurately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we not do that?  Why do we not tell these people that we 
will give them back funds, either through enhanced benefits, 
reduced premiums or contributions?  We will compensate 
contributors by the amount they have overpaid, and the part the 
taxpayers have given up.  Sure, take that back and apply it to 
something that the taxpayers will benefit from. Let us be fair. 
That is what is missing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course the government has invoked time allocation because, as 
any bank robber would say, “I ain't going to stick around until 
I get caught”.

me, to start with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It revolts me also to see that these people are capable of 
finding positive aspects to the dirty deal they are now handing 
to government pensioners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government deliberately attacked the unemployed a few years 
ago. 
It misappropriated the funds in the employment insurance fund, 
the surplus that had come from the unemployed and from 
employers, with not one cent coming from the federal government. 
Using all kinds of tactics, however, the Minister of Finance 
managed to get his hands on $25 billion.

new source of supply. This time he is going after his own 
employees, those who helped keep the government running 
properly, those who have helped ensure the country's security—I 
refer to the RCMP—and those who made a contribution within the 
Canadian forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These three pension funds total $30 billion, which the 
government wants to get its hands on, possibly for the purpose 
of again giving Liberal ministers a chance to create programs 
that will offer an opportunity for flag-waving and will, more 
importantly, stir up trouble with the provinces.  That is their 
specialty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are very honest. 
In fact, they said very clearly in the September 1997 throne 
speech that they were increasingly aware of the fact that they 
needed money. Why? The Liberal ministers are certainly 
concocting other programs to show how good this government is 
and how sensitive it is to the current disaster, with the 
unemployed, young people without work and people who do not have 
access to adequate health care services because of the cuts in 
funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the $30 billion, the federal Liberals are preparing, for 
September or October, another marketing blitz and propaganda 
campaign to demonstrate how good a government they are, but once 
again, opposition members, particularly members of the Bloc 
Quebecois, are being vigilant. We know what they are up to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More and more, the government is shirking its responsibilities. 
Not too long ago, the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency was 
established, and it will allow the Minister of National Revenue 
to shirk his responsibilities. Questions will be asked of the 
minister responsible for this agency in the House, and I already 
know what the answer will be “I will investigate. I will ask the 
agency. I cannot interfere, because it is an independent 
agency”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is false. It is not an independent agency.The people who 
were chosen, as all those who will be appointed to the new 
public sector pension investment board, are good Liberals. I 
will give some very important criteria that will be used by the 
Liberal government to create what we call a possibly objective 
board of directors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First criterion: they will check to see if these people are 
Liberal members with a paid up membership. Second criterion: 
they will check to see if they are good friends of the Prime 
Minister. Third criterion: they will look at their financial 
contribution to the Liberal Party of Canada. And, above all, 
they will check to see if these people are prepared to commit, 
unconditionally, to follow the Prime Minister's orders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced that these are the four criteria that the 
government will use to appoint the board of directors of the new 
public sector pension investment board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we ask questions to the ministers opposite about this 
investment board if, unfortunately, it is established, they will 
hide behind the fact that it is an independent body. But this 
board will not be independent.

to hit people who have been working hard for 20 or 30 years. 
Today, the government will reward these people by taking 
unilateral action, by taking $30 billion directly from them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is trying to tell us that this is an honest 
proposal. 
I have a lot of trouble with this word.  Yesterday I looked in 
the <I>Larousse</I> dictionary for synonyms that come close to what we 
cannot say, but I was not successful.  It is a bit like a 
swindle.  With this bill, the government is trying to show that 
it is being good to its employees.  Nothing could be further 
from the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to go back to the very democratic incident of this 
morning.  This bill affects many people, some of them retired. 
We have many comments to make, but this government has become an 
expert at imposing time allocation.  When we want to speak the 
truth, we are gagged and forced to speed up the process.  Why? 
Because the government is going to need money again in the fall 
because there is no longer a surplus in the EI fund. 
It has cleaned out the fund, and new money will be needed, this 
time for other partisan programs and propaganda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have travelled extensively, and I have seen the image that 
Canada projects, particularly at agricultural shows.  All the 
countries focused on their products.  Canada's image in Paris 
especially was something else.  There were so many Canadian 
flags that it was hard to see the products.  All the other 
countries knew that what matters is the products and the market. 
When Canada takes part in an event, the dominant image is maple 
leaves.  The names of vendor companies or organizations appear 
on the leaves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the visitors asked me “Is this the Canadian pavilion?” 
I said no, it is just exhibitors who happen to be together inside 
the Canadian pavilion. 
Members can imagine the kind of image we are projecting on the 
international level. We are moving towards globalization and we 
should be promoting our products and all the provinces, and what 
do we see, when we get out of Ottawa? The maple leaf propaganda 
of the Liberals.

and there were several motions put by the member for St. Albert 
that you did not refer to, namely motions— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I can clear this up very quickly. 
All of the motions were identical to motions standing in the name 
of the hon. member for Saint-Jean.  Every one of the motions in 
Group No. 4 has been put in one name or another.  Where they were 
identical to the motions put by the member for Saint-Jean, they 
were put in his name. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, we are nearing 
the end of a process which, in my mind, has lost some of its 
credibility and undermined democracy. I wanted once again to 
start by making this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has used closure 53 times since in this 
parliament, since 1997. Often, opposition members have little 
say either here in the House of Commons or in standing 
committees. As I said before, it is always the tyranny of the 
majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are getting rather fed up with all this and the other 
opposition parties are starting to grumble. 
Basically, I think there are two types of members of parliament. 
There are those, like the Liberal members, who do exactly what 
their House leader tells them to do. When he says “We will now 
muzzle them”, they all agree, one after the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is most shocking is that government members will often let 
opposition members talk until they drop. They let them go on and 
on and they do not take part in the debate in order to speed 
things up. But what do they do when there is time allocation? 
They put their names down to take part in the debate, in order 
to limit as much as possible the time opposition members have at 
their disposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time allocation is questionable from a democratic point of view, 
and doubly so, because we are being gagged, not only here in the 
House, but also in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the government's attitude is utterly arrogant. This 
morning, when he introduced the time allocation motion, the 
government House leader laughed and smiled as if to say “We are 
going to shut their mouths once and for all and we will do it 
with great pleasure”. I find that attitude highly despicable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But let me come back to the bill at hand. I read recently in the 
papers that the government is about to form an ad hoc committee, 
probably made up of psychologists, to look into why public 
service employees are unenthusiastic and uncompetitive. 
The government noticed that there was dissatisfaction among its 
employees and it wants to know why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a bit absurd that the government would ask itself why its 
employees are so unfavourably disposed towards their employer 
and so demoralized. Let us take a look at the special laws 
passed recently, including the bludgeon law that forced 
employees back to work. At two o'clock in the morning, the 
President of the Treasury Board rose in this House to solemnly 
announce that an agreement in principle had been reached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was a trade unionist for 20 years and I consider that the 
President of the Treasury Board managed to add insult to injury.

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He tells us at 2 o'clock in the morning that an agreement in 
principle has been reached. Usually, the agreement in principle 
is signed and the government says “Now that the agreement in 
principle has been signed, we will wait for the results of the 
general assemblies and we will sign once it is deemed 
acceptable”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not what the government did. Not only did it force 
workers back to work, but it ignored the agreement in principle 
as if it did not exist. Even though there was an agreement in 
principle, it decided to impose back to work legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not surprising that there has been a slight decrease in 
the competitiveness of public servants, nor is it surprising 
that there is much recrimination and complaining within the 
federal public service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now talk about another issue that I mentioned in my 
previous speeches, namely the management of public finances by 
this government. The last <I>Star Wars</I> movie having just been 
released, I would say the Minister of Finance is the Darth Vader 
of the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He hides behind a black costume and sends his troops to the 
front. When the time comes to make employment insurance cuts, he 
tells one of his valiant lieutenants to go to the front on his 
behalf and take money from the employment insurance fund, which 
generates between $5 and $6 billion a year. 
The fund had accumulated $20 billion to $25 billion.  He tells 
his lieutenant to go and take it, and hand it over to the 
government, to settle the debt and the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are really unethical tactics, ones that must be denounced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Darth Vader then orders the President of Treasury Board, when 
pay equity comes up, when the time comes to pay women in the 
public service properly, not to do anything, to wait for the 
Bell Canada decision, and all kinds of decisions.  They all came 
out in favour of the women, yet the President of Treasury Board 
continues to leave the matter unresolved.  There are $2 billion 
to $5 billion that should be doing to women in the public 
service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind him, women public servants are also voters. 
They are the constituents in Saint-Jean, in Jonquière, everywhere 
in Quebec.  They are the voters in Louis-Hébert, Manicouagan, 
Argenteuil—Papineau, Matapédia—Matane.  They are in every riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are not people who are earning a fortune.  They earn about 
$30,000 a year.  This is not a lot of money, so members can 
imagine what another $2,000 or $3,000 a year would mean to these 
women.  They will simply put more of it into the regional 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the people who keep the regional economy running.  The 
federal government will get some of the money back in income and 
other taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is doing this deliberately.  It says “See what 
good administrators we are. 
Look at our public management, here is our report card”.  Darth 
Vader says “I put Canada back on the road to economic 
prosperity, I resolved the deficit and I am paying off the 
debt”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who resolved the deficit?  Women did. So did the people in the 
public service who invested their money in order to have a 
reasonable pension plan for their retirement years.  Now they 
are being told “There is a surplus of $30 million, we are going 
to take it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But they do not answer the question.  Suppose they take it and 
things do not work out, then what?  The contributions of these 
people will be increased or the plans' payments will be limited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are basic problems.  When I hear the House's Darth Vader, 
speaking through his lieutenants, say “We have put Canada back 
on the road to economic prosperity”, I find it scandalous. 
What sort of image will we send to private sector employers if 
parliament sets the bad example of taking money from the pension 
funds? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have used all the terms, because some we cannot use, the 
unparliamentary ones.  Up to now we have talked of rip-off, 
abduction, control and raiding.  We have used all the 
parliamentary terms, but it comes back to the word we have in 
our head but cannot say if we are to use parliamentary language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, the example has already been given. I recall the matter of 
concern to me, the case of the former employees of the Singer 
company. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1640"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT71"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few years ago, yours truly asked several questions on behalf 
of these workers. The government was the trustee and allowed the 
company to take money from the employees' pension fund, with the 
result that these people are receiving a monthly pension ranging 
from $20 to $50. They could have had much bigger pensions if the 
government had been the watchdog that it said it would be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we asked these questions, the human resources development 
ministers—three of them provided replies over the years—would 
always say “No, we have nothing to do with this. 
We did nothing wrong”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was on the mind of this government, of these directors and 
of Darth Vader? They all thought “Some day, we will get our 
hands on that surplus”. They could see the surplus in the 
employees' fund, but they did not want to set an example and say 
“Sorry. We acknowledge our responsibility”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, we can understand why Singer workers were the first 
victims, but I think there will be others, considering the 
terrible example the government is giving to the private sector. 
We proposed amendments, but I am sure government members will 
never support them. Yes they listen to their parliamentary 
leader when the time comes to gag the opposition. They follow 
their orders. They will probably defeat everyone's amendments 
and stick to their arrogant behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois and, I believe, most opposition parties, will 
vote against this bill because it is too despicable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 
38, to inform the House that the questions to be raised tonight 
at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. member for 
Halifax West, National Defence. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to 
speak for just a few minutes to the amendments that I have now 
moved.  I thank the House for that indulgence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would urge all members to vote in favour of these amendments 
because they fix the problem that the government is creating with 
this legislation.  The government is trying to get its big clammy 
meat hooks on money which does not belong to it.  It is wrong for 
it to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said, there are several solutions to this.  One of 
them is to just leave the money where it is.  It assures the 
taxpayers.  It protects the taxpayers against future losses as 
the demographics change, and they most likely will.  It puts a 
bit of a security blanket on the fund.  The motions put forward 
by the Reform Party will do just that.  They will protect both 
the people who are the employees and the taxpayers via the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members to support the motions put forward in the 
name of the Reform Party and in my name because this is what will 
be accomplished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is very important for us not to support, as the 
government is doing, going ahead with the bill unamended and just 
ramming it through.  It is just wrong. It is not the way to treat 
the employees of the government, the servants of the people.  It 
is just unconscionable. 
<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, many 
of the motions that have been put forward in my name deal with 
trying to take out of the bill the language that would enable 
government to seize the $30 billion pension plan.  That of course 
is the whole goal of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look back at how this whole debate got started, we will 
see that it was framed around one simple statement made by Alain 
Jolicoeur, the chief negotiator for HRDC in these matters.  About 
18 months ago he said that employees and pensioners had no 
priorietary interest in any surplus in the pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This statement was further compounded when the President of the 
Treasury Board said,  “The employees and the unions don't stand 
a chance in hell of getting their hands on the pension plan”. 
That is a quote, Mr. Speaker.  I am not trying to use language 
that is not correct.  This is where we started from. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1645"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT73"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT73"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1645

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously it is a basic tenet of the trade union movement and 
anybody involved with employee benefit plans that all pension 
surpluses are the exclusive property of the employees who paid 
into the plan because it is wages.  It is part of the pay package 
and wage package. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we look at this, it makes one wonder, if the President of the 
Treasury Board really believed that the employees have no right 
to claim that money, why then is he changing the legislation? Why 
then is he going to all this trouble of drafting 200 pages of 
legislation to get the enabling language to now say that the 
government can take the money out of the pension plan? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the changes we have put forward, we are trying to challenge 
the myth being perpetrated that the employees do not have any 
right to any part of any surplus.  That is certainly what we are 
being told by the minister's actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If one needs further evidence of the fact that the money is the 
employees' money, it is used that way at the bargaining table. 
Whenever the bargaining agents for the various public sector 
employees are at the table with the government, the government 
uses the whole pension package as part of the wage issue.  It 
says “Well, we can't give you much of a raise this year, but 
don't forget that you have always got that lovely pension”. 
When it is to its advantage, the government uses the pension as 
part of the wage package.  Now we are being told it is something 
completely separate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I pointed out earlier, there was a handshake deal if you 
will, a longstanding recognition of an issue when back in the 
1960s the government wanted pensions off the bargaining table. It 
did not want to negotiate pensions at the same time it was 
negotiating wages because it was far too complex.  The deal was 
that if the pension issue was taken off the bargaining table, the 
government would never unilaterally alter the terms and 
conditions of the pension plan while this deal held, while this 
pact or accord was in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That has been violated.  It has been shattered.  It has been 
broken.  Exactly what this bill does is it alters the terms and 
conditions of the pension plan without going to the other party 
and without negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is further language in here that gives the President of 
the Treasury Board the right to further alter the contributions 
any time he sees fit.  Any time an actuary says it had better 
crank up the contributions from the employees' side, that can be 
done without coming back to the advisory board or the House of 
Commons, which is where it should come back to because the terms 
are being changed unilaterally.  It gives unprecedented powers to 
the minister that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the amendments put forward by the Reform Party and by 
our party deal with this issue.  They try to take that language 
out of the bill that enables the government to seize not only the 
current pension but all future pension surpluses generated by the 
new public sector pension investment board.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise in the 
House today because I wish to speak to Bill C-78, an act to 
establish the Public Sector Pension Investment Board, to amend 
the Public Service Superannuation Act, the Canadian Forces 
Superannuation Act, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police 
Superannuation Act, and other related acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are opposed to the bill now being debated for several 
reasons. First, because it is another indication of how this 
government manages the public purse, under the Minister of 
Finance, by helping itself here and there to any surplus, however 
small, and using the money to fund all sorts of projects, often 
in areas of provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are opposed to this way of doing things.  We saw what 
happened with the surplus in the EI fund.  The government helped 
itself to it.  Insurance means just that.  There must always be 
money left in the fund for hard times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Employment Insurance Act was amended so heavily that it 
became extremely difficult for people to qualify for benefits. 
They are subject to all sorts of investigations, which are fine 
in the normal course of things, but which often deprive those 
looking for work of the system they used to be able to rely on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments to the Employment Insurance Act have gone too 
far.  Surpluses were used to pay down the deficit and to fund 
other programs as quickly as possible with no regard for the 
foundation of the EI fund system.

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With what happened not too long ago, one has every right to be 
concerned and to say “It is no better to keep taking money from 
the surpluses in other funds”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The surplus in the public service plan is about $15 billion. It 
is $2.4 billion in the RCMP plan, and $13 billion in the 
Canadian forces' plan. This adds up to $30 billion, which are 
going to be used to pay for programs or reduce deficits here and 
there. The thousands—I repeat thousands—of workers who paid into 
the plan are getting shafted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently there are around 275,000 Canadians and Quebeckers who 
have been contributing to the plan. There are 160,000 retirees 
and 52,000 surviving spouses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of helping workers, using the interests generated by 
these surpluses to improve their working conditions and their 
wages, the government decided to do something else, saying “From 
now on these surpluses will be part of a fund managed by the 
government. The government can dip into it as it sees fit, 
without any regard for the very reason the pension funds were 
established in the first place”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we speak about public service employees, we speak mostly 
about women since they are the majority in the public sector. 
We are talking about employees who earn about $30,000 a year and 
get an average pension of $9,000 a year.  These are not people 
earning above the average, far from it.  They are people who 
might be in need of that $30 billion in the surplus to improve 
their living conditions, instead of seeing the money taken away 
from them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years these same employees have had all sorts of 
things done to them.  They may seem to be a pretty tough lot, 
but beware.  The women public servants may be patient for a 
time, but when that patience runs out, watch out, for they have 
had enough of being snubbed, after all the pay equity business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are people in my riding who have been waiting for years to 
see this problematic issue of pay equity solved. When there has 
been no solution to a problem for more than 10 years, this 
suggest the problem lies with the ones who are supposed to be 
finding the solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were told that there were court decisions pending and we 
would have to wait and see what the outcome would be.  There was 
even a decision pending in the private sector.  So the public 
sector could not make a move because that could have a major 
impact on the private sector.  All of these judgements have been 
brought down now, and the issue could have been solved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that several billion dollars are at stake, but that 
is because nothing has moved for years.  Had the problem been 
settled at the right time, one year at a time, the figures would 
be far less and people would not be left with the same 
impression.  There would not be these huge sums to be given back 
to public servants, because they would have been treated 
properly all along. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The matter is not yet settled.  People are still waiting.  I do 
not know if they are Waiting for Godot, like in the play, but 
they are definitely still waiting, and the money keeps piling 
up.  The workers are getting older, some are already retired. 
Imagine what a few thousand dollars would mean to these people 
who have been waiting 14 years to get it and who are receiving 
$9,000 a year in pension benefits. These people have never 
earned enough money to brag and say “We are on top of it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people have been and are still being treated unfairly, 
because they are still waiting for a solution. Now the 
government is picking on these same people, by taking the 
surplus in their pension funds and in some way jeopardizing 
their secure old age and the future of their pension plan.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleagues have talked about the government using and 
abusing closure. Of course, we live in a democracy, and our role 
in this place is to represent our constituents and defend their 
interests by opposing bills that could hurt them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of my constituents work for the government. Even if that 
were not the case, it would still make sense to me to defend the 
constituents of my colleagues and even those of the government 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we want to address numerous amendments in relation to a 
bill, closure is brought. 
This cynical government rises and says “The debate is over”. 
This is what gagging the opposition is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this parliament, the government has resorted to closure more 
than 50 times. It might as well tell us right from the beginning 
if it does not want us to talk. We have something to say on each 
of these amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are things that are disturbing and one of them is how 
little the government cares about its employees. I am thinking 
in particular about public servants, because they form the 
largest group. We can identify with them more, since we have 
worked a lot with them on recent bills, and particularly on the 
pay equity issue. Still, this does not keep us from also caring 
about Canadian forces and RCMP personnel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is somewhat alarming to see that ordinary citizens count for 
so little. 
By citizens I also mean women, many of whom work with great 
dedication in the public service, that is for the government. 
They are watching us today and wondering how far this will go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government helped itself to the surplus in the employment 
insurance fund—public services also pay employment insurance. 
Now, it is helping itself to the surplus in their pension funds. 
There is no end to this. And, as I said, but I can never say it 
often enough, the government has not even settled the very 
sensitive issue of pay equity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by asking for the unanimous consent of the House 
to move the following motion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That all government members, since the government has imposed 
time allocation on consideration of Bill C-78, at report stage, 
be prevented from speaking during today's debate on this bill. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Does the hon. member have the unanimous 
consent of the House to move his motion?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
with great sadness that I rise to speak today.  This sadness 
hangs over the opposition members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government's management style is unacceptable.  Since my 
election in 1997, the Bloc Quebecois and all the opposition 
parties have faced closure on many occasions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is closure?  This government uses it to muzzle the 
opposition.  Why muzzle the opposition?  Because the government 
is not capable of legislating in a way consistent with the 
reality of Quebeckers and Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from an extremely proud and a highly industrialized 
community.  There are also many many public service employees in 
the riding of Jonquière.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a tax data centre there.  What did they do recently to 
the Department of National Revenue?  They set up another agency. 
I think they are trying to see how many agencies they can set 
up.  Why is this government doing that?  Because they have a 
whole lot of friends to thank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have always been in active politics.  Elected the member for 
Jonquière, I was not expecting to be part of a circus here in 
the House.  What is this government doing?  Taking care of all 
its friends. Why must these people be compensated?  Because the 
government has nothing to give the people.  It has to look after 
its friends first of all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is going on right now with Bill C-78 is unacceptable.  The 
government is doing the same thing it did with the EI fund. Too 
much is not enough, as they say, and so is too little.  This 
government has no common sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On weekends I visit my riding.  People say to me: “Jocelyne, 
are you going to tell the government that there is such a thing 
as common sense?  If they do not know what it is, then they 
should pay us a visit, talk to people in factories.  We will 
show them a thing or two”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They did not go to the same school as we did.  They went to 
schools that taught them to reward their cronies, their friends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is going on is not fair to women, as my colleague, the 
member for Louis-Hébert, pointed out. 
Three quarters of the employees at the taxation data centre in 
my riding are women.  They are constantly coming to see me to 
complain about how the President of the Treasury Board has 
insulted them yet again.  They are insulted by his unwillingness 
to recognized pay equity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only does the government not recognize pay equity, but it is 
dipping into the pension fund.  In most cases, these women have 
sacrificed their health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For many years now, the government has resorted to cutbacks in 
the public service in order to reduce the deficit.  Where there 
used to be three or four women doing a job in the taxation 
centre, now there is only one. The workload has increased.  Now 
the government is actually going to dip into their pension fund, 
when it is known that most of these women are single parents. 
They have children under their care. When they retire, they will 
get a meagre $9,000 pension. It is a joke at their expense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think there are a lot of government members who know 
how it is in real life, how much it costs to buy a pound of 
butter or to buy clothes for children. I will gladly take them 
shopping to show them the day to day reality of ordinary people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is high time workers put the government in its place. They 
are sick and tired of paying when the government does anything 
it wants with their money. On top of that, it likes to reward 
its friends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not proud today. It is May 13. Usually, 13 is my lucky 
number. Today is not a lucky day for Quebeckers and Canadians, 
for those people who gave their all to do their job well. 
They gave their all hoping to have a decent income when they 
retire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has other ideas. Instead of increasing this 
decent income, it takes money from these people. Then it says 
that it is for their own good. Oh, sure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My parents taught me that a person who takes something from 
another person must be judged. One of these days, the Liberals 
will be judged. 
We will be able to say that we told them not to do that. They 
will be condemned, and I will be there to applaud.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North—St. Paul, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the issue before us concerns the federal employees' 
pension plan.  It is estimated that there is a surplus of about 
$30 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From time to time we should draw wisdom from the media.  I have 
in my hand an editorial from the Toronto <I>Star</I> dated April 
26, 1999.  I could not do better than to quote profusely from 
this editorial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What, for example, is the nature of the federal employees' plan? 
What is the amount they contribute from their earnings?  They 
contribute a maximum of 7.5% of their earnings to this plan. 
Apparently it is a plan that is acceptable to them and it is 
indeed a very good plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the duty of the federal government to this plan? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  How can you stand there? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:</B>  I can stand here because this is a 
House of democracy.  If the member of the Reform Party respects 
democracy, then he will respect freedom of speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  You do not believe in democracy or you 
would not have shut down debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:</B>  This is an example of a member of 
the Reform Party trying to make a travesty of democracy in 
Canada.  I am not angered, I am saddened that it would be evinced 
by the member opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The duty of government to this pension plan is not only that the 
federal government will match the contribution of federal 
employees, but as well it must be noted very clearly that the 
government will assume all the risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two points.  The government matches the contribution 
of the employees and at the same time it makes up for any short 
fall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the issue before us?  I will read from the editorial 
which I mentioned previously: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, the plan is estimated to have a $30 billion surplus, 
meaning that if the future pension entitlements for all employees 
and retirees were paid out today, the pension fund would have $30 
billion to spare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two weeks ago Ottawa introduced legislation.... 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Complicating the debate is the fact that the pension fund and 
the surplus exist only on paper.  In reality, the government has 
always used the employee contributions to help finance its 
programs.  The benefits are funded on a pay-as-you-go basis from 
budget revenues.... 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So if the employees were to win the battle for even richer 
pension benefits, government spending would automatically go up.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the Reform Party would agree with that.  That would leave 
less money for social programs like health care and less money to 
reduce the personal income taxes of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it only follows that the surplus truly belongs to the 
Canadian people.  Because we assume all the risk, it only follows 
that it belongs to the Canadian people.  According to the Toronto 
<I>Star</I>, “The government is on solid ground”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am surprised the Reform Party, which tries to say that it is 
about a cut to income tax, would miss the opportunity to find a 
source for the reduction of income taxes; that a party which 
would like to see a reduction in our debt would lose the 
opportunity to find a social fund so we could reduce our debt. 
More important, we can have a social fund to allocate 
expenditures for our health care program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think I have made the basic points on the issue.  With the 
permission of the Speaker, I will answer any questions that 
members opposite would like to pose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent that there 
be a period of questions and comments?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was 
not planning on indulging in the debate today, but after the 
speech from my hon. friend I felt compelled to take part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about democracy and what this House is all about.  I 
agree that presumably the House is all about democracy.  However, 
this is now the 53rd or 54th time— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  The 52nd time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston:</B>  My colleague from Elk Island informs 
me that this is the 52nd time that time allocation has been 
imposed on debate in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can recall a day when the rat pack sat on this side of House. 
The member for Glengarry—Prescott—Russell, who is now the 
government House leader, was one of the illustrious members of 
the rat pack.  He used to go into absolute convulsions whenever 
the Conservatives moved time allocation or closure in the House. 
As a matter of fact, he used to say things like “Here comes the 
jackboots.  Bring out the brown shirts.  Here comes closure 
again”.  Over and over the member for 
Glengarry—Prescott—Russell would say things like that whenever 
debate was restricted in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is the very person who reared up on his hind legs with much 
authority, to the chagrin of people on this side, and today moved 
time allocation with a noticeable smirk on his face.  He was very 
much pleased that he could do whatever he could to make sure that 
democracy did not take place.  He limits debate time and time 
again in the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to rise tonight to say a few 
words on behalf of my colleague from Surrey North in support of 
his private member's bill, Bill C-260. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say at the outset that I find it absolutely incredible that 
the government can move so expeditiously as it just did to shut 
down debate on an important piece of legislation.  For the 53rd 
time the government moved time allocation, a form of closure. It 
closed down the debate on Bill C-78, the government pension bill. 
It rams through the House legislation that we see is of real 
importance to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am specifically speaking now in favour of Private Member's 
Bill C-260, which is votable.  We see foot dragging which takes 
up valuable time in the House, when for all intents and purposes 
this is a very simple and straightforward bill which makes a 
minor change to the Young Offenders Act. This bill could be put 
through quickly with all-party support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, one would think that would happen, because ironically 
enough the justice minister and the justice department have seen 
fit to pick up the idea of my colleague from Surrey North. 
Basically the content of Bill C-260 is included in the justice 
minister's new youth justice act, Bill C-68, which is also being 
debated in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does Bill C-260 do?  As I said, it is very simple and 
straightforward.  It involves a minor change to section 7.2 of 
the Young Offenders Act.  It would move that from a simple 
summary conviction offence to a dual procedure or hybrid offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of those at home viewing the debate tonight, we 
have to ask what this bill would accomplish.  It would hold 
parents, guardians or others more accountable, the people who 
sign contracts with the courts to take on the responsibility for 
youth who have been charged with criminal offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than incarcerating those youths, the courts would grant 
bail.  The youths would be out in the community but under certain 
conditions imposed by the courts.  Those conditions, once 
imposed, are meant to be respected. Adults, often parents but 
sometimes guardians or others, sign a contract with the courts 
and take on the responsibility of ensuring that the youths follow 
those conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What exactly does the bill do to hold the parents or guardians 
more accountable?  It would simply change the present possible 
penalty from six months imprisonment to two years less a day. 
Nothing else would change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The justice minister has paid my colleague from Surrey North the 
ultimate compliment that can be given to a private member, 
certainly to a member from an opposition party.  She has included 
his Bill C-260 virtually verbatim in her new youth justice act, 
Bill C-68. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard from members on the government side during the 
preceding debate on this bill.  This is the third hour of a 
votable private member's bill. 
In the preceding two hours of debate members from all parties 
congratulated my colleague from Surrey North for accomplishing 
that, for bringing forward a bill that has actually been included 
in government legislation. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1825"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT87"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT87"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1825

<A HREF="#LINKT86"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another question would have to be asked. Why would my colleague 
from Surrey North not simply withdraw Bill C-260 since it is 
included in the government's new youth legislation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately we have seen time and time again that government 
legislation for many reasons can take a considerable amount of 
time to get passed, especially omnibus bills that are not like 
Bill C-260 that contain clauses that are certainly arguable as to 
their worth to Canadian society and to the general public. The 
new Bill C-68, the youth justice act, is going to be one of those 
bills.  There is going to be some very contentious parts to that 
legislation if it ever comes before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another thing hanging over all this legislation. We 
keep hearing rumours that the government is going to prorogue 
parliament in June.  Legislation on the Order Paper will die. We 
are very concerned that the youth justice act could be one of 
those pieces of legislation that dies at the end of this session. 
Then it is of little benefit to anyone that one of the sections 
in Bill C-68 that we support is in effect Bill C-260 put forward 
by my colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our estimation there is some need to push this forward. My 
colleague was fortunate enough to begin with to win the lottery 
and have his name drawn to debate the bill.  Then he was 
successful in convincing the subcommittee which deems certain 
private members' legislation votable that his bill was important 
enough to be made votable.  Obviously it met all the criteria for 
a votable item. He was able to argue sufficiently and it was made 
votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is now before the House for its third hour of debate 
and it will be votable. We just heard the hon. government whip 
say that although it will be deferred, there will be a vote on 
Bill C-260. All members will be able to vote on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we vote and that we push this issue along 
and that we have that opportunity to pass this very important 
change into law as quickly as possible, rather than wait to have 
it brought forward some day in Bill C-68. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people have said that this bill is too harsh because it 
will hold parents accountable. It is important to point out, as I 
did earlier, that the only thing it changes is the possible 
maximum sentence that can be levelled by the court against 
parents or guardians who do not live up to their responsibility, 
who do not fulfil the contract they sign with the courts when 
they take the responsibility for youth who have been charged for 
criminal activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> It is already in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  The reality is that the bill as it is 
presently constituted will accomplish that.  The Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Justice was heckling a moment ago 
saying that it is already in the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course it is in the act, but as has been pointed out by 
previous speakers, being able to hold the parents accountable 
with more deterrence that will be provided by the possibility of 
a two year sentence is not in the act. 
That is the reason we must push this through to a vote.  I expect 
that members from all sides of the House, including government 
members who obviously intend to support Bill C-68 which includes 
this change, would want to support Bill C-260.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gar Knutson (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to speak in the House of 
Commons this evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As most hon. members know, the government fully supports the 
concept behind the bill.  We have incorporated it completely into 
the proposed legislation, Bill C-68, the youth criminal justice 
act which currently is at second reading in the House.  The 
Reform Party member for Surrey North should take some credit for 
that inclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me first look at the current situation under the Young 
Offenders Act.  It provides that young people who are denied bail 
can be released to a responsible adult who undertakes in writing 
to care for the youth and ensure compliance with the conditions 
set by the court.  Currently a wilful failure by the responsible 
adult to comply with the undertaking is a summary conviction 
offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-260 would amend the Young Offenders Act to make the 
offence of wilfully failing to comply with an undertaking a 
hybrid rather than a summary conviction offence, that is give an 
option for the offence to be treated as a summary conviction or 
as an indictable offence with the possibility of a prison term 
for up to two years at the discretion of the crown.  The new 
youth criminal justice act also provides for the same hybrid 
offences treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government feels that a wilful failure to comply with an 
undertaking to act as a responsible adult in relation to youth is 
very serious.  It is useful to allow a prosecutor to use 
discretion as to what charge to bring forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no secret that we greatly appreciate the hon. member's 
important contribution to the new youth criminal justice act. 
However, the motion put forward by the government at this time 
would allow parliament to deal with the issue in the more 
comprehensive government youth justice bill that is already 
before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again it is important to note that the concept behind Bill 
C-260 has been completely incorporated in Bill C-68.  While Bill 
C-260 seeks to amend the Young Offenders Act, Bill C-68 seeks to 
replace the Young Offenders Act with an entirely new act, an 
important element of the government's youth strategy.  Therefore 
I move: 
<A NAME="LINK275">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the 
word “that” and substituting the following therefor: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Bill C-260, an act to amend the Young Offenders Act, be not 
now read a second time but that it be read a second time this day 
six months hence”. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The question is on the amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the bill was before the House on March 15, at the 
conclusion of the time for debate the hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough had the floor and had six minutes 
remaining in his speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill was subsequently debated on March 19 and the hon. 
member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough did not on that 
occasion use his six minutes.   I understand he is seeking the 
floor floor now, and since he is rising on the amendment he may 
take ten minutes.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak to the amendment 
to the main motion.  The amendment keeps in mind that Bill C-68 
has borrowed from and incorporated much of the intent the hon. 
member for Surrey North had in mind when the bill was originally 
brought forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I acknowledge the ongoing efforts of the member for Surrey North 
in this regard.  Through no fault of his own and through no 
desire of his own, he joined a very exclusive group in the 
country, and that is being the survivor of a murdered victim.  As 
a parent I think the bill and the incorporation of the bill into 
the Criminal Code serves as a tribute to his son Jesse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This a very commendable focus of what in most circumstances 
would be a very bitter and negative energy.  He has put forward 
what is a very positive motion which will hopefully help to 
prevent, perhaps in some way, matters such as this where a parent 
is not being held accountable and not making significant efforts 
to supervise a young person who is bound by a court order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been much discussion throughout the debate on Bill 
C-260 about the new youth criminal justice act that has also been 
debated in the Chamber.  We in the Progressive Conservative Party 
like all Canadians were looking forward to the changes that were 
coming about as a result of deliberations and as a result of the 
long delay endured on the issue of changes to the Young Offenders 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been stated time and time again in the House, in the 
media, in the coffee shops and in general debate throughout the 
country, the Young Offenders Act was not serving its purpose, not 
serving our criminal justice system, and not serving Canadians at 
large. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the new bill is a disappointment.  There was an 
opportunity, which the minister chose not to exercise, to make 
changes that would have had a more significant effect.  That is 
not to say that commendable changes have not come about. 
Certainly there is an element through some effort on the part of 
the member for Surrey North to bring in some form of parental 
responsibility.  It is a positive measure to have the ability now 
to identify certain dangerous young offenders and the ability to 
transfer certain types of offences.  That would be seen in a 
positive light. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However other offences have been excluded for some reason from 
consideration.  Although we are not through the final stages of 
the bill, there will be an opportunity to propose amendments.  At 
least there will be an opportunity to fix some of the glaring 
omissions on the part of the Department of Justice.  Time will 
tell. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The introduction of the new bill was given a great deal of focus 
in the media.  There was a great deal of hype and much discussion 
outside the Chamber by the minister.  It is with sort of a heavy 
heart that we are facing a situation where this change to the 
Young Offenders Act does not exactly hit the mark. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the areas where obviously there is a downturn or a 
failing is the inability to lower the age of criminal 
responsibility to 10.  There is also an omission in the area of 
focusing on the use of weapons in the commission of a criminal 
offence and making mandatory minimum sentences for young 
offenders in situations where weapons have been used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The focus of the bill was to be on violent versus non-violent 
offences.  There was much discussion and acrimony about the fact 
that young people should be given an opportunity and should be 
treated differently under our criminal justice system.  That is 
the philosophy of the old bill, of the juvenile delinquents act, 
and of the bill before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is difficulty in saying that we have to be more pro-active 
and pre-emptive when it comes to treating young people under our 
criminal justice system.  There has to be an acknowledgement that 
the resources also have to be allotted.

<A HREF="#LINKT89"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The enforcement and administration of the legislation have to 
acknowledge that currently there is a funding shortage and that 
currently the federal government is not holding up its end of the 
bargain.  The original intent of the old legislation, the Young 
Offenders Act, was that the federal government would pick up 50% 
of the cost of administration.  Similarly the new legislation 
would have the same fiscal or monetary attachment.  That is not 
the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know that the present social services are in many cases 
the first line of defence, that is child welfare offices, offices 
that have to deal with the protection of children.  These offices 
are drastically underfunded, yet at the same time the bill will 
put a greater emphasis on those agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be reticent not to mention the fact that the police are 
given greater powers of discretion under the new bill.  It is a 
very laudable intention that police officers be allowed to 
exercise greater discretion in the field and perhaps on occasion, 
rather than formally charging a young person, be permitted to 
take the young person to his or her parents or back to the 
station and administer a tongue lashing, for lack of a better 
word.  Sometimes that will have a better impact on the young 
person than having them go through the very formal and very 
sterile court process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all of that in mind, if the intent of the new legislation 
is to have this proactive attempt by police to circumvent more 
formal processes, there also has to be an acknowledgement that it 
will be a very onerous task for police in terms of taxing their 
time, their effort and their current resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They simply do not have those resources.  We know that because 
time and time again we hear it from the policing community and 
from the chiefs of police.  We know that the RCMP is drastically 
underfunded at this time.  We know that its budgets have been cut 
time and time again.  In general terms we have seen billions cut 
out of transfer payments to provinces that go to the 
administration of justice in individual provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is nothing short of lip service.  It is very lame for the 
government to suggest that it will give more responsibility to 
the police and the frontline agencies which will be tasked with 
administering the new bill and at the same time tell them not 
only that they will not get more money to do so but that they 
will not get the same amount they used to have to administer the 
Young Offenders Act.  There is an absolutely hypocritical nature 
to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to what some other justice ministers in the 
provinces have said, I will quote from the Alberta Minister of 
Justice, Jon Havelock, who said in relation to contemplating the 
tougher spin which has been put on the legislation that to 
increase penalties, increase the jail time and ensure that those 
who were repeatedly committing offences are dealt with more 
appropriately under the act, the money will have to be in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New Brunswick justice minister, Greg Byrne, said that he could 
not remain partisan when speaking about the new bill.  He said 
that it should be tougher on violent offenders.  This creates an 
interesting dilemma for the Minister of Justice because she has 
cautioned Canadians that the provinces will have to come on side 
and enforce the provisions of the bill which will become law 
before the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the minister's year long consultation process with many 
of the provinces she stated continually that they were being 
properly consulted.  Consulted is one thing but being actually 
listened to is another.  It has become patently obvious that the 
ministers of justice of many of provinces, including Alberta, 
Ontario, Prince Edward Island and even New Brunswick, are sorrily 
disappointed with the outcome and the final draft of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It demonstrates to me that it is another example of broken 
promises.  If this is the consultation that takes place, and yet 
at the end of the day the provinces are ignored, it is not 
something that will further good relations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government and the provincial governments agreed a 
long time ago that they would divide the cost of administering 
the Young Offenders Act.  This is certainly the intention of the 
provinces today.  They are still asking the federal government to 
pick up its fair share of the cost of the administration.  No 
where have we ever seen the commitment of the federal government 
to do so.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's attempt to please all of the provinces by taking 
bits and pieces of the suggestions and implementing them into the 
bill will eventually please no one, and I would suggest that 
includes the hon. member for Surrey North. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the introduction of Bill C-68 we saw a lot of bells and 
whistles and a lot of publicity about what it is going to 
accomplish, but at the end of the day we saw a very cumbersome 
bill that will be extremely difficult to administer.  The bill is 
twice as lengthy and includes twice as many clauses as the old 
Young Offenders Act.  We know that the old Young Offenders Act 
was a very cumbersome piece of legislation.  This will be a field 
day for lawyers, a nightmare for judges, and it will not 
accomplish for Canadians what we had hoped it would.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it was going to be a pleasure to rise to speak to 
this bill and to talk about the great things that my colleague 
from Surrey North has done in this House, and about how even the 
government has inserted what the member has in this bill into its 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard the government whip say “Let's defer the vote”, and 
we all thought that was fine, but in the middle of the debate the 
member for Elgin—Middlesex—London moved a motion to hoist the 
bill.  The people who are listening probably do not understand 
that the motion to hoist will delay the bill for six months in 
order that we can have a look at it.  Maybe they think that is a 
good idea.  However, in parliamentary terms the government has 
killed this private member's bill.  The bill is dead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds:</B>  The parliamentary secretary said that 
it has not been killed.  She should walk down to the clerk's 
table and find out a little about parliament because this bill is 
dead. That is what they did on the other side.  The Liberals have 
killed this young offenders bill which would have benefited this 
country.  It is a shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is really a shame about it is that we have the government 
interfering in Private Members' Business.  This was not done by a 
backbencher; it was done by the government with a plan to kill 
this private member's bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public may not understand what the bill addresses.  It calls 
for parents and guardians of young offenders to be held 
accountable when they fail to discharge their responsibilities. 
It could have been law in this country by May 26, when we return, 
but the government has killed the bill.  It has killed this great 
idea, which even it admits is a great idea because it included it 
in its legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberals might say that we should just wait until their 
legislation comes along, but we know that the government does not 
intend to pass Bill C-68 in this session.  The House is going to 
prorogue before the bill ever sees the light of day because the 
government has taken so much heat over the fact that certain 
things are not in the bill that should be there.  It will let the 
bill drag on.  The government House leader has not brought the 
bill back into the House for debate.  We have had 20 minutes 
here, an hour there, two hours there, but there is no government 
behind Bill C-68. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not even see it on our agenda of “must haves” before we 
break for the summer.  That is a shame.  It is an absolute shame 
that the government spent a couple of million bucks on PR for the 
bill to try to make the minister and the government look good and 
it is not even on the agenda as an item to be considered before 
we leave for summer holidays.  The government could have had the 
bill of the member for Surrey North which would have made that 
part of it law before the summer, but it has not done that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Democracy is really great on the other side.  The Liberals have 
killed this bill.  They have killed this young offenders section. 
They just do not want to see a member from this side getting 
credit for doing it.  They will pay the price for that.  What is 
even worse is that young people will pay the price.  They will 
pay the price because this was a good bill.  Even the Minister of 
Justice said that when she brought down her legislation.  She 
said that this was incorporated in Bill C-68 because it was a 
good idea, but then they killed this bill today.  They are going 
to kill Bill C-68. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  That is why we incorporated it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds:</B>  They are sitting over there yapping 
away.  A little yapping here and a little yapping there, but it 
makes no sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill could have passed.  We could have supported it, we 
could have voted for it and it would have been part of the 
present bill because we are not going to see Bill C-68 for a long 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They can talk all they want, but what they have done is killed 
democracy and killed this member's bill.  That is what a hoist 
means.  If they do not understand that, they should sit with you, 
Mr. Speaker, to get a few lessons on parliamentary democracy.  If 
they have been conned by their own House leader that this will 
not kill the bill, they do not understand how parliament works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say shame on the government for hurting democracy tonight and 
for killing this private member's bill.

is not much to say.  I was prepared to thank the hon. members for 
supporting the bill all the way through, as far as it got, but 
now we see what the government is really up to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill was meant to amend the Young Offenders Act, which is 
the current law of the country.  I understand and appreciate the 
fact that the minister did choose to use it in the new 
legislation, but we do not know where that legislation is going 
to wind up.  It has been pushed back and pushed back.  We do not 
know if it is ever going to see the light of day.  I am not 
prepared to take a pig in a poke and act on faith alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am disappointed about this, but I have dealt with more severe 
things in my life.  I think most members can attest to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This piece of legislation was an idea that was prompted by some 
personal experience.  It would have been good legislation for the 
country.  It would have allowed the crown an opportunity to 
increase the sanctions on parents who fail to supervise their 
children properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In effect, my bill is dead.  That is fine.  That is part of the 
deal here.  All I can hope for is that Bill C-68, the new youth 
justice legislation, does come into force sometime.  Judging by 
what I have seen, I do not anticipate that will happen.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on 
March 5, I raised the issue of charges pending against Mike 
Kipling and the pursuit of these charges against this man. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many issues surrounding the government's 
administration of the anthrax vaccine to Canadian forces 
personnel last spring in the Persian Gulf.  A vaccine researcher 
corresponded with my office earlier this year and raised some 
very interesting issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This researcher was informed by the Department of National 
Defence that it was a matter of military policy that forces 
personnel were to be provided with specific written disclosure of 
contraindications and possible adverse effects associated with 
immunization.  As well, prior to immunization, forces personnel 
should be briefed as to the risks of the diseases the vaccination 
is supposed to prevent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sergeant Kipling was left with serious and unanswered questions 
after reading the acknowledgement form.  This vaccine researcher 
claims that there is no data addressing how carcinogenic this 
vaccine may be nor about any possible reproductive effects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nuremberg Code of 1947 clearly states that in terms of 
following orders: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely 
essential. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the government able to say without a doubt that voluntary 
consent was given?  I think not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear from the government, in response to my 
comments, why the Liberal administration supports people losing 
their right to decide what goes into their bodies simply by 
virtue of the fact that they have joined the Canadian forces? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It appears, from the Food and Drug Administration in the United 
States, that the company which provided the anthrax vaccine in 
question may have re-labelled a lot of outdated drugs. 
Furthermore, the government did no independent testing of the 
chemical package it wanted so desperately to inject into the body 
of Sergeant Kipling and other Canadian forces personnel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the government commit here and now that it will review 
policies concerning vaccinations to allow for individual choice 
and the possibility of waiving vaccinations and whether some 
quarantine during testing might suffice to meet the goal of 
protecting the population at large?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, last year Canada 
responded to the threat posed in the gulf by Saddam Hussein.  We 
dispatched the HMCS <I>Toronto</I>, aircraft and personnel from 
435 squadron in order to do our part as a member of the 
international community.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Our maritime personnel provided escort duties for a U.S. navy 
carrier battle group and contributed to maritime interdiction 
operations.  Our aviators and support personnel provided 
technical air to air refuelling in support of the allied air 
effort in the region.  Our maritime and air personnel did an 
excellent job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The dangers faced by the approximately 360 Canadians in the gulf 
were very real.  They included the possibility that biological 
weapons could be used against our personnel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all good conscience, we could not send our people into a 
potentially dangerous situation without ensuring they were 
properly protected.  Part of this protection was inoculating them 
against anthrax.  As we all know, anthrax is a very deadly 
disease in which individuals are not aware they are sick until it 
is too late to treat them.  We had to protect Canadian personnel 
against the use of such biological weapons.  To do otherwise 
would be both irresponsible and unconscionable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has worked in good faith and in the best 
interests of the men and women of the Canadian forces to provide 
them with the best protection possible in what we must remember 
was a potentially dangerous operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize that Sergeant Kipling and his family have no doubt 
experienced considerable stress over this situation.  However, 
cohesion and discipline are fundamental elements in an effective 
armed force.  For that reason, disobeying an order, any order, is 
a serious offence that should be treated appropriately by the 
military justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sergeant Kipling has been charged with wilfully disobeying an 
order under section 126 of the National Defence Act.  The 
decision to charge Sergeant Kipling and to proceed to a court 
martial was made after very careful examination of the case and 
is in accordance with current military law.
