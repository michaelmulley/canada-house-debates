	<B>Mr. Bob Wood (Nipissing, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
commend the work of the people in my riding of Nipissing for their 
efforts to save CFB North Bay. In recent weeks there has been a 
remarkable team effort made to inform the members of this 
government about the consequences of the NORAD facility leaving 
our city.
<P>
	Our most powerful weapon has been the co-operation that has 
existed between all the stakeholders. So far we have received over 
16,000 signatures on a petition to save our air base. This grassroots 
support is echoed across our community. It extends from the 
affected employees and their local unions to our city council and 
our business community.
<P>
	This support has been essential in allowing Mayor Jack Burrows 
and I, along with the valuable assistance from North Bay MPP and 
Ontario Premier Mike Harris, to bring a strong and unified message 
to Ottawa.
<P>
	This issue crosses political and ideological lines as we fight 
collectively to save hundreds of jobs in northeastern Ontario and 
northwestern Quebec.

	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
morning on CBC the finance minister said his government is 
focusing spending on those things which are most important to 
them: health care, children and jobs. Let us look at the record.
<P>
	The minister has slashed $7 billion from health care, education 
and welfare. In fact health care has been cut 40 per cent. This is 
how the finance minister focuses on health care.
<P>
	The minister has gouged the average family's after tax income 
by $3,000. Parents are working longer and harder just to make ends 
meet. This is how the finance minister focuses on children.
<P>
	And jobs? Our unemployment rate is hovering around 10 per 
cent compared to Japan at 3.4 per cent and the United States at5.4 per cent. If the minister taxed less and left more in the hands of 
those who earn it, this would increase consumer spending and drive 
the economy and businesses to create jobs. Instead, through 36 tax 
increases this minister takes $24 billion more every year, killing 
jobs in our communities. This is how the finance minister focuses 
on jobs.
<P>
	The finance minister's words and his record conflict.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Bernier (Beauce, Ind.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
draw attention to the archaic method used by The National 
Battlefields Commission of Canada to collect fines for traffic 
violations on federal property, particularly in Quebec City.
<P>
	The people ticketed for very minor violations cannot pay the 
fines even if they wanted to because these fines are not set in 
advance. They have to immediately sign a guilty plea, which is 
referred to the Court of the Sessions of the Peace for a judge to set 
the amount of the fine and additional court costs. Failing that, the 
documents will be served on them.
<P>
	This is a costly procedure for all taxpayers. It is high time that 
The National Battlefields Commission of Canada updated its 
procedures. This is another good way of saving money.

Canadian Heritage and the Secretary of State for Multiculturalism, 
I announced the Matthieu Da Costa award. The award honours 
black history month by commemorating the life of Da Costa, the

	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to applaud the joint decision made by the Fonds de 
solidarité des travailleurs du Québec and the Fonds régional du 
Bas-Saint-Laurent to invest $1.5 million in Carrière Glendyne, 
located in Saint-Marc-du-Lac-Long. This investment will bring the 
slate mine back into production and preserve 60 direct jobs in this 
small village of 534 people.
<P>
	Getting Carrière Glendyne back into operation will give new 
impetus to the economy in Saint-Marc-du-Lac-Long. The initial 
stages involving rock scaling activities have resumed, and it is 
expected that all of the company's 60 employees will be called 
back to work by March 17.
<P>
	Quebec is among the world's ten largest mining countries, and

	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this budget is yet another Liberal con job.
<P>
	Instead of jobs, there is $3.2 billion in further cuts to social 
programs scheduled this year. Instead of helping to reduce child 
poverty now, there is another red book promise to help children in 
need effective July 1998, only 18 months from now. And if it does 
materialize, it is only 20 per cent of the commitment the B.C. NDP 
government has made to help end child poverty now.
<P>
	The Liberals have taken $14 billion out of the economy through 
cuts to social programs. Now they  insult Canadians with a snow 
job pre-election budget. This budget offers nothing for struggling 
families who are looking for stable employment and no hope for 
their children's future.
<P>
	The Liberals have achieved one thing. In 1993, the last year of 
the Mulroney government, 5,250 taxpayers earning over $70,000 
per year paid no taxes. Under the Liberals, there has been a 400 per 
cent increase: 21,270 Canadians earning over $70,000 a year paid 
no taxes.

Women's Institute has become well known and respected across 
Canada and around the world.
<P>

<P>
	The movement began with one woman, Adelaide Hoodless, and 
her response to the death of her 18-month old son from drinking 
impure milk. Impelled by her personal loss, Mrs. Hoodless became 
an activist campaigning for clean milk. On February 19, 1897 at 
Stoney Creek, Ontario the Women's Institute began, creating a 
movement to educate women in the home sciences.
<P>
	The local movement spread quickly to become the pre-eminent 
women's organization in Canada. At the turn of the century the 
concept spread to Britain and throughout Europe. In 1933 the 
organizations joined forces and the Association of Country Women 
of the World was formed.
<P>
	Over the years, issues have changed and the WI continues to

<P>
	Yesterday we were presented with a workable budget, a budget 
that invests in jobs, health care, education and children.
<P>
	The government has long recognized that children are our 
greatest resource, that they are our future and we must invest in 
them. The government has made the investment.
<P>
	The national child benefit system is an innovative approach to 
reducing the number of Canadian children  who live in poverty. The

<P>
	The finance minister has raised tax revenues by $24 billion and 
has reduced spending by $13, billion, a $37 billion gain. But lo and 
behold, we will still have a $17 billion deficit. Why? Where did the 
$37 billion go? It has gone to pay big interest on Canada's ever 
growing debt.
<P>
	The finance minister blew it by not making cuts in the first year. 
He blew it by not reducing the size of the government faster. He 
blew it by not including businesses and regional development 
grants in his spending cuts.
<P>
	Under Reform with spending cuts in the first year we would have 
balanced the budget today. Under Reform we would be talking 
about budget surpluses to share with taxpayers, hospitals and

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the budget tabled yesterday by the Minister of Finance is a 
most disappointing one. If there is one underlying theme, it is the 
Liberal vision of a highly centralist federal government, 
encroaching unrestrained onto areas of provincial jurisdiction 
every time it has the chance.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. Yesterday, the 
Minister of Finance had such a wonderful opportunity to 
demonstrate to us his government's real belief in a decentralized 
federalism which respects provincial areas of jurisdiction. Why, 
then, did he prefer to follow his usual pattern, the usual habit of the 
Liberals, and to announce still more overlap, still more duplication, 
still more waste?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
could the Leader of the Opposition tell us which measures in 
yesterday's budget did not please him? Does he believe that the 
federal government ought not to have used the taxation system to 
help the disabled? Does he believe that the federal government 
ought not to have used the taxation system to help those who give 
donations to small charities?
<P>
	Does he believe that the federal government ought not to have 
created a new and greatly enhanced benefit for the poor children in 
Montreal and elsewhere in Quebec? Does he believe that the 
federal government ought not to have bowed to Quebec's demands 
for an infrastructure program?
<P>
	Which programs does the Leader of the Opposition find 
unacceptable for helping Quebecers and Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will tell him what I find unacceptable. It is that his 
government has, over the past two years, cut $4.5 billion from 
transfers to the provinces for social services and education. Today 
he imagines that a few million dollars are going to make us forget 
the $4 billion in past cuts.
<P>
	As for the details, I will get to shortly, but just now I have three 
questions for him. Here is my question for the moment.
<P>
	What we want to find out from the Minister of Finance is how he 
can justify, on the one hand, that he is short of money and therefore 
needs to cut transfer payments to the provinces, when these are 
mainly for health care and education services and, on the other 
hand, he can at the same time justify sprinkling a few million here, 
a few million there, in areas in which he has no jurisdiction at all?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, let 
us look at the facts. In 1997-98, Quebec will receive $10.3 billion, 
31 per cent of federal transfers, which is more than any other 
province. In equalization payments alone, Quebec will receive 
close to $4 billion, 46 per cent of the total payments. From 1993 to 
1998, transfers to Quebec have dropped about 11 per cent. Our own 
cuts exceeded 14 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, the Bloc Quebecois asked us to increase 
assistance to students who need student loans. They asked us to 
increase tax credits for parents who wanted to finance their 
children's education. This we did in yesterday's budget. I am 
waiting for the Bloc Quebecois to congratulate us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if there is anything that characterizes the fundamental 
differences between us, this is it. For the Minister of Finance, for 
Liberals, it is incomprehensible for the federal government to play 
its true role of distributor of the wealth, as they often describe it, 
while at the same time minding its own business.
<P>
	Can the government not respect the areas of jurisdiction set out 
in its own Constitution? That is where the problem lies. How can 
they imagine that they are better placed to look after prenatal 
nutrition? Ottawa will look after prenatal nutrition. Ottawa will 
look after literacy, the disabled, poor children, family policy. These 
are provincial areas of jurisdiction. Can they not grasp that, on the 
other side?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, if 
Ottawa is involved, it is because Quebec asked for it. Where 
assistance to students is concerned, it is the Bloc Quebecois who 
asked us to increase student aid. If we are involved in 
infrastructures, it is because the President of Treasury Board got a 
letter from Bernard Landry asking Ottawa to get involved in the 
infrastructure program in Quebec.
<P>
	If we are in research and development, allow me to point out 
that, in 1993, the Government of Canada funded 22 per cent of 
Quebec R &amp; D activity. Quebec's share was a mere 8 per cent. A 
good thing, then, that we are involved.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> 
Fortunately, Mr. Speaker, because if they were not, Quebec's 
deficit would be down by 60 per cent.
<P>
	The Liberals, who were elected three and a half years ago to the 
shouts of jobs, jobs, jobs, have nothing to offer one million and a 
half unemployed workers in Canada today. Yesterday's budget had 
nothing better to offer than a paltry $25 million in new money for 
job creation measures for the coming year. This is an average of 90 
cents per Canadian.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8308"> 8308 </A></B>
<P>
	My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Now that he has 
given up doing anything about high unemployment, does the 
Prime Minister have anything to offer 1.5 million Quebecers and 
Canadians who are looking for jobs, besides wishing them a 
cynical good luck?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, for three years we have worked very hard on job creation, 
and Canada has created more than 700,000 new jobs, which, I 
repeat, is more than Great Britain, France, Germany and Italy 
combined.
<P>
	I agree the demand is enormous, but we managed to reduce 
unemployment from 11.4 per cent in January 1994 to 9.7 per cent. 
We want to do better, we always do.
<P>
	Today, for instance, Canadians benefit from interest rates that 
have dropped by five percentage points in two years and are now 
two and a half percentage points lower than interest rates in the 
United States. When you look at the Canadian economy, you can 
see the results of this policy, because today, car sales, housing sales 
and construction, and industrial expansion are all benefiting from 
the lowest interest rates we have had in Canada for 35 years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister forgot to add that this year we had a 
record number of bankruptcies in Canada. He forgot to say that.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	My question is this: Why will the Prime Minister not admit that 
he failed on job creation? Why will he not admit that his slogan 
``jobs, jobs, jobs'' was just that, like the other slogan on abolishing 
the GST: ``scrap, scrap, scrap''? He no longer has any credibility.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Once again, 
Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member forgot to ask his question.
<P>
	Let me tell you that in the past four months, we created 85,000 
new jobs in this country in the private sector alone. The vast 
majority of these jobs are permanent. According to most 
economists, this year in Canada we will create between 300,000 
and 350,000 new jobs, and the same number again next year. 
According to most economists, according to the OECD, Canada 
will create more jobs than any other country in the G-7, including 
the United States.
<P>
	Now, about the budget. Let me just quote Gérald Ponton, 
president of the Alliance des manufacturiers et des exportateurs du 
Québec: ``No new taxes: good news for business and the Canadian 
economy. Clearly, when the government uses its fiscal flexibility as 
it did with the infrastructure program and the innovation fund, it is 
setting an example Bernard Landry would do well to follow, which 
he can do without increasing taxes''. That is what this government 
has done.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in yesterday's budget there were a lot of questionable 
statements, but the biggest whopper of them all was the finance 
minister's claim of not raising taxes. Just days before the budget, 
the government raised compulsory Canada pension plan premiums, 
payroll taxes, by 70 per cent.
<P>
	Since the Liberals came to power in 1993, income tax revenues 
have risen by over $15 billion, corporate tax revenues are up by 
almost $7 billion and the hated GST is bringing in almost $2 billion 
more.
<P>
	How can the finance minister possibly claim that he is not 
raising taxes when federal tax revenues have increased by over $24 
billion and the Canada pension payroll tax is being raised by 70 per 
cent?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the fact that the Reform Party has a different set of values than 
most Canadians and the fact that the Reform Party does not believe 
in the Canada pension plan certainly does not give it licence to 
misconstrue what the Canada pension plan is all about and how 
important it is to Canadians.
<P>
	The leader of the Reform Party knows full well that not one 
penny of Canada pension plan premiums comes to government, 
neither to the federal government nor to the provincial 
governments that joined with us. It is invested for the retirement 
savings of Canadians in exactly the same way as with other 
retirement schemes.
<P>
	Just because the Reform Party does not believe in the basic 
institutions of the country, it is no reason to stand up in the House 
and deliberately misconstrue what the heck they are all about.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I wish the hon. Minister of Finance would 
withdraw the words ``deliberately misconstrue''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (LaSalle-Émard):</B> Mr. Speaker, I withdraw the 
words.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the net impression of all that ranting was for the minister 
to be saying that he does not interpret the increase in CPP 
premiums as a payroll tax.
<P>
<B>(1430 )</B>
<P>
	The economic analysis and forecasting division of his own 
department publishes papers-I can give him copies of them-in 
which it describes CPP premiums as a payroll tax. It has computer 
models for running that payroll tax and determining its negative 
impact on job creation when it is increased.
<P>
	Last night, Judith Andrew of the Canadian Federation of 
Independent Business discussed the CPP premium increase as a 
payroll tax. If there is any group in the country that can recognize a 
payroll tax when it sees it, it is the CFIB.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8309"> 8309 </A></B>
<P>
	The only people that do not believe a 70 per cent hike in CPP 
premiums is not a payroll tax increase is the Minister of Finance 
and the gullible gang across the way.
<P>
	I would appreciate a straight answer to my question. Given the 
views of his own department, why will the minister simply not 
admit that CPP premiums are a payroll tax and that he has raised 
them by 70 per cent?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the leader of the Reform Party, in his effort to destroy the Canada 
pension plan, consistently refers to the increase in premiums of the 
pension contribution that would be made.
<P>
	The other day he said that these premiums would go at full 
maturity for a person at the maximum earnings from $945 to 
$1,635.
<P>
	What the hon. member, the leader of the Reform Party, has not 
done is provide Canadians with a calculation of what his alternative 
would cost. Let me do it for him, in case it has slipped his mind.
<P>
	In the agreement with the provinces that amount would go from 
$945 to $1,600. The Reform Party alternative would take it from 
$945 based on the Chilean model, which they have adopted, to 
$2,150.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Reform Party has a plan for preserving both the CPP 
and increasing retirement income for Canadians at a lower cost 
than what the government proposes.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It is not like the MP pension plan either.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> I want to come back, Mr. Speaker, to the ethics of 
this issue.
<P>
	I am sure that the finance minister, as an aspiring Prime 
Minister, realizes the importance of being honest with the Canadian 
people. All I am doing is cautioning the government that it is 
heading down the same road on this CPP premium as it went down 
with the GST. The Liberals have almost convinced themselves that 
a tax is not a tax, just like they convinced themselves that the Prime 
Minister never said he would kill, scrap, abolish the GST.
<P>
	Will the finance minister stop and pause before he gets too 
deeply into this and admit that he has raised payroll taxes by 70 per 
cent, the greatest single tax increase in Canadian history?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am sure that the leader of the third party, as the aspiring leader of 
the fifth party, would like to put his own numbers before Canadians 
so they can make the same judgment.
<P>
	We have stated that contributions to the Canada pension plan are 
not a tax. They are an investment in Canadians' retirement savings.
<P>
	One thing is very clear. The agreement the federal government 
has come to with the Government of Alberta, and I notice that the 
hon. member has not got the courage-Mr. Speaker, I am sure he 
does-the hon. member will go to Alberta and will campaign 
against Ralph Klein because Ralph Klein signed the deal.
<P>
<B>(1435 )</B>
<P>
	I am sure he will go into Ontario and will campaign against Mike 
Harris because Mike Harris signed the deal. I am also sure he will 
explain to Canadians why his alternative will cost $500 more than 
the federal government's changes to the CPP.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Yesterday, the Minister of Finance told us in his budget that the 
deficit for the current fiscal year was $5.3 billion less than his 
target last year, on the same date, in his previous budget. With this 
manoeuvring room, the minister could, among other 
things-because there are a lot of things to do-pay Quebec the $2 
billion it cost to harmonize its sales tax with the GST.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Finance acknowledge that the McKenna 
formula, concocted in secret after the Government of Quebec made 
its requests known, serves simply to justify more unfair treatment 
of Quebec by the federal government?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, if 
the member would look back at the speech I made with the 
announcement, he will see that I set out the formula for 
compensation to the Atlantic provinces, Manitoba and 
Saskatchewan.
<P>
	At the same time, I explained why Quebec, Ontario, British 
Columbia and Alberta would not be receiving compensation. They 
did not lose over 5 per cent of sales tax revenues. The reason is 
quite clear.
<P>
	We are prepared to compensate a province if losses are involved. 
The hon. member will understand that, if no losses are involved, 
there will be no compensation. Quebec has all the information. We 
gave them not only our figures, but the provinces' as well.
<P>
	I am prepared to sit down with the hon. member, as we did with 
the officials of the Quebec ministry of finance, to explain exactly 
how the formula works.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we have a minister of finance in Quebec too. And he 
says harmonization with the GST would have cost Quebec $2 
billion had the corporate tax burden not been increased accordingly 
to compensate. In Ottawa, on the other hand, the Minister of 
Finance says that is not so, that in fact Quebec made money in the 
process.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8310"> 8310 </A></B>
<P>
	If the Minister of Finance thinks Quebec minister Landry is 
lying to the public, would he rise and say so?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
the information in my reply comes from Government of Quebec 
statistics. If the hon. member would care to look at sales tax 
revenues in 1990, 1991 and 1992, he will see that Quebec lost no 
more than 5 per cent of its revenues at the start.
<P>
	He will also see that, in subsequent years, Quebec made money. 
These figures are public.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday the finance minister did a pretty good impression of 
George Bush with his no new taxes line. Unfortunately here are the 
facts.
<P>
	Since the Liberals came to power in 1993, federal tax revenues 
have increased 20 per cent while the average family income has 
decreased by 10 per cent. Liberal years have been good years for 
the finance minister but hard times for Canadian families.
<P>
<B>(1440 )</B>
<P>
	Let me ask the finance minister this. How can he possibly claim 
that there have been no new taxes when the average income of 
Canadian families has dropped by 10 per cent?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there is no doubt that over the course of this government's 
administration our revenues have gone up. Absolutely. They have 
gone up because we have had a stronger economy. Economic 
growth brings higher revenues.
<P>
	If we want to fight the deficit surely to heaven it is better fight 
the deficit by having a stronger economy than by adopting the kind 
of scorched earth policies Reform would advocate which would 
absolutely destroy the economy.
<P>
	The fact of the matter is that overwhelmingly the majority of 
increases in this government's revenues has come from increased 
economic activity primarily in the corporate sector because it is 
making more profits and as a result of those profits we are getting 
more revenue.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
argument here is not over growth, it is just who is going to get the 
benefit from the growth. This government is getting 20 per cent of 
the benefit while the Canadian public and taxpayers are losing10 per cent of it.
<P>
	Since the Liberals came to power in 1993 the average family 
income has dropped by $3,000. I do not think families could be 
convinced that this is growth or that it has been really fun for them.
<P>
	Let me ask the finance minister again how he can possibly claim 
no new taxes when the average family  income has dropped by 
$3,000 per year and its Canadian pension plan payroll taxes have 
been hiked 70 per cent. How does it work?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there have been in certain areas increases in taxes, increases in tax 
revenues. The Reform Party has opposed these. The Reform Party 
has gone on the web and said ``these are the tax increases brought 
in by the federal government that we oppose''.
<P>
	The Reform Party opposed the elimination of the tax advantages 
for family trusts. It opposed the elimination of the preferential rate 
for large corporations. It opposed the measures that were taken to 
combat the underground economy. It opposed the elimination of 
the $100,000 lifetime capital gains tax exemption.
<P>
	These are the tax increases Reformers opposed because they hurt 
their friends. Heaven help them if they had to help poor or middle 
income Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question os for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Yesterday's budget epitomized this Liberal government's 
inaction in the area of taxation. Three and a half years after taking 
office, the Minister of Finance has made no major changes; he has 
no real tax reform to propose to the people of Canada. Taxation is a 
powerful tool available to the Minister of Finance to achieve social 
or economic objectives.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Finance explain that, despite a golden 
opportunity to create jobs through taxation, nowhere in his budget 
did he use either personal or corporate taxes to do so?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Quite the 
contrary, Mr. Speaker. In yesterday's budget, we presented highly 
targeted tax breaks amounting to more than $2 billion over a three 
year period specifically for persons with disabilities as well as 
substantial breaks for students or parents who want to save for their 
children's education. There is also the child tax benefit.
<P>
	The vast majority of measures contained in yesterday's budget 
were precisely tax measures, tax breaks designed to help 
Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, last 
November, the Bloc Quebecois released a corporate tax analysis, 
which clearly showed that up to $3 billion could be recovered and 
recommended this amount be invested in job creation incentives.
<P>
	How does the minister justify not having done his homework in 
that area, in spite of this recommendation?
<P>
<B>(1445)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
was done long before the Bloc's report was tabled. I could quote, 
for example, from previous  budgets, measures like the abolition of 
the lifetime $100,000 capital gains exemption, the broadening of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8311"> 8311 </A></B>
<P>
the minimum replacement tax base or the elimination of the tax 
advantages offered by the use of trusts.
<P>
	As I said the last time, the list goes on-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> For three pages.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (LaSalle-Émard):</B> That is right, I tabled it myself. I 
submit that the hon. member should ask the Table for the three 
pages I mentioned.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the 
last election, the government campaigned on the issue of jobs, jobs, 
jobs.
<P>
	In the budget yesterday there was not a word about jobs. There 
was nothing for jobless Canadians. There was just 80 minutes of 
self-congratulations.
<P>
	The finance minister did not even mention the 9.7 per cent 
unemployment rate, the 1.5 million unemployed, the one in four 
people underemployed or who are worried about losing their jobs.
<P>
	When will the finance minister come down from his mansion on 
the hill and realize that by relentlessly driving up taxes he is killing 
jobs in this country?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
what was done in yesterday's budget was to very clearly outline a 
comprehensive jobs program.
<P>
	First of all, we started out with the absolute necessity of cleaning 
up the nation's finances. Our interest rates have gone from two and 
a quarter percentage points higher than the United States' to where 
they are now, two and a quarter to a half percentage points lower 
than the United States'.
<P>
	This is as a result of the actions of this government. That is why 
people are now saying that Canada will have the strongest job 
creation record of any of the G-7 countries.
<P>
	Second, we put in place a short term program, infrastructure, 
roads, sewer mains and highways in order to create instantaneous 
jobs. More money went into the tourism sector because it is a 
massive creator of jobs.
<P>
	The Prime Minister's missions abroad have led to the highest 
level of exports in this country's history. We have put in place a 
long term job program, helping students finance their education, a 
very large research and development program for Canadian 
universities.
<P>
	This government has put in place a comprehensive job program 
and it is paying off.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if there 
is job creation in this country, that is news to the 1.5 million people 
who are still unemployed, the same number as when the 
government came to power.
<P>
	The last Tory government and the present Liberal government 
have left this country with a legacy of joblessness that has not been 
paralleled since the Great Depression. Seventy-six months in a row 
of unemployment over 9 per cent is a disgraceful record and the 
minister should be ashamed.
<P>
	The Liberals have broken their promise to create jobs. When will 
the minister realize that high taxes are killing jobs in this country?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is expected that when an hon. member rises in this House the 
premise of their question will reflect the policies of their party.
<P>
	The Reform Party seems to have forgotten this fundamental 
piece of legislative responsibility. Therefore let me simply say that 
since we have taken office, as the Prime Minister has said, there 
have been over 790,000 jobs created in the private sector.
<P>
	Is that enough jobs? Of course it is not. Are we worried about job 
creation? Do we want to see more young Canadians go back to 
work? Absolutely.
<P>
	However, let us understand what the alternative was. In 1993 in 
Penticton the leader of the Reform Party said that if they were 
elected and their economic plan, their scorch and burn policies, 
were put into effect, that at the end of three years there would be 
fewer jobs in Canada than there were in 1993.
<P>
	We are 800,000 jobs ahead of the Reform Party.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	The minister announced that $150 million would be provided 
over a three year period to support provinces that will implement 
new initiatives, such as home care and pharmacare programs. The 
fact is that such initiatives have already been taken in Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1450)</B>
<P>
	Is the minister going to do what he did with the GST and tell 
Quebec that, since it has already implemented such reforms, it will 
not get one penny? Is he going to do that again?

<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am surprised both at the tone and the substance of the hon.

provide moneys for citizens who reside in the province of Quebec 
who would be interested in participating in a national home care 
program or in a program for national pharmacare, thereby 
extending medicare.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think 
the minister did not understand the question.
<P>
	This is despicable. The minister is putting $300 million into 
health, which does not even come under his jurisdiction, after 
reducing by $2.3 billion, in the last two years, transfer payments to 
the provinces for health.
<P>
	How can the minister expect to be taken seriously by the public 
when he is giving a measly $300 million with one hand, after 
cutting billions with the other hand in the last three years?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member should know that the Minister of Finance, not in 
this budget but in the last budget, provided to the provinces 
something which they had been asking for for quite some time, the 
stabilization of transfer payments.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance clearly did that and for this fiscal year 
we will be providing both cash and tax points totalling $26.9 
billion.
<P>
	The hon. member should remember that as a result of this 
government's policies as they relate to interest rates they will save 
the provinces $1.8 billion. Equally so, under the auspices of 
equalization, the provinces will now receive $8.6 billion in this 
fiscal year. That is a hell of a lot of money for the purposes of 
health care and other social programs.

	<B>Mr. Benoît Serré (Timiskaming-French River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the President of the Treasury Board.
<P>
	Reformers and others have been complaining that bilingual 
labelling and packaging adds millions of dollars to the cost of 
doing business in Canada. Could the minister tell the House the real 
cost of doing business in the two official languages of this country 
and the benefits to Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
study that was done by the commissioner indicated quite clearly 
that the advantages are much larger than the cost. In fact, even the 
enterprises themselves indicate that the cost is very small and is 
well worth the advantages.
<P>
	In his study on the costs of bilingual packaging and labelling to 
small and medium size businesses, the Commissioner of Official 
Languages found that the  average cost of compliance with federal 
laws and regulations is one-fifth of one cent per dollar of product 
revenue.
<P>
	So those who scream against it are completely unjustified. The 
firms themselves find it is necessary because there are health, 
safety and security advantages to it and because the cost, once 
again, is one-fifth of one cent per dollar of revenue.

	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, to use one of the finance minister's favourite phrases, let 
me simply say that this is the Liberal record that he is so proud of: 
1.5 million Canadians unemployed, one in four Canadians worried 
about losing their jobs, $7 billion slashed from health care and 
education, a $28 billion federal tax grab, and Canadians have 
$3,000 less to spend in disposable income.
<P>
	Why does the finance minister not come clean and admit that 
Canadians today are far worse off than when the Liberals came to 
power in 1993 because of their tax, tax, tax policies?
<P>
<B>(1455 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
heaven forbid I should speak for the government. Simply let me 
quote David Crane, one of the more astute commentators on the 
political scene, referring to the budget. He said the budget can 
almost be called an investment budget that focuses almost entirely 
on people, making sure that children get early support to be good 
learners when they start school; providing more money for parents 
to raise healthy children; giving more deductions to post-secondary 
students and boosting innovation in the universities and industry.
<P>
	That is what a non-partisan and objective commentator has to 
say about this budget.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, that commentator has a Liberal membership. There is no 
doubt about that.
<P>
	The simple truth is, and the finance minister should know this, 
taxes, payroll taxes, kill jobs in this country. Unemployment is at a 
record level in this country and he has offered no tax relieve to take 
care of that. Only last Friday he imposed yet another $10 billion tax 
grab on hard working Canadians.

$10 billion CPP tax grab is going to help Canadians keep their jobs,

Does he not know the simple truth by now that taxes kill jobs in this 
country?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Tim O'Neil, chief economist, the Bank of  Montreal, is forecasting 
well over 300,000 new jobs this year. Maureen Farrow from 
Loewen, Ondaatje, McCutcheon Limited international investors 
whom I talk to every day is looking at Canada as if it had sort of 
risen from the ashes. It is fascinating because it is the deficit, the 
debt and the current accounts, the contained inflation environment, 
the overall competitiveness, the restructuring of the export centre. 
We have gained enormous market shares across the board in export 
markets, particularly in the Asian markets, including Japan.
<P>
	The hon. member talks about people who have Liberal cards. 
This from Deutsche Bank: ``The Canadian economy has enjoyed 
massive monetary stimulus. We expect GDP growth to be more 
than doubled to 4.1 per cent this year, more than 1 per cent in 
excess of the United States, nearly two times greater than the 
average of the G-7. The longer term prospects beyond 1997 are 
favourable''.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, it is a tragedy that you are going to cut me off.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is to the Minister of Finance who, we will all remember, four years 
ago stood in his place and said that jobs were a priority when 1.5 
million Canadians were out of work. This afternoon 1.5 million 
Canadians are still out of work; youth employment is at 70 per 
cent; bankruptcies are at an historic high; 1.5 million children live 
in poverty because their parents live in poverty. I could go on.
<P>
	Would the Minister of Finance admit that this budget gives no 
hope to those who are unemployed or underemployed and that the 
only jobs he is creating are con jobs and snow jobs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member, who sat in this House with a lot of us under the 
previous government, knows full well the economic situation in 
Canada when we took office in 1993. There was no hope. Taxes 
were going up. Interest rates were going up. Job creation was 
virtually a thing of the past.
<P>
	I know he will understand, being a fair person, that looking at 
Canada today the fact is not only have we created over 700,000 
jobs, not only are we being touted as doing better than any other 
OECD country, but our interest rates are down, our companies are 
exporting, consumer confidence is up. The foundation is there.
<P>
	Now, are we satisfied? Absolutely not. Is there pain and 
suffering out there? Yes, there is. I know the hon. member, unlike 
those around him, understands and shares that feeling, as do we. 
We are going to continue to work on this because government is 
about people. It is about providing them with the sustenance they 
require and we will continue to do as we have done.

	<B>The Speaker:</B> Dear colleagues, we are honoured today to 
welcome a group of eminent Canadians to this House. Their 
achievements have earned them a place in the Canadian Medical 
Hall of Fame.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	These individuals have made outstanding contributions to 
medical science. Excellence in advanced research and scientific 
discovery have earned them a place in the Canadian Medical Hall 
of Fame located in London, Ontario. Their achievements are a 
source of pride for all of us.
<P>
	I will ask them to stand as I call their names and I would ask you 
to withhold your applause until I have introduced all of them: Dr. 
Henry Barnett of London, Dr. Harold Copp of Vancouver, Dr. 
Herbert Jasper of Montreal and Dr. Robert Salter of Toronto.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I invite you to join me in Room 216 after question 
period. I would like you to meet these distinguished Canadians at a 
small reception. If you have time you are cordially invited.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="BUDGETSECRECY">BUDGET SECRECY</A></H4>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I have notice of a point of order from the member 
for York South-Weston.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I rise on a point of order with respect to the practice of budget 
secrecy. The delivery of yesterday's budget represents a marked 
departure from the practice that has been followed in the House for 
many years, certainly since I was elected to Parliament.
<P>
	Many of the provisions in the budget were announced by the 
government in advance of the minister's speech yesterday. 
Moreover, it has been the practice over the years that the budget 
documents themselves not be released until the minister rises to his 
feet in the House.
<P>
	Yesterday the budget documents were available approximately 
15 minutes before the minister rose to his feet. People had the 
opportunity to obtain the documents and to release them.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I ask that you review this matter because it is an 
important principle. The reason we have budget secrecy is to 
ensure that no individual or groups of individuals are able to profit 
from advance information they might obtain concerning an 
upcoming budget.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8314"> 8314 </A></B>
<P>
	In the past, finance ministers have been forced to resign where 
a budget leak has occurred because of the sanctity of the principle. 
I submit also it impinges on the privileges of members of the 
House when information is released prematurely. The reason why 
the budget was released at 4.30 p.m. yesterday is because the stock 
markets had closed.
<P>
<B>(1505)</B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I would like you to review this matter. I would also 
like you to review the whole concept of the budget lock-up. I and a 
number of other people found it disconcerting that the media were 
reporting what was in the budget before the Minister of Finance 
had finished reading his speech.
<P>
	Surely the lock-up should be extended until after the Minister of 
Finance has completed his speech to the House so that all 
Canadians have equal opportunity concerning the release of the 
information. It is patently unfair to the minister and to the House 
that the media should be reporting the contents of the budget before 
he is finished his speech.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with interest to what my hon. colleague suggests is a 
question of privilege. It would be my submission to you, Mr. 
Speaker, that it is not a question of privilege.
<P>
	It is no secret that the government, since coming to office, has 
attempted to demystify budget making. Out of respect for the 
traditions of budget making, it is important to remember that we 
campaigned based on the fact that we felt this was important to 
Canadians and to all members of the House. The Standing 
Committee on Finance has travelled the country and continues to 
travel the country on prebudget consultations.
<P>
	The principle behind budget secrecy is to ensure that no 
individual profits from information gained before the budget is 
read. I submit there has been no opportunity for private gain. In 
fact, to specifically deal with my hon. colleague's second point, the 
documents to which he alludes were on the desks of members of 
Parliament. No member of the public had those documents.
<P>
	Since the Minister of Finance is coming into the House of 
Commons to speak to members of Parliament, I submit that it 
would be impossible for there to have been a breach of security, a 
release or disclosure of pertinent information, as my hon. colleague 
has suggested.
<P>
	The stock markets were closed at the time of the deposit of these 
materials. There was no opportunity for any member of the public 
to take any advantage. As members, we are honourable members. 
The materials were placed quite properly on our desks as the 
Minister of Finance was about to speak.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have 
listened to the arguments put forward by the member for York 
South-Weston and from the government side. I think that the 
arguments put forward by the government side were very weak. I 
am more inclined to listen to the first speech.
<P>
	I have one point I would like to make. The government member 
said the stock markets were closed. That is a typical centrist 
Canadian attitude. The stock market in Alberta was wide open at 
the time the minister stood up. The stock market in British 
Columbia was wide open at the time the minister stood up.
<P>
<B>(1510 )</B>
<P>
	It is time these people started to recognize that Canada does not 
end at the lakes. There are millions of people on the prairies and in 
B.C. who deserve the same courtesy and attention as the rest of 
Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is 
just one small point I would draw to your attention. I think you 
would find that the members of Parliament who were in the lock-up 
that was allowed by the Department of Finance were not allowed 
out of the lock-up until the minister stood up.
<P>
	In the converse, the members of Parliament who were not in the 
lock-up, who are all honourable people and I am sure all had 
honourable intentions, nonetheless had the details of the budget 
prior to the time the minister stood up. I cannot imagine that 
anyone would have abused that privilege but it is possible that 
telephone calls could have been made from the lobby.
<P>
	If members of Parliament are in the lock-up and are not 
permitted out, there has to be a good reason for it. Why then were 
the members of Parliament in the House given copies of the budget 
prior to the minister standing up?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the first point I would make is that 
this is certainly not a matter of privilege.
<P>
	The second point is that I would not question the behaviour of 
any member of the House. I recall being in the Chamber just before 
the minister rose to speak. All members on all sides of the House 
were receiving documents as the minister arrived. Some were 
flipping through those documents. All members of the House were 
treated alike. The documents were here within the safety and 
security, if you will, of this Chamber with no prospect whatsoever 
of any kind of opportunity for anyone to profit from it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunziata:</B> Mr. Speaker, the fact is the budget documents 
were available in the lobby. There were people in the lobby who are 
not members of Parliament. I had two people with me who were not 
<P>

<B><A NAME="8315"> 8315 </A></B>
<P>
members of Parliament and who had the budget document15 minutes before the minister started speaking.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I want to inform myself about the precedents. I 
understood this is being brought up as a point of order, not a point 
of privilege. Is that correct? I address myself to the hon. member 
for York South-Weston.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunziata:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think it would be more 
appropriately phrased as a point of privilege than a point of order.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I will deal with everything that has been said in 
the context of a point of privilege.
<P>
	I want to inform myself about the precedents. I want to inform 
myself about what went on yesterday. After I have informed 
myself, I will get back to the House and I will share with you what 
my findings are.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Is this a different point of order?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> On the same point, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> As far as this point is concerned, I feel that I have 
heard enough. You are no doubt going to quote me something from 
the rules that we work by. I will familiarize myself with all of the 
rules that are involved.

	<B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have the honour 
to present, in both official languages, the report of the Canadian 
delegation to the fifth annual meeting of the Asia-Pacific 
Parliamentary Forum which was held in Vancouver, British 
Columbia from January 7 to January 10 of this year.
<P>
<B>(1515 )</B>
<P>
	The meeting was hosted by the Parliament of Canada and I can 
proudly report that it was highly successful and productive.
<P>
	Parliamentarians from 21 Asia-Pacific nations met to discuss 
important regional and global issues. Twenty-one separate 
resolutions were adopted dealing with such  matters as terrorism, 
drug trafficking, land mines and the environment. The Canadian 
delegation was most instrumental in proposing and having adopted 
important resolutions on education and literacy, on human rights, 
including the exploitation of children and women.
<P>
	In conclusion, I want to draw the House's attention to the fact 
that the right hon. Prime Minister addressed the delegates at the 
opening plenary session. He spoke of the importance of the APPF 
and how parliamentarians are an essential part of the decision 
making process and should play an active role in international 
relations.

	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.)</B> moved 
for leave to introduce Bill C-372, an act to amend the Criminal 
Code (protection of child before birth).
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, our nation today has an epidemic of 
children who are born with fetal alcohol syndrome which is the 
result of the mother consuming substances that are deliberately and 
permanently injurious to the fetus.
<P>
	In response to that I am introducing a controversial private 
member's bill. It would enable the courts to impose on the mother 
who is knowingly consuming substances injurious to the growth of 
the fetus. The courts would be able to have the individual confined 
to a hospital or another suitable facility where her access to 
injurious substances could be controlled for as long as the court 
deemed fit. This would ensure the protection of fetuses for nobody 
is speaking for their protection today.

	The House resumed from February 18, 1997, consideration of 
the motion that this House approve in general the budgetary policy 
of the government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to once again speak on behalf of my party 
regarding the fourth budget tabled by the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Yesterday, immediately after the presentation of this election 
minded and self-serving budget, I had an opportunity to give the 
official opposition's initial reaction.
<P>
	We took a more thorough look at the budget last night. As you 
know, the official opposition works very hard. We are not lazy 
people.
<P>
	However, when we look-and this will be the first part of my 
presentation-at the evolution of public finances over the last three 
years, and when we look at the track record of the Minister of 
Finance, we have no choice but to say that the minister is lazy. 
Why?
<P>
	I now get to the first part of the presentation. Some may look at 
how public finances have evolved and think the Minister of 
Finance is an extraordinary manager. However, we can say, based 
on an assessment of his track record, that his reputation is 
overrated. Why? Because if we consider budgetary revenues from 
1993 until today and what federal spending has been since the 
Liberals came to power, since the Minister of Finance has been the 
head of the Department of Finance, we see that if the minister had 
sat around twiddling his thumbs, the result would have been 
exactly the same as far as reducing the deficit is concerned. We 
could have put Youppi, the Expos' mascot, in his place, or Alcide, 
the mascot of the Granby Zoo, as suggested by the hon. member for 
Shefford, and the result would have been the same.
<P>
	Why? Simply because the Minister of Finance was able to take 
advantage of an extraordinary rate of economic growth, that 
unfortunately is not reflected in job creation because of the 
minister's inertia, but that increased the federal government's tax 
revenues by $22 billion. Where did our wonderful manager of 
public moneys, our national mascot get those $22 billion? Not just 
anywhere. He got them from individual taxpayers, from middle 
income people whom he continued to bleed dry, exactly like the 
previous government, by maintaining high taxes, income tax and 
even premiums, including those for the unemployment insurance 
fund which generate a surplus of $5 billion annually. He generated 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8319"> 8319 </A></B>
<P>
$22 billion in new  revenue. It is easy to reduce the deficit with this 
kind of increase in tax revenue.
<P>
	There is another very important item on the books of the 
Minister of Finance. He never dwells on his past achievements. He 
only talks about the present and the hoopla around his budget, but 
we should look at what he did before: he cut government spending 
by $14 billion. Where did he make those cuts? We should take 
those $14 billion and find out exactly where he cut most vigorously 
and effectively as a good public administrator.
<P>
	Well, we see that more than 50 per cent, or to be more exact,52.1 per cent of those $14 billion in spending cuts over the past 
three years, when we look at the revised figures the Minister of 
Finance gave us yesterday, is the result of cuts made in transfers to 
the provinces. It is easy to be in debt: if I have debts, I will let my 
neighbour pay. Now that is good management. And that is what the 
Minister of Finance did. Since he became head of the Department 
of Finance, 52.1 per cent of the $14 billion that was cut was the 
result of cuts in transfer payments to the provinces. Meanwhile, he 
walks around saying: I am a good manager, but in Quebec, they are 
not, they cut all over the place and they downsize.
<P>
	Of course, our Minister of Finance is too lazy to do the job 
himself and lets others do the work for him, while he goes around 
with a big smile, making theatrical gestures and exuding charm, as 
some people said, but he is the worst public administrator the 
federal government has ever known, because he lets others do the 
dirty work. Fifty-two per cent from downloading onto the 
provinces. It is easy to be a good manager.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	The proportion of operating expenses in this $14 billion is 20 per 
cent. Twenty per cent of $14 billion comes under his control as 
manager and represents cuts in government operations. It is a small 
amount compared to the 52 per cent he left up to the provincial 
governments. And included in this figure is the despicable cut of 
$4.5 billion in social programs and in transfers to the provinces to 
cover post-secondary education, health and social welfare.
<P>
	Actually, in the past three and a half years, the Minister of 
Finance has managed to reduce government operating expenses by 
only 6 per cent. I think people understand now that the reputation 
of the Minister of Finance is overblown and that he sitting there 
like an overpaid manager. He is sitting there watching events 
saying: ``I am not going to do anything, because if I do, I might 
make a mistake''. Every time the government rose to propose 
things, it made mistakes too.
<P>
	We need only think of the promises on the GST and the promises 
of $720 million for the daycare system. We need only think of the 
bad decisions made in the implementation of employment 
insurance, which will, and I will come back to this, marginalize a 
whole lot of  workers, who will be so discouraged by the eligibility 
criteria that they will simply withdraw from the labour market and 
swell the ranks of welfare recipients and be in the pay of the 
provinces.
<P>
	From this alone, we can see that the government had only one 
thing in mind: to keep the system, maintain the unwarranted 
advantages of wealthy Canadian families-and we will have an 
opportunity to return to this shortly when we talk about the revision 
of the tax system-and continue to bleed middle income earners 
and the unemployed, as it has done since the start of its mandate.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance has wasted an excellent opportunity to 
leave his true mark, not the false image of a good administrator 
who has reduced the deficit, the only one in Canada's recent history 
to have kept his promises. In the kind of economic situation that 
this minister has enjoyed, Michael Wilson, Don Mazankowski and 
John Crosbie could have done much better than he did.
<P>
	He has lost an excellent opportunity. Why? Because he could 
have taken advantage of the relatively good economic situation to 
do the things we are entitled to expect from a true administrator of 
public finances.
<P>
	First of all, he could have brought in tax reform. Our tax system 
has not been changed in 30 years. We have said this many times. 
We even made it one of our campaign commitments, just as the 
Liberals did. That is another red book promise that has not been 
kept. They talked about making our tax system more efficient, 
more in line with the reality of the 1990s and the next decade and 
more fair and equitable for all taxpayers, but they have not done it.
<P>
	In the three and a half years he has been at the helm of the 
finance department, the Minister of Finance has lost an excellent 
opportunity to reform our tax system.
<P>
	Last year, we did the job our lazy minister should have done. We 
formed a small task force. We sought advice from experts across 
Quebec and across Canada; we even used the briefs that were 
submitted at numerous meetings of the finance committee where 
tax experts were invited to talk about corporate and personal taxes.
<P>
	Last year, with our small team from the official opposition, and 
with the full support of my colleagues, who were good enough to 
make suggestions for the reform of corporate taxation, we tabled a 
substantial, almost exhaustive analysis of all major tax 
expenditures that applied to Canadian businesses.
<P>
	For the benefit of taxpayers in Quebec and in Canada, tax 
expenditures are all the exemptions, everything in tax legislation 
that applies to corporations, as well as to individuals-in this case I 
am talking about corporations-everything that lowers the taxes 
paid by corporations.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8320"> 8320 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	We reviewed twenty or so of these tax expenditures and found 
that things had changed in the last 30 years. Some small 
improvements, some cosmetic changes, had been made but, 
overall, things had been terribly neglected and a number of unfair 
advantages to large corporations for which there was no longer any 
justification had been left intact. And they continued on this 
course. Three and a half years of the Liberals in power, three and a 
half years of our super tough manager, our mascot, the Minister of 
Finance, and not a line written about the reform of corporate 
taxation.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois' analysis showed how, through tightening 
the rules and abolishing outmoded tax expenditures, $3 billion 
could be saved, and we suggested to the Minister of Finance that he 
take this $3 billion and plow it back into the corporate tax system in 
order to support SMBs in their job creation efforts. People are 
looking for jobs, and the Liberals are telling us that jobs are their 
priority.
<P>
	I recall that, when we tabled this report, the Minister of Finance 
rose to his feet and congratulated the Bloc Quebecois. Even the 
newspapers reported that the Minister of Finance had congratulated 
us on corporate taxation. But that was as far as it went. He 
congratulated us. We were very flattered, very pleased. My 
colleagues and I in the Bloc Quebecois were very pleased to be 
congratulated, but that was not why we did what we did. It was not 
so he could take this report and shelve it, like other reports by royal 
commissions of inquiry have been shelved by the federal 
government over the last 25 years.
<P>
	We offered him these detailed, documented, very simple but 
highly logical suggestions so that he would do something, so that 
he would stop sitting back and watching the world go by, so that he 
would stop going with the flow and doing nothing to improve the 
tax system.
<P>
	He did nothing. That would have been easy. We made a very 
simple suggestion in this report, which we repeated in our report on 
personal income tax published more than two weeks ago: we asked 
the minister to eliminate a tax provision that applies to 
corporations and wealthy Canadian families, and consists in taxing 
only75 per cent of capital gains. For instance, only 75 per cent of the 
value of equity holdings owned by a corporation or an individual 
would be taxable.
<P>
	When a worker earns $300, the entire $300 is taxable, not just75 per cent. But the rich, wealthy Canadian families, the same ones 
who take advantage of almost perpetual tax referrals connected 
with family trusts and who transfer money abroad without paying 
income tax, the very same people who go around with powerful 
lobbyists, go to see the minister and say: ``You must not touch 
that''. Once again, the lobby of wealthy Canadian families has 
won.
<P>
	I must say that when we look at the government team and the 
Prime Minister's office as well, we can see that the lobby of 
wealthy Canadian families is very close to the government. I think 
that explains much of this government's inertia. They were elected 
to preserve all these advantages, because the minute the 
government does anything about these tax provisions and revises 
the system as we suggested, to be fair to businesses that do pay 
taxes, especially small businesses, these undue advantages that 
accrue to the friends of the Prime Minister and the Minister of 
Finance will disappear.
<P>
	I get the impression that is largely why the Minister of Finance 
has been so slow to act and did not write a single word about 
corporate tax reform. For the past year, and actually I am proud of 
this, the Minister of Finance has been waving three pages at us: 
``Look, I have three pages of measures with which I eliminated tax 
loopholes, three whole pages''.
<P>
	A week and a half ago we wisely asked the Minister of Finance 
to table the document he had been waving around for a whole year 
in this House.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	We were right to do so, because it allowed us to analyze each of 
the measures the Minister of Finance claimed eliminated tax 
loopholes. He would rise and list them endlessly. Sometimes we 
did not quite understand. From this document we can see why we 
did not quite understand. Of all the measures listed on these three 
pages, only one quarter actually serve to eliminate tax loopholes.
<P>
	Three quarters of the measures he waved in our face every 
question period each time we asked him about corporate and 
individual tax loopholes are erroneous, do not make sense, were 
never carried out, have nothing to do with loopholes or are 
duplicates. The repetitions go on for three pages. As if we could not 
figure out that they repeated the same measures two or three times 
over the three pages so they would appear to look like more, rather 
than the meagre showing they were compared to the 400 pages we 
gave him on corporate and individual taxes.
<P>
	Really, this takes the cake. This is not being a little partisan or 
election oriented; this is electioneering in spades, despite an 
important responsibility to Quebec and Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	Since he came to this House, the Minister of Finance has been 
and is still hiding behind a smoke screen. He claimed he had done 
great things to deal with tax loopholes, but judging by what he 
presented, it does not seem to amount to much.
<P>
	With regard to personal income tax, it would have been so easy 
for the minister and his team-I suppose it must be impressive, at 
least in terms of numbers and volume; I believe its total weight 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8321"> 8321 </A></B>
<P>
must be around several million pounds. There are many brainy 
people at the  finance department, they are all over the place, at the 
revenue department as well, experts who advise the Minister of 
Finance and who could have conducted in-depth analysis, far better 
than what we presented, with regard to the reform of the personal 
and corporate tax systems. Why was it not done? Why is it that in 
the last budget, as in the previous three, there was no measure to 
make personal taxes more equitable?
<P>
	Another red book broken promise. In the red book, they talked 
about tax fairness, tax equity. You can go and see for yourself. They 
have been quoting it less often lately, perhaps because of the 
election, they know we are going to annotate it and rub their noses 
in it. Again, they said the tax system should be made fairer and 
more equitable, one more empty promise. Nothing, a big zero, is 
what they have done to change the personal income tax system.
<P>
	Two weeks ago we presented a report suggesting a few possible 
measures. We were not asking the finance minister to implement 
them immediately in his budget. However, he could have 
announced that he was contemplating a reform of personal income 
tax for next year, or some mechanism to improve the equity and 
justice of the system. But no, this would have been too much to 
expect from the Minister of Fiance. He is used to sitting back and 
letting things happen. So he did nothing in these areas.
<P>
	For example, if he had wanted to reduce poverty for families, 
and particularly single parent families with children, he could have 
replaced the income tax deductions for child care expenses, as 
provided in the Income Tax Act, with a refundable child tax credit, 
just as we had suggested.
<P>
	He could have implemented measures so that even the single 
parent families without any taxable income on their return would 
have benefited from the refundable part of the credit. We have 
estimated that families, depending on their income and the number 
of children, would have saved an additional $600 to $1,000. The 
minister could have done that. But no, he did nothing of the sort.
<P>
	In order to focus taxation on job creation, he could have adopted 
our suggestion and implemented a job creating RRSP similar to the 
home ownership RRSP. Like the people participating in the home 
buyers' plan, people could have withdrawn $25,000 out of their 
RRSP to start up a new business.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	Last year, more than 60 per cent of new jobs were self-created, 
that is to say people created their own jobs. That is the way of the 
future. People are being told over and over again that it is the way 
of the future and that is the goal they should pursue. However, no 
government is willing to give them a hand. Yet, this is a new reality 
of the labour market that should be acknowledged, and the  tax 
system should be adjusted accordingly. But there is nothing in the 
finance minister's budget in this regard.
<P>
	We are not creating enough jobs and he is sorry for it. Here is an 
official in charge of managing public finances, making sure that the 
economy is sound and the labour market more productive, and he 
apologizes, like the Prime Minister. No, the Prime Minister does 
not apologize, because he never admitted that he can make 
mistakes. The Minister of Finance apologizes by saying: ``We 
could do better, but we did not''. Yes, he could have done better, 
much better.
<P>
	For example, he could have restored the $5,000 ceiling on 
contributions to labour-sponsored investment funds, like the FTQ 
and CSN funds in Quebec and others in the rest of Canada, as we 
suggested. Last year, he reduced the ceiling to $3,500. He says that 
he is working to create jobs, but he is cutting off funding for one of 
the best job-creating vehicles in Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	There again, they are short of ideas, they are short of means. I 
have a feeling that they lost their drive. Instead, they would rather 
wait until they have won another election to play dirty tricks once 
again, as they have been doing for the last three and a half years, 
and they will be at it again. This is the Liberal establishment: they 
continue to maintain undue advantages for rich families and rich 
corporations. This is the Liberal Party of Canada.
<P>
	I would like to remind the House of one thing that became 
obvious to me when the analysis of corporate taxation was done. It 
is always under Liberal governments, the previous ones and this 
one, that tax deferrals by big corporations have consistently 
increased. Every time the Liberals have been in office, all of a 
sudden, there has been an increase in the number of tax loopholes 
and tax deferrals by big businesses, for a total of $36 billion until 
now.
<P>
	The finance minister also did not think that this issue should be 
examined and that-for big corporations that will never pay a 
penny in taxes, because for them it is not a deferred tax but a 
scrapped tax-a mechanism should be put in place to get, like in 
the United States, at least a small minimum, <I>minimorum</I> as we say 
in Latin, the smallest minimum in taxes.
<P>
	Once again, the finance minister has nothing to his credit. I find 
this is quite a bad way of completing a first mandate as finance 
minister. I think Canadians are starting to understand the game 
played by the finance minister and are starting-and we will see 
thisduring the election campaign-to question the ability and 
honesty of some of the people on the government side.
<P>
	The finance minister, if he had been hard working, if he had been 
the kind of beaver that he says he represents, because it is Canada's 
emblem, could have taken advantage of exceptional circumstances 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8322"> 8322 </A></B>
<P>
in terms of tax  revenues, as I was mentioning earlier, and in terms 
of people's expectations.
<P>
	Yesterday, the finance minister in his budget speech painted 
quite a picture when he talked about deficit forecasts for this year 
and next year. Our initial analysis of his statements is as follows: in 
the past-since the past is the key to the future-the finance 
minister has always somewhat underestimated his performance, so 
that six months later, the first actual figures are spectacular, 
exceeding forecasts by 30 per cent, and have a major political 
impact. This is all he thinks about. He gets up in the morning and 
only thinks about the way of looking like the best manager of the 
government. In fact, the finance minister is a comedian, a real 
comedian.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	He tells us: ``I must be careful. I cannot put in too much. I can 
allocate no more than so many millions-a pittance, crumbs here 
and there-to the fight against poverty''. The fact of the matter is 
that the Minister of Finance is hiding the truth from the public. The 
fiscal flexibility he will benefit from, not because of his managerial 
skills-as I said earlier, Youppi and Alcide would have done 
better-but simply because of the economic situation, could total 
between $8 billion and $10 billion this year and the next.
<P>
	What is this flexibility? It is the difference between last year's 
deficit forecasts for this year and next year and the actual results 
achieved because of the economic circumstances.
<P>
	Even if he took $8 billion from his deficit reduction target, 
thanks to the economic situation, he could still achieve a zero 
deficit by the year 2000-achieving a zero deficit by the year 2000 
is no small feat; the financial marketplace would be delighted to 
hear that-but he is not yet committed to a zero deficit by the year 
2000. The Government of Quebec, on the other hand, made that 
commitment long before he did. Achieving a zero deficit by the 
year 2000 would be possible if he took the $8 billion or more at his 
disposal, and applied it to something else than deficit reduction.
<P>
	The federal deficit could be eliminated by the year 2000 by 
allocating $8 billion to various other things, to alleviate the job 
crisis, to fight growing poverty, and so on. The Minister of Finance 
did not tell us that yesterday; he was silent on this issue. Do you 
know why? It will be very simple for him. Let me predict what will 
happen during the election campaign. Let me pretend I am Bernard 
Derome. I would say: At 3.55 p.m. this afternoon, I predict that, 
when the election campaign is in full swing, the Minister of 
Finance will release revised figures on deficit reduction. He will 
say: ``This is wonderful. The Liberal Party of Canada and the 
Minister of Finance-because he really likes to be a 
star-managed to achieve results that greatly exceed all 
expectations, including the minister's own, when he tabled the 
budget''.
<P>
	We know that. One only has to make a simple calculation to see 
where the deficit reduction curve should be in the year 2000, based 
on the budget forecasts made last year by the minister, and to see 
that there is a margin of $8 billion to $10 billion for this year and 
next year.
<P>
	So, there is some leeway with this $8 billion margin. This is a 
great opportunity for a government interested in doing something 
about job creation, about poverty. But the government is passing up 
the opportunity. The government could have added an extra $2.5 
billion to this $8 billion, by committing to reform the personal tax 
system this year. It would have had that extra $2.5 billion by 
eliminating undue benefits for those who earn $150,000 or more, 
while giving back some of the money to low income earners, who 
have been bled dry with a tax burden of $22 billion over the last 
three and a half years. So, this additional $2.5 billion could have 
been added to the $8 billion margin, that is the money available to 
the minister to take some action.
<P>
	To this amount, the minister could have added another $500 
million, and we were hoping to see this in the budget, as stated in 
the document that we tabled last week, by saying yesterday that, 
being the good manager that he claims to be, he was going to fight 
the underground economy. Had he done so, he could have got 
another $500 million.
<P>
	In 1994, Statistics Canada estimated the underground economy 
at $6 billion, so $500 million out of a total of $6 billion is not all 
that much. By trying a little bit harder, the minister could have 
generated those revenues. All things considered, in the first budget 
he tabled in the province of Quebec, Mr. Campeau was able to 
generate a lot of money by using the necessary resources. This 
additional $500 million would have given the minister more 
leeway.
<P>
	In his last report, in the previous one and in the one before that, 
the auditor general kept pointing to $2 billion to $3 billion in 
inefficiencies and waste. Last time, besides that $3 billion, he 
indicated that the federal government is spending $1.2 billion more 
than needed to manage its inventory. That is $1.2 billion too much. 
As a good manager of our public finances, the minister could have 
promised, each and every year, to fight all that waste and try to give 
himself more leeway.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	All in all, this year, if he had been willing to, he could have given 
himself a lot more leeway, in fact between $8 billion and $14 
billion more-that is a lot of money-and still maintain his 
objective of eliminating the deficit by the year 2000. It is very sad 
indeed. He could have told us: ``Look, I can do these two things at 
the same time.'' Instead, he stuck to his fight against the deficit, the 
only thing that matters to him, his only real achievement. He wants 
to show the people that he can not only reach his goal and 
completely eliminate the deficit by the year  2000, but that he can 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8323"> 8323 </A></B>
<P>
also generate surpluses immediately and go for a third election 
campaign and maybe also run for the leadership of the Liberal 
Party of Canada, something he seems to be interested in.
<P>
	He had a margin of $8 billion to $14 billion. What could he have 
done with that? He could have distributed it to his wealthy buddies. 
That would have been his natural reaction. He could have done 
things for all taxpayers in Quebec and Canada. He could have 
helped the real people, the people he claims to serve, the people the 
Bloc Quebecois actually does serve.
<P>
	He could have said: ``I will forget about the $4.5 billion cut in 
the Canada social transfer, the transfer payments to the provinces 
for welfare, post-secondary education and health care. I will give 
back to the provinces the $4.5 billion I took from them in my last 
budget''.
<P>
	Thus, with the established programs and resources in the 
provinces, especially in Quebec, we could have really fought 
poverty. Instead, the minister announced a program that was all 
show and only designed to get votes.
<P>
	Thanks to the leeway he had, he could also have afforded to stop 
doing what he has been doing for the last two years, that is, using at 
least $5 billion of the unemployment insurance fund a year to 
reduce his deficit.
<P>
	I want to digress about the first measure, which is to put $4.5 
billion back into the Canada social transfer to the provinces. 
Yesterday, the minister announced that he would fight child 
poverty with determination. Over the past few months, he has made 
a show of being compassionate toward poor children. He wants us 
to forget that his $4.5 billion cut in social programs is the very 
thing that increased poverty for families, for the parents of poor 
children.
<P>
	He indicates today that there will be a supplementary child 
benefit of $600 million. When you consider only that, it is fine. But 
do not forget that the cuts amounted to $4.5 billion and that the 
$600 million will only be implemented next year, after an election.
<P>
	We must not forget the promises made during the 1993 election 
campaign. Everybody remembers the promises made by the Prime 
Minister and his ministers who were only candidates then: ``We 
will create hundreds of thousands of jobs''. Where are those jobs? 
``We will abolish GST''. What happened to the GST? ``We will 
invest $720 million in the day care program''. Where is the $720 
million?
<P>
	And now they announce a new $600 million child benefit for 
1998. We do not believe them. They are not believable. Nobody 
believes them. We have our doubts about what will happen after the 
election. It seems that they suddenly forget their promises once 
they have been elected. They ignore them. They dismiss them and 
act as if they had never existed.
<P>
	There is a real national emergency in terms of child poverty. The 
Minister of Finance said it was. According to our analysis, it is 
more than an emergency. In fact, we should have done something 
in the past three years. We should not have cut $4.5 billion in social 
programs. On the contrary, we should have increased funding to 
help families, the most disadvantaged families, the parents of these 
children living in poverty.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	Instead, this year, we will spend only $50 million to fight child 
poverty. Have you thought about what $50 million means? They 
cut $4.5 billion from social programs, which will worsen the 
problem of poverty. They will spend $600 million, but only next 
year, because this problem is not enough of an emergency for the 
government. They will spend $50 million this year to fight child 
poverty. This amount shows how compassionate the Minister of 
Finance is. We do not believe him either. He is not believable when 
he says that he is greatly concerned about child poverty.
<P>
	When he places his hand on his heart, I think what he really has 
in mind is his wallet. Child poverty is the least of his concerns 
because, once again, if he did not have his mind set on merely 
partisan or crass electoral things, he would have put the money 
where it is needed, and at the levels that his margin of $8 to $14 
billion a year allows. He would have put $4.5 billion in social 
programs instead of literally robbing the provinces of that amount. 
That is where he should have put the money.
<P>
	Concerning the unemployment insurance fund, once again, the 
Minister of Finance could have been more shrewd, more hard 
working, less lazy. He could have said: ``I will use part of the $5 
billion surplus in the unemployment insurance fund to substantially 
reduce unemployment insurance, now called employment 
insurance, premiums''. Not a reduction of a nickel or a dime, which 
is what he has accustomed us to. As a matter of fact, every analyst 
is saying today that, in this regard, the minister's budget is 
worthless, that it will not have any impact on corporate 
competitiveness and job creation.
<P>
	He could have done three or four times better. And with the rest 
of the surplus, he could have given back the protection he took 
away from the unemployed with the introduction of the 
employment insurance program last January. He could have done 
that, but not this finance minister. We know him and we know how 
he is putting his fiscal house in order on the back of others, so we 
could not expect him to use this cushion that he is hiding from us to 
stimulate employment by reducing unemployment insurance 
premium rates, and especially by helping small and medium size 
businesses create jobs and by improving the situation of those who 
fall victim to unemployment. He has not done that. Absolutely not.
<P>
	I remind the House also that he has not followed our suggestions 
on corporate income tax reform, which  would have freed up $3 
billion that could have been used to support employment in the 
small and medium size business sector. He applauded these 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8324"> 8324 </A></B>
<P>
suggestions but he did not act on them. He applauded them just for 
show, for his image. Image is very important to our finance 
minister. He is paving the way to becoming the leader of the 
Liberal Party of Canada some day. He came to thank us. He was 
even quoted by a newspaper as congratulating the Bloc Quebecois, 
but he did not do anything in the area of employment. The same 
goes for our proposed employment RRSP. He applauded that 
suggestion but did not act on it.
<P>
	Speaking about employment, do you know what new measures 
are contained in this budget to create jobs? I remind you that we are 
experiencing a shortage of jobs. There are 1.5 million people 
officially unemployed; there are another 1.5 million unofficially 
unemployed, people who are discouraged, marginalized, driven to 
welfare, who no longer show up as actively seeking work. This 
adds up to 3 million underemployed people in Canada. He has set 
aside $25 million in new money for job creation. This represents 90 
cents for each Canadian. Direct assistance during the Great 
Depression was more generous. It is terrible, 90 cents.
<P>
	It is cynical, laughable, but sad at the same time, because 3 
million people are waiting for help, while with great fanfare the 
Minister of Finance is presenting his empty, ridiculous measures. It 
is unacceptable.
<P>
	The only new measures in the budget are measures that will lead 
to confusion.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	In addition to being partisan and despicably election oriented, 
these measures, when presented by the Minister of Finance, 
suggest that the public will swallow anything. Apart from that, 
there is the confusion that will result. The Minister of Finance is 
proposing, and for three and a half years that is all his government 
has been proposing when there is any reform, a wholesale invasion 
of provincial jurisdiction. This is all this budget is.
<P>
	It talks about health programs. Under the 1867 and the 1982 
Constitutions it is clear that health comes under provincial 
jurisdiction. The same clearly goes for education. Income security 
and social assistance are areas of provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	The government tells us it has no more money for social 
programs. It is cutting $4.5 billion, and all of a sudden we are 
seeing little programs with ``Government of Canada'' at the bottom 
and the Canadian flag at the top. It does not get much more 
partisan.
<P>
	There is no longer any money for social programs provided 
jointly with the provinces. In particular, the government is cutting 
$1.3 billion from the Government of Quebec's social programs. 
And with a fraction of the amount it has stolen, it is setting up a 
child benefit  program to fight poverty. If that is not confusing and 
inflammatory, I do not know what is. The Minister of Finance is 
playing with fire.
<P>
	The same goes for the Foundation for Innovation. The purpose of 
the Foundation for Innovation, an $800 million dollar undertaking, 
is to fund research and infrastructure in the areas of biomedical 
research, post-graduate research and so on. Once again, this is an 
intrusion into health and education.
<P>
	What the Minister of Finance does not tell us is that his fund is 
just a band-aid solution for a huge gaping wound, one he himself 
has caused with the various measures he has put in place in the past 
three years. When he cut $4.5 billion from social programs and 
health, part of that was going to biomedical infrastructure and 
research.
<P>
	Moreover, people far smarter than those across the way came 
before us in the finance committee to say that the cuts imposed by 
Minister Martin in his first three budgets might compromise all 
biomedical research. We are talking about major cuts here. They 
slashed research budgets by 30 per cent, with the full knowledge 
that we are already trailing behind all other industrialized 
countries. A 30 per cent reduction is tantamount to a death sentence 
for biomedical research.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance announces to us, with great fanfare: 
``are going to create an $800 million foundation to fund research''. 
This budget is a total joke, a kind of vaudeville act. It is sad to see a 
minister of finance behaving in this way, when there are crying 
needs in the areas of poverty and job creation. He leaves the 
provinces scrambling to keep their heads above water. He cleans up 
his government's finances at their expense, and goes about patting 
himself on the back for being a good manager.
<P>
	We need to know where the Minister of Finance is getting his 
$800 million to start up the Foundation for Innovation. It might 
have been expected that he would get it from the $8 billion 
available, plus all the items I have referred to, which could yield 
between $8 billion to $14 billion to work with. If he had been a 
good manager, if he had not had an exaggerated obsession with 
waging war on the deficit, with immediate, spectacular results, in 
order to bolster his image, to make him look like a Canadian leader 
in training for a leadership fight, one might well think that he 
would have taken the money from there. But no.
<P>
	When we look at last year's budget, the 1996 budget-which I 
am not allowed to use as a prop, but I do have in my hand-when 
we look at his forecasts for overall transfers to the provinces, 
including the equalization payments, the Canada social transfer and 
so on, and when we compare them with the forecasts in yesterday's 
budget, we see that last year he projected $800 million more in 
transfers to the provinces than in this year's budget. Fascinating 
coincidence.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8325"> 8325 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	There is new spending totalling $800 million for the Canada 
Foundation for Innovation, and there is $800 million less available 
for transfers to provinces. What a coincidence: exactly $800 
million. So this is a big coincidence, but it is rather odd, because 
we do not know why the minister deliberately decided to take away 
another $800 million from the provinces or it may be the economy 
or a combination of the two, but in any case, there is no new money 
here.
<P>
	He did not take advantage of the flexibility he has to establish 
this kind of foundation. As I said before, this is just a band-aid on a 
gaping wound he opened in the course of the last three budgets by 
attacking provincial budgets for health care and education.
<P>
	I would like to touch on one last point in this budget. I think this 
is a very important issue on which there is practically a consensus 
in Canada. I am referring to the harmonization of the GST with the 
Quebec sales tax.
<P>
	As you know, in 1991, the Quebec government offered to 
harmonize its sales tax with the federal GST. It did so because it 
felt that with a harmonized system, the sales tax would be easier to 
manage by business and its administration would also be easier, 
since the Government of Quebec would administer both taxes on 
behalf of the federal government. It also wanted to improve 
Quebec's competitive position and trade balance. In fact, Quebec 
Finance Minister Bernard Landry made this clear when he started 
to demand compensation last April. He made it clear why the 
Government of Quebec decided to harmonize its sales tax with the 
GST.
<P>
	We did so in good faith, and we did so with a view to improving 
the situation in 1991. What do we see six years later? That the 
federal government thought it was a such good idea that it 
suggested the same to the maritimes. However, to persuade the 
maritimes to go along with it, it offered them about $1 billion. That 
is $1 billion over the next three years to harmonize the sales taxes 
of the three small maritime provinces with the federal tax, the GST. 
One billion.
<P>
	And now, the Minister of Finance says: ``It is not the same thing, 
the harmonization is not being done the same way''. Is that right? 
We harmonized in 1991, and they harmonized in 1997. They are 
entitled to $1 billion and we do not get a red cent.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance in rejecting the demand of minister 
Landry for some $2 billion in compensation pushed arrogance to 
the point of saying: ``We based our calculations on the formula we 
used in the maritimes. Unfortunately under the terms and the 
subtleties of the formula, you are not entitled to it''. Oh, come on.
<P>
	According to this logic, the government can exclude whomever 
it wants whenever it wants. This is exactly what the government 
wanted to do. In setting up the  formula, it justified paying out $1 
billion in the maritimes and denying Quebec any compensation.
<P>
	I heard the minister say in question period: ``We did the 
calculations. The Government of Quebec made money with 
harmonization''. My eye. In terms of tobacco and gasoline alone, 
we lost something like $600 million in tax revenues, because we 
wanted to harmonize with the federal government and make things 
easier in terms of taxes on consumer goods. For these two items 
alone, $600 million.
<P>
	The claim for $2 billion is justified. It is justified to such an 
extent that the government of Mike Harris, the Government of 
Ontario, I am pleased to say, as it does not happen often, is 
supporting Quebec's demand for $2 billion.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	Even the Government of Alberta is supporting Quebec's 
demand. The Government of Manitoba is supporting Quebec's 
demand. British Columbia is supporting the Quebec government's 
demand for $2 billion. This is unheard of. The finance minister told 
us he owed us nothing. He gave $1 billion of our own tax dollars to 
the maritimes and told Quebec: ``No, you are entitled to nothing. 
You went ahead, you did it all on your own, you spend money for 
the others, but you are not entitled to anything, only the maritimes 
are.''
<P>
	We would have expected to see in this budget an indication of a 
possible first payment, a first instalment to pay off the $2 billion 
debt the federal government owes the Government of Quebec, but 
nothing. A big fat zero.
<P>
	There are many other things I could speak up against in this 
budget-my colleagues will have the opportunity to deal with 
specific elements of the budget over the three days set aside for the 
debate-but I would like to end on the following note. The finance 
minister wasted three and a half years he could have used to 
improve things. He could have used these three and a half years to 
make the tax system fairer and more equitable for everyone.
<P>
	He could have taken steps to reduce the outrageous benefits for 
the richest Canadians, who are said to represent 2 or 3 per cent of 
the total population; I am not saying they should be eliminated, 
they could have been allowed to keep some of their benefits-one 
way or another we do have to keep them here-but at least they 
should have been reduced in scope and what is collected 
redistributed among middle and low income earners, who have 
borne the brunt of increased income tax and other tax hikes over the 
last 15 years, and who have been the victims, over the past three 
years, of a $22 billion tax grab.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="8326"> 8326 </A></B>
<P>
	With the manoeuvring room he had, thanks to the economic 
recovery, not thanks to him-because he, I have made up my mind 
on this, he is not the best  manager I know-he could really have 
helped the poor and given back to the provinces the money he stole 
from them in the last two budgets, $4.5 billion.
<P>
	He also could have helped the unemployed. Hew could have 
helped to create jobs. My overall assessment of this budget is that it 
is good for the shredder, the waste basket. If it was meant to be a 
pre-election budget, the Prime Minister should call an election 
tomorrow morning with the budget as a platform. Let me tell you, 
as the Prime Minister himself said, they will get clobbered.
<P>
	We are ready for the election. We are ready to compare our 
record to theirs, our reality to theirs. Our reality is more in line with 
that of the grassroots, closer to what real people experience, more 
attuned to the circumstances of the have-nots who were ignored by 
this government over the last three and a half years.
<P>
	I would like to move an amendment to the government's motion. 
I move, seconded by my colleague, the member for Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by replacing all the words after the word ``That'' 
with the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``the budget statement by the Minister of Finance be rejected by the House of 
Commons because it:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>unilaterally maintains major reductions in transfer payments to the provinces in the 
fields of postsecondary education, health, and social assistance, while intruding in 
areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction, particularly by creating the Canada 
Foundation for Innovation from money earmarked for the provinces, introducing a 
national child tax benefit system, and setting up pilot projects filled with national 
unity propaganda in the field of health and social programs;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>proposes no tangible job creation measures, does not substantially reduce 
Unemployment Insurance contribution rates, or improve protection for 
unemployed persons, which has been greatly reduced by Employment Insurance;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>conceals its lack of action in creating jobs and fighting poverty, knowingly reducing 
effectiveness in these areas and distributing electoral gifts around Canada and 
Quebec;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>does not include an in-depth reform of the tax treatment of businesses or individuals, 
for example, by maintaining benefits for large corporations and rich Canadians; and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>introduces no measures to compensate the Quebec government for the 1991 
harmonization of its sales tax with the federal GST, although Quebec would be 
eligible for this compensation in light of the $1 billion being paid to the maritime 
provinces.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I must tell the hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot that I can see nothing wrong with this 
amendment, but we will need some time to determine whether it is 
in order. We will let you know as soon as possible.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that this House 
approves in general the budgetary policy of the government; and of 
the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are here to discuss the federal budget. The Liberals say 
it is a good budget. What is more important is what Canadians are 
saying about it. In our view Canadians will say: If this is such a 
good budget, why don't I see the benefits. Where are the jobs? 
Where are the health care and pensions that I can count on? Where 
is the tax relief? Why is it that federal government revenues go up 
by 20 per cent and family incomes go down by 10 per cent?
<P>
	The good news is that the majority of the provinces have already 
balanced their budgets and the benefits are starting to flow. It is 
Ottawa and the federal Liberals that are furthest behind and most 
off track. The big task facing Canadians in 1997, in a federal 
election year, is to get the federal government on track with respect 
to job creation and tax relief.
<P>
	There are two options before Canadians. Reform offers its fresh 
start platform designed to balance the federal budget now, and then 
leave more dollars in the pockets of Canadians through broad based 
tax relief. Notice the order: balance first, tax relief second. The 
Liberals offer this tax and spend budget designed to get more tax 
dollars into the hands of the federal government and then further 
spending.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8327"> 8327 </A></B>
<P>
	The options are Reform's fresh start tax relief versus the Liberal 
tax and spend budget. These are the principal fiscal options facing 
Canadians in an election year at the federal level and should be 
the focus of both public debate and this budget debate.
<P>
	If we are going to have any kind of debate, one of the 
prerequisites is to establish the facts and to separate myth from 
reality. I would like to spend a little time on that because the budget 
is loaded with myths. Budget myth number one is that federal 
finances are finally under control. What is the reality? The federal 
deficit is still at $19 billion. The debt will pass the $600 billion 
mark this spring. The federal government will spend $46 billion 
per year on debt service, more by far than it spends on social 
programs. This is represented as prudent fiscal management. Only 
in Ottawa would that be believed.
<P>
	Budget myth number two is that the federal government has 
reduced the deficit by controlling its spending. What is the reality? 
Almost the opposite. Eighty-four per cent of deficit reduction has 
been achieved by increasing tax revenues. Two-thirds of the 
remainder of deficit reduction has been accomplished by 
offloading on the provinces and through defence cuts. Only 6 per 
cent has been achieved by reducing the federal government's direct 
spending on other programs.
<P>
	I noticed that at the beginning of the minister's budget speech, he 
thanked everyone and his dog for contributing to this speech. The 
people he did not thank were the Canadian taxpayers who are 
responsible for 84 per cent of the reduction of the deficit.
<P>
<B>(1630 )</B>
<P>
	Budget myth number three, Liberals are the great defenders of 
medicare. The reality is that they have cut medicare by 40 per cent, 
closing hospitals across the country and increasing waiting lines in 
every province, but leaving others in local and provincial 
governments to take the blame. This pretence of defending 
medicare while gutting it is the ultimate hypocrisy.
<P>
	Budget myth number four, Liberals are attacking child poverty. 
The reality is that their new $600 million child benefit is 
completely negated by the $7 billion federal cut in health, 
education and social spending since 1993.
<P>
	If one thinks about it, Canadians are a kind, caring and 
compassionate people. If the average Canadian were willing to 
spend $1,000 on helping a poor family or a poor child how would 
they do it? They might make a direct contribution to that family or 
that child, or they might make a contribution to a local agency or 
church that was in the business of helping those people. They might 
even be persuaded to pay $1,000 in taxes to their local government 
or the provincial government which has services offered at the 
community level.
<P>
	However, I doubt if there is one Canadian in 1,000 who honestly 
and sincerely wanted to help a poor family or a poor child who 
would think that the best way to do  it was to write a $1,000 cheque 
to Revenue Canada because they know what would happen.
<P>
	The $1,000 would go to the minister of revenue who would take 
a bite out of it for administration and then pass it over to the 
Treasury Board. The Treasury Board would take a bite out of it for 
allocation and then pass it on to the human resources minister. The 
human resources minister would take a bite out of it by having a 
conference with all of his provincial colleagues and a bunch of 
experts to decide what to do and then he would pass it on to his 
provincial colleague who would take a further bite out of it and 
then pass it on to some agency. Out of the $1,000 that went in at one 
end of the pipe, we would be lucky if a loonie got out the other end.
<P>
	Canadians know a better way. Canadians know that if Liberals 
and Tories were so concerned about the poor and the children of the 
poor then why are these people paying taxes in the first place? Why 
is a single mother with one child making $2,000 a month paying 
federal income taxes at all, let alone $1,300 a year? It is because 
government after government made them pay taxes and offered no 
tax relief.
<P>
	Of course the greatest thing one can do for the working poor is to 
get more jobs, which brings me to budget myth number five, jobs, 
jobs, jobs. The reality is 1.5 million Canadians unemployed, 2 
million to 3 million underemployed, 700,000 having two jobs to try 
to make ends meet, 17 per cent unemployment among young 
people, 1 out of 4 workers afraid of losing their jobs, and the worst 
string of unemployment numbers since the depression, 76 
consecutive months with unemployment rates over 9 per cent.
<P>
	Some day the finance minister's picture will hang in the 
hallowed halls of Parliament. At the rate he is going, I suspect they 
will hang it next to the picture of the finance minister in R.B. 
Bennett's government, the only other government that ran up 
unemployment numbers like we are experiencing today.
<P>
	The Liberal budget is accompanied by a booklet called the 
government's job strategy, but it contains no reference to tax relief. 
A job strategy without tax relief is like a beaver without teeth. It is 
like a truck with no wheels. We can rev the engine, flick the lights 
and honk the horn but it is not going anywhere, which is precisely 
the Liberal record on jobs.
<P>
	That brings me to the biggest myth of all. The finance minister 
would have Canadians believe that he has not raised taxes. That is a 
big whopper. The reality is that since the Liberals came to power in 
1993, the GST revenues, the hated GST, are up by $2 billion, 
corporate income taxes are up by $6.8 billion, personal income 
taxes are up by $15 billion, and other taxes are up $500 million. 
That is a $24 billion increase in tax revenues over what they were 
on the day the Liberals took office.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8328"> 8328 </A></B>
<P>
	Just last week, in the biggest tax grab of them all, there was 
a 70 per cent increase in Canada pension plan contributions. It is 
the government's Achilles' heel, the tax grab that will be to the 
Liberal's what the GST was to the Mulroney Conservatives. It is 
the tax increase that brings to 36 the total number of tax increases 
introduced by the Liberal government.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	Enough of these myths. Enough of the fudge-it budget. There has 
to be a better way and there is a better way. It is described in the 
platform which Reform has put forward under the heading of a 
fresh start for Canada.
<P>
	I suggest that the next election will be a contest between two 
very different visions of the country, and the vision that captures 
the hearts of Canadians will be the vision that shapes the Canada of 
the 21st century.
<P>
	One vision held by the government and by the Conservatives 
before them revolves around big government and the high taxes 
that go with it. It is based on the belief that the Canadian economy, 
Canadian social services and Canadian unity all need aggressive 
intervention and management by a big spending federal 
government. It is the vision of Ottawa and the politicians who 
control it as the centre of the universe.
<P>
	This is a vision which has Canadians working more than half a 
year just to pay taxes. It is a vision that promises job creation and 
social justice and has delivered chronic unemployment and chronic 
poverty. It is a vision which trivializes Canadians' sense of 
themselves by implying that only through government programs, 
government spending, government initiatives and government 
propaganda can the country be held together.
<P>
	The other vision, the one offered by Reform, is of a Canada 
defined and built by its citizens rather than by the government. The 
citizen, not the government, is at its centre. It is a vision in which 
strong families and communities and local governments, not more 
federal programs, are the principal pillars of social security. It is a 
vision of a country where tax freedom day occurs in April instead 
of in July. It is a vision of a country in which the unemployment 
rate is 5 per cent or lower instead of 10 per cent, thanks to initiative 
and entrepreneurship, innovation and hard work. It is a vision of a 
smaller government and lower taxes. It is a vision based on the 
proposition that a dollar left in the pocket of a consumer or a 
taxpayer or a lender or an entrepreneur will create more jobs and 
economic and social security than that dollar in the hands of a 
federal bureaucrat or a politician.
<P>
	We are talking about the budget, so I want to conclude with the 
fiscal plan that makes that vision of a new and better Canada a 
reality. Our fiscal plan calls for balancing the federal budget by 
1998-99 at a level of expenditure  lower than that proposed by the 
finance minister, and then running surpluses thereafter.
<P>
	Note that what we are proposing is balancing the budget first and 
tax relief after. Many members opposite seem to think we are 
trying to do the two things at once. We have made this abundantly 
clear; balance first, tax relief after.
<P>
	We then get to surpluses and these surpluses are the real light at 
the end of the tunnel, the beginning of the hope for the future. We 
propose to apply those surpluses as follows. A $5 billion down 
payment on debt reduction by the year 2001, with a fixed 
proportion of future surpluses being dedicated to debt reduction. In 
other words, the federal debt would be set up like a mortgage and 
the first payment made every month is a payment on the mortgage.
<P>
	Second, $4 billion per year transfer for health and education 
purposes to the provinces to repair the damage done by the 
Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Most important of all, broad based tax relief which follows, not 
precedes, balancing the budget. Seven tax relief measures to 
deliver $1 billion per year in tax relief to the people of Atlantic 
Canada; $3.2 billion per year in tax relief to the long suffering 
people of Quebec, the most highly taxed jurisdiction perhaps in 
North America; $5.4 billion per year in tax relief to the people of 
Ontario; $2.3 billion per year in tax relief to the people of the 
prairies and $1.8 billion per year in tax relief to the people of 
British Columbia.
<P>
	Put another way, it is $2,000 in tax relief per average family by 
the year 2000 or tax relief that lifts 1.2 million lower and middle 
income Canadians off the federal tax rolls altogether.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	To put this into perspective, Reform proposes a trimmer, more 
focused $94 billion a year federal government. We can get a lot of 
government services for $94 billion. This compares with a bloated, 
unfocused $109 billion a year federal government from the federal 
Liberals and Tories. The difference between the two is about $15 
billion per year. The number one question to be decided in the next 
federal election is whether Canadians should allow that $15 billion 
to be collected by the federal tax man and spent by Ottawa or 
whether that $15 billion should be left in the hands of the Canadian 
consumer and business community.
<P>
	Reform believes that a fresh start for Canadians lies in the 
direction of leaving that $15 billion in the hands of the people to 
whom it belongs.
<P>
	I therefore move:
<P>

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The amendment made by the hon.

subamendment by the hon. leader of the Reform Party would

permission to give it a formal ruling as quickly as can be done.
<P>
	Questions and comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
a question for the member for Calgary Southwest.
<P>
	In the House today and over the last couple of days the Reform 
Party has criticized the government for its approach to the Canada 
pension plan. I think when an opposition party comes to Ottawa it 
has an obligation not just to criticize but also to offer an alternative.
<P>
	I wonder if the member for Calgary Southwest, the leader of the 
Reform Party, would care to inform the House and Canadians what 
exactly is the plan of the Reform Party with respect to reforming 
the Canada pension plan.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his question 
because a lot of confusion has been spread, mainly by the Minister 
of Finance, on what Reform's position is.
<P>
	First of all, Reform's position is broader than that of the 
government. Our aim is to get more retirement income for seniors 
at lower cost through both pension reform and tax reform. That is a 
broader objective than just rescuing CPP. It includes rescuing CPP 
but it is a broader goal.
<P>
	We propose three measures to accomplish this objective. First, 
we propose to guarantee existing seniors that they will receive all 
the benefits they are entitled to under CPP. We propose a 
modification to CPP designed to achieve that guarantee.
<P>
	Second, we propose to shift middle aged and younger workers on 
to an expanded RRSP program. The RRSP program gives higher 
benefits per dollar spent than CPP. And so our modified CPP plus 
our expanded RRSP program give pensions at a lower cost than the 
Liberal approach which is focused mainly on rescuing CPP.
<P>
<B>(1645 )</B>
<P>
	The third thing we add is Reform's tax relief program. By lifting 
1.2 million Canadians off of the federal income tax rolls altogether, 
including many seniors, it helps seniors further, whereas the 
Liberals have been increasing the burden on seniors on every front 
by clawing back the seniors benefit, by gouging the contributors to 
CPP and by restricting the use of RRSPs rather than expanding 
them.
<P>
	Reform's aim is to get more retirement for seniors at lower cost 
through pension and tax reform. Our proposal rests on three pillars, 
not one: a modified CPP; an expanded RRSP; and tax relief 
including tax relief for seniors.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like the hon. member to provide some 
clarification on the Canada pension plan.
<P>
	There have been numerous statements made that the Canada 
pension plan is a tax and not a pension. In my opinion when I pay 
my taxes I do not expect any funds back over <I>x</I> number of years. 
Presently as the CPP sits it is a pension and in due time whether it 
be through disability or retirement people expect to have a return 
for their funds invested.
<P>
	Could the hon. member clarify his position that it is a tax and not 
a pension?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, what Reform has said is not that the 
pension is a tax but that the premium paid is a payroll tax. This is 
not just Reform's opinion.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance has in his department the economic 
analysis and forecasting division which did a lot of work on this 
budget. Joe Italiano who is with that division put out a paper on 
April 25, 1995 called ``Growth in CPP/QPP Contributions''. In it 
he defines CPP contributions as a payroll tax. Incidentally he goes 
on to analyse the impact of increasing those payroll taxes from 
1986 to 1993 and concludes that they killed 26,000 jobs. This is not 
me speaking; this is the finance minister's own department 
defining CPP premiums as a payroll tax.
<P>
	The government gets a lot of statistics from Statistics Canada. A 
number of officials in Statistics Canada put out a paper in the 
<I>Canada Tax Journal</I> a short while ago. They identified payroll 
taxes and listed what they were and the list included CPP and QPP 
contributions.
<P>
	Last night Judith Andrew of the Canadian Federation of 
Independent Business was discussing the minister's budget. She 
referred to the hike in the CPP premiums as a payroll tax. If there is 
any group in the country that would know a payroll tax when they 
see it, it would be the CFIB because of course these are the people 
who are actually paying it.
<P>
	Reform says it would be very appropriate for the minister, since 
his department acknowledges it, Statistics Canada acknowledges it, 
economists acknowledge it and business people acknowledge it, to 
acknowledge that the CPP premium is a payroll tax. When it is 
increased by 70 per cent, that has extremely negative effects on 
employment.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8330"> 8330 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it appears to me that the leader of the third party is 
engaging in a semantic exercise in using the term payroll tax.
<P>
	The premiums deducted for the Canada pension plan at source 
are paired equally, one to one with an employer contribution and 
paid over into the Canada pension plan. The identical thing 
happens with the employer's pension plan. The employee is 
deducted an amount of money at source. It is paired with dollar for 
dollar by the employer; the identical sum the employee puts in, the 
employer puts in. It is the same as with the Canada pension plan. 
Those funds are turned over and paid into the employer's pension 
plan.
<P>
<B>(1650 )</B>
<P>
	Does the leader of the third party agree that there is a pension 
plan in both cases? In both cases it is mandatory that the employees 
contribute. The contributions end up in pension plans and 
ultimately the party making the contribution, the pensioner, will 
draw the benefits from the plan.
<P>
	Why does he insist on referring to one of those two options as a 
tax when it is not?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all most employer pension 
plans work the way the member describes, except one, namely the 
one that the members in this House voted for themselves. In that 
one the public puts in six times what the member puts in. That is 
why it is unfair.
<P>
	Second, one of the principal differences in what we are talking 
about here is that the CPP contributions are a legislated mandatory 
compulsory contribution whereas participation in 
employer-employee pension plans are usually voluntary.
<P>
	The third point and the most important one is that the finance 
department itself defines CPP contributions as a payroll tax. This is 
not the Reform Party; it is a division of the minister's own 
department.
<P>
	That is the explanation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, whenever I present the arguments the leader just 
developed, audiences tend to react by saying: ``You will never be 
able to deliver on this''. I wonder what kind of an answer the leader 
would give to people who make this argument.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, the way to deliver on all of these 
commitments is first to get a mandate from the Canadian people to 
do so.
<P>
	The public are aware that their retirement income is insecure 
under CPP. They are afraid that the minister is casting a lecherous 
and covetous eye on their RRSP payments.
<P>
	The way to get this secured and the way to get a mandate from 
the public is the way we endeavour to get a mandate for virtually 
everything that is done in this House, to go to the public with an 
explanation of the program. If the public supports it, then there is 
the authority to proceed with these types of reforms.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to participate in this debate and to speak 
about the benefits the 1997 budget will bring for the businesses and 
citizens of Etobicoke-Lakeshore. I will be sharing my time with 
my colleague from Kenora-Rainy River.
<P>
	The measures outlined by the finance minister in his speech 
yesterday will improve the lives of young people, of families and 
of seniors. Our measures for small and medium size businesses will 
help Etobicoke businesses thrive, grow and create jobs.
<P>
	In my speech today I will focus on the specific measures that 
will benefit the people of my riding and then explain why the path 
this government has chosen is the best one for Etobians.
<P>
	First, the budget will invest in our most important asset, young 
Canadians. Our youth employment strategy is good news for the 
students of Lakeshore Collegiate, Father Redmond, Etobicoke 
School of the Arts, Bishop Allen Academy, Humber College 
Lakeshore Campus, as well as university students in my riding.
<P>
	Our strategy will support Canadian students with 120,000 career 
summer job opportunities and over 19,000 internship placements in 
the research, private and non-profit sectors. These crucial first 
opportunities will give young Canadians the chance to break the no 
experience, no job and no job, no experience cycle.
<P>
	We are also continuing the successful youth service program. In 
Etobicoke-Lakeshore the program was instrumental in 
developing a youth and crime prevention initiative in one of our 
most troubled communities.
<P>
	In addition, this government will assist young Canadians by 
helping them and their families to afford training and education. 
We are doing this by raising the per month education tax credit 
from $100 to $200 in the next two years and enabling students to 
apply it to more expenses and apply unused portions to future tax 
credits. For example, a college or university student with tuition of 
$2,800 and additional fees of $300 would receive $1,200 in 
combined federal and provincial tax assistance per year.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	Moreover this government is extending the pay back period for 
student loans and offering an additional $20 million a year for 
student assistance. That is more good news for young Etobians 
worried about the cost of education.
<P>
	We are also enabling parents with young children to save early to 
help pay for their children's education or make up for a 
contribution missed when their children  were younger. Families in 
Etobicoke will be happy to hear that annual contributions to 
registered education savings plans are being doubled from $2,000 
to $4,000. We are also relaxing the requirement that in the event the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8331"> 8331 </A></B>
<P>
child does not pursue post-secondary education, parents can 
transfer the RESP to their RRSP or receive the investment income 
directly.
<P>
	Low income families in Etobicoke will be happy to hear that our 
government will enrich the Canada child tax credit by over $600 
million. This combined with a $250 million working income 
supplement means an $850 million increase in annual benefits.
<P>
	Our government will continue to work with the provinces and 
territories to design the complementary changes that will reduce 
child poverty and barriers to work.
<P>
	Our efforts for health care in Canada are solid. We remain 
committed to the values of the Canadian system and we will 
enforce them through the Canada Health Act.
<P>
	Etobians of all ages will be happy to hear that we have stabilized 
the Canada health and social transfer to the provinces at $25 billion 
annually and we anticipate growth in transfers at the turn of the 
century. We are committing $300 million more over the next three 
years for new health initiatives. Every dollar of the new money will 
be devoted toward the delivery of better health services to 
Canadians.
<P>
	Seniors in Etobicoke-Lakeshore will be pleased to hear that we 
are devoting $150 million over the next three years to help the 
provinces put in place new projects, such as new approaches to 
home care, drug coverage and other innovations, that will enable us 
to test ways in which we can make our system more efficient.
<P>
	There will also be $100 million for the community action 
program for children and the Canada prenatal nutrition programs 
designed to prevent health problems in our children.
<P>
	This is more good news for groups like the Stonegate 
Community Centre, the Association of Ontario Health Centres, the 
Stothers Centre for Children and Families and the Welcome Baby 
Support Network for Teenage Mothers. All of these organizations 
will benefit from these new initiatives.
<P>
	There is no question that our publicly funded system is one of 
Canada's greatest achievements and there is no doubt that this 
government will fight to keep it.
<P>
	Our government is investing in helping the disabled achieve the 
equality to which they are entitled. As a member of the human 
rights and the status of persons with disabilities committee, I am 
especially pleased by the announcement of $100 million worth of 
additional support each year to disabled Canadians. Using tax 
credits, financial incentives, training and opportunities  funds, the 
government will put Canadians with disabilities in balance with 
other Canadians, allowing them to realize the same opportunities.
<P>
	In a similar way we are giving the people of 
Etobicoke-Lakeshore the chance to give more to charitable 
causes. The charitable sector is playing an increasingly important 
role in meeting the needs of Canadians. The government 
recognizes the importance of giving charities the tools they need to 
accomplish their important work.
<P>
	Although tax assistance for charitable giving entails a cost for 
governments, it is plainly a much lower cost than providing full 
support directly through public funds. The 1997 budget levels the 
playing field between the crown and other kinds of charities, 
making it easier for organizations to raise funds and donors to 
receive larger tax credits.
<P>
<B>(1700 )</B>
<P>
	The budget contains $95 million annually of new tax assistance 
to the charitable sector. This will give charities, like the Etobicoke 
Cancer Society, Goodwill, St. Vincent de Paul, Reach the Rainbow, 
the YM-YWCA, the Children's Aid Society and the Etobicoke 
chapter of the Heart and Stroke Foundation, the framework they 
need to accomplish their work and help Canadians whom these 
charities serve.
<P>
	Now that I have mentioned some of the ways in which we are 
assisting individuals, I will speak about our strategy for a vibrant 
economy. The government has always maintained that good fiscal 
management is the route to investor confidence. In the time since 
we took office we have witnessed a monumental turn around in the 
fortunes of Canada. Remember, in the late 1980s, year after year of 
Conservative finance ministers preaching restraint, and then year 
after year of record deficits?
<P>
	It was the Liberal government and the Minister of Finance that 
turned Canada from the worst debtor nation in the G7 to a deficit to 
GDP ratio of 2 per cent. In 1998, the government anticipates 
breaking its dependency on borrowing new money. This means that 
1998 will mark the first time in 28 years that it will not have to go 
to the markets to borrow new money. It will put the Canadian 
government in an enviable position internationally. Canada will 
have the best financial record of any G7 government. In 1997, it is 
expected to be the growth and job creation leader of all G7 
countries.
<P>
	If the government were to offer the Canadian public, as the 
Reformers and the Ontario finance minister suggest, a broad based 
tax cut, not only will we lose the war on the deficit but we will 
surely lose the vital social programs we have been fighting to 
protect. This is not a fresh start for Canada but a full stop for 
Canada and a future for Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8332"> 8332 </A></B>
<P>
	Members will be happy to know that we are not gambling all 
our chips on the tax cut number like our opponents would. Instead, 
we are building on the cornerstone of responsible fiscal 
management, a strong health care system, a prosperous export 
strategy and an innovative research and development program. 
This is the best approach for Canada and for Etobicoke.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
the hon. member to comment on the request made by the 
Government of Quebec to receive the same compensation as the 
maritimes for harmonizing the GST with the provincial sales tax. 
We all know that the maritimes received a gift of approximately $1 
billion in compensation from the federal government.
<P>
	Since the share of federal expenditures borne by the Government 
and the people of Quebec amounts to about 27 per cent, this means 
that Quebec is giving approximately $300 million to the maritimes, 
which I feel is totally unfair. To claim that the federal government 
did not reward them is inaccurate. Because in some of the maritime 
provinces the provincial sales tax was relatively high-9, 10, 11 or 
12 per cent-the federal government said: ``Set the harmonized 
sales tax at approximately 15 per cent and we will make up the 
difference''. If that is not a gift, what is?
<P>
	It was said also that the maritimes did not have the funds 
required to make up the difference, while all they had to do was 
increase other sources of revenue, income tax for instance.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	I would like the hon. government member to tell me if, in her 
opinion, it is fair and equitable to have the Government of Quebec 
pay, through the federal government, $300,000 per year as a gift to 
the maritimes, when New Brunswick Premier McKenna is setting 
up an office in Montreal and using money Quebecers paid to 
Ottawa, which Ottawa in turn gave to the maritimes, to lure Quebec 
businesses to his province.
<P>
	That is right, with our own money, Quebec's money, the 
Government of New Brunswick is stealing our businesses away. 
Does that seem fair and equitable to her?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Augustine:</B> Mr. Speaker, it seems strange that I have to 
address the whole question of fairness. We in the House and the 
government have indicated in many ways that this federation works 
because we all co-operate. Many of us speak on a daily basis on the 
unity, harmony and co-operation that is needed to ensure that every 
part of the federation works.
<P>
	In addressing the budget presented by the Minister of Finance 
yesterday, the question of fairness and of provincial responsibility 
and the question of who is taking jobs from whom, I am not sure 
was addressed.
<P>
	On the question of co-operation and harmonization of the GST, 
the provinces have to work with us. The tax is an administratively 
bad tax. We are doing what is necessary to provide the best 
approach for the country. I am not going to address what provincial 
premier is doing what in any part of the country.
<P>
	I would ask my colleague to co-operate with us to address the 
issue of Canadian unity.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member reiterated in her presentation what the finance minister 
said this morning in a CBC television interview.
<P>
	He said that we are going to focus spending on things that really 
count to Canadians. Our values are health care, education, children 
and job creation. But when we look at the record, the government 
has cut $7 billion a year from health and education funding. That is 
a 40 per cent reduction. So the actions are quite different from the 
words.
<P>
	The government's record on jobs is not good. The 
unemployment rate is about the same as it was when it came into 
office.
<P>
	I would like to ask the member to tell me how the words that the 
finance minister presents and those that the member presents are so 
much different from what the record really demonstrates in these 
areas?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Augustine:</B> Mr. Speaker, we stand on our record. That is the 
short answer. We have created jobs. We have provided an 
environment in which jobs can be created. We have reaffirmed our 
commitment to the Canada Health Act. We have provided money 
for youth and youth programs. We have set a course for the future 
that will definitely take us to where we ought to be. The hon. 
member's fresh start myths will not get us where we want to be.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to enter the budget debate.
<P>
	First, I would like to congratulate the Minister of Finance on a 
job well done. I would like to say to my constituents, welcome to 
the greatest nation on earth. It is easy for me to say that, simply 
because we have fulfilled the commitments we made in 1993. At 
that time we campaigned on restoring fiscal sanity and created a 
climate of opportunity. When I talk to people across the nation, to 
consumers, to people in the construction industry, to homeowners, 
to people who are buying their first car or their first home, they tell 
me that we have done just that.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<B><A NAME="8333"> 8333 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	We have to continue through a number of other budgets to reduce 
the deficit to a point where, at least in the next millennium, we will 
not have to continue to deal with deficits even when there is a 
downturn in our economy. That is what the finance minister means 
when he talks about our values. Because of our values we have 
made tough decisions.
<P>
	I was here a number of years ago when the Tory government was 
in power, when the finances of the nation and the government were 
in rough shape-

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="FINANCIALSTATEMENTOFMINISTEROFFINANCE">FINANCIAL STATEMENT OF MINISTER OF FINANCE</A></H4>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that this House 
approves in general the budgetary policy of the government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I was 
saying, our efforts in the last almost four years clearly show that by 
1998 and 1999 net borrowing requirements will be zero.
<P>
	That is how most countries define a balanced budget. So what we 
can now say is that we have the deficit under control. As well, the 
debt is starting to fall as a portion of GDP. In only four years we 
have been able to clean up the mess left behind by nine years of 
Tory incompetence and mismanagement.
<P>
	What are the results of all this hard work by this government and 
quite frankly by Canadians as it relates to some of the pain that 
Canadians have had to go through in order to deal with the 
Conservatives and their rule and of course some of the people on 
the right wing who have suggested that they have all the answers?
<P>
	We have the lowest inflation in a very long time. We have 
interest rates at their lowest level in almost 40 years. We have 
massive savings for home owners and consumers and economic 
growth is strong. In fact, we have led the G-7.
<P>
	Of particular interest, because of course this is an election year 
and everybody likes to make predictions, the private sector 
forecasters predict we will continue to have the strongest economy 
in the industrialized world.
<P>
	Since our election more than 715,000 new jobs have been 
created. As has been said in this place by the Prime Minister on a 
number of occasions, that is more than Italy, France, Germany, 
Japan and Britain all put together. That may not seem like a lot to 
some members but in fact based on the mess that we inherited from 
the right wingers in this particular scenario that I mentioned, I 
think it is a job well done indeed. I suspect that some forecasters 
like John McCallum from the Royal Bank are predicting we will 
even better that this year with the creation of up to 350,000 more 
jobs.
<P>
	That is on the fiscal side. Those of us who were here under the 
Mulroney rule have to remember that now we have the little 
brother of the Conservative Party called the Reform Party whose 
members were so embarrassed about their leader under the 
Conservative Party they decided to start their own.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8334"> 8334 </A></B>
<P>
	None of us is fooled by that. It is the same right wing Tory 
ideology. That is why we see the lack of interest by the voting 
public in supporting the Reform Party, which is no different than 
when it supported the Mulroney years because of the tax policies, 
the vision and the values it holds for Canadians and which the 
majority of Canadians do not support.
<P>
	I want to talk a bit about those particular values. Before I do that, 
I want to lay a few issues on the table for the public watching today. 
The opposition and certain parties in the provincial jurisdictions 
are suggesting that we in the federal government have been able to 
clean up our finances by downloading to the provinces.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	I want to talk a bit about Ontario because I am an MP from north 
western Ontario. What we are living through is almost identical to 
what I would envision under a Reform government if it were ever 
to occur in this land. We are seeing a slash and burn policy. We 
should look at the facts in Ontario to give us a sort of preview and a 
picture of the future if another right wing party like the ones in this 
House would form the government.
<P>
	Because of Mike Harris' irresponsible tax cuts he has had to cut 
$1.3 billion out of hospitals, $.5 billion from roads, $400 million 
from post-secondary education, $2 billion from social assistance 
and I understand $1.3 billion from municipalities, and that is just 
the tip of the iceberg.
<P>
	I want to give people some information this afternoon that may 
bring to light just why it is difficult for federal members of 
Parliament to accept where Mike Harris is going and that he is in 
fact trying to blame the federal government for the slash and burn 
and all the different headaches that he is causing people from 
northwestern Ontario and Ontario as a whole.
<P>
	Payments to Ontario's government will drop from $10.3 billion 
in 1993-94 to $9.1 billion in 1998-99, a decline of $1.2 billion or 
11.4 per cent. This represents at most 2.5 per cent of Ontario's 
revenues. We cannot, after the list I have just read, suggest that this 
cut made to transfer payments to the Ontario government and the 
Ontario people is the reason why Mike Harris and his Tories are 
cutting all the services in Ontario.
<P>
	Let me give the real reason why. It relates to the opposition, 
especially the right wing opposition parties, both the Tories' and 
Reforms' interest in across the board personal income tax cut. In 
Ontario this particular government has suggested that it would cut 
30 per cent out of our personal income tax. That works out to $4.9 
billion per year by 1999. That is the reason we are closing 
hospitals, why we are reducing payments to school boards and why 
we are increasing the size of our classrooms and why we have to 
reduce transfer payments to the municipalities.
<P>
	Anyone who has spent any time looking at what is going on in 
Ontario would know that it is not the transfer payments from the 
federal government to the provincial government, but it is the 
silliness of having a tax cut across the board when there is still a 
major deficit to deal with and in fact you cannot afford to do 
without those revenues. For the life of me I cannot understand why 
this blind right wing ideology is even being considered by 
Canadians and Ontarians when in fact those of us in this place 
know that we cannot do without that revenue until we balance our 
books.
<P>
	I am proud to be a Liberal for a number of reasons. Even though 
we have had to make some tough decisions on the deficit we 
continue to maintain our values of looking after our social 
programs, putting them on a good footing. The agreement that we 
signed with the provincial governments on CPP is a perfect 
example of that. Putting money toward health care, putting money 
toward youth, putting money toward innovation and technology, 
that is what Liberalism is all about. That is why this government is 
popular in the polls. It is not because some of the members 
opposite say that we have played some number game.
<P>
	People are more intelligent than that. They know we have made 
tough decisions but we have been fair and equitable. That is the 
reason why when we go to the people with this particular budget 
and our record they will agree with us that we have gone a long way 
down the road to improving our chances in the next millennium.
<P>
<B>(1730 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member just described what Liberalism is all about. He said 
virtually the same thing as the finance minister said this morning 
on CBC television, which was that they are going to focus their 
spending on the things that really count to Canadians. He said that 
their values are health care, education, children and job creation. 
Those are the same things which the hon. member said.
<P>
	Those are the words, but I want to ask the hon. member about the 
actions and contrast them to the words.
<P>
	When we look at the action on health care, in fact federal 
spending has been reduced by 40 per cent. That is a fact. That is 
reality.
<P>
	Unemployment has remained above 9 per cent for many months. 
The unemployment rate is almost as high as it was when the 
government took office in 1993. Not only are there 1.5 million 
people unemployed, there are another two million to three million 
who are underemployed, and fully a quarter of the workforce is 
afraid of losing their jobs. More important than the actual 
unemployment rates, bad as they are, is the fact that Canadians are 
having to worker harder than ever just to make ends meet. That is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8335"> 8335 </A></B>
<P>
making their lives very  difficult. It is creating child poverty and 
problems within families.
<P>
	Education funding has also been cut by the federal government 
by 40 per cent. That was the action. That is a fact.
<P>
	The government shows its concern for children by reducing the 
average family income by $3,000. I am talking about take home 
pay. That is the pay which families have available to look after 
their kids. That has been reduced by $3,000 since the government 
took power. That is how the government shows care for children.
<P>
	I would ask the hon. member to respond to the clear difference 
between the words that he and the finance minister speak and their 
actions over the last three years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nault:</B> Mr. Speaker, I find it so humorous that I could 
almost laugh.
<P>
	All of a sudden that right wing party is talking about jobs, health 
care and the plight of the poor. It is talking about those issues 
because it cannot deal with the only issue that it ran on in the last 
election, which was cleaning up the finances of the nation by 
slashing and cutting everything that was not nailed down. Now that 
the Liberal government has done what no government has been 
able to do for the last 20 years, all of a sudden that party has 
recognized that there is something else.
<P>
	Let me deal with the issue of 42 per cent. When the finance 
minister for Ontario presented the Ontario budget, on page 9 he 
said that Ontario will experience federal cuts of some 42.4 per cent.
<P>
	That is the reason I brought up these numbers and that is the spin 
the member opposite is putting on this debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I believe 
there is some rule in the House about just how far a member can 
stretch the truth before it is no longer acceptable?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> There is certainly a rule in 
the House about referring to members who stretch the truth.
<P>
	I think the hon. member is giving an answer to the question of 
the hon. member for Vegreville. With respect, what he is 
suggesting is that he does not agree with the answer, which is 
entirely parliamentary, but the rest is not.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nault:</B> Mr. Speaker, as you know, I was in opposition 
between 1988 and 1993. I understand the opposition mentality. 
When I sat across from Brian Mulroney, who is the big brother of 
the Reform Party, I used to get these numbers as well.
<P>
	However, it is important to get the facts on the record. The 
opposition party is stating that we have cut 42 per cent of the 
transfers to the provinces. The Ontario  finance minister has 
selectively chosen a 1995-96 starting point, the high water mark for 
transfers and he is looking at only the cash. That is what the 
opposition is doing today. It is very misleading to the public 
because part of the CHST is not just the cash but the tax transfers.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	This is very important. I have a list of every single province in 
front of me. Ontario, when the tax points and transfers are 
included, will end up with only $1.5 billion less which is 2.5 per 
cent of its total revenues.
<P>
	For someone to stand up in this place and suggest otherwise is 
not being factual. It shows why those members are at less than10 per cent in the polls. They cannot even get their facts straight.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Order. The time for 
questions and comments has expired. A subamendment was moved 
earlier in the day. It has been reviewed and has been found to be in 
order.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I too am pleased to speak on the budget. Yesterday 
afternoon, the people of Canada and Quebec were sorely 
disappointed with this federal budget, who purpose is to win votes. 
It is not only a do-nothing and meek budget, but also one that falls 
short of their expectations, given the considerable flexibility the 
government and its Minister of Finance had in preparing this 
budget.
<P>
	Like the vast majority of people and pressure groups, the Bloc 
Quebecois condemns this cheap election-minded budget designed 
to disguise this Liberal government's lack of action while 
purporting to provide assistance to children, families and the 
unemployed in Canada and Quebec.
<P>
	Like in the cartoon published in <I>Le Devoir</I> this morning, the 
Minister of Finance of Canada is bragging, with cynicism to boot, 
in the face of all the people who were hit by the massive cuts of the 
past three years. This cartoon illustrates the attitude with which the 
finance minister tabled this budget. Such an attitude is an insult to 
the 1.5 million unemployed in Canada today. It is an insult also to 
the tens of thousands of children who have been forced to live in 
poverty by this government since it took office. In fact, the number 
of poor children has increased by 500,000 over the past three years.
<P>
	This attitude is also an insult to provincial governments, which 
have had to pay the price for reduced transfer payments and to live 
with the consequences of this government's policies for the past 
three years. Finally, the most insulting aspect of this attitude is that, 
in addition to showing off, the Minister of Finance is displaying a 
terrible lack of initiative in his election minded budget.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8336"> 8336 </A></B>
<P>
	Two general conclusions can be drawn from yesterday's budget. 
The first one is that, since it was tabled last night, this budget has 
generated a unanimous reaction in Canada and in Quebec, as we 
saw this morning in most newspapers. There is an obvious lack 
of faith in the proposed measures, in light of the previous policies 
of this government over the last three years, since it took office.
<P>
	This lack of faith affects Canadians and Quebecers, because the 
finance minister paints a misleading picture on the reduction of the 
deficit, which he says is the result of the government's cost cutting 
measures, but which is in fact largely due to a reduction in transfer 
payments to the provinces.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	There is also a lack of faith when the finance minister proposes a 
timid reduction of employment insurance premiums, whose rate is 
well above the rate that the government and the minister could have 
set. Instead of granting a 10 cent reduction, the minister could 
easily have lowered the rate by 30 cents, as we will see later.
<P>
	There is also a lack of faith when the finance minister announces 
that $800 million will be earmarked for the creation of the Canada 
Foundation for Innovation. That money will come from the savings 
made through reduced transfer payments to the provinces. In fact, 
it is the provinces that will pay for this investment.
<P>
	Let us look at the reduction of the deficit, which the finance 
minister is so proud of. The minister is very cynical when he boasts 
about the early success of his fight against the deficit.
<P>
	Yesterday, he said, and I quote: ``For 1998-99, the government's 
deficit target is $9 billion''. The minister is therefore talking about 
a partial deficit, without ever setting a deadline for a zero deficit in 
his budget, as several provinces did, including Quebec.
<P>
	We all know that the finance minister refuses to give a date, at 
least for the time being. The minister, who is driven by fear, is 
probably waiting for the next election campaign, which is not too 
far away. He will then engage in grandstanding in setting a deadline 
for his zero deficit, because he will have given himself enough 
flexibility to set a date depending on the circumstances.
<P>
	This timid attitude, to say the least, goes against the very idea of 
a long term budgetary plan, and illustrates the essentially 
demagogic nature of the budget tabled yesterday by the finance 
minister. However, this lack of rigour on the government's part is 
not the real issue. The real issue is the source of the funds used to 
fight the deficit, something which the minister is so proud of.
<P>
	It was precisely this that the Minister of Finance touched on 
yesterday when he said, and I quote: ``The fact is that by 1998-99, 
government spending on  everything but the debt will have been 
reduced from $120 billion in 1993-94 to $103.5 billion''.
<P>
	Once again, we must put these statements by the minister in 
context. Yes, spending has been reduced, but how? Now we know 
that it has been almost entirely by offloading the deficit onto the 
backs of the provinces. This reduced federal spending is largely an 
illusion.
<P>
	Let us return to a major sticking point in yesterday's budget: the 
reduced EI premiums. As we have said repeatedly, these premiums 
are well beyond the objectives that could have been reached in 
order to demonstrate leadership in this area, and that could have 
been an effective job creation measure.
<P>
	Let us also return to the creation of the Canadian Foundation for 
Innovation. Once again, this is a measure that owes its existence to 
money taken from savings generated through decreases in 
provincial transfer payments.
<P>
	A second thing we notice in examining this budget is the sly 
interference of the federal government in matters of provincial 
jurisdiction. An examination of measures over the last three years 
reveals three areas where the government has shown a lack of good 
faith.
<P>
	First, the piecemeal approach when it comes to the promises 
regarding benefits for children living in poverty: $70 million seems 
completely ridiculous, if you consider the role of this government 
in contributing to child poverty, which has done nothing but get 
worse since this government came to power.
<P>
	I would like to quote a brief passage from the Liberals' red book, 
which reads as follows, on page 15:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Today, after nine years of Conservative government, Canadians are facing 
hardship: 1.6 million unemployed, millions more on welfare, a million children 
living below the poverty line, record numbers of bankruptcies and bank closings.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	Here is another quote taken from real life, straight from 
Statistics Canada: ``After three years under the Liberals, the 
country is still in a sorry state: 1.5 million Canadians are 
unemployed, nearly 3 million are on welfare, 1.5 million children 
live in poverty, 500,000 more than three years ago, and the number 
of bankruptcies, 86,253 between January and November 1996, has 
also reached record levels''. We understand perfectly why before 
he resigned from the Liberal Party, our colleague from York 
South-Weston said: ``We accused Conservatives of every possible 
evil, and I am resigning because we are doing exactly the same 
thing they did''. People had certain expectations with respect to 
child poverty.
<P>
	How can we believe this government if we consider it failed to 
inject $720 million in child care, a promise that was not kept, like 
the GST?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8337"> 8337 </A></B>
<P>
	Second, more band-aid solutions, when we consider promises 
in other areas that are strictly matters of provincial jurisdiction. 
This is an amazing attitude on the part of the Minister of Finance. 
He savagely cuts transfer payments to the provinces, which 
undermines provincial objectives to fight poverty and 
unemployment, and meanwhile he is interfering in provincial 
jurisdictions with his pre-electoral gestures. We know perfectly 
well the government cut $4.5 billion in transfer payments to the 
provinces which are used for social programs. It also took $5 
billion out of the unemployment insurance fund, which in the end 
comes out of the pockets of Canadians.
<P>
	What is going on? The problem is that the unemployed are 
receiving fewer benefits that are becoming increasingly difficult to 
obtain and are getting them for a shorter period of time. Thousands 
of people will never have unemployment insurance, even if they 
did work. So today, they tend to end up on welfare much faster. 
Transfers to the provinces for social assistance have been cut.
<P>
	When the government says it is doing something about poverty, 
it is just putting a band-aid on a problem the government itself 
created and which has not changed from what it was three years 
ago, when the Conservatives were loudly condemned by this 
government.
<P>
	Finally, as you saw earlier during question period, no 
commitment was made or will be made in this budget to 
compensate Quebec for the cost of harmonizing the GST, a demand 
that has been voiced repeatedly for a number of weeks, especially 
by the Quebec Minister of Finance.
<P>
	We know the government has just transferred $1 billion to the 
maritimes, and as my colleague from Longueuil explained earlier, 
when you transfer $1 billion from the federal government to the 
governments of the maritimes, this is $250 million which comes 
out of the pockets of Quebecers, since Quebecers provide Ottawa 
with one quarter of its revenue. So they took $250 million out of 
the pockets of Quebecers to send it to the maritimes, because they 
were harmonizing their provincial sales taxes with the GST. 
Quebec has claimed compensation for nearly $2 billion and will 
not get a penny. That is the story of the GST.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This budget is an electoral budget but it is also a lousy budget. 
The minister of finance did a lousy job on this budget. The minister 
had every opportunity to do something. He had a margin in which 
to manoeuvre; in fact $8 billion under the targeted deficit if we 
include in the $5 billion the $3 billion that was set aside for bad 
eventualities.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois produced three reports recently, trying to 
show the government through an analysis of the fiscality that it 
would be perfectly possible through the  fiscality, through the 
underground economy and by implementing some measures 
suggested by the auditor general to get $6 billion more.
<P>
	It is possible to get a $14 billion margin. It is a real possibility. 
With this margin we should have expected the minister to do 
something. It would have been quite possible to still target zero 
deficit for the year 2000 but at the same time to give back to the 
provinces the $4.5 billion taken for social programs and to put back 
into the unemployment insurance fund the $5 billions taken from 
there to give more protection to the unemployed and maybe to use a 
30 cent reduction on fees instead of 10 cents. But that is not what 
the minister has done.
<P>
	Of course, this budget is an electoral budget, we all know it. We 
are going into an election, as everybody seems to understand. The 
election will be a very strange one in comparison with the one of 
1993. In 1993, 54 members of the Bloc were elected from Quebec 
and, to the surprise of all Canadians and to our own surprise, we 
became the official opposition here.
<P>
	This time there will not be any surprise. We will very easily elect 
55 members of the Bloc back into the House of Commons. It is now 
possible for Canadians to replace the Bloc as the opposition, if they 
so wish, if they think we did not do a good job as opposition, by 
electing an opposition from another party. If they do not, we have 
to admit that we will be elected as the official opposition not only 
by Quebecers but by all Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In conclusion, this budget needs to be seen as what it is: a 
vote-seeking budget, a do-nothing budget which does not come up 
to expectations, and for what it is absolutely not: a tax-reforming 
budget.
<P>
	We know, Canadians and Quebecers know, that the rich in this 
country do not pay as much tax as they should. The minister has 
been urged repeatedly to really reform the Canadian tax system, but 
there is nothing in this regard in the budget.
<P>
	To give a precise example, the family trusts, we know that they 
all beat it for the U.S. not so long ago, and got out of paying an 
amount estimated at between $500 and $600 million in taxes. Six 
hundred million dollars is exactly what will be given to poor 
children over the next two, three or four years. Two companies 
belonging to the same group left without paying taxes, and the 
government did not react.
<P>
	Nor are there any job creation measures. Jobs, jobs, jobs, if 
anyone can find any, let them tell us where. There will be no hope 
for Canadians or Quebecers with this budget as far as job creation 
is concerned. All that the minister and the Prime Minister say is 
that it is up to the market to create jobs, and we must set up the 
necessary conditions for jobs to be created.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8338"> 8338 </A></B>
<P>
	We need look no further than the banks, which have made 
record profits in the past two years, but are now responsible for 
record layoffs as well. Before telling us that private companies 
create jobs, maybe a thorough analysis ought to be done.
<P>
	There is nothing about the GST and Quebec. Where is the 
fairness here? There is a double standard; the maritimes get money, 
Quebec does not. And they will go on cutting benefits to the 
unemployed and cutting social programs, while the minister is 
madly patting himself on the back, claiming he has managed to 
fight the deficit with his budget.
<P>
	We are heading toward an election, and the Liberals will be 
judged accordingly.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
[English] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is budget time and with all the rhetoric around the tax 
and spending plans of the Liberals of our money, in other words the 
people's money, the money and the wealth created by Canadians, 
not the government, with all this talk people sometimes become fed 
up and rather cynical.
<P>
	What flows from that is the notion of average Canadians that the 
government always paints a rather rosy picture. When was the last 
time we heard a federal Conservative or Liberal government admit 
that things were not very rosy? Canadians then just tune out. They 
tune out of the budget debate. They tune out of all the commentary 
about finances. They say ``The government brags and so we really 
cannot listen to them. We have the Bloc and it seems to always 
resort to rather self-centred whining about how hard done by 
Quebec is. It is always the message from the separatists of 
wanting''. Quite frequently they use the word demanding.
<P>
	Opposition parties have an obligation to compliment the 
government when the government goes in the right direction. When 
it comes to being critical the opposition must go beyond just 
cynicism and criticism but offer practical, credible alternatives that 
can stand the test of public examination.
<P>
	I put it to the member of the Bloc, and he is being very negative 
in his tone, what are his solutions to contribute to Canada? What is 
the Bloc prepared to do to make Canada work rather than opt out? 
What is the member prepared to offer as a fiscal alternative to help 
all of Canada, including Canadians in Quebec, rather than just 
complaining and offering to opt out?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pomerleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, my colleague said many citizens 
will tune out when we speak about the budget. They will not tune 
out when the time comes for the election.
<P>
	What did we produce in a practical way to help the government 
to establish a good budget? Today we are  giving our opinion on 
this budget and our opinion is that this budget is not very good at 
all. But we did a lot of work for the government. I am sure in 
certain fields the Reform Party also did some work in presenting 
some analysis to the government.
<P>
	We produced three reports on fiscality, a study well done. We 
received congratulations from the Minister of Finance for having 
done so. These were reports on three studies that showed clearly 
point by point through an analysis that if we would review the 
fiscality in this country we would probably be able to save right 
now $6 billion that could be used to put back into programs for 
employment.
<P>
	We are not trying to opt out of the government. We are trying to 
help. If we want to help the government, the government has to 
help itself. With this budget, when we see that it has a full margin 
to act and it does not do anything, it is saying that it will help poor 
people, but it put $600 million for the poor children. That is the 
same amount of money that it let go with the fiducies familiales to 
the United States. That is only one or two companies that did that.
<P>
	We are trying to help. We offered some analysis but nobody 
listened.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
quote remarks by Alain Dubuc, a journalist and economist, in <I>La 
Presse</I>. He said he was a federalist in the last referendum.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	Just to give his remarks a little credibility, because there are 
people in the government and in my party who say that we behave 
this way because we are separatists, he himself said that the federal 
government has cut $6.8 billion, including $2.5 billion this year, in 
funding to the provinces over the past three years.
<P>
	That means that the provinces have to face this cut and continue 
to pay the same percentage of taxes. If the government is cutting 
money to the provinces, it should also cut the taxes and revenues it 
takes out of the provinces. The provinces are getting it both coming 
and going. And, in return, they get what Alain Dubuc of <I>La Presse</I> 
describes as the big box of Smarties. In other words, they sprinkle 
little treats here and there just so they can say they are doing 
something for health, for poor children, and so forth.
<P>
	I would ask my colleague to comment on this example. 
According to Alain Dubuc, and it is easy to calculate: In the case of 
poor children, the federal government and the Minister of Finance 
say they are helping poor children, but the figure works out to be 
$28 a year per child. That is, 53 cents a week per child. It hardly 
pays for a litre of milk per child.

	So you can see how ridiculous it is to gloat that, as $2 billion 
is being taken away from Quebec, poor children are being given 
53 cents a week. My colleague made an excellent speech. I would 
like his comments, because I find this way of going about things 
totally ridiculous.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pomerleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for his 
excellent question. As we can see from my hon. colleague's 
breakdown of figures, what this budget, tabled by a minister who 
claims he wants to seriously look after poor children, provides for 
is 53 cents per week per child in Canada. We can also see that, over 
the past three years, instead of improving, the situation of poor 
children in Canada has in fact deteriorated.
<P>
	When the Liberals were criticizing the Conservatives in their red 
book, they indicated that there were 1 million children living in 
poverty in Canada. There are now 1.5 million poor children in 
Canada, which means that their number has increased by 500,000 
in the last three years. Poor children do not appear out of thin air. If 
their numbers are growing, it is because the overall economic 
situation is deteriorating, because more and more people are 
unemployed and on welfare.
<P>
	While it is content with giving 53 cents per week to poor 
children and brag about it, as my hon. colleague said, the 
government is letting family trusts move to the U.S. depriving the 
government of $600 million in tax revenue. That is what this 
budget is all about and the kind of work that has been accomplished 
these past three years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing 
my time with the hon. member for Fundy-Royal.
<P>
	The budget tabled by the Minister of Finance is good news as 
regards job creation. This budget is in line with the federal 
government's long term strategy to improve the state of public 
finances, so as to create conditions that will promote employment, 
as well as short and long term growth.
<P>
	The government will also continue to invest in immediate and 
longer term initiatives to create jobs, which is a top priority for me 
and the federal government. Let us not forget that 715,000 new jobs 
were created since the Liberals took office, in 1993.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	Extending the federal infrastructure works program is an 
excellent example. The government will spend $425 million on 
that program, for a total of $600 million this year.
<P>
	I am also very pleased about job creation initiatives in rural 
areas, since my riding includes some large rural areas. In this 
regard, regional tourism will get increased support, through an 
amount of $50 million allocated to  the Business Development 
Bank of Canada, as well as an additional $45 million, over a three 
year period, to the Canadian Tourism Commission, and additional 
funding to the Farm Credit Corporation.
<P>
	Over the next three years, the federal government will allocate 
$1 billion for job creation initiatives for young people. The 
Minister of Human Resources Development recently announced 
that $225 million would be earmarked for the creation of jobs for 
young Canadians. These initiatives will provide a more promising 
future to many young Canadians who wish to join the labour force.
<P>
	I also want to mention the creation of the Canada Foundation for 
Innovation, an investment of $800 million by the government, 
which will ensure that Canadians remain on the cutting edge of 
research and technology, areas which will help our industries to 
remain competitive and to create jobs in the future.
<P>
	Given the Liberal government's sound economic management 
during the last three years, it is not surprising that private sector 
forecasters are expecting more than 300,000 jobs to be created this 
year and also next year. Having said that, I can assure the House 
that the Liberals will keep up their efforts to create jobs for all 
those Canadians who are still looking for work.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In the time remaining I would like to deal with some of the 
criticisms that the government has received with respect to job 
creation. I have already indicated that in the first three years of the 
Liberal government's mandate Statistics Canada confirms that 
approximately 715,000 net new jobs have been created by the 
Canadian economy. This compares to a net loss of 71,000 jobs 
during the last three years of the previous government's mandate. 
Under the previous Tory government the unemployment rate was at 
11.4 per cent at the time that the Liberal government was elected in 
1993.
<P>
	The current rate of unemployment is 9.7 per cent. This is 
obviously much too high. One person in Canada unemployed, 
seeking work and unable to find it is a human tragedy. There will 
never be an acceptable unemployment rate until unemployment is 
eradicated.
<P>
	I do not think it is a fair comment to indicate that because the 
official unemployment rate issued by Stats Canada is still at 9.7 per 
cent that the Liberal government's record on employment and 
setting the conditions that lead to employment creation is bad. 
Look at the 715,000 jobs that have been created by the Canadian 
economy in that time period.
<P>
	We still have 1.5 million unemployed people which is certainly 
not acceptable and is certainly a cause for concern to everyone, 
particularly to those people who are unemployed, but 715,000 
people have found jobs. The reason that the rate still remains as 
high as it does is because more people have come into the work 
force. This is something that the government cannot control. It can  
encourage people to obtain more training so that they will be in a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8340"> 8340 </A></B>
<P>
position to seek employment, but it does not preclude people from 
coming into the workforce.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	I do not believe the official unemployment rate is the proper 
indicator one should be looking at to measure the government's 
performance in job creation. It should be the total number of net 
jobs created.
<P>
	The opposition parties are saying that the government should 
provide tax relief. By giving Canadians tax relief, more disposable 
funds would be available for them to make purchases and this 
would stimulate the economy.
<P>
	I would like to draw the House's attention to the low interest 
rates which have the same effect. The government has managed the 
economy and has been able to reduce the deficit. It has shown 
responsible fiscal management and interest rates have dropped 
dramatically. They are at their lowest of the last several years.
<P>
	I have two examples of the savings and benefits that people can 
obtain. I quote a Royal Bank report from October 1996 on home 
ownership indicating that a five-year $100,000 mortgage has a 
payment of $765 per month. The same mortgage for the same term 
except for the higher interest rate in 1990 required monthly 
payments of $1,200. The Royal Bank indicates that this is the 
equivalent to receiving an $8,000 raise in salary. This is as a 
consequence of the lower interest rates.
<P>
	Similarly, on a new car loan of $15,000 over a four-year period, 
the lower interest rates today are resulting in savings of almost 
$500 per year. Again, that is an example of where money is being 
made available and is being freed up as a consequence of the fiscal 
management of the government and the lower interest rates.
<P>
	It has been necessary to have certain cuts in spending in certain 
programs that have led to the reduction of the deficit. That leads to 
the more favourable interest rates. Now that the deficit is being 
reduced and is below the finance minister's targets, he is able to 
start paying the dividend for the suffering that all Canadians had to 
endure over the last few years to reach this point.
<P>
	This budget shows Liberal vision. It shows Liberal values. The 
investments being made are in areas of child poverty, education, 
benefits for the disabled, research and development and also for the 
community action program for children.
<P>
	CAPC is a program that is receiving increased funding when it 
was scheduled to receive a reduction in funding. The community 
groups and agencies in my riding with which I have met were very 
concerned about the scheduled reduction in funding. I am sure they 
will be very happy to see that the CAPC program is not going to be 
reduced but will be increased.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> So you will know, there are only five minutes of 
questions and comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the hon. 
member's presentation, he talked about how the government is 
quite proud of its record on health care, education and jobs.
<P>
	The finance minister, of course, expressed that this morning. On 
a CBC television program, he said: ``We are going to focus our 
spending on things that really count to Canadians. That is what our 
values are: health care, education, children and job creation''. I 
guess the two are giving the same message.
<P>
	Those words are quite nice but when we look at reality and the 
record of this government on those issues, it is quite another story. 
When it comes to health care, we have seen a 40 per cent reduction 
in spending. There was a 40 per cent reduction in transfers to the 
provinces. Mr. Klein said 42 and that might be closer. I am not sure. 
That is the reality.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	It is the same thing for education. There has been a 40 per cent 
reduction in transfers to the provinces.
<P>
	With respect to job creation, unemployment rates are still at 
almost 10 per cent, compared to Japan at 3.4 per cent and the 
United States at 5.4 per cent. The record of this government on jobs 
is totally unacceptable.
<P>
	Beyond that, the hon. member talked about how the 
unemployment rate has actually dropped somewhat since the 
government took office. That is true, but we are looking at a larger 
than ever portion that is underemployed. There are far more people 
underemployed than under the Conservative government and there 
are far more people who are afraid of losing their jobs. The record 
on jobs is nothing to be proud of.
<P>
	I would like to ask the member to respond to the clear difference 
in the words, the actions and the record of this government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. DeVillers:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to correct the 
statement made that this member is proud of the government's 
record on health care and education. My submission did not deal 
with those issues. My submission dealt with the jobs record. That is 
something which I dealt with at length. It is something which I 
stand by. It is not good enough. It is never good enough. Any rate of 
unemployment is too high. However, what critics such as the 
Reformers neglect to look at is the actual number of jobs which 
have been created.
<P>
	The figure is there. The Statistics Canada figure indicates that 
715,000 jobs have been created by the Canadian economy in the 
last three years, compared to 71,000 jobs that were lost in the last 
three years of the Tory reign.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8341"> 8341 </A></B>
<P>
	The number is there. It is not an insignificant number. It is not 
good enough, but it is certainly something which I am prepared 
to stand by and be held accountable for during the next election 
campaign.
<P>
	The member asked my colleague from Kenora-Rainy River the 
same question with respect to the 40 per cent cut to health care. All 
I will do is repeat the answer. That 40 per cent deals with the cash 
part only. It does not take into account tax points. We have to look 
at the entire picture; we cannot only look at the cash points in the 
transfers.
<P>
	In the case of Ontario, the province with which I am most 
familiar, it amounts to 2.5 per cent of the total provincial budget. 
The provincial government is making draconian cuts to health care, 
education and to a lot of other areas. We know why. It is to fund the 
across the board tax cut of 30 per cent which that government, 
which is a friend of the Reform Party, promised the people of 
Ontario.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to ask the hon. member where he gets his 
math from.
<P>
	If in fact this government has created these 700,000 or 800,000 
jobs, why has that not affected the unemployment rate in Canada? 
If these are new jobs which have been created by this government, 
then in order for the unemployment rate to remain as stable as it has 
in the upper limits of 9 per cent, there must be jobs being lost on the 
other side because there are still 1.5 million people unemployed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. DeVillers:</B> Mr. Speaker, I dealt with that point in my speech. 
The number of people who are unemployed is still roughly the 
same because more people have come into the workforce. Some 
people have graduated from school. Other people have obtained 
training and are now in the workforce. Other people have realized 
that there is a possibility of getting a job now and that is why they 
have returned to the workforce.
<P>
	The government cannot control the number of people who enter 
the workforce. It can encourage people to enter the workforce, but 
it certainly cannot control who wants to be in the StatsCan figure 
and who does not.
<P>
<B>(1820 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
particularly pleased and honoured to rise today in the House of 
Commons to address the issue of the budget.
<P>
	Our fourth budget continues the plan that is important for 
Atlantic Canadians. It is of particular importance to the people of 
New Brunswick in my riding of Fundy-Royal.
<P>
	It is a plan that dwells on the competent fiscal and economic 
management that is reducing the deficit. It is a  plan that is aimed at 
creating and continuing to create a climate for jobs and economic 
growth in both the short term and the long term. It is a plan that 
ensures the long term future for effective sustainable social 
programs and that invests in a stronger society through education, 
health and our children.
<P>
	I will point out a few facts that have become very important 
especially to the people in my riding. Our fourth budget announces 
that this year's deficit is the lowest in 15 years. It represents the 
largest year over year decline in the federal deficit ever. By 1999 
we will no longer need to borrow any new money from financial 
markets and we will have the lowest deficit in the G-7.
<P>
	Our fourth budget is also the latest instalment in our efforts to 
clean up the unprecedented fiscal and economic mess that was left 
behind by previous governments. In January 1994 the deficit was at 
$42 billion and our unemployment rate stood at 11.4 per cent. Our 
indebtedness was threatening our very future and the very future of 
the social programs that are of such vital importance to Canadians, 
especially Atlantic Canadians. No wonder so many Canadians had 
given up hope until 1993. What a difference four Liberal budgets 
have made.
<P>
	One thing our budget does not do is to sacrifice sound economic 
management and wise economic investments for short term 
political expediency. Other parties are only too keen to play politics 
with questionable across the board tax schemes, but this is not what 
Canadians want. With this our fourth budget we are trying not to let 
Canadians down.
<P>
	When we took office Canadians knew that we needed to take 
tough decisions and that fundamental reforms were required. When 
we took office in 1993 Canada's fiscal mess was jeopardizing the 
very future of our cherished social programs. With more money 
going to bankers each year than to social programs, their prospects 
were increasingly bleak.
<P>
	Throughout our mandate our government has taken steps to save 
Canada's social safety net. In just three and a half years, we have 
reformed all aspects of our social safety net. All aspects of our 
social safety net have been reformed: a new employment insurance 
system; a new Canada health and social transfer which provides the 
flexibility and certainty that provinces need to deliver services in 
health, post-secondary education and social assistance; an $11 
billion cash floor in the CHST, not a cash ceiling; and a new seniors 
benefit which was created to better target those seniors in our 
society in the most need without affecting current seniors.
<P>
<B>(1825 )</B>
<P>
	When we took office in 1993, Canadians had lost confidence but 
we knew that Canadians elected a Liberal government because they 
<P>

<B><A NAME="8342"> 8342 </A></B>
<P>
trusted us to make decisions  with compassion. We are building the 
social safety net of the future.
<P>
	The 1997 budget announces the Canada child tax benefit, 
targeting more assistance to over a million Canadian families and 
their children to help those families escape the welfare trap.
<P>
	Our youth employment strategy was announced to provide job 
opportunities for 110,000 young Canadians and to give young 
Canadians improved access to the federal youth programs which 
are presently worth more than $2 billion. We also believe it is 
important to ensure that all of our young people have access to 
good education. We have improved the system of student loans and 
education credits.
<P>
	We have allocated $800 million for a new Canada innovation 
foundation which will be particularly helpful to our hospitals and 
universities in the province of New Brunswick.
<P>
	We know that governments working together can do a better job 
in labour market training. Recognizing this, the federal government 
has turned over administration of labour market training to the 
provinces. As everyone knows, Alberta and New Brunswick have 
already signed ground breaking agreements.
<P>
	The National Forum on Health recently made a number of 
recommendations to improve health care. The 1997 budget 
provides for $300 million over the next three years to implement 
key recommendations of the national forum. Social union 
discussions between the federal and provincial governments are 
setting out our principles of the safety net for the future and the 
management of our future.
<P>
	Our commitment to the principles of the Canada Health Act is 
unequivocal. These principles will be enforced as they have been 
throughout our mandate. We will not only protect medicare, we 
will work in partnership with the provinces to improve it and to 
strengthen it.
<P>
	We will take action to ensure that our health care dollars are 
spent more effectively and efficiently. We will bring the system up 
to date to respond to the changing health needs of Canadians and to 
respond to the advances which are being made to medical practices.
<P>
	The National Forum on Health stated that the transition to a 
better system in the future requires some targeted investments 
today. That is why our fourth budget provides $300 million over 
the next three years to implement key recommendations of the 
national forum. Every single dollar will go to the delivery of better 
health care for Canadians.
<P>
	We are also providing $150 million over the next three years for 
the health transition fund to help provinces launch pilot projects to 
investigate new and better approaches to health care. I believe the 
province of  New Brunswick is already on the leading edge of 
developing important new projects for this important transition 
fund.
<P>
	As I conclude, it is important to remember that today while 
unemployment is at 9.7 per cent, we will not be satisfied until every 
Canadian and every New Brunswicker who wants to work can get a 
job. We need to build on what works. Despite the cutbacks in the 
public sector, we have created 700,000 jobs since 1994. This year 
alone we will create 300,000 new jobs. Our jobs strategy is 
working.
<P>

<B>(1900)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADIANSECURITIESCOMMISSION">CANADIAN SECURITIES COMMISSION</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
establishment of a national securities commission is an idea that 
has been around for close to 30 years, but until recently there has 
been little progress.
<P>
	The issue has become more prevalent in recent years because of 
the ever-changing nature of investment and trade. This is the era of 
the globalization of trade and Canada must remain competitive. To 
do so, Canada must  facilitate market investment. If we cannot 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8345"> 8345 </A></B>
<P>
encourage investment we will lose our competitive edge in the 
broader global market.
<P>
	In recent years, Canada has witnessed the creation of 
conglomerates in the financial industry. This has generated a dire 
need for regulation and, if this does not occur, Canadian investment 
will suffer severely.
<P>
	Unlike most other countries, Canada has a securities commission 
in each province and territory. This requires a company to go 
through the same procedure numerous times. A company wanting 
to sell shares in several provinces must gain approval from the 
securities commission in each one. This requires the company to 
file both its prospectus and disclosure many times. It is tedious and 
expensive, creating a great deal of uncertainty and duplication.
<P>
	Companies are also discouraged by the different standards of the 
various provincial commissions. This complicated situation has 
resulted in companies opting for the single filing system in the 
United States. Many Canadian companies are choosing to file on 
U.S. exchanges such as NASDAQ. This is precisely how the 
numerous provincial commissions hurt the Canadian investment 
market. Costly duplication and differing standards discourage 
Canadian companies from listing on Canadian exchanges. 
Canadian exchanges are losing high quality companies to other 
countries.
<P>
	Because of the current situation, I have seen Canadian 
companies that were funded by Canadian research grants using 
Canadian graduates, Canadian expertise develop a new technology 
that become a commercial success by going to a U.S. exchange to 
raise capital. We have the ridiculous situation now where Canadian 
companies are encouraged to become foreign companies and to 
move their operations outside Canada, denying jobs to Canadians. 
This must be stopped.
<P>
	Why is it that the management of Canadian exchanges generally 
favour a national commission and the provinces do not? This is not 
a political question but an economic one which must be addressed.
<P>
	The solution to this problem is to create a centralized agency 
which can increase efficiency, standardize regulation and reduce 
the costs involved in investment. The current system is not good 
enough. Canada risks losing much of its high quality investments 
to the United States if it does not facilitate these companies.
<P>
	As the member for Waterloo riding, I am particularly concerned 
with this issue because of its important impact on my community. 
Waterloo is a member of the Canadian technology triangle and is an 
important contributor to Canada's profile on the global market. 
Waterloo companies are extremely dependent on their investment 
potential throughout Canada.
<P>
	We must encourage the Canadian economy through every means 
possible. This would entail a transition from  the provincial 
securities commissions to a centralized national commission which 
would be more efficient and less costly.
<P>
	This is not a political question but an economic one. Our 
economic interests are at stake. If Canada is to remain a forerunner 
in the global market, we must facilitate investment interests in a 
national securities commission.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the 
hon. member for Waterloo for his question on the Canadian 
securities commission initiative.
<P>
	The federal government became involved with the Canadian 
securities commission initiative as a result of the request from 
provinces. The objective is to improve on the existing system of 
securities regulation in Canada whereby the capital market 
participants have to deal right now with up to 12 different 
regulators. We are prepared, at the federal level, to facilitate the 
process.
<P>
	Regulatory duplication creates uncertainty and adds to the cost 
of raising capital in Canada. It may be motivating some Canadian 
companies to raise capital in other markets. It may also be 
deterring some global issuers from selling their securities in 
Canada.
<P>
<B>(1905)</B>
<P>
	For some months now, federal and provincial officials have been 
developing a memorandum of understanding which would set out 
the possible parameters of a Canadian securities commission. We 
have been talking about a voluntary arrangement whereby 
participating provinces would delegate the authority to regulate 
securities in their jurisdiction to the Canadian securities 
commission. Provinces who do not wish to participate will 
continue with their existing securities regulations.
<P>
	We are talking about a regime with one set of rules applied 
across all participating provinces, a single agency with a number of 
regional offices capable of providing one-stop service yet at the 
same time maintaining the strengths of our regional capital 
markets.
<P>
	Work on the memorandum of understanding has now been 
completed and it has been forwarded to the provinces for their 
response.
<P>
	While we believe that a Canadian securities commission would 
make an important contribution to the efficiency of Canadian 
capital markets, the decision to proceed further with the 
establishment of a Canadian securities commission rests with the 
provinces.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance has asked the provincial ministers 
responsible to respond in the very near future regarding their 
interest in proceeding. If there is sufficient interest, a process will 
be established to ensure the timely implementation of a Canadian 
securities commission.
<P>
	I hope this responds to my hon. friend's question.
<P>

<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="EXPORTS">EXPORTS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Bill Graham (Rosedale, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak 
on the matter of a question I asked the Minister for International 
Trade on October 23 about Canadian exports. In the minister's 
response to my question, he made two points that I thought were 
very important.
<P>
	The first point was that our merchandise exports are sufficiently 
high in terms of the surplus over our imports to counteract what has 
previously been an unfavourable balance for us in invisible trade. 
That means our current accounts are now in a surplus position in 
Canada for the first time in something like 22 years. That is largely 
due to a lot of aggressive moves by the government which I would 
like to refer to later. However it is important that the Canadian 
public focus on the fact that it is not just our exports that are in 
surplus now, but it is our total current accounts which are in 
surplus. This is an extremely important development for the 
Canadian economy.
<P>
	The second point the minister made was that much of the success 
in the export market that has been made recently has been due to 
efforts of small and medium size businesses. The committee on 
foreign affairs and international trade recently prepared a report on 
small and medium size businesses and the export trade.
<P>
	In that report we found that small and medium size businesses 
are being much more aggressive in areas of export than they had 
been before. They are becoming familiar with the tools which 
government provides them with, such as the Export Development 
Corporation which in turn is working with the banks to enable 
better financing mechanisms for exports. They are better using our 
trade commissioner services. They are using team Canada and 
going on team Canada missions when team Canada goes abroad. 
They are participating also through their provinces and 
municipalities in a way to ensure that they have access to exports.
<P>
	We found something else about small and medium size 
businesses and their access to exports that is very important for this 
country. We have a tremendously talented pool of people in the 
multicultural communities of our country who speak languages 
other than English and French and who have knowledge of other 
cultures, business cultures.
<P>
	In my own riding of Rosedale in downtown Toronto, there are 
areas where over 50 languages are spoken. I speak to many of these 
people. Some of them are now forming small and medium size 
businesses. They are able to export their products to the 
communities where they came from because they have access to 
those communities. They know those markets. This is an 
enormously rich pool for us to develop. This government is to be 
congratulated on reaching out to that community and seeking to 
enable it to be effective in these markets.
<P>
	Finally, the other thing we have to draw attention to in this area 
is the fact that many of our exports are now directed toward the 
service industry. Services now represent about 60 per cent of the 
GDP of modern economies. I am informed that in Toronto over55 per cent of all services are traded services.
<P>
<B>(1910 )</B>
<P>
	A report prepared by the Boston consulting group, sponsored by 
the Bank of Nova Scotia, shows the importance of the financial 
services to the Toronto economy.
<P>
	This is key to the future because these are traded services and 
therefore require a marketplace within the domestic economy 
which will enable them to reach out into the international economy. 
We must be conscious of the fact that we have to make sure that in 
this country we have an appropriate domestic marketplace that will 
enable these companies to grow and develop in the service field, 
particularly in the financial field in modern cities like Toronto, 
Montreal, Vancouver and other important financial centres.
<P>
	This means we must focus on ensuring that we have a free 
market within Canada. We have to perfect our national markets. We 
have to insure that we are not impeding but helping our financial 
services providers to be part of the international community as well 
as the domestic community.
<P>
	The people from small and medium size businesses who came 
before us in the committee told us that they are now competing in 
the domestic economy as well as internationally. We must make 
sure we have both. In so doing, we must ensure that we have the 
multilateral as well as the bilateral mechanisms in place.
<P>
	Finally, in that respect we should congratulate the government 
on signing the Canada-Chile free trade agreement, which is one 
more way to ensure that we will have access to those important 
developing Latin markets which will complement our exports 
outside of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
for International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
respond to the comments from my colleague, the hon. member for 
Rosedale.
<P>
	I do not think there are many people in the House who are as 
articulate when it comes to dealing in the realm of foreign policy, 
both trade and others. There are many times that I seek his wise 
guidance, as does the minister.
<P>
	The questions he raises and the comments he made are quite 
true. This year has been a record year for Canadian exports. Indeed, 
Canada is now exporting almost $1 billion of goods and services 
every single working day. We have seen our trade surplus continue 
to mount over the last few years.
<P>
	This year the trade surplus has increased by 20 per cent in excess 
of $34 billion. In the last three years  exports have increased by47 per cent. Our GDP as it relates to trade is now at an all time high 
of almost 40 per cent. Some have put it over 40 per cent. So it is 
very clear that Canada's success in trade is driving the engine of 
<P>

<B><A NAME="8347"> 8347 </A></B>
<P>
recovery. It is the engine which is producing the jobs in the 
economy and wealth for Canadians.
<P>
	The member spoke about the importance of the service sector. 
He is entirely correct. For the last number of years as our trade and 
our surplus in goods and products has grown, we have lagged 
behind in services.
<P>
	I would like to say to the hon. member that according to the 
statistics that came out today, for the first time in 12 years Canada 
has posted a surplus not just on the goods side but on the service 
sector side. That is very positive news for the movement in that 
sector of the Canadian economy.
<P>
	The member speaks about the importance of small and medium 
size enterprises. The government could not agree more. It knows 
that the continued success of trade abroad will continue and will 
sometimes be led by large companies. But the success we are most 
proud of are in the small and medium size enterprises whose people
<P>
accompanied the Prime Minister, the minister of trade and other 
members of Parliament along with me around the globe. They are 
truly showing the entrepreneurial spirit in the Canadian economy. 
And this is what will continue to lead in the creation of jobs and 
growth both domestically and abroad.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> It being 7.15 p.m., the 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to our 
standing orders.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 7.15 p.m.)
