	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
have the honour to table, in both official languages, the 15th 
report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts. In this 
15th report, dealing with the Atlantic Region Freight Assistance 
Program, the committee makes a series of recommendations to 
the National Transportation Agency, the Department of 
Transport, and the Treasury Board.
<P>
<B>(1005) </B>
<P>
	Appended to this report is the dissenting opinion by the 
official opposition containing the two following 
recommendations. I quote: ``That the Department of Transport 
assess the impact on employment of abolition of the Atlantic 
Region Freight Assistance (ARFA) subsidy. The government 
should then emphasize job creation programs in the affected 
regions in a way that reflects the Department's findings''.
<P>
	There is also a second recommendation: ``That the 
government review the amounts allocated under the 1995 
Budget as compensation for abolition of freight subsidies, so 
that the assistance provided represents the same 
compensation:subsidy ratio for the Atlantic Region Freight 
Assistance Program''.
<P>
	Pursuant to Standing Order 109, the committee requests that 
the government table a comprehensive response to this report.

	<B>Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos (Saint-Denis, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I have the honour to table, in both official languages, 
the seventh report of the Standing Committee on Citizenship 
and Immigration, dealing with refugees, immigration and 
gender. In recent months, the committee has considered the 
extent to which gender can prevent women from obtaining 
refugee status in Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14410"> 14410 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Our report encourages ongoing sensitization of those 
involved in the refugee selection process and considers how to 
reduce the systemic barriers which deny women an equal 
opportunity to obtain protection in this country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In closing, I would like to thank all the members of the 
committee, as well as the staff of the House, for their 
contribution to this report.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
Bloc Quebecois is tabling a minority report dealing with refugee 
status claims made for gender related reasons, as was proposed 
by the Bloc Quebecois members of the committee.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Even now we agree with the main orientation of this majority 
report. We cannot agree on its contents because it is too vague in 
the wording and too weak.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In particular, we cannot agree with the immigration tax. We 
would also like gender to be included in the legislation as a sixth 
prohibited ground for discrimination against women.

	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
have the honour to present the ninth report of the Standing 
Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food examining the impact 
of the elimination of the Western Grain Transportation Act, the 
Atlantic Region Freight Assistance Act, the Maritime Freight 
Rates Act and the Feed Freight Assistance Act.
<P>
	The report is entitled ``Dismantling the Crow: Curbing the 
Impacts''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
the Bloc Quebecois members of the Standing Committee on 
Agriculture and Agri-Food have appended a dissenting report to 
the report that my colleague from Malpèque has just tabled. We 
wanted to table a dissenting report in order to highlight the 
inequity that now exists between western and eastern farm 
producers in Canada.
<P>
	One thing we pointed out was discrepancies in the 
abandonment of rail lines. For example, in the west, the public 
interest is the criterion for closing a line, while in the east, 
economic cost effectiveness is the criterion. For several reasons 
of that sort, we had to append a dissenting report.

member's bill is to amend the Canada Business Corporations 
Act to limit to 10 the number of concurrent directorships that 
one person can hold at any time.
<P>
	The responsibilities of a director are broad and very serious 
and as such there must be a point at which one cannot fully 
discharge those responsibilities without jeopardizing the 
interest of investors, the company or its employees.
<P>
	Therefore I look forward to debating the bill with my 
colleagues in the House.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Concerning the announcement in the last budget of a decrease in the 
number of civil servants by 45,000, what number of these positions are 
expected to be eliminated by (<I>a</I>) not refilling positions which are now vacant,

	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister Responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> The 
February budget announced a reduction in the size of the public 
service and the federal sector as a whole, including the military, 
separate agencies and crown corporations, as a result of program 
review. An estimated 45,000 positions will be affected over 
three years.
<P>
	The figure 45,000 is not on its own a target but is the result of 
the government's program review decisions,  whereby a number 
of programs and activities are being reduced, eliminated or 
re-engineered. It is an estimate based on the overall savings 
targets established in the budget and the structure of program 
costs.
<P>
	During the government's program review some estimates 
were derived of how the downsizing is expected to unfold, 
broadly speaking.
<P>
	For example, about 6,000 jobs will be transferred to the 
private sector. There will also be some natural attribution 
through voluntary departures and transfers.
<P>
	Two separation programs have been put in place to assist 
organizations to cope with their personnel downsizing: early 
retirement incentive, ERI, and early departure incentive, EDI. 
Projected take-up for each program is included in the tentative 
allocation of projected reductions in personnel set out in the 
following table.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
very pleased to address the House at third reading of Bill C-85, 
an act to amend the Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances 
Act.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	The issue of MPs' pensions is, of course, of interest to all 
members of this House and to Canadians in general.
<P>
	This is an issue that demands leadership. However, in 
showing leadership, the government and members must 
carefully consider all aspects of MPs' and senators' 
remuneration.
<P>
	The issue itself is complex and contentious, a fact that makes 
it hard to address in a partial or even a general manner. That said, 
during its election campaign our government made certain 
promises it intended to keep once it came to power. The red book 
emphasized two aspects in particular of the MPs' pension 
scheme that were to be the subject of reform.
<P>
	I shall take the liberty of quoting directly an excerpt from 
page 92 of the red book: ``The pension regime of members of 
Parliament has been the focus of considerable controversy. 
-We believe that reform is necessary''.
<P>
	Our government has now taken action. The changes we 
planned to the MPs' pension scheme will be made when Bill 
C-85 is passed. The red book stated, and I quote: ``A Liberal 
government will reform the pension plan of members of 
Parliament to end ``double-dipping''. MPs should not be able to 
leave office and receive a pension from the federal government 
if they accept a new full-paying job from the federal 
government. In addition, we will review the question of the 
minimum age at which pensions will begin to be paid''. The 
Liberal government had made a commitment to keeping those 
promises.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	However, the government has gone further. It will put into 
place a number of additional changes that will enhance the 
needed reform of MP pensions, changes that will provide for 
former members who have become disabled, equitable support 
for common law spouses, the option for members of this 
Parliament to determine their continued participation in this 
plan, which is a direct result of the request put to the Prime 
Minister on January 21, 1994 by the Reform House leader on 
behalf of his party.
<P>
	Furthermore, a direct savings of millions of dollars due to a 20 
per cent reduction in benefits to all MPs will be realized.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Let me be clear. This government consulted; this government 
listened; this government acted. Here are the facts: 
double-dipping eliminated; minimum age set at 55 years; 
optional participation offered to MPs in this Parliament; and 
$3.3 million saved for the  government-in other words, 33 per 
cent lower costs to Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	On February 22, 1995, immediately before the Minister of 
Finance tabled the Budget that would strike a mighty blow to the 
deficit, the President of the Treasury Board announced that our 
government intended to reform the MP's pension scheme. He 
also tabled Bill C-85 on April 28, 1995, and spoke when that bill 
was tabled for second reading on May 4, 1995. The President of 
the Treasury Board also testified before the Standing Committee 
on Procedure and House Affairs on May 30, 1995. As well, I was 
given the opportunity of speaking to you when this bill was 
tabled for third reading.
<P>
	This debate, which has continued for eight months, has also 
included a full day of consideration by the House of a motion 
made on this matter on Opposition Day and, of course, the 
appearance of expert witnesses before the Standing Committee. 
Over 20 hours of debate-and I must say it was often tough 
debate-have been devoted to this bill thus far.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	The official opposition has presented some interesting and 
quite often constructive ideas on this issue, which is a thorny 
and difficult one.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The third party is engaged in often rancorous debate and 
highlighted a number of issues that are of importance, 
particularly the issue of salaries. Because we are in an area of 
fiscal restraint it is vital to note that Bill C-85 only deals with 
pensions. We will not and cannot act to raise the salaries and 
other benefits of members of Parliament at this time.
<P>
	We will respect the legislated salary freeze on employees and 
continue to demonstrate leadership in putting Canada's fiscal 
house in order.
<P>
	Members of the standing committee heard testimony from 
expert witnesses, including a taxpayers' group, that had the 
same theme. The issue surrounding the greater issue of 
compensation must be addressed, pensions must be reduced and 
salaries increased.
<P>
	This was also the viewpoint expressed by the pension experts 
from the private pension consulting firm, Sobeco, Ernst &amp; 
Young. It was the same as that of Professor C.E.S. Franks of 
Queen's University, a member of the Lapointe commission. It 
was the testimony of a former member of Parliament and 
actuary, Paul McCrossan. It was supported by Robert Fleming, a 
former administrator of the Ontario legislature. It was even put 
forward by the very group that puts hundreds of little plastic 
animals on the lawn of the House.
<P>
	This total compensation approach is supported by the 
government in principle. However, as I mentioned at the outset, 
in practice we must carefully consider all elements of 
compensation. Salaries cannot and will not be increased.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14418"> 14418 </A></B>
<P>
	At the risk of repeating myself, I will again state that the 
government has demonstrated leadership by reducing pensions 
for MPs, by going beyond what it had promised. This will have 
the net effect of reducing total compensation. Unfortunately this 
is the reality Parliament must face in today's economic climate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would now like to focus on the major elements of Bill C-85, 
and perhaps to correct some of the errors of interpretation that 
have crept in. I certainly would not want the honourable 
members on the other side of the chamber to voice their views 
about the bill without having accurate information.
<P>
	Bill C-85 restricts double dipping. It will apply to any future 
appointment, to any renewal of an appointment, and to any 
contract signed after the date on which the bill obtains royal 
assent.
<P>
	Former senators will be subject to this restriction in the same 
way as former members of this House. The clause on double 
dipping in Bill C-85 provides that any former member who is 
receiving a pension will be required to notify the appropriate 
minister when he starts to hold federal employment or enters 
into a federal service contract.
<P>
	The notification will have to be made within 60 days after the 
date of the appointment or the signing of the contract, and the 
member will have to report how much he is earning or expecting 
to earn. Every year he will have to report all sums of money 
received from the federal government as long as he holds the 
employment or continues to execute the contract.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Any member whose earnings exceed or are expected to exceed 
$5,000 annually would have their pensions abated dollar for 
dollar by the amount of their remuneration. For example, if a 
member receives $30,000 in pension and earns $45,000 in a 
federal position, his or her pension will be totally suspended. If 
the member earns $25,000 he or she would receive $5,000 of 
their pension. That is because they earned a $30,000 salary.
<P>
	I am taking the time to illustrate these examples because it is 
important to note that only federal parliamentary pensions and 
federal salaries comprise the double dipping provision.
<P>
<B>(1045 ) </B>
<P>
	The second component of Bill C-85 I would like to address is 
the red book commitment of the minimum age. Age 55 will be 
the minimum age at which former MPs and senators can collect 
a pension. This government agrees with the age 55 
recommendation put forward by the Lapointe commission in the 
report entitled: ``Democratic Ideals and Financial Realities''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Madam Speaker, the third point I would like to raise is that of 
optional participation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier, within days of entering Parliament, 
the Reform Party House leader stood before this House and 
asked the Prime Minister if the government intended to continue 
to force MPs to participate in the MP pension plan. The Prime 
Minister's response was to the point: If members do not want to 
contribute to the pension plan, then administrative 
arrangements would be made to ensure they would not be part of 
the plan. Bill C-85 explicitly responds to the Prime Minister's 
promise to the Reform Party. Members will be provided with the 
option to choose whether or not they wish to continue to 
participate in this pension plan.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Madam Speaker, there are people shouting over there because 
they do not like to hear the truth. They prefer exaggeration so 
that they can make a little political hay. That is what they do 
when they have problems with the electorate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am confident members of the Reform Party will recognize 
this change adequately reflects what their party has sought. 
However, I would urge all members including those of the 
government and the official opposition to carefully consider 
their personal and family retirement needs prior to making this 
decision. Political motivation and party discipline should not 
play a part in this important choice.
<P>
	This government has a clear view that retirement savings 
should be supported as they are through the income tax system 
in providing benefits through RRSPs or registered pension plans 
by employers providing for the legitimate retirement needs of 
their employees. The Government of Canada provides pensions 
for its public servants, the military, the RCMP and we should 
certainly provide pensions for our parliamentarians.
<P>
	I would like to put forward some figures which were first 
presented to the standing committee. I understand they were 
useful to the committee members for the analysis of this 
proposed legislation. According to the Statistics Canada 1992 
publication ``Pension Plans in Canada'' only 9 per cent of people 
who are in employment related pension plans are in plans that 
match contributions or are similar to RRSP type plans. The 
remaining 91 per cent are in defined benefit plans which provide 
a set formula to determine benefits. This type of plan provides 
better certainty and security for employees and planning for 
retirement because their ultimate benefits can be anticipated 
without being subject to the prevailing interest rates at the time 
the annuity becomes payable.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14419"> 14419 </A></B>
<P>
	My colleagues in the opposition are taking great risks. If they 
continue to make noise, my voice can be much louder than 
theirs.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Madam Speaker, the Statistics Canada publication I just 
mentioned reveals that in general, in the context of these defined 
benefit plans, private sector employers contribute about 60 per 
cent of the costs while in the public sector the employer's 
proportion is 60 per cent.
<P>
	Naturally enough, in the case of special plans, the share of the 
costs assumed by the employer is considerably higher. For 
instance, in the case of the Canadian Forces the employer's 
contribution is $2.70 for every dollar contributed by an 
employee.
<P>
	I have taken the time to state these facts because I think it is 
important that we have enough knowledge about private or 
employer-sponsored pension plans in Canada generally, if we 
want to evaluate this particular pension plan logically and 
rationally.
<P>
	The final element I want to discuss is the question of pension 
accrual or pension benefit rate. Bill C-85 reduces the benefit 
rate for members' pensions from 5 per cent to 4 per cent of their 
annual salary per year of service. This is equivalent to a 20 per 
cent reduction.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	Combined with the introduction of a minimum age, this 
reduction will make it possible to reduce by 33 per cent the 
amount the taxpayer contributes to the members' pension plan. 
This is a significant saving, in line with our government's deficit 
reduction strategy.
<P>
	Clearly the government has gone even further than it 
promised it would in reforming members' retiring allowances. 
We have markedly reduced the costs that the Canadian taxpayer 
has to pay.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In addition to outlining the important elements of Bill C-85 I 
would like to address one concern that I have in effectively 
communicating the impact of pensions. Private interest groups 
and members of this House have put forward what I would call, 
and I want to underline it, misleading information of potential 
payments to MPs. It is not just government MPs that have been 
mentioned. The exorbitant amounts reportedly to be paid to 
young cabinet ministers and long serving MPs are based on 
misleading and incorrect assumptions.
<P>
	For example, the 5 per cent inflation assumption is certainly 
out of whack with what the Department of Finance calculates, 
which is a standard of 1.5 per cent. Even Reform will understand 
that there is a difference between 1.5 per cent and 5 per cent.
<P>
	Additionally to state that a pension figure is based on an MP 
retiring today and collecting a pension immediately until age 75 
fails to recognize the effects of Bill C-85. They fail to recognize 
it because it is convenient to them. Particular attention should be 
paid to clause 11 of the bill which will introduce the minimum 
age of 55. The assumptions also ignore the ministers and MPs 
are not retiring today. In fact they are making active 
contributions to the Canadian political landscape and will 
continue to do so for many years.
<P>
	It might be useful by way of example to demonstrate the 
nefarious effects of such outrageous and incorrect assumptions. 
The price of a $2 loaf of bread considered in future dollars would 
cost according to these assumptions which include 
compounding and high inflation $3.20 in 10 years and after 20 
years about $5.30. That is the kind of gimmickry we are engaged 
in. Simply put, these comparisons do not accurately reflect what 
a former member may receive in pension. They are extremely 
inaccurate and misleading.
<P>
	In conclusion, Bill C-85 is an accurate response to the 
concerns expressed by Canadian taxpayers. They have asked for 
reduced contribution on the part of government. Bill C-85 
delivers a 33 per cent cut in that contribution. Electors have 
asked that we fulfil our stated commitments in the red book. Bill 
C-85 does that and goes further.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Our public servants, the members of the Canadian forces and 
other employees affected by the wage freeze are expecting us to 
respect the same rules as they do.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Before we continue on 
the debate, I know the subject is emotional for a lot of you. Our 
constituents, right across this country, are listening. I think they 
would like to hear what people have to say. Could I ask that we 
give them that much respect.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to address the House at third reading of 
Bill C-85 on reform of members' retiring allowances. I rise as 
the official opposition critic on parliamentary reform.
<P>
	I would like to say right off that the objective that we in the 
Bloc Quebecois and the official opposition wished to achieve in 
the reform was twofold. First, because we shared the concern of 
all taxpayers in Quebec and Canada, we knew very well that a 
pension plan that allowed members to collect both pensions and 
federal civil service salaries could not continue. We also knew 
that the absence of a specific age limit for qualifying for a 
pension was unacceptable, because taxpayers were seeing 
people after just six years of parliamentary service getting an 
immediate pension at the age of 30 or 35 or 40. It was 
unacceptable. It was unfair.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14420"> 14420 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	So those aspects were our two targets, shared by the taxpayer, 
and I think that Bill C-85 is confirmation that both have been 
met.
<P>
	However, I would like to recall that we tabled an amendment 
to this bill that was designed to prevent former members who 
were currently double dipping from continuing to do so. The 
government preferred not to incorporate our amendment. 
Instead, the restriction on double dipping will come into effect 
only when the bill becomes law, thus leaving plenty of 
government employees drawing both their pension and their 
salary. I am thinking, among others, of the ambassador to Paris, 
Benoît Bouchard, who gets both a pension and a salary.
<P>
	I think it would have been very useful if the government had 
agreed to make the system fair for everyone immediately.
<P>
	I would also like to add, in the course of these remarks, that in 
the end the total value of members' pensions strikes me as a 
small matter in comparison with a more useful way of 
recovering money and reducing government expenditure: the 
abolition of the Senate, the other House. If the $45 million and 
more that goes on salaries and services for the Senate could have 
been tackled, we could have saved an enormous amount of 
money.
<P>
	One of the distinctive things about the western world is its 
democratic systems of government. Universal suffrage is 
indisputably the element in a revolution that at the start of this 
century allowed a number of western societies to achieve, 
rapidly, unprecedented economic development and to 
experience the emergence of the mass consumer society we 
know today.
<P>
	However, western democratic society has not eliminated all 
inequalities, nor does it really hold the promise of a better world 
where all men and women would be equal, a society where 
poverty and misery would no longer occur. Social classes 
continue to exist, with their different levels of wealth, their 
injustices. We live in the very heart of economic liberalism. If 
democracy is a synonym for political freedom, it is also the 
home of economic freedom.
<P>
	There are members of Parliament in our society, certainly, but 
there are also professionals, welfare recipients, people without 
jobs, CEOs of big and small companies, civil servants, tramps. 
We do not all have the same lot in life. We live in a society with 
social classes. And it is an illusion to think that everyone is 
treated equitably.
<P>
	The debate on members' pensions, in my opinion, serves as a 
way of avoiding a much more fundamental debate that needs to 
be held on poverty and power. We have to expose the illusory 
democracy that screens us from the human misery in our 
societies. We have to attack the system's real profiteers. There 
are profiteers in the Canadian parliamentary system, and to 
focus exclusively on members' pensions, without calling among  
other things for abolition of the Senate, is serious political 
irrelevance and evidence of boundless bad faith.
<P>
	The cost of the parliamentary pension plan is insignificant 
compared to what has to be paid out of the public purse to 
maintain Senate appointments and the institution itself.
<P>
	One of the Reform Party's main election promises was to 
make cuts in what the party calls the ``three Ps'': members' pay, 
pensions and privileges. The Reform Party calculates that a 
significant reduction in members' pensions would result in 
savings on the order of $1.5 million over five years.
<P>
	According to Jean Dion, columnist for <I>Le Devoir</I>, ``the 
savings that could be made by slashing members' benefits are 
hard to calculate''.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	Following the last election, the pensions to be paid to defeated 
members were estimated at $109 million over 20 years, or a 
quarter of 1 per cent of the deficit for 1992-93 alone. Now, the 
total budget for senators is $42.6 million a year. Over 20 years, 
if you consider the costs of upkeep for the premises the Senate 
occupies, the cost to the taxpayer is, by comparison, more than 
$1 billion.
<P>
	That is what I would call shameless exploitation of a 
country's citizens, who pay out of their taxes the salaries and 
pensions of people they never elected. A senator is a member of 
a political species that lives off the poor in our society. The 
Senate is nothing but a pretext for whatever government is 
currently in power to reward its cronies, be they Tory or Grit.
<P>
	The Senate is an institution with no democratic legitimacy. Its 
members are appointed by the Governor General, who by 
convention acts on the initiative and advice of the Prime 
Minister, who submits a list of names to him. Because senators 
are not elected, the official opposition, the Bloc Quebecois, 
considers the Upper House a political anachronism and 
convincing proof of the obsolescence of the Canadian federal 
system.
<P>
	We in the Bloc Quebecois have grasped that one of the great 
weaknesses of the Canadian parliamentary system is not the 
members' pension plan but rather the very existence of a Senate. 
The existence of the Canadian Senate is a vestige of the 
traditional elitist form of representation that is supposed in 
some way to balance the democratic legitimacy of the elected 
members of the House of Commons.
<P>
	From 1925 to 1963, the average age of a senator was 69. In 
1975 it was 64. A Senate seat, as the whole world knows, is a 
prize for someone at the end of his career. He will not need to 
fight to keep his seat, because the salary is guaranteed until he 
reaches 75. That is what I call a golden retirement. That is what I 
call the real problem. That is the real scandal of the Canadian 
parliamentary system and the democratic system in which it has 
developed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14421"> 14421 </A></B>
<P>
	I think that the government in power, the Liberals, and the 
Reform Party too, should have gone after the really pointless 
expenditures. Lacking the courage to attack the Senate, which 
represents a pointless expenditure, they referred instead to cut 
members' pensions. We recognize that they accomplished what 
they set out to do, and that it is an improvement, but as I have 
shown, the money they hope to recover is just a little more than a 
million dollars over twenty years.
<P>
	If we got rid of the Senate, we could save over $42 million a 
year. The goal of reviewing sessional allowances or members' 
pensions can never, in any way, be a means of putting the 
country's finances on a sounder footing, or fighting the deficit, 
or achieving the great collective ideals of equality and wealth in 
our sacrosanct democracy. This debate is just something to 
placate the people, and bills making changes to members' 
retiring allowances-remember Bill C-270, brought in by the 
NDP, Bill C-236, brought in by the Liberals, Bill C-208, 
brought in by the Conservatives-are just ways for this House to 
assuage its conscience.
<P>
	On July 20, 1994, the Commission to Review Allowances of 
Members of Parliament tabled its report. It made the following 
points: the number of former members receiving a pension is not 
what is commonly believed. To go by the press, every 
parliamentarian who ceases to sit gets a retiring allowance. But 
in fact only half of the members who retired over the past decade 
received an allowance. Since 1984, only 42 per cent of retirees 
have received an allowance.
<P>
	The report goes on to state that the public sometimes has the 
impression that parliamentarians who retire do so with an 
excessively large pension.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	In fact, most pensions paid to parliamentarians in the past 
decade were between $10,000 and $40,000. Actually, 57.2 per 
cent of them are below $30,000 and 90.4 per cent are below 
$50,000.
<P>
	``One might also think, the report goes on to say, that a 
disproportionate percentage of retirement benefits are paid to 
persons below the age of 55. But this is absolutely not the case 
since only 13 per cent of retired MPs receiving benefits are 
below 55''.
<P>
	According to the report, the Canadian parliamentary pension 
plan is quite comparable to those in other western democracies. 
Admittedly, this plan is one of the least demanding with regard 
to the minimum age at which benefits can be collected, but one 
of the strictest with regard to the contribution rate of the 
beneficiary; and it falls within the average with regard to the 
maximum authorized benefit.
<P>
	As can be gathered from the report of the Commission to 
Review Allowances of Members, there is no reason to hold a real 
debate on the matter and it is no secret that the parliamentary 
discussions about MP pensions are merely a way of avoiding the 
real debate on the fundamental questions which are increasingly 
undermining the credibility of western democracies.
<P>
	The Reform Party lays it on a bit thick. The great number of 
amendments which they tabled at the beginning of June look 
more like an insurance policy negotiated downward than an 
effort to prepare a serious piece of legislation.
<P>
	I repeat, Bill C-85 on the reform of MP pensions in its present 
version responds entirely to the two main concerns of taxpayers 
in Quebec and in Canada with regard to equity.
<P>
	First, the age at which a former MP can collect his pension is 
now set at 55. Secondly, a former MP can no longer receive both 
a pension and a salary paid by a government agency. The bill is 
unequivocal in that regard.
<P>
	With this bill we have therefore attained the basic objectives 
which we have in common with taxpayers, but we would have 
liked the government to accept our amendment and apply it 
immediately to those in government and in the public service 
who currently benefit from double dipping.
<P>
	I remind this House that we would also have preferred to deal 
effectively with the expenses of useless institutions like the 
Senate, which costs us tens of millions of dollars per year. All 
this for an institution which serves no useful purpose. It is 
simply a place-and the real place-for a golden retirement. A 
place to which men and women who have rendered or could 
render services to the government are appointed with a salary 
which is guaranteed until age 75. That is what I call an 
unacceptable golden retirement and that is where we have to get 
the money that is needed.
<P>
	In closing, I remind this House that in this matter the official 
opposition is concerned about equity. We fundamentally believe 
that our amendments contained all that is needed to achieve this 
equity, namely two basic elements: the setting of the minimum 
age at 55 years and the elimination of double dipping.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary-Ouest, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to voice my opposition to Bill C-85, an act 
to amend the Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act. I 
would first like to say a word about the position of the Bloc 
Quebecois. The Bloc Quebecois has explained well the 
problems with the Senate and with ambassadors' pensions, for 
example.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14422"> 14422 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	But the fact remains that the Bloc supported the government 
in this matter in order to keep their pensions from the Parliament 
of Canada just before the referendum on independence. I remind 
this House that the members of the Bloc have the option of not 
participating in this plan. They must explain their participation 
to their constituents.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I have given a lot of thought to what I might say today. There 
has been a lot of emotion in the debate and I must admit that I 
share in a lot of the emotion. Because I like to avoid a lot of 
emotionalism, I probably will avoid some of it in my speech 
today. This is not because I think I should but because, perhaps 
in my state of mind at the moment, I would be better to stick to 
some of the facts and to try to make some arguments that 
hopefully a few on the other side will listen to at the last minute.
<P>
	I will not get into the statistics about the generosity of the 
plan. Those are well known now by the public. We have a very 
rare occasion here. In supporting a government bill we have a 
coincidence of a lack of intelligence and a lack of integrity at a 
single time which I would not say is unprecedented but should 
give members cause for reflection.
<P>
	Let me review some of the headlines in the newspapers of the 
last couple of weeks on this topic. According to the Montreal 
<I>Gazette</I>: ``Voters won't forgive MPs for keeping lavish 
pensions''. From the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I>: ``Pension issue certain to 
haunt Liberals''. My personal favourite in my favourite 
newspaper, the Calgary <I>Herald</I>: ``MPs pensions still too rich''.
<P>
	All of us in the House have been around long enough. Even 
those who have not been around very long have been around 
long enough to know that not everything we read in the 
newspaper is true. However I believe in this case there is a 
certain correlation between the reality and the reporting.
<P>
	Let us take a little time to go back to the testimony we heard 
before the procedure and House affairs committee studying the 
bill and to some of the comments of my friends across the way. It 
is important to do this so that after the next election, when we 
look back at the day this bill was passed, we will see just how 
prophetic many of the commentators and experts were when 
discussing the bill.
<P>
	I had done some teaching before I came to the House and this 
is an opportunity to do a little teaching here about what will 
happen if self-interest overcomes principle.
<P>
	One witness before the committee, Mr. Robert Fleming, had 
written extensively about the compensation of elected officials 
as well as the broader issues that universally face legislatures 
across the world. I will read Mr. Fleming's closing remarks to 
the committee. Perhaps the House will pay closer attention to 
these than committee members did. I do not repeat Mr. 
Fleming's remarks because I agree with all he said. In fact he is 
more sympathetic to the bill than I am. Nevertheless Mr. 
Fleming said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>All I'm saying is that I don't think you're listening to some of these 
issues-Regardless of what the President of the Treasury Board or anyone else 
says, they are flying in the face of public opinion if they don't put this into the 
hands of the broader community to debate and examine.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I'm not talking about the traditional form of commission conducted, as we 
are, in this forum, but I'm talking about a way for sensible people, who are 
fair and include knowledgeable parliamentarians and actuaries getting 
together to look at the whole picture and saying this is what should be done. 
Again, I believe if you permitted this at this point pretty darn soon, before it 
gets out of hand, that without credible results you probably would come out 
smelling like roses and with much better results.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If this doesn't happen, I feel, and I've talked to very reasonable and 
sensible Canadians about this, who I think have their heads screwed on and 
not the sort of people who are going to jump to conclusions. But they 
definitely feel that you are quoting your own counsel, pushing your own show 
ahead. And it's going to be to the detriment of the Liberal Party of Canada, the 
Government of Canada, and it's definitely going to be to the detriment of the 
people of Canada. I think this has to be taken into account.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Again, as somewhat of a political scientist, the Liberal Party of Canada has 
had a marvellous go at it since October 1993. But I think the thing risks 
becoming unravelled if this kind of situation is not dealt with in a totally and 
utterly open manner. This applies to everything concerning the administration 
of the House of Commons.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	Broadly speaking there was consensus among all of the 
witnesses the committee heard that Bill C-85 is a bad idea for all 
sorts of reasons and certainly politically a very bad idea.
<P>
	This witness also pointed out: ``The fact that 81 qualifying 
members are Liberals and only 14 belong to other parties 
suggests that the government should tread warily and wisely in 
advancing legislation. This is an area which has become a 
political minefield''. The government has made very little 
attempt to get cross party consensus on this.
<P>
	Former Conservative MP and actuary Paul McCrossan had 
something to say on this also. According to him Bill C-85 is bad 
for members, bad for Parliament as an institution and bad for 
Canada. Mr. McCrossan went on to explain how Bill C-85 will 
hamstring Parliament, how it will destroy any legitimacy the 
government has or might have had in redesigning Canada's 
national retirement income and medical care system, just when 
these changes are most needed in the face of Canada's  
flourishing debt and aging population. We know about the 
government's plans in those areas.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14423"> 14423 </A></B>
<P>
	Mr. McCrossan talked about the need for Parliament to act 
with integrity and to redesign our national social plans rather 
than let a future crisis arise and dictate their reform. He talked 
about the effect that passing the bill would have on generating 
immense public outrage for protecting privileged positions just 
when reductions in national benefits are being proposed for 
other Canadians.
<P>
	This witness talked about the public's feeling toward 
politicians. We have all heard this: ``They are all crooks''. He 
told the committee the underlying cause of this attitude, and I 
agree with him, was politicians have consistently established 
one set of rules for themselves and one for the general public.
<P>
	Referring to the potential passing of this bill without 
amendments he said: ``Once again, in that case you deserve the 
public's contempt''. I agree with that.
<P>
	Mr. McCrossan recently published an article in <I>Benefits 
Canada</I>. In it he describes the Conservatives' attempt to reduce 
the generosity of the plan. The Conservatives promised this in 
1984 and never delivered on it. I will read the excerpt once 
again:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Wilson asked me to help him present his proposals for changing MPs' 
pensions to the last PC caucus meeting before the 1988 election. He wanted a 
mandate to proceed before the election was called so that the new Parliament 
could start with a new plan. A riot broke out. For about 20 minutes Wilson 
tried to explain either the problem or its solution. He was not allowed to 
speak. Member after member shouted him down. Whenever calm was restored 
and Wilson tried to speak, bedlam erupted. Finally he gave up.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Can we not see it happening all over again, this time in the 
Liberal caucus? We all know about the press reports.
<P>
	I understand the minister also tried to bring about some 
significant reforms which were ultimately thrown out of caucus 
and of cabinet. Who will pay the price for this? The price will 
ultimately be paid by first term backbench MPs sitting across 
the way who really do not support this plan, probably really do 
not understand it, but who will go along with the whole Liberal 
government group think thing. I hope they will at least consider 
opting out. I will address that again later.
<P>
	The voters may forgive them if they opt out, but that is the 
only way they will be around long enough to qualify for this 
plan. What it is interesting is they will end up supporting this 
plan, it will be their votes which pass it, it will protect and 
enlarge the pensions of the most senior members of the 
government and they will end up out of their seats with no 
pension whatsoever.
<P>
	During the report stage debate on the bill the chief 
government whip asserted there was nothing wrong with this 
plan, that outflows matched inflows and had for years. This is an 
example of some of the misquoting of statistics that has gone on 
around here.
<P>
	What the chief government whip did not mention was the size 
of those inflows, or the source, is exclusively tax dollars and the 
vast majority does not come from the members' of Parliament 
pay cheques.
<P>
<B>(1120 ) </B>
<P>
	Second, the vast majority of the outflows has yet to come and 
the inflows are to cover the future liability streams created by 
this pension plan.
<P>
	Let me quote again from Mr. McCrossan's article as he refers 
to Don Mazankowski's half hearted attempts at reform: ``Even 
well informed MPs like Don Boudria, the chief government 
whip, continued to assert in debate that the government's chief 
actuary had said the MPs pension plan was actuarially sound''. 
That has been repeated in this debate. ``In his latest report 
published prior to the 1991 House of Commons debate the chief 
actuary pointed out the plan had only $27.9 million in assets to 
cover about $182.7 million in liabilities. Also, the normal cost 
of the plan was rising''. To cover the actuarial liability we now 
have these huge inflows each year.
<P>
	During the one day of witness testimony-the committee 
never did study the bill-at the procedure and House affairs 
committee, the government whip made some other enlightening 
comments. He talked about his situation and how well off he 
would be if instead of having the MP pension plan he had 
participated in an RRSP plan with contributions matched dollar 
for dollar by his employer, ostensibly the House of Commons.
<P>
	He said that under the MP pension plan he would enjoy a 
benefit if he retired today of somewhat less than $30,000 year. 
According to our calculations it would be closer to $36,000 a 
year, but $30,000 under the new proposal. Remember this does 
not apply retroactively and so he would be getting $36,000 a 
year.
<P>
	My office did the calculation. The government whip said he 
had calculations but never tabled them. I have done the 
calculations according to the assumptions outlined by the 
government whip. I see some truthful aspects but his answers 
still required scrutiny.
<P>
	He said he would be eligible for a pension of about $27,000 a 
year already under a matching RRSP arrangement. He forgot to 
mention that under an RRSP plan like other Canadians are 
eligible for, contributions of the size he is talking about fully 
matched by an employer would be illegal. Our 11 per cent plus 
an 11 per cent match make 22 per cent, which is well above the 
legal limit. No other Canadian would be allowed to shelter that 
much of their income from tax and have it grow without paying 
taxes on the income it generates. An investment of this type 
would not have the expensive advantage of full indexation 
offered under Bill C-85.
<P>
	As the member for Mississauga West pointed out several 
times during the committee's hearing, the government may 
decrease the contribution for limits on RRSPs in any case. 
Where would that leave MPs? It did  not seem to bother her that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14424"> 14424 </A></B>
<P>
this would affect millions of other Canadians negatively. This is 
an important point.
<P>
	Applying the Income Tax Act in the same way it applies to 
other Canadians lowers the government whip's expected 
pension benefit from $27,000 to only about $22,000, which is 
not a bad pension considering he has only been on the job here 
since 1984.
<P>
	Compared with a fully indexed pension of $35,000 to $36,000 
which he would collect if he resigned tomorrow, this may not 
look quite so inviting. Fully indexed as provided for under this 
plan at the current inflation rate, this $35,000 would grow and 
would be worth approximately $82,000 in tomorrow's dollars by 
the time he was 75.
<P>
	An annuity purchased with an RRSP would still be worth only 
$22,000. In other words, in 30 years or so he would find his 
pension is worth only $5,000 or $6,000 in today's dollars. This is 
a very different case and we start to see why this plan is so costly 
to taxpayers.
<P>
	Let us be serious. Will the member and the government really 
try to tell ordinary Canadians they could have a $60,000 salary 
for 10 years and retire for the rest of their lives with a pension 
that would support their every need and more? Seriously, 
Canadians do not live in that kind of world. We should not invent 
those kinds of numbers.
<P>
	According to one witness, Mr. Brian Corbishley, to provide 
the benefits promised under this bill would take an investment 
of about $34,000 for each year of service; this is for the ordinary, 
backbench member of Parliament, not someone with an 
additional salary they can contribute like the government whip. 
Basically Mr. Corbishley is saying it would take a matching 
contribution of 26 per cent of a member's salary to fulfil the 
government whip's assertions.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	Several government members have indicated they believe the 
9 per cent contribution level in the bill is too high. Obviously it 
is not nearly high enough to provide the benefits the bill 
provides.
<P>
	The government did, I believe inadvertently, make an 
important point. A plan with matching contributions, properly 
invested over a long period of time, even one that was legal 
under the Income Tax Act, would help to provide a reasonable 
retirement income and would save the taxpayers a bundle.
<P>
	The cost for a one to one plan like we proposed, about 9 per 
cent MP salary matching, would cost about $1 million. That is 
about $6 million less than the government's contribution costs, 
to which it must add $23 million in interest charges it has to fork 
out for the present plan. That is a saving of about $29 million a 
year and clearly there is no comparison whatsoever in the cost.
<P>
	I hope my speech has cleared up what is maybe some honest 
misconception regarding the plan with members opposite. We 
know the debate has at times been very emotional. There have 
been all kinds of accusations levelled. My hope is in talking 
about these personal cases that I not bring it back to that level 
but use them as examples to put forward some of the honest 
problems the public finds with the bill.
<P>
	Unfortunately it does not appear we will solve this problem in 
the House. My position and that of my party is we must bring in a 
plan which is no more generous than the average private sector 
plan and that we need an independent body to do it and there 
must be full disclosure of all the benefits.
<P>
	There seems to be some confusion on what a normal pension 
plan is. The President of the Treasury Board gave some statistics 
when he appeared before the committee, which the 
parliamentary secretary repeated today. I will go over them 
because they talked about misleading statistics. The President of 
the Treasury Board has presented statistics about what a normal 
pension plan is. Let us go over a normal pension plan.
<P>
	Normal for most Canadians is no employer pension plan at all. 
According to Statistics Canada, as of January 1, 1992 only about 
47.5 per cent of employed paid workers were fortunate enough 
to belong to an employer pension plan. About half of those were 
workers who belonged to pension plans in the public sector.
<P>
	The minister told that committee 44 per cent of all pension 
plan members have some form of automatic indexing. What he 
neglected to mention was in the private sector less than 12 per 
cent have any automatic protection from inflation, and full 
protection of the kind offered to MPs in Bill C-85 is virtually 
unheard of even in the public sector.
<P>
	The minister indicated as well that about 95 per cent of all 
pension plan members are in defined benefit plans which 
provide a set formula to determine benefit payments. According 
to Statistics Canada, only 43.7 per cent of all plans are of this 
type. Some of the larger plans have this but over 50 per cent do 
not. Those who do not have an employer benefit plan are almost 
always in a contributory plan, not a defined benefit plan.
<P>
	The minister did not present any comparative statistics on 
benefit rates, and with good reason. While his proposal gives 
MPs a benefit rate of 4 per cent per year of service, only 2 per 
cent of all pension plan members have a benefit rate above half 
of that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14425"> 14425 </A></B>
<P>
	One departmental official, when I asked how many other 
Canadians had this kind of benefit rate, conceded none to his 
knowledge. There could be the odd chief executive officer with a 
special deal but none he is aware of.
<P>
	Similarly, the President of the Treasury Board did not bother 
to present any statistics on the minimum age for collection of 
benefits, which is 55 in the bill. However, in over 90 per cent of 
all registered pension plans the normal age of retirement is 65. A 
hearing is going on today just down the street in the federal 
court, the Information Commissioner versus the Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services. The government has 
asked that the hearings regarding the release of information on 
MP pension benefits be held in camera. It does not even want 
taxpayers to hear its argument for not releasing the information.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	I would have thought if it had some reasonable reasons for 
suppressing the information, and I cannot imagine what they 
would be, it would want the voters to know what the reasons 
might be.
<P>
	In my opinion it is in the best interests of the public for the 
information to be readily available. It will affect who is elected. 
That will affect the quality of government. Voters have a right to 
know how their tax dollars are being spent.
<P>
	As I pointed out previously in the House, individual 
member's salaries and expenses are printed in the public 
accounts. Why are their pension benefits or at least the cost of 
those benefits not available to the taxpayers? So much for more 
open government. So much for government with integrity. On 
this kind of issue we might as well have had Brian Mulroney and 
his Tory party sitting across the way.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It might be an improvement.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Calgary West):</B> Let me talk about the opt out 
once again. I want government members, even though they are 
going to march in here and vote for the bill, to seriously consider 
the opt out. The opt out is not ideal. I have said this before and I 
will say it again, the ideal situation is a fair pension plan for 
members of Parliament, not nothing but not too generous. Since 
those are the choices, I would suggest we opt out.
<P>
	What the government is doing to convince the public that this 
is okay is simply not working. I have made some reference 
already to the tactic. One has been to misquote figures, to try and 
rationalize this as somehow not really better than what anyone 
else is getting. Nobody believes that. Not an expert in the 
country will come forward to verify those numbers.
<P>
	The other attempt to rationalize this has been to basically 
slander various Reform members of Parliament. For example, 
the member for Beaver River is opportunistic in opting out. 
There have been other  slanders and fabrications against her 
which I will not get into.
<P>
	It is also said that ex-military members are double dipping. 
This is an interesting definition of double dipping. Suddenly all 
Canadians, who after having had a career and qualifing for a 
pension in a normal way and who enter a second career, are 
somehow double dipping. Now we have hundreds of thousands 
of Canadians who are now defined as double dippers.
<P>
	There was the great one members actually thought they had 
going for a few days which was that the member for Calgary 
Centre had advocated massive pay increases when, in fact, what 
he was suggesting was that the government be transparent about 
the salaries the MPs are actually being paid, taking into 
consideration all the benefits, all of their untaxed allowances 
and all their accrued pensions.
<P>
	What is interesting about all of these things is that they are not 
in the bill. That definition of double dipping is not in the 
government's legislation. The government, while it continues to 
raise the compensation issue, did not raise it in the legislation. It 
is only a bill on MP pensions.
<P>
	There has been a lot of talk about the pay issue but I want to 
get something on the record because my views on the pay issue 
are a little different than most of the people in the House and 
probably a little different from some members of my party. This 
party has consistently said: ``Cut the pension to normal with no 
pay increase whatsoever''. We tabled amendments to that effect 
and the Liberal members all voted against them.
<P>
	However, let me talk about the process of determining pay. 
There have been commissions to study the pay issue. In fact, one 
thing we noticed when we had the committee hearings for one 
day was that the commissions appointed by this federal 
government such as the Lapointe or Sobeco study, had 
considerably more generous views of remuneration than some 
of the commissions that had been appointed in the provinces. All 
of them had concluded that MPs or ex-MPs were basically 
underpaid and they gave some reasons for that which deserve 
study. However let us be very clear about how they arrived at 
that conclusion.
<P>
	First, all these commissions proceed by essentially asking 
members of Parliament and former members of Parliament what 
they do, how much they could earn elsewhere and how much 
they think it is worth. That is essentially how the commissions 
operate. They then come up with a recommendation that we are 
all underpaid. They accept the stories that all members of 
Parliament tend to tell, which is that prior to coming here they 
had brilliant careers and were earning hundreds of thousands of 
dollars somewhere else. Some were. As we all know, the 
member for Calgary Centre was. The Minister of Justice was. 
There are some other members who had very brilliant careers 
both in this House and in the previous Houses.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14426"> 14426 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	However, that is not always true. Before I was elected, I 
worked around here and I know about some of the brilliant 
careers.
<P>
	The second story told is that all members of Parliament do 
valuable work while they are here. They work long and hard 
hours all the time, on critical tasks of great importance to the 
nation and their constituents.
<P>
	The third story told is that through no fault of their own, 
members suddenly find that when they are turfed out of office, 
despite their previous brilliance and their brilliance while here, 
they find themselves virtually unemployable and can find no 
work.
<P>
	There are elements of truth in all of these statements but I do 
not think we should accept them at face value. Some of these 
commissions should have examined this a little more closely. I 
will not talk about careers. As I say, some people clearly have 
had good careers and some people, depending on their 
occupational background, have an chance at adjusting back into 
the workforce. I know the member for Halton-Peel and I have 
discussed the fact that certain occupations are given to 
readjustment to the workforce while others are not.
<P>
	I would like to talk for a minute on this one point about the 
valuable and hard work because it is important. It is time we 
started calling a spade a spade around here. Have we worked 
hard this week? You had better believe it, Madam Speaker. We 
have worked bloody hard. We have been up every day this week 
until midnight and 1 a.m. voting on bills.
<P>
	What about those votes? Those votes were all predetermined. 
There were no surprises in any of them, although there were a 
couple of little surprises, but all of these votes were 
predetermined. In fact, they were so predetermined that half of 
the time people did not even know what they were voting on. 
However, they certainly did not need to know what they were 
voting on even if they did.
<P>
	The question that the taxpayers should be asking is not 
whether this is hard work, because this is hard work, but whether 
it is valuable work. They should be asking whether staying up all 
night to go through these rituals has been worth a hell of a lot of 
money to them.
<P>
	Let me mention another example. We sat in a committee all 
day. We had flown in witnesses from across the country to study 
the MP pension bill. They came in early in the morning and we 
sat there all day, morning, afternoon and evening. Did we stop 
for five minutes to review or discuss any of the committee 
testimony to determine whether there was anything in it that 
might apply to the legislation? No. We proceeded to clause by 
clause consideration and did the bill in 12 minutes. Therefore, 
we went through the ritual of flying these people in and hearing 
from them.
<P>
	The question once again is: Hard work costs a lot of money. 
Was it of any value? The truth is, and this is not a phenomenon 
restricted to Canada but certainly one that has become worse 
here, that many MPs play very little or any real legislative role. 
It does not matter whether they are ignoring their constituents' 
views, their election commitments or their personal principles 
and knowledge, we know that most MPs will simply vote with 
the party no matter what the bill is about and whether they have 
read it or not.
<P>
	What really is the value of that? What really is the equivalent 
to that? Is that equivalent, as some would tell us, to being a 
senior executive? If that is the way the government and others 
believe the House of Commons should work, maybe MPs are 
regional sales reps for their political parties. Maybe that is the 
comparison we should be making.
<P>
	I am just giving another point of view. An independent 
commission should look at those kinds of issues. Maybe it 
would end up not looking at how we are remunerated but what 
we are doing around here and whether we can make it more 
effective.
<P>
	There is one little item of which I have to make some mention. 
I normally do not talk at all about my personal life but let me 
digress for a second. In the committee meeting, the President of 
the Treasury Board said, and the parliamentary secretary 
repeated it today, that before we opt out of these pensions we 
should consult our families. He said that we were really doing 
our families wrong by doing this. It was a valuable suggestion.
<P>
<B>(1140 ) </B>
<P>
	I got married just after I came to the House. I have been 
married a year and a half. I am starting to understand this 
marriage thing. I said: ``Before I opt out I should really consult 
my wife. It concerns the future and our future''. I thought it was 
the right thing to do to opt out but I thought: ``Yes, this wise 
advice. I should consult my wife''. The treasury board president, 
the expert on family values that he is, advised me to do this.
<P>
	I talked to my wife Laureen and explained that this potentially 
could be very expensive for us. I tried to explain it to her. This 
point is important because in the riding she talks to people. She 
is in touch with her family. She is not in this cocoon. She said to 
me: ``There may be some truth in what you are saying but the 
reality is that both you and I know that the pension plan is way 
too generous. We know what the public thinks about it and we 
know what it is''. She said: ``You did not get elected to rip off the 
taxpayers. Frankly, if you or I ever find ourselves in a financial 
situation on the job or any other job where we are doing that, 
then we had better find other work''. That is the only way to look 
at this.
<P>
	Reform MPs in opting out are not making a political point on a 
particular day. Let me be very clear to Liberal members about 
this, those who are thinking of participating. In opting out we 
are making a solemn pact with the taxpayers. The pact is the 
following. This  pension plan is not reformed satisfactorily. It is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14427"> 14427 </A></B>
<P>
not an acceptable plan. By opting out we have no stake in it 
whatsoever.
<P>
	The government can refuse future opt outs and it can 
grandfather the present recipients if it wants but if we form the 
government we have no vested interest whatsoever in this scam. 
When we have the chance to put in a plan, if this is not changed, 
there will be no grandfathering. There will be no trough regular 
and trough lite. We will take every legal step necessary to cut 
benefits that were not adequately contributed to by members of 
Parliament. We will lead by example in reforming the fiscal 
situation of this country. We will start here and we will not spare 
the people who made the decision to opt into that plan. That is 
our commitment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I am pleased to speak today on third reading of Bill C-85, which 
proposes amendments to the Members of Parliament Retiring 
Allowances Act.
<P>
	Before I begin, I want to highlight the points that I wish to 
make during my comments. First, it has to do with the question 
of total compensation. Most members would agree that the 
pension plan is an integral part of the compensation of any 
employee. When an employee looks at a position that pension 
plan is part of the compensation in this debate and in the 
comments made by hon. members.
<P>
	They know very well that they are dealing with pension plans 
as a stand alone item without reference to the total compensation 
package. That is the first point.
<P>
	The second point is that the salaries of members of Parliament 
have been frozen since 1991 and will be frozen and have been 
designated to be frozen until 1997. That is the commitment the 
government has made and members of Parliament have made, to 
have their salaries frozen for seven years.
<P>
	The third point is that independent consultants have been 
asked to assess the total compensation offered to members of 
Parliament. Their conclusion was that the total compensation of 
members of Parliament was not out of line with comparable 
work in other sectors.
<P>
	The fourth point that I am going to make has to do with this 
bill and what it does. The bill reduces the value of the pension 
plan that members of Parliament presently enjoy. It eliminates 
things called double dipping. It sets a minimum age that must be 
reached before a member can start collecting. It also reduces the 
accrual rate. This bill reduces the value of the pension plan. To 
defeat this bill would mean that the existing plan would stay 
intact. As a result it is clear all members of Parliament will be 
supporting this bill, if not at least in principle.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	I am going to touch on the two options that have been 
suggested particularly by the Reform Party. I intend to 
demonstrate that the actual cost of those options would be more 
to the Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	Some individuals and organizations have waged a constant 
publicity battle against the bill and its provisions as being too 
generous. They have targeted the earned pension entitlements of 
individual members. Some of this outside criticism has involved 
exaggeration that treats pensions in isolation removing them 
from the total compensation context which is where they 
properly belong.
<P>
	The independent study conducted by Sobeco Ernst and Young 
and tabled in this House in March of last year did not find MPs' 
total compensation package to be overly generous but I 
emphasize that it did recommend a redistribution of the various 
elements of that package. Sobeco Ernst and Young 
recommended increases in direct compensation with 
corresponding decreases in indirect compensation including 
pensions.
<P>
	This is point number one. We are talking about total 
compensation. In fact the total compensation is not overly 
generous but the distribution of that income between the various 
forms of income should be readdressed.
<P>
	The Lapointe commission report which was tabled last July 
also recommends changes. Among other things it recommends 
that pensions should not be payable before age 55 and that basic 
indemnities should be increased once the salary freeze is lifted. 
Again an independent commission has recommended, and the 
government has accepted the recommendation, that pensions 
not be payable until age 55 or later and that the basic 
components of the total compensation should be dealt with but 
not until the freeze on salaries is lifted. It would be 
inappropriate at this time to increase the basic salary of 
members and reduce the pension. We are going to respect the 
salary freeze that has been accepted by all the civil service and 
all members of Parliament.
<P>
	A variety of views have been expressed during the course of 
debates on the pension issue. Some members no doubt would 
like to stay with the status quo while others seek radical change. 
I doubt that there is a single member who has not been affected 
by all the criticisms that have been made. One thing I am certain 
of though is that we have all heard from our constituents and we 
have listened to them.
<P>
	The government has paid particular attention to what 
Canadians have had to say on the issue. Bill C-85 fulfils our 
commitment set out in the election platform with respect to 
double dipping and the minimum age at which pensions will 
begin to be paid. It further fulfils the President of the Treasury 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14428"> 14428 </A></B>
<P>
Board's commitment made in February of this year to table 
legislation before the end of April.
<P>
	I believe that the amendments proposed in the bill are 
balanced and fair both to the taxpayers of this country and to 
members of Parliament. The proposed changes show Canadians 
that the government has taken note of their concerns and has 
acted upon them.
<P>
	At the same time the government is conscious of the fact that 
in periods of deficits and public sector salary freezes, it would 
not be ethical to increase members' basic indemnities as 
recommended by the Sobeco Ernst &amp; Young report. 
Consequently it would be inappropriate to implement the 
recommended cutbacks to MP pensions at this time.
<P>
	As I have said, the changes proposed in this bill are reasonable 
and fair. Nevertheless not everyone will agree with them. There 
will be criticism within and outside this House that the changes 
do not go far enough. This said, I think we will all do well to 
remind ourselves that no matter how hard we try we cannot 
please everyone. I do believe that this bill represents a fair and 
justifiable compromise that seeks to accommodate various 
points of view.
<P>
<B>(1150 ) </B>
<P>
	I would like to go briefly through the main changes to the 
pension plan proposed by Bill C-85. The new minimum 
pensionable age will be 55. In the future, senators and members 
of Parliament who earn over $5,000 a year from an appointment, 
employment or other personal service contracts in the federal 
public sector will see their pensions reduced on a dollar for 
dollar basis by their earnings. The pension accrual on future 
service will drop from 5 per cent for each year of service to 4 per 
cent. The contribution rate on future service for members of the 
House of Commons will drop from 11 per cent to 9 per cent of 
salary. Common law spouses will be recognized for survivor 
benefit purposes just as they are under the public service, 
Canadian forces and RCMP pension plans.
<P>
	In keeping with the generally accepted practice in Canada that 
when changes are made in pension plans they do not reduce 
benefits accrued to date, all of these changes, with the exception 
of changes to the survivor benefit arrangements, will apply only 
to pensions or portions of pensions earned on service that occurs 
after the date this bill receives royal assent. This represents a 
fair and equitable approach. It means that members who have 
organized their financial affairs taking into account the pensions 
they have earned to date will not see rules changed midstream 
leaving them potentially adversely affected.
<P>
	As I have said, it is simply not possible to please everyone. 
Consequently, those members of Parliament who do not agree 
with the changes and reductions proposed by Bill C-85 or who 
do not believe them to be far reaching enough will not be obliged 
to continue participating in the plan. As the Prime Minister 
promised, all members of Parliament will be given a choice. 
They will have 60 days from the date this bill  receives royal 
assent to exercise an option to stay in the plan.
<P>
	Having touched briefly on the main changes proposed by Bill 
C-85, I would now like to focus on the issue of the new 
minimum age for payment of members' pensions. As we all 
know once a member has six years of service, the present 
provisions see the pension commence as soon as the member 
leaves office. I would like to repeat that because some of my 
constituents have understood it differently. There is no pension 
payable when a member completes six years. Six years is the 
earliest date at which a member could collect, but he or she must 
have left office to commence receipt of pension payments.
<P>
	I do not believe this provision was the result of some arbitrary 
decision. There were sound philosophical and practical reasons 
behind it. The provision was introduced so a member would 
have an immediate income on which to draw to assist him or her 
in the often difficult transition from public to private life. This is 
the only immediate income available to a member with an 
immediate pension entitlement. There are no cash settlements, 
no lump sum severance benefits. In fact, members of Parliament 
do not qualify for unemployment insurance benefits under the 
current legislation.
<P>
	I would remind those who believe the immediate payment of a 
pension is indefensible that not a single member of this House 
enjoys any kind of job security. There is absolutely no guarantee 
of a career as a member of Parliament. Every four or five years 
we must seek re-election and many of us find our tenure in this 
House brought to an abrupt end.
<P>
	Nevertheless, despite these considerations a general 
consensus was reached that the minimum pensionable age 
should be raised. In addition, after considering 
recommendations from both the Sobeco Ernst &amp; Young and the 
Lapointe commission reports, the government accepted the 
recommendation that 55 was a reasonable pensionable age.
<P>
	This new age will only apply to pensions or portions of 
pensions earned after the bill receives royal assent. This means 
that any pension earned prior to royal assent will still be payable 
according to the existing rules, that is, as soon as a member 
leaves office. Once again I should emphasize the government 
believes this to be a fair and equitable approach and one that is 
consistent with generally accepted and legislated pension 
practice, namely the protection of accrued pension rights and 
benefits.
<P>
	I know full well there will be critics who say we are not going 
far enough, that possibly the minimum pensionable age should 
be 60 or 65. To such critics I would again emphasize the 
precarious nature of an MP's career and the likelihood of a 
member suddenly finding himself or herself unemployed. We all 
know it is not easy to switch careers in midstream and once a 
person has turned 50 years of age it can often prove impossible 
to find new employment. Therefore, I would suggest that it  is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14429"> 14429 </A></B>
<P>
not unreasonable to propose in future MP pensions should go 
into pay once a former member reaches age 55.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	How does age 55 compare with the pensionable age under 
provincial pension plans for members of respective legislative 
assemblies? The government's proposal of age 55 appears to be 
very much in keeping with the majority of those plans. Let me 
give some examples. Age 55 is the earliest pensionable age for 
MLAs in Saskatchewan, Nova Scotia, Yukon and the Northwest 
Territories.
<P>
	Some provinces have adopted a formula approach. In 
Newfoundland the pension starts when age and service total 60. 
In Ontario it starts when a member's age and service total 55. 
British Columbia has a combination of straight minimum age 
and a formula requirement. The pension is paid when a member 
reaches age 55 or when age and years of service total 60. Quebec 
has a similar arrangement whereby the pension goes into pay 
when a member's age and service equal 65, but the member must 
be at least 50 years of age.
<P>
	Only the province of New Brunswick still has no minimum 
pensionable age. Alberta has terminated the MLAs pension plan 
and Prince Edward Island has discontinued its pension 
arrangements for its present MLAs, although new arrangements 
are under review by an independent commission. The recent 
election in Manitoba was to see the existing pension 
arrangements terminated and replaced by a registered 
retirement savings plan, to which both MLAs and the province 
would contribute.
<P>
	If we look at the pensionable age for elected representatives in 
some other western democracies, we also see a variety of 
practices, some of which contain a service component, some of 
which are based on age alone once the pension is vested. For 
example, in Australia a pension is paid after 12 years of service 
or at age 60 with at least eight years of service. In Belgium the 
minimum pensionable age is 55 or age 52 with eight years of 
service. In France the pension is based on age alone, age 55, 
while in Sweden it is based on service alone being 12 years. In 
the United Kingdom the pension is payable at age 65, or age 60 if 
the age and service equal 80. In the United States it is the age of 
62 or age 50 with 20 years of service or 25 years of service with 
no age qualification.
<P>
	I would suggest that these various combinations of age alone, 
service alone, or age and years of service together have been 
developed in recognition, and I stress in recognition, of the 
uniqueness of service as an elected representative, in 
recognition of the fact that there is no guaranteed career as such. 
I would suggest that the government's decision to set age 55 as 
the new minimum pensionable age is well within the range of 
those generally accepted for elected representatives of the 
countries I have just mentioned.
<P>
	We have looked at the pensionable age ranges for the MLAs of 
the provinces and we have looked at the arrangements for 
elected representatives in some of our fellow western 
democracies. I do know there are some people who will ask how 
a pensionable age of 55 compares with the pensionable age for 
ordinary Canadians. I go back again to the unique and 
specialized nature of our employment here on the Hill and I 
point out that it is not unusual to tailor pension plans to meet 
specific career needs to accommodate career patterns that differ 
from the norm.
<P>
	I would light to highlight the special early retirement 
provisions that have been put in place for air traffic controllers, 
members of the Canadian forces and the many police forces 
across the country. These all recognize the vagaries, demands 
and requirements on career patterns that do not correspond at all 
to career patterns of the majority of Canadians.
<P>
	I would like to go back and look at the options Reform 
members have presented to the House. I should like to address 
the general feeling of many of their speakers that pensions of 
members of Parliament should have the same provisions as 
those applicable to the private sector.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	One aspect of private sector pension plans to which those 
members have not given consideration is the vesting 
differential. Vesting is the point at which the contributions of the 
employer become the property of the employee. As an example, 
in many plans in the private sector companies have plans which 
allow members to start accumulating pension benefits after only 
two years of service, whereas presently members of Parliament 
do not have that kind of provision.
<P>
	If we were to adopt two years of service before vesting began, 
each and every member of Parliament who has served in this 
place would qualify for a pension, when in fact less than half of 
members of Parliament ultimately qualify for pensions. On that 
basis alone, to simply change that aspect of a pension plan 
would mean that the cost to the Canadian taxpayers would 
double.
<P>
	There are some differences. For instance, members of 
Parliament are required to pay 11 per cent of salary and the basic 
salary for a member of Parliament is $64,400 a year. Eleven per 
cent of that salary or some $7,000 per year must be paid into the 
plan. No private plan requires 11 per cent. Most plans only 
require about a 3 per cent contribution rate to a maximum of 
some $3,000 to $5,000. In terms of the actual contribution on 
behalf of members, it is substantially higher than we see in 
private plans.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14430"> 14430 </A></B>
<P>
	The vesting for members begins after six years, whereas 
private plans begin vesting after two years and employees could 
qualify for a pension after only two years of service.
<P>
	Members of Parliament also have their eligible RRSP 
contributions reduced by the amount of pension benefits 
accrued in the plan. Should a member not qualify for the 
pension, the funds they have contributed would be returned to 
the member, but the RRSP limits that were forgone because of 
the MP pension plan are not recoverable.
<P>
	Members can qualify for pensions after 19 years of service of 
up to 75 per cent of their salary. Many plans pay up to 90 per 
cent. I give examples of teachers, school boards and firefighters.
<P>
	The hon. member for Calgary Centre said that members of 
Parliament should not receive any expense allowance and that 
they should be paid $150,000 a year. That is the wrong time to 
increase members' salaries.
<P>
	I simply close by saying that I have no hesitation in 
supporting Bill C-85 which brings into effect important changes 
that can be fairly and reasonably implemented at this time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I notice members opposite making fun of the tie which 
I happen to be wearing. The tie is for the benefit of members 
opposite. It is what is commonly referred to by many of my 
constituents as the piggy plan, not the pension plan.
<P>
	At the outset I inform the House that I will be splitting my 
time with one of my colleagues.
<P>
	Why is the Liberal government changing the MP pension 
plan? We would think it would be doing it for reasons of 
integrity. The Liberal government is only addressing MP 
pensions to try to deflect public criticism. It knew Canadians 
wanted real changes so it made red book promises. However the 
promises were minimal and the government is doing the 
absolute minimum to barely meet those promises.
<P>
	What were the promises? They were to end double dipping 
and to change the minimum age for collecting an MP pension, 
two of the many things that have outraged Canadians. The bill 
includes provisions to change those two things, which I 
commend, but the plan needs a major overhaul. This is just a 
start.
<P>
	When questioned about the continuing generosity of the MP 
pension plan most Liberals throw up smoke screens and whine 
about how underpaid politicians are. They do not understand 
that the salaries of working MPs are unrelated to how much 
retired MPs should be making.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	Over the past decade whenever the public has called for MP 
accountability and questioned the unsustainable and bloated 
pension package, the government has protected the plan and met 
the criticism by freezing MP salaries in major PR campaigns. It 
seemed to work before but not any more. Canadians are looking 
at the pension plans. Let us stick with the issue and not talk 
about low MPs salaries to defend high MP pensions.
<P>
	Today the Liberals are pointing to studies that say MPs are 
underpaid while they are working. They respond by retaining 
this overinflated pension plan. Next year or the year after they 
will point to the same studies and say: ``Gosh, look, we are 
underpaid. The studies prove it''. They will pull out the sob 
stories and gain public support for salary increases. Just as they 
have refused to discuss the real issues on MP pensions now, they 
will refuse to discuss the MP pension plan then. That is because 
it is indefensible.
<P>
	The government members go to great lengths to talk about 
anything but why they should be entitled to a two-tier pension 
plan. However some members of the government do not deny 
that the plan is generous. Just last Friday the hon. parliamentary 
secretary to the leader admitted:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The pension plan was generous. It is generous, and remains generous. 
However, the members of Parliament who entered the lists for the election in 
1988 and in all previous elections did so on the basis that at the end of their 
term of office they would be compensated in some way that was generous but 
was designed to make up for the loss of income they suffered in being elected 
to Parliament in the first place.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He continued:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Most people enter a career looking at the remuneration package and seeing 
what it is like.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I think I speak for my colleagues on this side of the House 
when I say that Reformers did not switch careers and enter 
politics for the remuneration package. We came to Ottawa to 
represent our constituents and to make some long overdue 
changes. Altering the platinum plated MP pension plan is just 
one such change.
<P>
	It saddens me to think that the main reason some of my hon. 
colleagues across the way entered politics was for the promised 
pension reward following their retirement from public service, 
and this is by their own admission. I would like to believe my 
colleagues opposite are honourable so I return to my first 
question. Is the Liberal government committed to making 
significant and necessary changes to the MP pension plan? Will 
those changes bring it into line with other Canadian pension 
plans?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Of course not.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> That is right. The 
simple answer is no. One would think the government with its 
penchant for political correctness would want to do the right 
thing. Unfortunately when Liberals are doing the right thing it 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14431"> 14431 </A></B>
<P>
means they are only  addressing public perceptions, not reality. 
These are the Liberal code words for entrenching inequality.
<P>
	The last time I heard someone use those words in the House it 
was the Liberal member opposite from Halifax. She said that her 
government was doing the right thing when defending the 
inclusion of special protection based on sexual orientation in 
Bill C-41.
<P>
	First the Liberals argued that jail terms and community 
service were supposed to be deterrents. They then told judges to 
increase sentences if the victim fell into one of the categories 
listed in section 718.2, such as having a different sexual 
orientation than the person committing the assault. If longer and 
harsher sentences are supposed to be a deterrent and certain 
victims incur those longer sentences, does that not sound like 
special protection? Does it not smack of inequality when some 
Canadian lives are worth more than others?
<P>
	The Liberals are now doing what they call the right thing with 
MP pensions. They are making cosmetic changes and protecting 
their own fully indexed MP retirement funds at the same time as 
they are talking about reducing RRSP contribution levels for 
other Canadians and pondering how long the Canada pension 
plan will survive. That sure sounds like a two-tier pension 
system to me. Every time I hear the phrase doing the right thing 
from a Liberal it means make some people more equal than 
others. In this case it is retired MPs.
<P>
	When a Reformer talks about doing the right thing we mean 
equality for all Canadians. This means equal protection before 
the law, equal pay for the same job, equal opportunity and equal 
treatment of pension plans under the Income Tax Act. Why 
should MPs be exempted from the pension rules they impose on 
other Canadians?
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	During the review of Bill C-85 in the House procedures 
committee only seven witnesses were heard. I find it incredible 
that the committee tried to prevent the National Citizens' 
Coalition and the Canadian Taxpayers Federation from 
attending. These groups have spent considerable time reviewing 
MPs pensions and were instrumental in drawing the excesses of 
the plan to the attention of the media and the public. To deny 
them the opportunity to speak is unconscionable.
<P>
	In fact only six witnesses were invited. Not to be thwarted, the 
Canadian Taxpayers Federation showed up in any event. The 
committee had no choice but to hear the association or be faced 
with a major media scandal.
<P>
	The amazing thing is that even the carefully selected 
witnesses all agreed this was an extremely generous plan. While 
proposing an MP RRSP plan one witness said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>You live by the same rules you make for other Canadians.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	If MPs were reliant on a similar RRSP pension plan they 
might be a little more cautious about the laws they pass that will 
affect all Canadians.
<P>
	According to the Income Tax Act pension plans must comply 
with certain criteria to be valid. One such criterion is a limit on 
the accrual rate. It can be no more than 2 per cent of the final 
three-year average salary. It is also only payable after the age of 
60.
<P>
	The government is acting as if it has made major concessions 
in the MP pension plan and in Bill C-85. As the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Prime Minister proudly pointed out, the pension 
plan will reduce the existing accrual rate by 20 per cent. At first 
that sounds great. All it really means is that the accrual rate was 
dropped from 5 per cent to 4 per cent. Yes, that is a 20 per cent 
reduction, but it is still 100 per cent more than the 2 per cent 
accrual rate all other Canadians are allowed under the Income 
Tax Act.
<P>
	Further, the Income Tax Act states that such a pension scheme 
is only payable after the age of 60. The government has decided 
that only applies to other Canadians. Members are eligible at 55.
<P>
	In the past MPs who served six years were eligible to collect 
the pension no matter how young they were; 36-year-olds could 
collect. I would hardly consider that selfless service in the 
interest of the public good. How many other Canadians receive a 
substantial pension after six years in the job? Surely it is an 
indication that the plan has been exceedingly generous for far 
too long. Moving the age of eligibility to 55, not 60 like the rest 
of Canadians, is considered a significant step by the 
government.
<P>
	I applaud the government on increasing the age of eligibility 
to age 55, but why did it not go that small step further to 60 so 
that the MP pension plan complies with the Income Tax Act?
<P>
	Apparently it will save taxpayers $3.3 million in the first year. 
How much more will be saved in the future because all 
Reformers will opt out? More important, the government is 
acting like taxpayers will continue to realize significant 
savings. Under the plan taxpayers will contribute $3.60 for 
every $1 an MP contributes.
<P>
	There is one promise we intend to keep. When Reform is 
elected government following the next election, we will really 
be reforming this travesty into a pension plan that is completely 
compatible with that of the private sector, and we will be making 
it retroactive.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I listened attentively to the 
member's remarks. I point out a couple of items that I believe 
the member did not include in his speech.
<P>
	I think all members would agree that serving in the House of 
Commons is a real privilege and a real honour. If we could afford 
to be here and work for nothing, I am sure 99 per cent of us 
would do that. The fact of the  matter remains that most of us 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14432"> 14432 </A></B>
<P>
need an income to sustain two homes. Most Canadians do not 
realize that what we make as MPs-
<P>
<B>(1215 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> The pension does not pay for your home.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> I am going to get to 
the pensions, just bear with me. I have a couple of minutes here.
<P>
	Members of Parliament make approximately $14 an hour. By 
the way, I for one happen to support the member from Calgary, 
and I say this with no shame, who believes that we are worth $30 
an hour. I support that position. But what the Reform Party is 
missing is that most members of Parliament do not retire from 
this place. They are defeated.
<P>
	When you are a defeated member of Parliament, you are 
usually defeated because you took on causes, went against the 
wind, and there are a lot of people in your own community after 
you are defeated, with all your education and previous 
experience, who will not readily hire you.
<P>
	I for one have seen many good men and women who have 
served this House who have been defeated brutally, not through 
their own work but through party work, and who are out there 
walking the streets with absolutely no income. I believe that 
Canadians do not want to see members of Parliament who have 
served this House well go on welfare after they are defeated. I do 
not think they want that to happen.
<P>
	I am all for reviewing the pension fund, but if the Reform 
Party is going to be straight with Canadians its members have to 
include, as the member from Calgary has included, in this 
debate the fact that maybe this plan in some respects could be 
perceived to be a little generous, but when you take all factors 
into account after you have been defeated, what bank in Canada 
or business doing business with a bank would want to hire you 
after you are defeated in this House?
<P>
	Being a good member of Parliament in this House means you 
have to take on causes and go against the wind. The Reform 
Party, in fairness to this debate, is not including all factors.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his comments.
<P>
	I listened in this House to his defence of this gold plated plan. 
He seems to believe that when members are ultimately defeated, 
retire, or quit they end up on skid row. I do not know of any 
retired MPs who are on skid row or on welfare rolls. I would be 
interested to know their names if the hon. member is aware of 
some.
<P>
	Further, he addressed the whole issue of the salary and the 
total remuneration package. I said in a speech on this bill that if 
we are going to address the salary issue, let us address it 
separately. Let us not confuse pension with salary. That is what 
the members are saying.
<P>
	I beg to differ. My hon. colleague from Calgary did not 
suggest that we should be paid $30 an hour. He suggested that we 
make the system transparent, that we roll everything in and do 
not have any special concessions built into the wage package. 
He said he does not believe we should have tax free allowances, 
that we should all be the same. That is what he was trying to 
drive at, and I support that. Let us make the system that pertains 
to MPs exactly the same as for all the rest of Canadians. Let us 
have a transparent system. We pay taxes the same as everyone 
else, and we should not have a two-tiered pension plan in this 
country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, this 
debate is not about money. So far all I have heard is about money 
and how much this will save the taxpayers. This debate is about 
integrity, and integrity means honesty.
<P>
	The Reform Party of Canada is the only party in this House 
that says the pension plan is still too generous, notwithstanding 
the changes. It is four times better than the private sector, seven 
times better than any other public sector pension plan. Because 
of this and on principle, we are opting out. It would be 
hypocritical of us to accept it after having criticized it. We 
believe in what we are saying and we are prepared to act.
<P>
	The Liberal government's feeble response has been Bill C-85, 
which effectively ends double dipping and raises the qualifying 
age for a pension to 55. It also increases the amount of time an 
MP has to serve to receive a maximum pension of 75 per cent-5 
per cent better than the private sector-of the best six years of 
earnings. In 19 years MPs will now get 75 per cent of their salary 
in pension, rather than 15, as it was before, rather than the 35 to 
40 years it takes anybody in this gallery, anybody who is not 
down at this level, to receive a pension plan. That is the 
difference, and that is why it is too lucrative.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	The generous pensions MPs are paid are almost universally 
viewed as reasonable compensation for the fact that we do not 
pay members of Parliament enough in salaries. This is the 
Liberal government view, and this is the view that has resulted 
in two undesirable patterns in Canadian politics. First, it is 
difficult to attract top calibre candidates because the pay is not 
high enough. Forget about idealistic arguments that elected 
office is a higher calling and that people should be prepared to 
make sacrifices to serve. The reality is that they have mortgages 
to pay and families to feed too.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14433"> 14433 </A></B>
<P>
	Second, big pensions at the end of the rainbow tend to make 
politicians acutely aware of the need to be re-elected. That 
generates more survival mode thinking and less commitment to 
tackle the tough issues and do what is right for constituents and 
the nation.
<P>
	I would like to read a letter to the editor that I saw in the 
<I>Financial Post</I> written by an individual named Paul Arnold, 
from Victoria. This was on the heels of my comments during 
debate on this bill at second reading when I talked about how we 
should be looking at the whole remuneration package, not just 
the pension separately and justifying the high pension based on 
the low salary. This is ``Some straight talk on MPs' pensions'':
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We should extend thanks to Reform Party MP Jim Silye for having the 
courage to expose the deceptive way in which MPs pay themselves with our 
tax dollars, and for opening the door to a long overdue public debate on this 
sensitive issue.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Professional politicians such as Jean Chrétien and Sheila Copps often 
grumble about how hard they work and how underpaid they are. Neither, 
however, likes to talk very much about their tax free expense accounts, their 
litany of perks and special privileges or, above all, their lucrative gold plated 
pension plan that in Copps's case will be worth millions of dollars.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Silye is simply saying that MPs should be compensated fairly for the work 
they do. They should receive a salary that is comparable to others in both the 
public and private sectors with similar workloads and responsibilities. Their 
salaries should be transparent and all hidden tax free expense accounts, perks, 
privileges and gold plated pensions should be eliminated entirely.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Most Canadians do not object to paying our elected officials well for doing 
what must be a very demanding and stressful job. They want MPs to plan for 
their own retirements by investing in RRSPs, just like the rest of us. What 
Canadians detest is the underhanded way that MPs feed at the public trough 
and the way the taxpayers keep retired MPs living in the lap of luxury for the 
rest of their lives.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	There are 205 rookies in this Parliament. It is not their fault 
this pension plan and its method of distribution is in its current 
state. However, it disappoints me that the 205 rookies in this 
Parliament could have done something about it. I cannot believe 
the rookies on that side allowed 70 veteran MPs to walk away 
from this House and within 30 days of leaving they will start to 
receive their pensions. Why are they not ruled the same way? 
Why is it the class of '88 gets to opt out, our class gets to opt out, 
but future classes do not get to opt out? All future MPs should 
have the choice to opt out as well.
<P>
	A transparent, taxable salary could replace the current 
compensation or remuneration of an MP. Here is this low salary 
that MPs receive that the President of the Treasury Board uses to 
justify this high goldplated pension plan. This is what he says is 
too low and why we need this pension plan. Here is what MPs 
receive: a taxable salary of $64,400; a tax free allowance of 
$21,300, which is equivalent to a pretax value of $42,600 if we 
make it transparent and taxable; the tax free travel status of 
$6,000. These are tax free benefits.  In the private sector, of 
which I was a part two years ago, my company and I had to pay 
taxes on these benefits.
<P>
	We in this House do not have to pay taxes on the following 
benefits: free VIA Rail pass; free personal long distance 
telephone calls; free health and dental package; free parking; 
free air travel for family; free insurance policy with spouse and 
dependent children; free second language lessons; a severance 
payment of $32,000 when defeated or retired; a re-entry 
allocation of $9,000 when defeated or retired.
<P>
<B>(1225 ) </B>
<P>
	On top of that is the lucrative, double standard, gold plated 
MP pension plan for a six-year member, worth between 
$500,000 and $4.5 million, depending upon the years of service, 
and valued at $28,000 per year by the independent consulting 
group Sobeco, Ernst &amp; Young in February 1994.
<P>
	This is why I believe MPs, notably the class of '88 and the 
class of '93 and all future classes, should have the right to opt 
out. A remuneration committee should be struck, with no MPs 
on the committee, and the mandate of the committee on behalf 
of all Canadians should be to set and establish a transparent 
taxable salary for MPs, which includes all expenses that can be 
receipted, and a pension plan of a certain amount that MPs will 
themselves look after.
<P>
	The mistake I made when I gave a dollar figure of $150,000 
was that that is self-serving. It is not my place and it should not 
be my place to set the amount. It should be done at arm's length 
by an independent body. There are some good groups out there 
that could do that. That is why I criticized the 205 rookies-or 
the 150 rookies, because Reform rookies are doing what they 
said they would do.
<P>
	Let us fix it. The Liberals have an opportunity to fix it, and 
that would be the way to do it. We would get the public off the 
backs of MPs. We would restore integrity to politicians, because 
they would be paid a salary and benefits the Canadian public 
agrees with. They would not set it themselves; it would be set by 
an independent body. That would include the salary, benefits, 
and a pension plan that MPs could look after. That is how the 
problem could be solved, and we would not be yelling across the 
floor at each other about what is going on.
<P>
	On an overall compensation and remuneration package, we 
have argued long and strong on this side of the House that the 
pension plan is far too generous. It has to be reduced and brought 
into line with the private sector. That is what Canadians and 
Reformers want. That is what Reformers are promising and that 
is why Reformers are opting out. We are putting our money 
where our mouths are.
<P>
	We really believe that all members who do not opt out, those 
who had the opportunity to opt out, will be voted out, because 
they are treating themselves on a different level and on a 
different standard from the rest of Canadians. We are no better 
than the rest of Canadians.  We are serving Canadians. If we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14434"> 14434 </A></B>
<P>
really want to serve Canadians, we should accept the amount 
that would be given by an independent board.
<P>
	I think the MP pension plan should definitely be looked at and 
reviewed and brought into line with that of the private sector.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I listened with interest and I want to address at least one point 
the member has raised.
<P>
	He continues to suggest in the House that the expense 
allowance members of Parliament receive should be doubled 
and added to salary. This is absolutely a wrong approach. The 
member is slowly back pedalling. He has said in the House on 
many occasions that all the benefits should go away and 
members of Parliament should be paid $150,000 a year. He 
justifies that by saying that the expenses somehow should be 
doubled to be on a pretax basis and added to salary.
<P>
	In fact what the member has failed to realize is that if 
expenses were added to salary it would be the same as telling a 
travelling salesman who received a $5,000 reimbursement for 
his housing, travel, and lodging that somehow he should get 
$10,000 added to salary instead of being reimbursed for the 
expenses.
<P>
	Members of Parliament do have legitimate expenses: a second 
housing allowance, travel, food, et cetera, all of which are part 
of doing this job. They are reimbursement of expenses.
<P>
	Perhaps the member would like to calculate what the 
equivalent pretax would be. What he has failed to do is 
understand that all the expenses incurred by members of 
Parliament would be deductible for tax purposes against that 
salary. In fact the amount of $150,000 represents a 30 per cent 
salary increase to members of Parliament as proposed by the 
Reform Party.
<P>
<B>(1230 ) </B>
<P>
	I simply ask the hon. member for Calgary Centre if he would 
explain to the House why he believes we should change our 
pension plan to make it the same as the private sector's and why 
is the Reform Party recommending a 30 per cent salary increase 
to members of Parliament?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Madam Speaker, we have an issue where, on the 
basis of a low salary, the government tries to justify a high 
pension. I have tried to take a look at the complete remuneration 
package of MPs, which includes the so-called low salary and the 
pension. If we add them together what do we get? It is too low on 
the one end and too high on the other. Why not bring them 
together and look at it that way?
<P>
	As far as the doubling up of expenses, that $21,300 is called 
an expense allowance but all the members who live in Ottawa 
and the surrounding area get it and they do not have two 
residences. I use all the expense money because I live in Calgary 
and I have a residence here. According to Sobeco, Ernst &amp; 
Young, not all of that expense money is used up. However, that is 
not really the issue.
<P>
	The issue is we should come clean and say: ``To be a member 
of Parliament this is your job description and this is the head 
office. You come from all across Canada to work in the head 
office. If you come here we will pay you this much in a 
transparent taxable salary. Receipt your expenses and we will 
reimburse you. Within that benefit package we will give you 
some of these benefits, like a life insurance policy, a health and 
dental policy, parking, and the value of that is determined by-''
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Why are you recommending $150,000?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> I should not have recommended a number. If it 
were $150,000 the net amount we would get is $75,000 to look 
after everything, all expenses, the second residence and 
everything else.
<P>
	What the hon. member gets right now is about $72,000 net. He 
is within $3,000 of that same figure. I can show that based on the 
total compensation package.
<P>
	The solution is not to keep defending this gold plated, trough 
regular, trough light and trough stout plan. Even members of the 
government do not understand the pension plan. They keep 
defending it rather than asking how they can fix it. I have put 
forward a suggestion and a solution. The pension plan is too 
generous. Get rid of it. Make it no better than the private 
sector's. That is what Canadians want. That is what we have to 
do. Listen to what Canadians have said and do that.
<P>
	If we do that there is a problem with the rest of the equation 
and we will have to fix it. However, there will be another time to 
talk about remuneration. We have to bring one down and bring 
out all of the perks which are under the table.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it was not my intention to 
participate in this debate but as I was listening to Reform 
members I could not believe they were not discussing some of 
the other relevant factors in the debate.
<P>
	Before the member for Calgary Centre leaves I would like to 
make sure I understood his quote accurately that the person who 
wrote the article said members of Parliament should receive a 
salary commensurate with what they would receive in the 
private sector. The member nodded that is what this article 
stated.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	That is an interesting point to debate. From the same 
<I>Financial Post</I> last week we saw a list of the top 100 executives 
in Canada and what they made. For members who did not see the 
article I will give some highlights.  The top executive in Canada, 
my former employer Mr. Stronach from Magna, made approxi-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14435"> 14435 </A></B>
<P>
mately $14 million. The last one on the list received 
approximately $1 million.
<P>
	Of the top 100 executives in Canada, the men and women 
given judgment by their peers to be the top 100 in terms of their 
business accomplishments, achievements and contributions to 
the community, the lowest paid makes $1 million and the 
highest approximately $14 million.
<P>
	In no way, shape or form do I want to suggest the salaries in 
the House should be commensurate with the top 100 executives 
in Canada. However, I believe the work we do in this board room 
is every bit as important as the work those executives do in the 
private sector. Our responsibilities are as great. There are a lot 
of men and women in the country who if they were in the private 
sector would probably be in that top 100.
<P>
	There are men and women in the Chamber whom I have 
watched in committee and in the House. I have watched them 
travel the country and the world. They work harder than a lot of 
the top 100 executives. A lot of the top 100 executives could not 
keep up with most members of Parliament.
<P>
	The Reform Party is trying to depreciate the contribution the 
men and women of the Chamber make on behalf of their 
constituents and on behalf of their country. The member for 
Calgary Centre said let us have integrity, let us be transparent. 
He talked about free rail passes, that we have plane tickets to 
travel Canada and that we have a telephone code in order to 
make long distance calls. He tried to spin that these are perks.
<P>
	These are not perks. These are tools the men and women in the 
Chamber need to do their job. How many of us in the Chamber 
have ever used our rail passes? This is my second term as an MP 
and I think I have used my rail pass once to go from Ottawa to 
Toronto. I would like to get on the train instead of taking a fast 
ride to Vancouver to give a speech. I would love to have the 
luxury of taking a week to get there and a week to get back on our 
rail system, what is left of it. However, a lot of us do not have the 
luxury to enjoy the rail pass the way the member for Calgary 
Centre tried to insinuate.
<P>
	This whole notion of depreciating the work members of 
Parliament do is really not fair. It is fair to debate the notion the 
pension plan might be perceived as too high or too generous but 
I do not when we consider the whole package involved.
<P>
<B>(1240 ) </B>
<P>
	On the notion in the <I>Financial Post</I> which someone in the 
private sector wrote to the member about salaries being 
commensurate with the private sector's, what member of 
Parliament will lead the campaign that we want $.5 million a 
year for all members of Parliament? They would be dead.
<P>
	I have had a lot of experience in the private sector and I have 
met most of those people in the top 100. A lot of members of 
Parliament are worth every nickel of the $.5 million a year if we 
want to compare them to the contributions those top 100 
executives make.
<P>
	If we are to be fair and constructive in this debate we should 
include all factors and we should not mislead Canadians. Rail 
passes and plane passes are not there as perks. They are there for 
us to go out and give speeches, listen to people in all parts of the 
country. We do not serve only our own communities in the 
Chamber, we serve coast to coast. That is why we have those 
instruments. To spin them as perks I do not think is responsible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
also pleased to participate in the discussion on Bill C-85, a bill 
which lives up to our red book commitments and goes beyond.
<P>
	The bill makes important reforms to MP pension 
arrangements and has the effect of lowering the costs to 
taxpayers of the plan by some 33 per cent. The bill proposes a 
package of what are essentially cutbacks to one element of 
parliamentarians' compensation, our pension plan. Because the 
other elements of our package remain frozen they could not be 
used for any offsetting adjustments.
<P>
	Members today are being asked to accept a pensionable age of 
55 and a 20 per cent reduction in our pension formula for our 
future service. I believe this is a fair bargain. I hope members 
will join me in supporting the bill.
<P>
	The changes to the pension arrangements contained in Bill 
C-85 are being proposed after somewhat long and careful study. 
Part of this was carried out through the review process set up 
under the Parliament of Canada Act. Under this act a 
commission is required to be established after each federal 
election to review the adequacy of MP compensation and 
allowances.
<P>
	The most recent commission established in January 1994 was 
headed by the Hon. Charles Lapointe and made its report in July 
1994. Even before the Lapointe commission report, however, a 
special study of parliamentarians' compensation had already 
been commissioned by the prior government. This study was 
carried out by Sobeco, Ernst &amp; Young, a reputable Montreal 
consulting firm. Its report was tabled in Parliament in February 
1994 and was then referred to the Lapointe commission for 
review.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Sobeco, Ernst &amp; Young examined several elements, including 
the questioning of the basic principles governing 
parliamentarians' pensions. They also suggested a number of 
discussion topics, such as tying sessional indemnities to 
parliamentarians' private income and rates of pay to their 
performance.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14436"> 14436 </A></B>
<P>
	The government welcomes these two reports on the whole 
issue of parliamentarians' compensation and allowances. As 
part of this study, not only were extensive consultations carried 
out with citizen groups, business associations, compensation 
experts and other stakeholders, but present and former members 
were also consulted. Throughout the process, the objective was 
to come up with a series of changes which would be fair and, 
while alleviating taxpayers' concerns, would continue to meet 
the needs of members.
<P>
	Let me first quote a few of the recommendations contained in 
the independent report presented by Sobeco, Ernst &amp; Young, 
which reviewed the entire parliamentarian compensation 
scheme.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This study looked at each aspect of our compensation 
package, from sessional indemnities through pensions, 
insurance, health benefits and travel. A value was assigned to 
each component which in turn allowed the consultants to value 
the total package. The components and package were then 
compared with the compensation packages provided in other 
Canadian jurisdictions, public and private, and in selected 
international jurisdictions. When total compensation is taken 
into account and compared to similar occupations in private and 
public sectors, the study noted that MPs' compensation exceeds 
that of managers in all companies but as was pointed out it is 
still less than executives.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	Both the general feelings and the formal comparisons arising 
from the study support the position that parliamentarians' basic 
salaries are relatively modest but our pension arrangements are 
overall too generous.
<P>
	The study recommended a realignment of our expense 
allowance to include an accommodation allowance and an 
accountable expense portion. It recommended minor changes to 
the travel benefits, insurance benefits and career transition 
provisions. At the same time it recommended that the pension 
plan be scaled back essentially to levels more commonly found 
in the private sector. The study also recommended increasing 
the salary of an MP from the current $64,400 to $88,500.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, it is important to note that the consultants 
recognized however that it may not be the right time, in the 
present situation, to vote the salary increases they were 
recommending. At any rate, they indicated that the proposed 
decrease in the retirement plan, if approved, would necessitate 
an increase in wages so that the overall compensation level 
would remain the same.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A true pension plan must have a retirement pension goal 
guaranteeing a revenue replacement target at retirement which 
does not depend on investment return over the accumulation 
period, salary increases or in some  cases, age of retirement. 
Such an objective may be reached only through a defined benefit 
plan because employer's contributions can be applied to level 
the fluctuations in retirement pensions resulting from variations 
in investment returns over the years.
<P>
	The consultants' bottom line recommendation on this issue is 
that if the Canadian public's concerns were that pension costs 
were too high, the solution should be to reduce the cost by 
reducing benefits rather than to replace the plan with a 
retirement savings plan which had no clear income replacement 
goals.

<P>
	As the hon. members probably noticed when they read Bill 
C-85, this is the solution advocated by the Treasury Board 
president. The measures contained in this bill will help reduce 
costs to taxpayers substantially.
<P>
	Sobeco, Ernst &amp; Young also made recommendations on 
double dipping. As the hon. members know, the bill before us 
provides for major restrictions in that regard.
<P>
	The pension payable to former members who receive, in 
respect of a federal position, a salary or fee paid through the 
CRF or appropriations will be reduced or cancelled if they earn 
more than $5,000 per year from that job.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As my final comment on the Sobeco, Ernst &amp; Young report, I 
would like to read what the consultants considered an important 
goal in setting parliamentarians' compensation: ``MPs' 
compensation should contribute to making members proud to 
serve their country and convinced that their financial reward for 
doing so is fair and to making Canadians in turn satisfied with 
the levels paid to their representatives''. I think all members can 
endorse this goal.
<P>
	As I indicated earlier, the Sobeco, Ernst &amp; Young report was 
subsequently referred to the Lapointe commission. 
Traditionally that commission has not looked at issues such as 
pension benefits. Nevertheless, it did so on this occasion. The 
Lapointe commission made recommendations in two main 
areas, first, the area of MPs' and senators' compensation and 
second, in the matter of the public's attitude about 
parliamentarians' compensation overall.
<P>
	Like the Sobeco study before it, the author noted that there 
was a great deal of misunderstanding and lack of knowledge 
about the compensation paid to parliamentarians. Like Sobeco, 
the Lapointe commission also recommended an increase in 
sessional indemnities to take effect as soon as the salary freeze 
is lifted in 1997.
<P>
	The commission recommended replacement of our tax free 
allowances with fully accountable capped expense accounts. As 
hon. members know, the bill before us adopts the 
recommendation of the Lapointe commission and sets age 55 as 
the pensionable age under the Members of Parliament Retiring 
Allowances Act. The Lapointe commission agreed with Sobeco 
that incidents  of double dipping would be greatly reduced 
through imposition of a pensionable age and that no additional 
measures 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14437"> 14437 </A></B>
<P>
were needed. However, our government does not agree. That is 
why Bill C-85 has a provision which eliminates double dipping.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	These studies should be a great source of inspiration. They 
identify all the factors to consider and the areas where 
adjustments are required. However, the fact that fiscal restraint 
is still the order of the day gives the President of the Treasury 
Board little leeway in making changes to the members' 
compensation scheme. Not only would a decrease in our 
retirement benefits be unfair to us if it were not offset by some 
adjustment, but it would make public office much less attractive 
in the future.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	On this side of the House we believe that the proposed 
reduction in our future benefits of 20 per cent and the reduction 
of taxpayers' costs by one-third have gone a considerable way 
to reforming our pension plan in a period when the government 
is committed to maintaining the wage freeze for 
parliamentarians.
<P>
	The Lapointe commission's final pension recommendation 
concerned the contribution rate to the pension plan which it 
recommended should be reviewed. Bill C-85 recognizes that 
members' pension benefits will be reduced in the future and sets 
a revised member contribution rate of 9 per cent of session 
indemnities and additional salary if applicable.
<P>
	In conclusion, it is clear that Bill C-85 meets many of the 
objectives outlined in the Lapointe commission report. We 
could have gone further but I believe we have met our red book 
commitments and gone beyond them. Maybe it is not to the 
satisfaction of everyone, but we have accepted much of the 
advice of many who have spoken on the reform of MP pensions. 
This bill is proof positive that we have kept our promises.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, a very wise man once said that when you are in a 
hole and you want to get out, the first thing you should do is to 
stop digging. It is interesting to hear members opposite speak 
today and try to validate the change to the MP gold plated 
pension plan when in actual fact what they should probably do is 
to just stop digging. Some members and Canadians have deemed 
this to be an unjust and unfair form of remuneration, when in 
actual fact it should be a pure pension plan. We should separate 
salary and pension.
<P>
	I would like to ask the member a question regarding the 
actuarially sound propositions in the pension plans, the old and 
the new proposition being put forward for consideration of the 
House.
<P>
	The Liberals have done some things. They have reduced the 
rate at which the benefits accumulate from 5 per cent to 4 per 
cent. They have also reduced the amount members actually pay 
into the pension plan from 11 per cent to 9 per cent.
<P>
	In looking at the plan we should try to figure out if it is 
actuarially sound. I think all members of the House and all 
Canadians would agree that something we at least owe the 
public of Canada is to make sure the program is actuarially 
sound. Witnesses stated before the committee that to make it 
actuarially sound we should be paying in close to 30 per cent. I 
believe the figure was between 26 per cent and 30 per cent.
<P>
	How can the member square this with his constituents when 
what we are doing with this plan is making the taxpayer pick up 
the difference? We should be paying approximately 26 per cent 
to make it actuarially sound.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Discepola:</B> Madam Speaker, I have no problem standing 
here before my constituents and supporting Bill C-85 because 
during the election we campaigned on the question of pension 
reform. I will save members the trouble of reading the red book 
commitment, and hopefully they have read it. Two issues came 
up time and time again.
<P>
	One was the age. I agree totally that no one should be able to 
retrieve a pension right after leaving office, despite the fact that 
the average tenure in the Chamber is less than six years. In 
private industry the normal vesting period is two years. In our 
case it is six years and the majority of us do not receive the 
pension plan. The Bloc Quebecois, for example, has stated 
categorically that it is not interested in the debate because its 
members do not plan to be here in six years.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	The contribution which we make as MPs has been 
substantially reduced. It has decreased from 5 per cent to 4 per 
cent. Our contributions have been decreased from 11 per cent to 
9 per cent. That will save taxpayers over $3 million a year, 
which amounts to 33 per cent of the cost.
<P>
	We have done our share. I will have no qualms justifying that 
to my constituents in the next election campaign. I will be proud 
to stand and justify my contribution to the constituents of 
Vaudreuil. I guarantee to members of the Reform Party that I 
will be here after the next election because my constituents have 
confidence in me.
<P>
	It is not a single issue which will dictate whether a member 
will return to the House. The Reform Party has chosen minor 
issues such as this one to make big political gains. It might work. 
I wish Reform members luck. But by George, if we had 
expended half of the energy that we have in this debate on the 
real 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14438"> 14438 </A></B>
<P>
problems which face the country, such as job creation and 
growth, we would have been much better off.
<P>
	I am glad this is the last day of debate on the bill. I wish 
Reform members a merry summer as they travel to the east 
exploiting some aspects of the bill for their own political gain 
and I wish them luck in their recruitment process for the Reform 
Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, it gives me 
pleasure to speak on Bill C-85. I will be splitting my time with 
the member for Fraser Valley West.
<P>
	Major problems exist in Canada. There is the debt and the 
deficit. There is the criminal justice system and all the reforms 
which are necessary. There is parliamentary reform, which rates 
fairly high with Canadians. We certainly need to look at the 
other place; all of us would agree many changes are required 
there. Free votes. Recall of MPs so we can get rid of the bad 
ones. Referenda. Those are the issues people are talking about. 
The other things they are talking about are things which are not 
compatible with what they see as being fair. Certainly MP 
pensions fit into that category.
<P>
	Canadians are now very aware that over the last number of 
years we have built a $553 billion debt and that the debt deepens 
by $110 million per day. By the time the next election comes the 
country will be another $100 billion in debt.
<P>
	When those are the problems, Canadians do not want us to 
waste our time talking about things like pensions and how we are 
going to take care of members of Parliament. We have wasted 
our time talking about things like gun control, quotas, the $2 
coin and the minor changes we will make to the pension plan. 
People are saying there are some big problems which we should 
be addressing. Canadians are asking us to get on with the job of 
addressing those problems.
<P>
	When talking about the pension plan Canadians ask how the 
Liberals can justify the pension. How do they do that? What do 
the Liberals say when they are in the House of Commons to 
justify their pension plan? Let us look at the kinds of things we 
have heard during the debate.
<P>
	First, we have heard about the red book. The red book says 
that we are going to change the pension plan. The Liberals say 
they have done that. They have made the eligibility age 55. The 
rest of the country of course is looking at 65, 67 and a much 
higher age in the future. Double dipping is not allowed any 
more. ``Big deal'', is what most people will say about that. They 
say they have gone further than what they had planned. I think 
the Reform Party can take some credit for that.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	We hear: ``When you leave one job, you are going to have a 
hard time finding another one''. I believe that if one has done his 
or her job here one will probably have an easier time finding 
another job. The people here who have done a good job will be 
sought after by industry.
<P>
	What about job security? That is a little hard to sell as well. In 
what other job does one find security any more? If people do 
their jobs they will have security, which is what we should have 
here.
<P>
	Members have said that when they leave their jobs this 
pension is compensation for a low salary. It has been made very 
clear by the member for Calgary Centre that there are other parts 
to this job. All Canadians are asking for is to have things up 
front. They want to know what MPs get.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a 
point of order. In view of the fact that Bill C-85 is such an 
important issue, I wonder if it might be in order to ask a few of 
the Liberals to attend in this House.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The hon. member knows 
very well that we do not refer to the presence or absence of any 
member. I would like to reiterate something I mentioned this 
morning. Because of the emotional issue we are dealing with, we 
could deal with it more calmly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Madam Speaker, I do not 
see a quorum.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I do not see a quorum.
<P>
	<I>And the count having been taken:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The hon. member for 
Red Deer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Madam Speaker, it is amazing how 
that works. It certainly is nice to give a speech to somebody. It 
makes my point about democracy and how little there is of that 
in this House as we have gone on.
<P>
	I would like to go back to the pension and how Liberals justify 
it. I have pointed out that this attempt at justifying the pension 
plan is going to fall on deaf ears. I think to the next election and 
about bringing up the trough charts that will be available as we 
show who is at the trough and what sorts of benefits there will 
be.
<P>
	I also think about that PC candidate who is going to say: ``I 
cannot opt out of the plan''. I think of the Liberal and NDP who 
will say: ``Our party did not opt out of the plan''. I also think of 
the position we are going to be in when we say: ``We all opted 
out of the plan when given that opportunity''.
<P>
	An article in today's <I>Gazette</I> is interesting. It states that the 
voters will not forgive MPs for keeping their lavish pensions. 
This is where it is really at. By voting themselves reduced but 
still lavish pensions this week, many Liberal MPs might be 
signing their own political death warrants. I guess we should say 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14439"> 14439 </A></B>
<P>
hurrah for that and right on because that certainly is going to 
help our campaign.
<P>
	The public is not stupid. The public knows what is happening. 
The public has sent the message that it should come from the 
constituency to Ottawa and that is where the message has to be. 
It is a clear message. The message on pensions is that they are 
too rich, too gold plated. Eighty per cent of Canadians are saying 
that. That is what the polls are saying about the MP gold plated 
pension plan. They do not believe that the party knows best. 
They do not believe that this is a fair item.
<P>
	For the member for Kingston and the Islands who brings out 
his green book, his little, little green book, I have a little, little 
red book. If I might paraphrase from this little, little red book 
concerning the topic of punishment of backbenchers, it says that 
MPs must learn to stop listening to the views of their 
constituents and remember their loyalty is to the party. That is 
exactly what the message in the pension plan is, loyalty to the 
party.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	So we will quote from this little, little red book because this 
little, little red book-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Could I ask the member 
to keep his objects on his desk please.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> The member from Kingston certainly 
holds his little, little green book up. I thought with all of his 
experience I could do it as well.
<P>
	This lack of democracy, this lack of listening to people, is 
probably the biggest concern I have. Let us look at the pension 
plan without mixing it up with salaries and other things. Its 
clause by clause study was done in 12 minutes.
<P>
	Look at the committee hearings where so much is done. We 
invite selected guests and give them one day to tell us what we 
want to hear. They would not even tell us what the government 
wanted to hear. So there are no amendments of substance and if 
there are they are defeated by the powers that be, by the Madam 
Speaker dictatorship that rules this House.
<P>
	We now have a two-tier system being proposed, a trough lite 
and a trough regular. The trough regular gives us figures that are 
unimaginable. We have members who would get $4 million if 
they were to retire and live to age 75. They could never get that 
in the private sector. The pension plan is three and one-half 
times greater than one could get in the private sector.
<P>
	The public is not saying that members do not deserve a 
pension. They are saying we should make it the same as we 
could get in the private sector. They are not saying-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry, the hon. 
member's time has expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I have to sometimes apologize for my colleagues 
because I want to give credit where credit is due. Some credit 
should be given to the Liberal Party.
<P>
	When I was flying to Ottawa a couple of weeks ago I met this 
fellow on the plane who said: ``I want to give credit where credit 
is due to the Liberals because they made me a millionaire''. I 
said: ``A millionaire, so why are you so sad and forlorn? What 
were you before?'' He replied that he had been a 
multimillionaire. It brings me back to this pension plan to ask: 
``Who is becoming the millionaire, the businessman or the 
member of Parliament from the Liberals or this separatist group 
over here?''
<P>
	I am wearing an appropriate tie today. It has some little 
piggies on it. It reminds me of the poem I learned in grade three 
when I was 22 or so. It goes:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This little piggy went to the pension market over here<BR>
 And this little piggy can buy a new home<BR>
 And this little piggy buys the best of roast beef<BR>
 But all these little piggies will ultimately get none</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is my little piggy story. If the government thinks we are 
kidding it had better bear in mind the word retroactive because 
when the next election comes and the present government is out, 
we will be back visiting Bill C-85.
<P>
	I have listened to a lot of things in this House of Commons 
during this past session. The other day when the Prime 
Minister-he has done this numerous times but I am speaking of 
recently-stood up in the House of Commons he had the nerve to 
compare himself with a hockey player to justify this fat cat 
pension plan. It was absurd for the chief politician in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1310 ) </B>
<P>
	Why these folks over there try to mix salary and pension is 
beyond me. There are people like the President of the Treasury 
Board, who should know better and who also will pick up a good 
pension. Why are they not listening to the people, through the 
Reform Party, through all the contacts that they have, through 
all the organizations in this country, about pensions? I will never 
know. It is certainly not a populist organization at all.
<P>
	One member recently in making a comment to one of my 
colleagues suggested that my colleague should resign if he does 
not like the pension plan. I think the shoe should be on the other 
foot. This group should resign for putting in the pension plan. If 
they will not resign we will be back talking in a couple of years 
through an election.
<P>
	For years as I was growing up I was concerned about political 
remoteness. When I lived in Atlantic Canada I heard that when I 
was a young man and later when I moved to British Columbia. 
Everyone you talk to talks about political remoteness and how 
Ottawa does not resemble what is really going on in the country. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14440"> 14440 </A></B>
<P>
This pension plan is just so representative of that political 
remoteness.
<P>
	During the election campaign in my riding there were three 
big issues: the economy, the criminal justice system and the 
pension plan. Even before the election, I decided to opt out of 
the pension plan, as my colleagues have. I still kept thinking 
about this political remoteness.
<P>
	When we talk about things here in the House of Commons 
from day to day, you cannot understand for instance these 
separatists who come into this House wanting and agreeing with 
a pension plan. I think it is absurd enough that they are getting a 
salary, much less asking for a pension plan at a cost to hard 
working Canadian citizens.
<P>
	I also wonder why it is that the Liberals keep hanging on to 
this and why it is they try to keep mixing it up with the statement 
that we are not paid enough, we need a future, we need a pension 
plan. I cannot understand how they are missing the boat. I guess 
it is political remoteness. They just do not understand.
<P>
	Three bills have just gone through the House-this is the last 
one-where the government has restricted debate and enforced 
time limitation. They were Bill C-68, the gun law; Bill C-41, 
commonly known now as the hate law, and sex crimes too if we 
consider sexual orientation; and Bill C-85. All three are on very 
important issues and the government has the audacity to limit 
debate.
<P>
	Some of the other bills which have gone through are just plain 
useless but government members debated and debated and 
debated. When it comes down to the three important bills which 
the government has goofed up on it limits debate. When we talk 
about political remoteness it is here in this House.
<P>
	If the government thinks for a moment that this Reform Party 
is going away, it is just starting and it is growing. It is growing in 
Ontario, it is growing in Atlantic Canada. The government can 
stick to its polls. It tried that in the last election and there were 
52 Reform MPs brought here. The government can stick to its 
polls but it will not work. The Liberals are going to the same 
Jurassic Park as that other group did. That is where they are 
going.
<P>
	What is wrong with a plan that is no better than other people 
get; a one for one contribution? What is wrong with that? Why 
must they have more? What is in it for them? What is not in it for 
the taxpayer? People in my community do not understand it, yet 
Liberals say they represent people all across Canada. It is 
political remoteness.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	I have seen here problems with ethics, problems with integrity 
and problems with arrogance to the hilt. However the real 
problem in the House is a four-letter word called greed. It can be 
called nothing better than that.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It is a five-letter word.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> That is what I should have 
said, five. I am only an accountant. I guess these things do not 
add up for me. That is how one gets out of it. That is why I have 
colleagues here. Accountants kind of get off track.
<P>
	What really irritates in the whole discussion is when 
government members opposite have been known to say that the 
member for Beaver River is opportunistic in opting out or not 
opting into the plan. That is about as low as we can get from 
members opposite.
<P>
	The individual is personally going to be out probably a couple 
of million dollars. That is not opportunistic. That is real 
commitment. That is the kind of commitment and principles one 
gets from this side, not the hogwash we have been hearing over 
there. They were the very people, when the Conservatives were 
over there, who stood over here and said: ``You don't have any 
ethics. You don't have any integrity''.
<P>
	What is happening today? It is the same old story. Liberal, 
Tory, the same old story. The two words I want to talk about in 
the final analysis are my five-letter word and I do not even want 
to say how many letters are in retroactive. It does not matter.
<P>
	The word retroactive will be indelible in the minds of 
Reformers. When we move opposite we will make a change. 
There will be changes to Bill C-68. There will be changes to Bill 
C-41 and there will be changes to Bill C-85. They had better 
remember the word retroactive.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it goes without saying that the issue of members' 
pensions is of interest to every member of Parliament as well as 
to Canadians in general.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Many have strong opinions as can be seen by the debate in the 
House today with members speaking both in support of and in 
opposition to Bill C-85.
<P>
	There is one thing all members of the House can agree on: the 
bill before the House is an improvement on the existing pension 
plan. It is a step in the right direction. I understand hon. 
members opposite think it should go further, but it is a step in the 
right direction.
<P>
	The basics of it are that we are living up to our red book 
commitment. Our red book commitment in the election 
campaign said that we would end double dipping: the practice of 
members leaving the House or leaving the Senate and getting 
another job on the federal public payroll or an appointment and 
being able to collect their pension and a salary at the same time. 
That is now over. That is over with the bill and it is over with the 
practice the Prime Minister instituted in Parliament in an 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14441"> 14441 </A></B>
<P>
informal fashion prior to the bill formally being adopted and 
coming into law. That is covered.
<P>
	Canadians are concerned that there be a minimum age, that 
members of Parliament leaving in their forties not be collecting 
a pension at such a young age. The age was reviewed by a 
commission of Parliament, the Lapointe commission which 
recommended age 55. A consultant study that was 
commissioned by the previous federal government also 
recommended age 55, and that is what is being implemented in 
Bill C-85. Again we have lived up to the commitment that was 
made in the election campaign to deal with the matter of a 
minimum age.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	We have gone beyond that because we have recognized in this 
time of fiscal restraint, this time of needing to reduce the cost of 
government, that we should take a leadership role and therefore 
we have by reducing the benefit rate for pensions collected by 
retired members of Parliament. In doing so I have been able to 
cut the cost to the taxpayer by some 33 per cent. A 33 per cent 
reduction in the cost of the pension plan for members of 
Parliament is again an improvement, a step in the right 
direction.
<P>
	We also have to look at the pension plan in the context of 
overall compensation for members of Parliament. That has been 
raised not only by the Lapointe commission and by the 
consultant study which said that we should go up in the salary 
and down in the pensions, keeping the overall remuneration 
level the same. Not only has it been suggested by them and by 
various witnesses who have appeared before the Lapointe 
commission, but it has also been a point that the Reform Party 
through its whip has particularly highlighted. The whip of the 
Reform Party was suggesting that we should perhaps be going 
up in salaries far in excess of what they are today, which would 
amount to increases in the neighbourhood of 100 per cent to 130 
per cent.
<P>
	We just cannot afford to do that. For the Reform Party to 
suggest in this time of fiscal restraint that we should have those 
kinds of salary increases is a terribly unreasonable position and 
not one that I am sure would be supported by the taxpayers at all.
<P>
	We have to look at the total context of the compensation 
package here. Members of Parliament have chosen to pay more 
for pensions, for having that kind of benefit when they leave the 
House, and to sacrifice a higher salary level than the Reform 
Party whip and others have recommended.
<P>
	While they talk about the pension being greater than what 
other people may get in the private sector, they fail to point out 
that members of Parliament pay a lot more. With any pension 
plan, whether it be private sector or public sector, one gets 
according to the amount of money one invests in it. Members of 
Parliament invest a substantial amount more. That is something 
they conveniently overlook.
<P>
	In putting this matter in the context of total compensation, 
there are some words that are particularly important to note 
because they were used by a member of the Lapointe 
commission, Professor C. E. S. Franks from Queen's University. 
He later appeared before the standing committee of the House 
reviewing Bill C-85. I think he put the matter in a good context 
and it is relevant to quote his words. He said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The majority of ex-MPs have served too short a time, in fact less than six 
years, to receive any parliamentary pension whatsoever. In fact a great many 
ex-members not only do not have a pension but have a difficult time in 
finding employment and re-establishing themselves after serving as a 
member.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Professor Franks went on to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The issue of MP pensions should more appropriately be considered in the 
context of overall remuneration of elected representatives. Members of 
Parliament are significantly less well paid than other Canadian professionals. 
International comparisons prove Canadian MPs to be among the lowest paid. 
If other factors were to be taken into account, like the length of sessions, the 
opportunities for other income generating activities, the likelihood of serving 
long enough to make a career as a politician and to earn a pension sufficient 
for support in old age, then Canadian elected representatives are even worse 
off than those of other countries. This low remuneration has effect on 
representation in Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Professor Franks went on further in his testimony to indicate:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A higher proportion of Canadian MPs choose voluntarily to retire from the 
House and not to run in an election than leave by any means, death, defeat or 
desire, than in Britain, than the United States or continental Europe.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>There is something deeply dissatisfying in the work world of the Canadian 
member of Parliament to create such a rapid turnover and desire to leave. It 
might be argued that this turnover does not matter and that a steady influx of 
new members is a good thing in the House, but what happens in Canada goes 
beyond what is a good thing.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Comparative studies of legislatures and the legislative process have shown 
that a necessary requirement and precondition for a strong legislature, 
independent and effective representation, and strong legislative committees is 
a body of experience, experienced long term members who make a career in 
the legislature.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Canadian Parliament does not have this sort of long serving 
membership. The Canadian Parliament is correspondingly weakened in its 
ability to hold government accountable, in its efforts to obtain redress of 
grievances for citizens, and in its debate and investigation of important issues.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	The important point illustrated by his words is that the failure 
to appropriately compensate members of Parliament weakens 
the institution and in turn is detrimental to Canadians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14442"> 14442 </A></B>
<P>
	He also noted, as did other witnesses, that half of former MPs 
go without any pension. We are talking about a situation where 
half the people in the House will never collect a pension. There 
is not an enormous cost to the Canadian taxpayer when we 
consider that. Members put in a lot of time and effort and do not 
receive any pension or contribution from the government.
<P>
	The Reform Party prefers to point out that there are some 
members who might do well with a pension because of their 
length of service. They have even used some figures they 
obtained from the National Citizens' Coalition. I have looked at 
those figures and they are wildly out of line with reality. They 
are just not true at all.
<P>
	For example, they used one figure of $2.5 million relevant to 
one member of the House when the actual figure is almost half 
that in terms of the accumulation of a pension collection over a 
great number of years. The assumption is that the member would 
be leaving now and collecting a pension until age 70. There is 
also the assumption that the inflation rate is 5 per cent. The 
inflation rate is actually less than half of that. The figures were 
grossly exaggerated. Again I point out that only half the 
members who leave the House receive a pension.
<P>
	Professor Franks' comments, the Sobeco, Ernst &amp; Young 
report, the Lapointe commission and the hon. whip of the 
Reform Party have all raised the question of why we do not raise 
the salaries. We just cannot. Members of Parliament have had 
their salaries frozen for some six years now. Public servants' 
salaries have also been frozen. In this kind of climate it would be 
a bad message and bad point of leadership to suggest that we 
should increase our salaries. I am sorry, I say to the whip of the 
Reform Party and other members who support him. We just 
cannot in this context deal with a salary increase.
<P>
	Meanwhile, we have indicated strong leadership in terms of 
moving in the right direction, living up to our commitments 
made during the election campaign as printed in the red book, 
and reducing the cost of the pension plan to the taxpayers by 
some 33 per cent.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is anticipated that the amendments proposed in Bill C-85 
will result in annual savings of some $3.3 million.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This bill is a move in the right direction. It reduces the overall 
cost of the MP pension plan to taxpayers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the hon. member for 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt.
<P>
	I point out to the House at the outset that I am not pleased with 
the method the government is using to force this particularly 
biased legislation through the House.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	The government cannot be at all comfortable with this 
legislation or it would allow members of Parliament free debate. 
That is not happening. What do we see? We see a government 
slipping this through as quickly as possible during the last day in 
an attempt to hide it from public scrutiny.
<P>
	Canadians are not stupid. They will see through this strategy, 
through the government's attempt to put one over at the very last 
minute. They will not be fooled by this undemocratic strategy.
<P>
	The Liberals, like the government before them, are 
underestimating the Canadian public. The new plan does not 
address Canadians' demands for a fair system of MP pensions. 
The new plan is hardly any better or any different from the old 
plan.
<P>
	It provides for a few adjustments by taking from one area and 
adding somewhere else, all at taxpayers' expense of course. This 
plan simply raises members' take home salary by reducing MP 
contribution rates.
<P>
	Liberals in the committee on procedure and House affairs 
excluded witnesses from coming forward to speak on the bill. 
The government claimed it would allow witnesses only who 
could prove they were experts in MP pensions in an effort to 
eliminate groups such as the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, 
which has been very outspoken in its efforts to push the 
government into bringing MP pensions in line.
<P>
	The government's exclusionary tactics have denied ordinary 
Canadians the right to appear before committee to express their 
views. Who does the government think pays the MP pensions? 
The Canadian taxpayers do and they deserve a right to be before 
the committee and have their views heard.
<P>
	The Liberals in committee also objected to witnesses who 
refer to the trough goers in derogatory terms unless they jammed 
all the witnesses into a one-day session. It appears when it 
comes to the greedy personal interests of members across the 
floor, there simply cannot be any discussion.
<P>
	Regardless of general consensus against the new plan by 
witnesses, the Liberal majority on the standing committee after 
just 12 minutes of deliberations pushed the bill through with not 
one change at all, what a sham.
<P>
	We now see why the ethics commissioners is only a 
figure-head. It is because there are no ethics regarding policies 
of the members opposite. Why should taxpayers have to 
continue to pay this ridiculous subsidy to members of 
Parliament?
<P>
	One witness to the standing committee estimated the new 
pension plan is seven times more generous than the typical 
public sector plan and four times more generous than the typical 
private sector plan.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14443"> 14443 </A></B>
<P>
	MPs are in a very privileged position. Unlike most working 
Canadians, they can set their own remuneration. MPs set their 
salaries, their perks and their pensions. This is a heavy 
responsibility which few are entrusted with, and with that 
responsibility comes a great deal of trust and expectation for 
fellow Canadians.
<P>
	The very nature of this pension plan is an abuse of not only 
MP privileges but also an abuse of the legislation that governs 
Canadians. The plan is out of line with regulations and rules 
governing pensions in the Income Tax Act.
<P>
	I make reference to the accrual rate. The Income Tax Act 
allows only a 2 per cent accrual rate. The previous MP pension 
plan allowed for a 5 per cent accrual. This plan drops it to four, 
still twice that of the Income Tax Act.
<P>
	Why are MPs different? The Liberals say they are proposing 
to reduce the amount of pensions, raise the minimum age for 
collecting pensions and eliminate double dipping. They will not 
say the full extent of the plan and why it is so distasteful that 52 
Reform MPs, all Reform MPs, and a few ethical Liberal MPs 
will have nothing to do with it and will volunteer to opt out of the 
plan.
<P>
	In addition, the Liberals in their amendments to this plan have 
taken the liberty of giving themselves a better deal by reducing 
MP contributions from 11 per cent to 9 per cent. In doing so what 
have they done? They have actually given themselves a raise as 
their take home pay will be increased by the reduction in the 
contributions-here we go again.
<P>
	It is obvious the self-serving interests of some members on 
the opposite side have dictated the contents of the bill. It would 
be far better for MP pensions to be set up by an independent 
body at arm's length to the government.
<P>
	Obviously many members cannot handle this responsibility 
themselves. At least at arm's length the agency would be better 
able to make an objective assessment of MP pensions.
<P>
	Members on the opposite side are arguing the new MP pension 
plan is fair just because they feel they work hard and deserve fair 
compensation. For many MPs it appears their definition of fair 
compensation should be much more fair than for other 
Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	I am sure many Canadians would be more than pleased to 
receive such generous compensation packages they were 
allowed, but they cannot play by the same rules.
<P>
	This plan is not realistic and cannot be extended to the public 
because if it did we would bankrupt the country. Members with 
any conscience will think twice before gorging into this tax 
trough and will opt out. Members here to serve Canada and not 
themselves will and should do the right thing.
<P>
	It is not easy to give up a hefty sum of tax dollars but if 
members think this over carefully and weigh it in their 
conscience, those who have one, they will do the right thing and 
opt out of the plan.
<P>
	This newly revised trough plan will become very evident to 
Canadians and they will demand their MP take the decent course 
of action and stop robbing their tax dollars. They will demand 
their MP take the high road and opt out. Many will see why the 
Liberals are attempting to push the bill through. This plan will 
make many of these politicians millionaires. These MPs do not 
want to give up such a lucrative fortune, let alone negotiate a 
normal pension. They refuse to be pressured by the electorate to 
get their hands out of the cookie jar and start doling out 
taxpayers dollars fairly.
<P>
	However, the Liberals have failed to gauge the mood of the 
voting public, just as the Conservatives did. The Liberals will 
suffer the same fate for not listening. This is what the Liberals 
fear, reprisals from their own constituents. That is why the 
government will not allow a simple provision in the bill for MPs 
to opt out at any time, not just a once only window but any time.
<P>
	The Liberals clearly want to protect their fortunes. They have 
no scruples to lay off public servants, cut back on medicare 
funding or social services as long as they can protect their own 
greedy little self-interest. They tell Canadians to cut back and 
make sacrifices, but sacrifices are easy when they are in 
somebody else's backyard or come out of somebody else's 
pocket.
<P>
	It is time for the government to look in its own backyard and 
do what Canadians expect, offer an MP pension plan similar to 
that available in the private sector.
<P>
	I support an MP pension plan comparable to those which 
Canadians receive in the private sector and which meets all the 
requirements for registration under the Income Tax Act. The bill 
does not accomplish this as it stands. I, along with most 
Canadians, will have no part of it. All 52 Reform MPs will be 
opting out of the plan and it will save Canadian taxpayers $38 
million.
<P>
	I want the members opposite to clearly understand that when 
Reform forms the next government, the Liberals can kiss their 
extravagant pension plan goodbye. Reform will retroactively 
adjust all present and past pensions for any living MP to 
reasonable levels. We will remove the porkers from the trough 
because the government, as reflected in Bill C-85, is incapable 
of doing what Canadians expect. Old style politics lives on. The 
Conservatives paid the price for not listening and the Liberals 
are about to suffer the same fate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton-Peel, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
remind my friend from Comox-Alberni his accusation of the 
government's not reading the mood of the people is quite 
interesting. The latest polls came out this morning, showing the 
Reform Party at a resounding 10 per cent. That is a drop of about 
about half from what it was at the time of the election.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14444"> 14444 </A></B>
<P>
	I ask the hon. member if he has ever terminated employment 
at some time and tried to resume a career after that termination? 
The hon. member is probably not as old as I am and so he is 
probably more marketable as a commodity in the private sector 
than I am at my age.
<P>
<B>(1340 ) </B>
<P>
	A large number of his colleagues in the Reform Party will be 
facing that onerous challenge at the end of this term, the 
challenge of resuming a career in the private sector. Members of 
the Reform Party for the sake of the people who will follow 
them, some will be Reform members, should think seriously 
about that.
<P>
	I have had that experience. Being self-employed I thought it 
would be the easiest thing in the world to terminate my career in 
Ontario politics and resume my previous career. It took four 
years to resume that income level, that level of activity. When I 
went back I was a different person. Many of my colleagues I 
have worked with and worked for prior to that time had gone on 
to other things and some had even died. It was a matter of 
starting all over again.
<P>
	I respectfully ask the member, whose righteousness reflects 
his colleagues', if he has ever had that experience and if he 
really knows what it is like to go back.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilmour:</B> Madam Speaker, on the first point on the polls, 
only one poll will count. The Conservatives found that in the last 
election and it will be the same poll for these people. They are on 
a downhill slide. Self-serving legislation like this will not do 
them any good at all.
<P>
	On the second point of the hon. member's question, the 
purpose of coming to Parliament as an MP is not to set yourself 
up because you cannot get a job when you go out. If you were 
good enough when you came into this place you will find a job 
when you go back out.
<P>
	I do not expect any guarantees when I go out of this place. I 
will not set myself up and use this place as a big trough to get in 
knee deep so that I can set myself up on the way out.
<P>
	I will go out with a normal pension or I will go out with no 
pension at all. This is not the place to set ourselves up for the 
future.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the member talked about our ramming it through. I 
wonder how he can say that when the bill has been around since 
the end of April. Prior to that Reformers questioned us for some 
period of time, when would we bring in the bill. They were so 
anxious to have it that when we finally brought it in they asked 
why we are putting it through.
<P>
	The issue has been around since the last election. It was 
around during the last election. It has certainly been around 
through this Parliament. I do not understand how they can say 
we are ramming it through. As well, at committee they did not 
even move any amendments. I do not understand that. Perhaps 
he could explain that a little further.
<P>
	Also on the question of the Income Tax Act, I do not 
understand it because this complies with the act. There is 
additional compensation but it is paid for by the members. I do 
not understand the member's-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry, there is 
barely any time, 30 seconds. The hon. member 
Comox-Alberni.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilmour:</B> Madam Speaker, if we are not ramming this 
legislation through why are we standing here on the last day of 
the session talking about it? If it has been around for so long, 
explain why we are here on the last day.
<P>
	Good grief, that answers it right there. Give me a break.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I rise on behalf of the constituents of 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt to speak to Bill C-85, the 
government's bill to amend the pension plan for members of 
Parliament.
<P>
	The Reform Party of Canada in response to pre-election 
demands of Canadians promised to make changes to the MP 
pension plan one of our highest priorities. We promised radical 
change to the plan.
<P>
	The Liberals have waited a very long time. They are merely 
tinkering with this plan.
<P>
<B>(1345 ) </B>
<P>
	In my recent householder I conducted a poll of my 
constituents. Seventy-seven per cent of the respondents 
believed that members of Parliament should have a pension 
plan. Eighty-nine per cent said that the current MPs pension 
plan should be reformed so it cannot be collected until age 60. 
They also said that the rates and contribution levels should 
conform with private sector plans.
<P>
	I would like to make this point very clear: I am opting out of 
the new plan, and it makes me very angry that this has to be 
done. Bill C-85 does not go far enough. It does not reflect what 
Canadians wanted. It is poor legislation.
<P>
	In the 1990s job security has virtually disappeared across all 
sectors of the economy. MPs should not have a pension plan that 
tries to make up for periods of time when an MP becomes 
unemployed. The Liberals either do not understand that or they 
simply do not care.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14445"> 14445 </A></B>
<P>
	The Reform Party was elected on a platform of fiscal 
responsibility. We will continue to pursue the Liberals in order 
to force them to respond to the desire of Canadians for 
leadership by example.
<P>
	Bill C-85 does not propose a fiscally responsible pension 
plan. The opting out clause the government has provided can 
only be interpreted as an admission of a flaw in the new pension 
plan the Liberals have proposed. If the government had provided 
a pension plan that would allow members to contribute to their 
own registered retirement savings plan or a private sector 
company type of plan with a contribution system of one to one, 
everyone from all sides of the House would have supported that 
plan. All Canadians would have supported such a plan.
<P>
	The Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act requires 
members of Parliament to contribute 11 per cent of their 
earnings. Seven per cent of the contributions go to the MP 
retirement compensation arrangement. Four per cent of 
contributions go to the retirement allowances account.
<P>
	The opting out clause proposed by the Liberals is a facade. It 
is a no win situation for individual members of Parliament. If a 
member chooses to opt out he or she can roll over their 
entitlement, which is the 4 per cent, which is the contribution to 
the retirement allowances act, into a personal pension plan, an 
RRSP. That seems fair enough. However, the 7 per cent 
contribution to the retirement compensation arrangement must 
be taken by the member in a one time payout, a cheque, plus 4 
per cent compounded interest. That one time payout is treated as 
taxable income in the year in which it is received by the member. 
Any accountant in the country would shudder at this punitive 
measure.
<P>
	The Liberals are punishing members of Parliament for opting 
out of the plan. They can do this because the previous plan was 
one of mandatory participation, which is normal in any company 
pension plan. Under the previous plan members were unable to 
pay into their own RRSPs. Therefore, the opting out becomes a 
double whammy: number one, the 7 per cent is added to the 
member's annual income and is taxable in the year it is received; 
number two, the members lose the amount of time they spent in 
the old plan in terms of not being able to make up the lost 
contributions to their RRSPs.
<P>
	As I said before, Bill C-85 is poor legislation. Again I will 
state very clearly that I am opting out of the plan. However, I am 
angry at the ramifications of opting out. The opting out clause is 
inequitable and unfair. There is no reason why it has to be this 
way.
<P>
	Let me make it very simple for the Liberals across the way. 
Number one, make the MP pension plan reflect private sector 
standards. Number two, make the MP pension plan available to 
MPs upon their reaching the age of 60. Number three, if it is too 
difficult for the government to change the pension plan, simply 
scrap it.  Let members contribute to their own registered 
retirement savings plans.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	Where is the government's sense of responsibility? Where is 
their sense of morality in this proposed scheme? Where is their 
leadership? Where is the red book commitment?
<P>
	Bill C-85 is a broken promise made to Canadians during an 
election campaign by the Liberals. This plan has not been 
changed in the way ordinary Canadians would have changed it. 
The government is putting this legislation on a fast track. The 
Liberals have placed a time limit on debate on this matter. But 
this issue is not going away.
<P>
	It does not matter that the Liberals tried to sweep this one 
under the rug along with their sexual orientation bill and their 
gun registry bill. In their haste to dispose of the MP pension plan 
they have shown Canadians how careless they are with respect to 
this matter.
<P>
	The Liberals will try to forget what they have done, but in 
their nightmares in the next election campaign they will be 
seeing their constituents vividly in technicolour holding up an 
MP pension placard and shouting ``You broke your promise''.
<P>
	Ordinary Canadians are astounded that they supported the 
Liberals in the last election. The Liberals have not even come 
close in delivering on a promise of integrity and restoring 
confidence in the government.
<P>
	When I look back to the image of the Conservative Party as 
pigs at a trough and remember the trouncing that party took at 
the ballot box, I have no sympathy for the Liberals. They are 
behaving in the same way as their predecessors. The Tories had 
two consecutive majority governments reduced to two seats in 
this Parliament because they would not respect the desires of 
ordinary Canadians. This Liberal government has not learned 
the lessons of the Canadian electorate taught by the Tories. This 
government has the gall to pass pathetic legislation by limiting 
debate. I can hardly wait for the next election.
<P>
	The House of Commons, by its name, by its very nature, and 
by the history that has created this Chamber and our 
parliamentary system, is supposed to be an arena for the 
common person to voice his or her concerns before the state. All 
of us in this place are commoners. The Liberals do not 
understand that we are representatives of the people and at the 
same time we are one with the people.
<P>
	The policies and programs coming from this place should be 
in line with the common will of the people. Bill C-85 continues 
to provide members of this Chamber with million dollar pension 
plans. There is nothing common about such a policy. The 
Liberals are continuing to ensure that this House of Commons 
remains a manor of millionaires.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="14446"> 14446 </A></B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I do not support this legislation. I thank you for 
your time today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member who just spoke has misled people 
listening to the debate because he suggested the Liberal 
government in introducing this bill failed to honour the 
commitments and promises it made in respect of the pension 
plan in this country for MPs.
<P>
	As he will acknowledge, I am sure, in his answer to this 
comment, the Liberal government promised two things in the 
red book: to end double dipping for members of Parliament and 
to install a minimum age for the pension plan so that members 
under a certain age could not collect. He knows the minimum 
age provided in the bill before the House is 55; he knows this bill 
ends double dipping. He should come clean with Canadians and 
admit that not only has the government fulfilled all of the 
commitments it made in the red book in respect of the pension 
plan, but it went further. It reduced the cost of the pension to 
Canadian taxpayers by one-third by reducing the contribution 
rate so that members are ineligible to receive the full pension 
after 15 years and now it will be 19 years. Why does the member 
do that?
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	Besides suggesting that, he is also pretending to be outraged 
on the part of the Reform Party with his pension and claims that 
he is not going to collect his pension. He will not for the very 
good reason that a member has to be elected twice to this 
Chamber to collect, and he will have grave difficulty doing that. 
He knows that in his heart of hearts.
<P>
	Is he not doing what the other Reformers are doing, opting out 
of the pension in order to squeeze out of the required 
contributions and put that money in their pockets instead of 
facing reality and acknowledging that what other people are 
doing here is right, honest, and fair?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member has about one minute.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question.
<P>
	I knew what I was getting into when I ran for election for the 
good people of Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt. If I do not 
win in the next election, that will not be a decision made by you 
but by the good people of Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. The hon. member will please address his 
remarks to the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> Of course I meant you, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> That is even worse. You have 30 seconds to 
wrap it up.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> Mr. Speaker, in respect to the pension plan itself 
and the Liberal commitments, I would like to make a few 
comments regarding the new pension scheme.
<P>
	Under the current pension scheme members of Parliament pay 
approximately 11 per cent into their plan and under the new 
scheme they will pay 7 per cent. The witnesses who came before 
the committee were quite clear: they reported it should be 26 per 
cent. We should actually be putting in approximately $19,000 to 
make it actuarially sound.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, I regret to intervene, but it 
being 2 p.m., pursuant to Standing order 30(5), the House will 
now proceed to statements by members.

	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it was 
five years ago today that the Meech Lake accord was dealt a 
death-blow. The member for Churchill and Clyde Wells, the 
current Prime Minister's accomplice, refused to ratify the 
accord.
<P>
	``Thanks for the job'', said the current Prime Minister of 
Canada to Clyde Wells, when he clutched him in his arms after 
becoming leader of the Liberal Party in Calgary.
<P>
	On that day, thousands of Canadians told Quebecers: ``No, 
you are not a distinct society. Even your most basic demands are 
unacceptable. You are a province just like the others. Shape up 
or ship out''.
<P>
	This has now become the Prime Minister's slogan. The choice 
for Quebecers is to either resign themselves or take control of 
their destiny. Quebecers will have to make a decision this fall, 
with the referendum on sovereignty.

yesterday, the Minister of Canadian Heritage showed a lack of 
respect in this House for Quebec regions by using the expression 
``reculées'', which means out of the way. The words used by the

regions, their vitality and their pride. People who live in distant

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CHILE'SACCESSIONTONAFTA">CHILE'S ACCESSION TO NAFTA</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Minister of International Trade 
stated that, if Chile wanted to join NAFTA this would not 
require reopening the agreement and only technical changes 
would be necessary to admit a fourth country to NAFTA.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Would he 
confirm his minister's statement to the effect that Chile's 
admission to NAFTA would not require opening the agreement 
but merely some technical changes?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, according to the agreement, Chile or other countries 
can join NAFTA if they accept the terms negotiated by Canada, 
Mexico and the United States. The consent of Mexico, Canada 
and the United States is required if another country wishes to 
join. Provided Chile does not request major changes, the 
agreement provides that other countries may join, subject to the 
approval of participating members of NAFTA.
<P>
	I know Chile is anxious to join NAFTA, and Canada is very 
supportive of Chile's bid at this time. In fact, this government 
has always maintained it did not want an exclusively bilateral 
agreement with the United States. We feel it is very useful to 
have an agreement that includes Mexico and other countries, 
since this would counterbalance the enormous power of the 
United States.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, what I understood from the Prime Minister's reply 
is that if Chile meets the criteria for membership, reopening the 
agreement will not be necessary.
<P>
	I want to ask the Prime Minister whether we can assume from 
what he said that the same scenario and the same reasoning will 
prevail in the case of a sovereign Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, that depends on whether the parties to NAFTA agree 
unconditionally. Personally, I think I am answering a purely 
hypothetical question. I know Quebec will not become 
independent. Since Quebec is already part of NAFTA, why get 
out and then get back in, when you are already in?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the question is not hypothetical, since the treaty 
exists and the parties felt the need to negotiate clause 2204, a 
clause of accession that opens membership to all those who wish 
to join.
<P>
	I want to ask the Prime Minister whether he would agree that 
Canada alone does not have the power to prevent Quebec from 
joining NAFTA and that the only thing Canada can do is get out 
if Quebec becomes a member.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> No, Mr. 
Speaker. It is clear that Canada is a member of NAFTA and that 
Quebec is already part of NAFTA. If Quebec wants to get out of 
NAFTA, that is up to Quebec. However, if Quebec wants to get 
back in, the consent of all members is required, as in the case of 
Chile or any other country. A member may propose new 
conditions for membership, in which case NAFTA would have 
to be amended.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14451"> 14451 </A></B>
<P>
	I do not know the status of current negotiations with Chile, but 
if Chile does not request changes to NAFTA, there will be no 
problem. If it requests changes to NAFTA, this will require the 
consent of Canada, Mexico and the United States. So it is 
certainly much better to be part of the agreement now, than to 
have to go and negotiate if you want to become a member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Prime Minister's answers do little more than give Quebecers 
cause for fear or doubt. The Prime Minister has already cast 
doubt on the rapid inclusion of a sovereign Quebec in NAFTA.
<P>
	My question is very simple and as follows. Given that trade 
between Canada and Quebec is 153 times that between Canada 
and Chile, will the Prime Minister undertake to work hard to 
have Quebec included in NAFTA quickly, following 
sovereignty?
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Quebec is a member of NAFTA. Everyday I work to 
ensure that Quebec benefits from NAFTA. So why ask me to 
work harder than I am at the moment?
<P>
	However, if we are talking hypothetically, I am not sure the 
rest of Canada will want to retain the privileges farmers 
currently enjoy. If consumers in Ontario can get milk, butter and 
cheese more cheaply from the United States, if Quebec leaves, 
and since dairy production is not a question of French or 
English, but simply of providing dairy products, they will want 
to take advantage of the better price. So the best way to protect 
products from Quebec within the Canadian market is to remain 
Canadian.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> Remaining Canadian means 
being a member of NAFTA. However, those who want to leap 
into the void may do so. But Quebecers know they are very 
happy in Canada and they want to stay here. This is clear, and I 
am convinced of it. I am all the more convinced because the 
Leader of the Opposition does not even have the courage to tell 
Quebecers the truth he told the Americans: ``I am a separatist''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
speaking of having the courage to tell the truth, the Prime 
Minister is in no position to tell anyone anything.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members: </B>Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> We know that Quebec is a member of NAFTA, 
just like Prince Edward Island. Given that trade between Canada 
and Quebec is 153 times greater than it is between Canada and 
Chile-since we are talking figures here, it should be clear-and 
given that 250,000 workers in Ontario owe their living to the 
trade relations between Ontario and Quebec, my question is as 
follows. In the light of the stakes, will the Prime Minister tell 
us-yes or no-as the Prime Minister of the rest of Canada, after 
sovereignty, whether he will assume his  responsibilities and see 
that Quebec's entry into NAFTA is facilitated?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am sitting pretty now. The Bloc Quebecois, the 
official opposition, wants me to remain Prime Minister of 
Canada to defend the interests of Quebec. That is quite 
something.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>

That is the type of opposition that will increase the stature of the 
leader of the third party, then he would stop dropping in the 
polls. The rest of the time he chooses to repeat the same thing 
and he does not score with it. He should find a new tune.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would remind the captain of the <I>Titanic</I> it is a short 
step from being on top of the mountain to being over the hill.
<P>
	Let me turn to the fiscal administration of the government. 
The Prime Minister has been strangely silent on the fact that 
Canadian exports fell in April for the third month, that 
wholesale trade has dropped sharply, that employment levels 
have been flat since November, that retail sales are stagnant and 
that housing starts are at their lowest point since 1982. It is quite 
apparent there was a gross deficiency in the fiscal planning of 
the government and that the finance minister did not go far 
enough fast enough in his budget. The chickens are coming 
home to roost.
<P>
	My supplementary question is: Will the Prime Minister now 
direct the finance minister to present this House with a 
midcourse correction and have it ready when we reconvene this 
fall?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, you are very generous with the nature of the 
supplementary questions today.
<P>
	The leader of the third party forgot to say that the OECD 
report published this week said the economic performance of 
Canada will be the best of all countries in the OECD ratings. The 
Minister of Finance had a very good budget which was 
extremely well received. We are on target. Our target to reduce 
the deficit to 3 per cent of GDP will be met next year as we 
predicted. Investment will carry on. Interest rates are going 
down at this moment, which is significant. A two point lower 
interest rate will help to stimulate the economy.
<P>
	I have a lot of confidence in the Minister of Finance. He is 
doing a very good job.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister will not fix the cabinet nor will he 
fix the budget. So let us turn to the government's administration 
of the democratic process of this House.
<P>
	Yesterday the Prime Minister was confronted with the broken 
red book promise on free votes. In reply the Prime Minister 
protested that he let government MPs vote on certain 
amendments earlier in the week. The Prime Minister said he let 
them vote. The MP's right to vote in this House is not some 
privilege granted to him by the executive. It is a right that comes 
from the people and MPs have the right to exercise their vote 
without threats of punishment or discipline.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister end this session on a positive and 
democratic note by turning to the backbenchers in his own party 
and assuring them of their right to vote their constituents' 
wishes without fear of threats or punishment from the Prime 
Minister or the whip?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the leader of the third party has a very broad shopping 
list today. He is trying to recuperate. Sometimes it is good to 
climb a mountain but do not try to do it backward. He has gone 
from 20 to 10 and is dropping. That is not the way to get to the 
top.
<P>
<B>(1430 ) </B>
<P>
	When I talk about the democracy in this party I do not have to 
add anything. The leader of that party has thrown critics out of 
different positions, three of them. He has done it. Now he is 
telling me that I am too tough.
<P>
	When the question was raised in the House of Commons 
yesterday, Liberal members reacted very positively. We have an 
agenda as a government. We are respecting the agenda of the 
government and we will carry on. When it is time for an 
election, I will have my red book with me and I will be able to 
show all the progress we have made and all the commitments we 
have fulfilled.
<P>
	I remember the Reform Party telling everybody that political 
parties should not accept any money from the government. 
Everyone took the refunds from the Chief Electoral Officer after 
the last election, contrary to the sanctimonious speech of the 
leader of the third party, which will remain the third party.

	Ignoring the real needs of the unemployed, who account for 
roughly 11 per cent of Quebec's workforce after five months 
without any job creation worth mentioning, instead of thinking 
about expanding the vocational guidance and counselling 
services currently provided to a mere 10 per cent of those who 
lose their jobs, the government is preparing to reduce from over 
a 100 to just 28 the number of Canada employment centres in 
Quebec.
<P>

UI recipients with $725 million in cuts this year alone, is cut 
back the services provided to the unemployed?

asking the human resources development committee for

already been told which ones will be closed, undergo changes or 
remain open. As for the Bloc, only this afternoon will it be

because no decisions have been taken. The decisions will be

afternoon, to develop the best information.
<P>
	I can guarantee this hon. member and all members of the

	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as much 
as the Prime Minister wants to say the economy of Canada is 
good, it is not.
<P>
	In 1993 the government inherited promising economic growth 
in the country. What has happened? Instead of nurturing the 
recovery that was there the government continued on an old 
pattern of spend and tax Canadians. The only growth policy the 
government could come up with was to devalue the dollar, 
resulting in an unbalanced recovery that has been entirely 
reliant on exports to the United States.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. Now that the U.S. 
economy is slowing and exports are dropping, what will he do to 
avert a recession, other than devaluing the currency?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member's statement does not 
coincide with the facts.
<P>
	At the time we took office unemployment was at 11.5 per cent. 
It is now at 9.5 per cent. At the time we took office there were 
433,000 fewer Canadians working than are working today. At 
the time we took office growth was anemic. The fact is that we 
have just come off one of the best years we have seen in a 
decade. In fact the OECD stated only yesterday that again this 
year Canada would lead all the G-7 nations.
<P>
	The fact is that we have had a very good record, which is due 
to the policies of the government. We intend to continue those 
policies.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Finance can say what he wants. There was some 
good growth in 1994, but today it is down to 0.7 per cent, which 
is a multiple drop. The Minister of Finance should admit that.
<P>
	What we need at this time is an economic statement from the 
government indicating that the government has a plan to 
eliminate the deficit. Can we count on the Minister of Finance to 
present an economic statement this fall so we can go to the 
people of Canada and say this is how the government will get rid 
of the deficit and bring in a balanced budget before the end of 
this Parliament?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have made it very clear that it 
is our intention to eliminate the deficit. We have also made it 
very clear that it is our intention to put the country back into 
good economic shape. That means putting Canadians to work, it 
means preserving our social programs, and it means giving the 
country hope.
<P>
	It is not the intention on this side of the House to bring in the 
kinds of scorch and burn policies the Reform Party would 
advocate. It is not the intention of this party to destroy the 
Canadian economy and the hopes of so many young. It is the 
intention of this party to do what Canadians want, and that is to

Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Canadian

<P>
	Following the public hearings regarding the draft orders in

the federal government. Unless the minister follows up on the

with these made-to-measure orders for Power DirecTv, in 
which the Prime Minister's son-in-law has an interest.
<P>
	Several witnesses heard during the public hearings strongly 
opposed the draft orders in council, because they will eventually 
make us lose control over the Canadian broadcasting system. 
Does the minister realize that, after the recording, publishing,

the last cultural stronghold still controlled by Canadians?

<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, after reading the communique released by the Bloc 
Quebecois this afternoon, I think that the party should be called 
the ``blague québécoise'', the Quebec joke. We held all kind of 
consultations, including public ones, and we received the report 
of a committee of experts, as well as several submissions, 
including some from groups such as the Consumers' 
Association of Canada, Friends of Canadian Broadcasting and 
the Conference of the Arts. Those groups urged us to accept the 
proposals made by the committee of experts. I should also 
mention the majority report tabled by the committee, as well as 
the report of the Senate, where the government does not have a 
majority. We are told that we did the appropriate thing.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Senate said that these orders were 
unconstitutional, but that the government could go ahead with 
them. This is some reference!
<P>
	Will the Minister of Canadian Heritage admit-assuming he 
can answer before it is too late, since things could change 
between now and this fall-that if he goes ahead with his draft 
orders in council, he will not only undermine the CRTC's 
integrity and independence, but will also postpone Canada's 
access to direct satellite broadcasting and allow Power DirecTv, 
which is an American company, to maintain and expand its 
illegal market in Canada?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think what all Canadians need to understand is how 
vital this part of the information highway infrastructure is going 
to be to Canadians. It is for that reason that we have been very 
concerned and very careful about ensuring that we see the 
creation of a framework within which we would have a 
competitive and open system.
<P>
	The hon. member, who makes quite bizarre allegations on this 
issue, is trapped in her own rhetoric. The very groups that say 
the most about supporting Canadian culture have supported the 
approach the panel of experts recommended on this case.
<P>
	What is clear to all Canadians is that we favour a system in 
which there will be licensing, competition, better choice and 
lower prices for consumers. The Bloc Quebecois favours 
monopoly. It is as simple as that.

	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Transport is determined to squander a 
billion dollars of the Canadian taxpayers' money.
<P>
	Settlement of the unconstitutional cancellation of the Pearson 
contract will cost taxpayers between $400 million and $500 
million. Even if the government manages to get Bill C-22 
through the Senate somehow, constitutional experts have said it 
will be thrown out of court. On top of this, the minister is 
determined to pay additional money to Hughes for a contract 
that will provide less than contracted for and that is behind 
schedule.
<P>
	Why does the minister not cancel the Hughes contract instead 
of the Pearson contract and save the Canadian taxpayers $1 
billion in the process?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, one of the things I have tried to avoid doing in 
answering some of the questions from the hon. critic for 
transportation for the third party is to take courses in dealing 
with split personalities to try to cope with them.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, if you listened to that question you would 
understand that on the one hand he is suggesting that we are 
going to lose $400 million to $500 million as a result of the 
cancellation of the Pearson contract.
<P>
	We are on the record as saying that we will compensate for 
reasonable out of pocket expenses, not one cent more, regardless 
of who thinks, including the hon. member, that we should be 
taking care of people who have not driven a nail or laid an ounce 
of concrete at Pearson by giving them up to half a billion dollars.
<P>
	With respect to Hughes, we have gone to the Auditor General 
of Canada. We are negotiating with Hughes. We recognize that 
there was mismanagement in that contract, both on the side of 
the government as well as by Hughes. We recognize that. We 
have admitted that publicly. Now we will do with Hughes what 
we are attempting to do with Pearson, which is to protect the 
taxpayers of Canada, whether he likes it or not.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr.

<P>
	Instead of doing the right thing, the government is trying to 
manipulate testimony going to the Senate. Members of the 
Canadian Bar Association were to speak very critically of Bill 
C-22 during the Senate hearings. The Minister of Justice called 
them to his office and told them to back off. The implication of 
penalty is obvious.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as a member I hope in good standing of the Canadian 
Bar Association, I would want to explain to my hon. colleague 
that people have come before the Senate committee to discuss 
the issue of Pearson. Although I may disagree with them on 
some issues, we recognize the credibility of the group that came 
before the Senate to make its position known with respect to the 
constitutionality of Bill C-22.
<P>
	It is highly irregular, if not totally improper, for the hon. 
member to come before the House and to suggest that members 
of the Canadian bar have been coerced by the government or 
anybody else. The hon. member should be aware that there are 
conflicting opinions on this, but certainly nobody has tried to 
manipulate the Canadian Bar Association. Had we done that, we 
would not have got the kind of testimony we got in the first 
instance with respect to the constitutionality of Bill C-22.

	<B>Mr. Michel Daviault (Ahuntsic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	If the use of somatotropin is authorized in Canada, consumers 
will demand that the milk produced using this hormone be 
labelled to distinguish it from unadulterated milk. Our children 
have the right to drink real milk with no hormones.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister acknowledge that if Health Canada 
authorizes the sale of somatotropin, either of two things will 
happen: citizens will either be confronted with a done deed and 
will have no choice but to consume the milk produced with the 
synthetic hormone, or they will have to pay more for the milk 
they are used to drinking in order to fund the cost of keeping two 
separate distribution networks for milk?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister explained yesterday that no decision has 
been made on the issue, that the moratorium is voluntary, and 
that, on July 1, the Department of Health will not be in a position 
to authorize the sale of this hormone to Canadian consumers.
<P>
	The hon. member apparently made the suggestion that we 
should inform consumers if the use of the hormone is going to be 
allowed. But this is a purely hypothetical question, because the 
government has not made any decision yet regarding whether it 
will be authorized, if it ever is at all.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Daviault (Ahuntsic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
certainly excuse the Prime Minister for not being up to date on 
the issue. But, in fact, if Health Canada gives its approval, 
agriculture will need two years to set up a system. That is why 
the agriculture committee, in addition to the health committee, 
this morning, demanded an indeterminate ban on this substance.
<P>
	Given that this is the last question we will be able to ask on the 
issue, I am going to ask the Prime Minister a genuine question, a 
simple question. Why must our children drink anything other 
than real milk, with no artificial hormones added?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the answer is that, in Canada, at the current moment, 
the milk children are drinking has no artificial hormones. 
Artificial hormones are banned in Canada, and that is the current 
situation. If there is any change in the situation, we will inform 
the House and we will take appropriate measures. But, at this 
time, all of these questions are purely hypothetical because the 
hormones in question are not authorized for use in Canada.
<P>
	The hon. member just said that this was the last time he would 
be asking a question. I hope that they are not going to devote all 
their efforts to the referendum and stop doing the work required 
of an MP. If they do, I hope they will give back their salaries.

<P>

Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have had the opportunity 
to look into the allegation made by the hon. member for Beaver 
River.
<P>
	The fact is that the whole program was being sponsored by 21 
organizations across the country, including the Canadian Bar 
Association, the John Howard Society and the Salvation Army. 
Their attempt was to try to provide ways of linking the use of 
literacy to crime prevention and to provide a way of enabling 
particularly young people who are at risk with the law to find 
solutions.
<P>
	One of the booklets was prepared by the young people 
themselves, expressing their concerns and their feelings. I want 
to point out to the hon. member that the booklet has never been 
distributed to any school. It is for adult use only and distributed 
by those organizations. I think it is time the hon. member 
withdrew her allegation.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
executive assistant in the senator's office who funded this said 
yesterday that it was for adult use only.
<P>
	On the contrary, James MacLatchie, the chair of the 
organization, said to press and MPs alike: ``This is to go to all 
schools across the country without respect to grades or age 
level''. There are two different stories coming out there. James 
MacLatchie should answer those questions.
<P>
	Whether it is for adults, criminals, dropouts or young people 
in schools across the country, would the minister agree that this 
obscene language is not good for anybody to learn to read and 
write? Will he obviously cancel it? Will he cut his losses, 
recommend to the senator responsible for it to cut her losses and 
cancel the booklet rather than cut their own throats and let it go 
ahead?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources

member for Beaver River did not consult with her own

released.
<P>

congratulated the minister responsible for literacy on the

provide protection against crime by the use of literacy.

	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in response to a question on May 8 from the hon. 
member for Nanaimo-Cowichan about allegations of sexual 
abuse at the Lac Barrière reserve, the minister of Indian affairs 
responded that it was a criminal matter and police were 
investigating. The band states that it is not aware of any police 
investigation and a recent federal-provincial-band 
memorandum of understanding is viewed as pre-empting a 
police investigation.
<P>
	Does the minister continue to state that there is a police 
investigation into sexual abuse when the band says there is not?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I came here today prepared 
to commend the hon. member and his colleague in the Reform 
Party who went up to Barrière Lake. I thought that was very 
broad minded.
<P>
	I sat here and listened to the statement of the pair. The 
aboriginal people of Barrière Lake do not have the opportunity 
to stand in the House and I feel it is incumbent upon me to put 
forward their side on what happened.
<P>
	I was handed a letter that was handed to the hon. member who 
put the question. They welcomed the hon. members up there. 
They wanted to show them their way of life. The hon. members 
chose the topics. They asked questions like: ``Is the premier of 
Quebec the minister of aboriginal affairs? How do you become 
an elder?'' They met with the accountant and they refused to 
listen to him. They wanted to take them to show them their 
forestry but they refused.
<P>
	They ended up by saying: ``We thought we were dealing with 
honourable people who wanted to learn about us. We forgot we 
were dealing with partisan politicians who are more interested 
in advancing their own political agenda than in hearing the truth. 
As I was saying at the beginning of this letter, I hoped this 
meeting would enlighten you. Apparently it didn't''.

<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister was further asked about allegations of 
misappropriation of $255,000 in legal fees to a co-president of 
the aboriginal committee of the Liberal Party, to which the 
minister responded that it was a criminal matter and up to the 
sûreté. According to the band, the RCMP has jurisdiction, not 
the sûreté, and the sûreté has done nothing. The RCMP has done 
little, if anything, other than a single brief visit with no follow 
up.
<P>
	Is this a shell game or does the minister want to get to the 
bottom of the allegation?
<P>
<B>(1500 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this allows me to clarify my 
answer on that date.
<P>
	The investigation by the la Commission de la jeunesse is in 
relation to the sexual abuse. The member for the Reform Party 
stood up and basically under the protection of the House 
defamed a member of the Canadian Bar Association of Ontario. 
He did not have the guts to go outside and do the same thing. He 
should do that today. He has already received a letter from that 
lawyer saying if he does he will be sued for defamation.

the Minister for International Trade will be aware of the conflict

murder.
<P>
	Pinochet's action in Chile reminds us that unless there is a 
level playing field when it comes to political rights and human 
rights, free trade is a moral hoax.

On behalf of all of the members of the House of Commons to

	Perhaps the pages will be members of Parliament one day but,

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr.

<P>
	It is true the member for Mission-Coquitlam did attend the 
launch of the literacy and crime prevention program ``Between 
the Lines''. That is one I have been working on for six months.
<P>
	However, after congratulating the government on what I felt 
was a very good idea, as there is a definite connection between 
literacy and crime prevention, we received the books which had 
not been opened by any of us before. As soon as we received the 
books and read them I released a press release. I would like to 
table it for the House in which I question the offensive language 
in that book.
<P>

go by what they have seen here, should they choose a political 
career, but to keep the best of it. As we well know, there is good

we will come back on September 18 or whenever the

ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-85, an act to amend the Members of Parliament Retiring 
Allowances Act and to provide for the continuation of a certain 
provision, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I believe mine is the last speech or close to the last 
speech we will be having on this issue prior to the vote later this 
afternoon. We will be on the MPs pension plan, the reduction in 
the pension plan as announced by the Liberal Party in the red 
book during the last election campaign. As a matter of fact, the 
bill on which we will be voting in about half an hour will reduce 
the MP pension plan benefits to an even greater degree than that 
which was promised in the red book.
<P>
	I accept the announcement made in the red book. As the critic 
for government operations in my days in opposition, I 
contributed to writing some of these portions of the red book as 
well as many others that pertained to government ethics, 
lobbyists, contracting procedures, MP benefits and so on. Today 
the Liberal Party is delivering on yet another promise in the red 
book.
<P>
	Some members across the way particularly in the Reform 
Party say it does not matter that is what we promised. It does not 
matter that it goes further. What matters to them is that we 
change what we are doing to suit them and they are not expected 
to be here for more than one term. That is essentially the crux of 
their argument. They are saying that MPs do not need pensions. 
That is their view.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> We never said that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> The hon. member should have participated in 
the debate to a greater extent. There are quotes in many places 
where members said they did not need these pensions. I have to 
disagree with members who made those statements.
<P>
	We have had a rather sorry spectacle. The Reform Party asked 
the Prime Minister point blank whether he would exempt them 
from that plan. The Prime Minister said yes. Then we produced 
the bill that did just that. The first question Reform members 
asked in the committee on procedure and House affairs was 
whether it was not unfair that the plan was designed in such a 
way to permit people to opt out, which is just what they asked 
for.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14460"> 14460 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> That is a crock.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Perhaps the hon. member personally disagreed 
with the member for Beaver River when she asked that question 
in committee. He has a right to disagree with her. I want him to 
know that the member for Beaver River made that statement. All 
members of the committee know it and the statement is recorded 
in the committee transcript. I am sorry if the member disagrees 
with that proposition. He will have to take it up with the member 
for Beaver River but I invite him to be cautious when he does so 
because she can certainly rough him up.
<P>
	That being said, I will turn to the principle of the bill. 
Essentially the bill has three components. First, it establishes a 
minimum age of 55 for receiving a pension on future 
contributions from the date of proclamation of this bill.
<P>
	The second component is to officially end double dipping. Mr. 
Speaker, you and I know perfectly well that since this 
government has come into office, rule or no rule, we have ended 
double dipping for any new appointment where a person had 
previously been eligible for an MP pension. That was done and I 
congratulate the Prime Minister for that.
<P>
	The third component is to reduce the accrual rate, which goes 
beyond the commitment made in the red book but was a good 
idea. It was done by the President of the Treasury Board in the 
bill before us today.
<P>
	Canadians and members have various views of the role of an 
MP. I heard one member say in debate a couple of weeks ago that 
the House of Commons should be for people who ``have made 
it''. This statement was made by the member for Peace River 
when he was participating in debate. In other words, people who 
have accumulated a certain fame, wealth and otherwise have 
some sort of right to this place superior to that right which the 
rest of us hold.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	I do not agree. Had that been the case, although the number of 
women in this House is insufficient, it would be far less than 
what it is today. Although the number of people who come from 
a disadvantaged milieu is probably lower than what it should be, 
it would be even less than what it is today if only people who 
have made it, to use the words of the hon. member for Peace 
River which are in the <I>Hansard</I> of this House, were the only ones 
who had a claim to be here.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, we are talking about members who come from a 
more disadvantaged milieu than others. I think that I am entitled 
to an opinion, coming from such a background myself, as you, 
Mr. Speaker, and all my colleagues well know.
<P>
	I have been in this institution for a long while. I began my 
working life here, not as the assistant to the prime minister, not 
as the assistant to a minister or to the Leader of the Opposition or 
to the Speaker of the House, but as a bus boy in the 
parliamentary restaurant.
<P>
	At the time, I had not even finished secondary school, which I 
went on to do later. I went back to school to earn credits, and 
although I wish I had more education, I did get four years, after 
starting here as an employee on the bottom rung.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	When I ran for election to this place, I had not made it. I do not 
apologize for that. Constituents elected everyone in this House 
for all the good reasons they choose to elect members of 
Parliament. If this House is to be a microcosm of this great 
country, then people from all backgrounds and milieus have a 
right to be candidates, not just those who have made it.
<P>
	Let us go back a little in the history of parliamentary 
institutions. Some members across the way denigrate the fact 
that in their view we are a little too close to the traditions of this 
great place. I do not apologize for that.
<P>
	I have become in my own way an amateur historian. Our 
parliamentary institutions date back prior to the Norman 
invasion of Britain to the witans in the period prior to that. They 
have evolved all the way in Britain from the invasion and the 
Magna Carta, the bill of rights and all those other documents, 
the declaration of rights and so on and in our own country 
through our Constitution and the precedents in the British 
House.
<P>
	I remind the House that in 1829 Daniel Patrick O'Connell was 
elected to the British House of Commons. His sin, what was 
wrong with the man, was that he was a Catholic. It was legal and 
had been for only a few years prior to that for Catholics to vote in 
Britain but they did not have the right to sit in Parliament. 
Notwithstanding that, in 1829 the people of Ireland found 
someone who could do it, who was rich enough, wealthy enough 
and a Catholic. There were very few of them. He was able to run 
as a candidate. He defeated a popular cabinet minister to become 
an MP.
<P>
	However he was not allowed to sit. He was made to run again 
in 1830 in order to be reconfirmed. Daniel Patrick O'Connell 
then took his seat in the U.K. House of Commons but nobody 
else could do the same. Why? Because there was no salary for 
members of Parliament. Only the rich, those who had made it, 
could become members of Parliament and the Catholics and 
other disadvantaged people could not.
<P>
	Salaries of members of Parliament should not be such that we 
get rich. We do not in this House. We should never go back to an 
era where only people who have made it have a right to claim 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14461"> 14461 </A></B>
<P>
that they can sit in this House. All Canadians have the right to be 
represented.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	If this Parliament is going to be the microcosm of this 
country, as I claim it should be and has a right to be, then all of us 
have a right to be candidates. Whether that person is a well 
known lawyer or a professor of law, as I see colleagues across 
the way, whether that person comes from a different ethnic 
background, whether that person is a medical doctor, or whether 
that person is the busboy in the parliamentary restaurant, it is all 
the same. We have the right to be represented in the Parliament 
of this country.
<P>
	In the next few minutes I want to talk about the salaries, 
benefits and pensions members get. After the Reform Party 
speeches, how many Canadians would know that since 1952 
there has not been one year where the premiums to the pension 
plan were less than the payout? Every single year the premiums 
by MPs and the matching contributions were in excess of the 
payout from the plan.
<P>
	People imagine a huge deficit in that plan. They do not know 
that every single year it has had a surplus, not thanks to the 
Reform Party or their friend they are in bed with, Mr. David 
Somerville of the National Citizens Coalition. They do not know 
that. Why do they not know that? Because that does not sell ads 
in the newspapers. That does not buy ties with little pigs on them 
for the member for Beaver River and the others who have made a 
mockery of this institution by doing some of the things they 
have been doing.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	And then these people come to this House complaining about 
our integrity. They have talked about the new approach to 
politics. Give me a break. We could comment on the actions of 
some of these parliamentarians, particularly the Reformers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Now we hear that MPs are all millionaires when they retire. 
Hogwash. Since when does someone take pension benefits based 
on a lifetime, total them up all at once and pretend that everyone 
is rich? If that were the way, the silly argument could be made by 
extension that everyone who qualifies for the old age pension is 
a millionaire. What kind of nonsense is that?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Chamberlain:</B> Rubbish.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> It is rubbish as the hon. member so eloquently 
just said.
<P>
	A study was done by the Library of Parliament on my own 
pension benefits. I revealed it in committee and I will now do so 
on the floor of the House of Commons.
<P>
	I have been a member since 1984 and I have paid premiums 
every month to the pension plan. Those premiums as of last 
January, when the study was done by Finn Poschmann of the 
research branch of the Library of Parliament, were evaluated 
with accumulated interest at the GIC rate, the rate offered in 
probably the most, pardon the expression, conservative 
investment vehicle  anyone could use. If we calculated what I 
have invested in that personally, I have invested $136,988 in all 
these years.
<P>
	Imagine what the member for Windsor West has invested after 
being an MP for 30 years, or the member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, the member for 
Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke and other veterans of this 
place. They will never see even a fraction of the interest on the 
money they have invested in those plans unless they live to be 
about 150 years old. How many times is that said to the people of 
Canada?
<P>
	In any case I have invested almost $137,000. Based on a 
matching employer-employee contribution that is used in any 
kind of plan that would mean that right now I would have 
$274,000 invested. The interest alone on that right now would 
bring in about $27,000 a year. What would I get if I retired today 
as an MP? I would get $30,000 a year. What about these millions 
of dollars they say I would get? The difference is $3,000 a year 
based on the most conservative investment vehicle we could 
possibly find.
<P>
<B>(1530 ) </B>
<P>
	Imagine how much better off I would be if I had done rather 
well at investing. That plan is not to make the member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell rich or the member for Windsor 
West rich or any other members who are already here and have 
served many terms. That is not the idea.
<P>
	The idea is the following:
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In my case, I was able, at a certain point, to leave my job and 
run for office. Now I have been elected, and nothing is going to 
change me, because I am here already.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	To use the words of the member across, maybe now I have 
made it. However, that is not the point. The point is that others in 
all groups in society can run for office. Perhaps a 29-year old 
sole support mother who has a good job would like to run for 
office. She can do so and not threaten her family and their future 
by wanting to serve her country.
<P>
	None of this is going to change me. I am already here and I 
have been here for a long time.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> You won't be here for long.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> I do not know whether I will be re-elected. That 
is for the good people to decide. At least I had this great 
opportunity. One of the reasons why I had that opportunity is 
because that security was there.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14462"> 14462 </A></B>
<P>
	What is wrong with other people wanting to run in 1998 or 
2002 and the elections after that if they are able to do so? Not 
everyone when they get here has previously made it. Not 
everyone was rich before they came here or had this huge 
business empire to go back to. Yes, there are some of those and 
there is nothing wrong with that, but there is another reality out 
there. Parliament is the place where everyone in Canada has a 
right to expect that one of them, if they are elected, can afford to 
sit in this great institution.
<P>
	The former Prime Minister of Canada, Mr. Diefenbaker, once 
said-perhaps it is be unusual for me to end my remarks by 
quoting a Conservative Prime Minister but I will anyway-that 
there was no greater honour for a Canadian than to represent his 
or her fellow colleagues in the highest court in the land, the 
Parliament of Canada.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, that is an honour that was given to me, to you and 
to all of us. What I want is for all Canadians to at least be able to 
aspire some day to represent their fellow constituents in the 
highest court in the land, the Parliament of Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Through you, Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to congratulate the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell on his excellent remarks, on 
sharing his personal experience of parliamentary life, from his 
early days in a former life to his election to this Parliament, and 
to the provincial legislature in Queen's Park before that.
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell what he would reply to the 
Reform Party's claim that all the bill before us is designed to do 
is sweeten even more the members' retirement package.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Bellechasse for his question. While I am at it, perhaps I could 
take this opportunity to thank him for his work at the procedure 
and House affairs committee. I think he did a very fine job and I 
wish to thank him for that.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, we all know that this bill will have 
the effect of reducing members' benefits. It is true that there 
used to be no minimum pensionable age.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	It is true that some former members are receiving benefits 
although they had not reached pensionable age when they left. It 
is also true that others, while having contributed to this plan 
much longer than they would have in a regular plan, are still not 
receiving any benefits. I gave the example of the hon. member 
for Windsor West who would probably be eligible for a bonus if 
he left now. Those are facts, but not the kind of facts that some 
Reform Party members raise on a regular basis in this House.
<P>
	Members' benefits are reduced through the institution of a 
minimum pensionable age and also for members who took a 
federal position upon retiring from politics. In their case, double 
dipping would be prohibited; they would not be allowed to 
receive money from both sources at once. Third, pension accrual 
rates will also be reduced because of the decrease in 
contribution rates and ensuing decrease in benefits at 
retirement.
<P>
	I realize that the time is up. To conclude, because this is 
probably the last chance I have to do so before the summer 
recess, I wish to thank, in my capacity as government whip, the 
Chair, our staff, the table officers, the pages and especially my 
two colleagues the opposition whips, the hon. member for 
Laurier-Sainte-Marie and the hon. member for Calgary West.
<P>
	In spite of our differences, we have worked very closely. I 
could even say that I look forward to the fall when I can work 
again with my colleagues, the whips of the other parties, in this 
House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened to 
the member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell talk about how 
he had only given a fair share to the pension plan and he 
expected to get a fair amount back.
<P>
	I wonder if he could respond to a question. We had a financial 
expert come to our caucus to talk about what we should do since 
we were opting out of the plan. His first piece of advice to the 
Reform Party as a professional financial adviser was: ``Don't 
opt out of this pension, it is the best pension plan in Canada''.
<P>
	Would that change the member's mind about his comments 
that this is a very fair pension plan?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> I never said it was a very bare pension plan. I 
used the amount that I have have contributed versus the payout 
and put before the House the difference between the two. If the 
hon. member wants to qualify that or anything else as being 
bare, they are his words and not mine.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to make a few short comments on this bill, since the 
debate is coming to an end.
<P>
	All the more so since, as a Bloc Quebecois candidate during 
the general election leading up to the 35th Parliament, I did not 
come here with the idea that I would accumulate any pension. 
Nevertheless, this issue concerns us all.
<P>
	If Canadians have shown some interest in the matter, it is 
probably after finding out that some young parliamentarians 
could, after two terms, start collecting very generous pensions. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14463"> 14463 </A></B>
<P>
Given the longer life expectancy, some of these pensions could 
total 3 to 3.5 million dollars.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	This is what really concerns people. I did not hear my 
constituents say that the pensions were too generous. What 
concerns them is the fact that a member of Parliament can start 
collecting his or her pension as soon as he or she leaves office. 
During the election campaign, I pledged to fight in this House to 
ensure that MPs pensions would only be collected at a normal 
age, that is the age where the majority of Canadians working in 
the private or public sector, can legitimately retire.
<P>
	The bill before us deals specifically with this issue, which is 
an issue on which we pledged to take a stand. The hon. member 
for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell clearly showed that, for the 
last 43 years, the MPs retirement plan has not only been 
self-financing, but has accumulated a profit. It is not a costly 
plan for the state. Indeed, it is a plan which is self-financing and 
which even generates profits.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I am quite aware that 
there are some strongly held views on both sides of this debate, 
notwithstanding the person who has the floor.
<P>
	If others want to continue the debate elsewhere, that is fine. 
However I hope we can conclude this debate in the 
parliamentary fashion we have conducted business in this 
Chamber on the vast majority of occasions.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Langlois:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for bringing this 
House to order with your usual blend of firmness and tact. As I 
was saying, the main concern of the constituents I have the 
privilege to represent was the pensionable age. That is settled in 
this bill. What we usually refer to as double dipping has also 
been abolished, at least in the case of federal institutions, and 
that is a good thing.
<P>
	I must say I agree with those who feel that with an annual 
salary of $64,400, parliamentarians are certainly not overpaid. 
Although we represent as many as 100,000 to 150,000 people, 
we meet daily with people in various sectors who earn twice or 
three times our salary. Not that I expect to be paid that much. 
Besides, our salaries are now frozen. The last Parliament 
decided to put a freeze on members' salaries. We have no desire 
to broach a subject that as we saw in the course of this debate, 
tends to elicit the most outrageous verbal attacks.
<P>
	The remuneration of parliamentarians will probably remain a 
contentious issue. It may be advisable to provide for an 
independent review mechanism. Of course, parliamentarians 
who think they are being paid too much for what they do can 
always send part of their salary back to the crown. But 
ultimately, it will be up to our constituents to decide whether the 
members they elected to the 35th Parliament gave value for 
money. Theirs is the ultimate verdict.
<P>
	Members who were elected and want to make a career in 
politics have to go before the voters in every election and prove 
they did the job they were paid to do as parliamentarians. Voters 
may also ask: Did I get my money's worth? Did my MP really 
deserve to be paid $64,400? Their judgment may be negative or 
positive. So there are several criteria we can refer to. We 
ourselves might feel guilty about getting a salary of $64,400. Or 
we might not feel guilty, but our constituents may show us the 
door.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	That said, I think there has been a great song and dance with 
this debate and with others about certain parliamentary benefits 
and our having it soft on our arrival in Ottawa. I would not say 
we have it soft. I would say, rather, that we did not come here for 
the salary. We came, obviously, to serve our fellow citizens as 
best we could, and they will evaluate our performance one day 
or another. We are accountable to them alone.
<P>
	I take this opportunity to point out, Mr. Speaker, and you are 
no doubt aware of this yourself, that our work as members of 
Parliament is made so much easier by the clerks, by the pages 
and by all those, who, often anonymously, almost invisibly, 
make our work or our life less difficult, given that we arrive at 
dawn and leave late in the evening for a few hours' rest.
<P>
	People are always working to put things back in order for our 
return, without our even noticing. The journals are printed and 
Hansard is there when it is ready. If we need something, pages 
are ready to find the documentation we need, the people at the 
Parliamentary Library find us what we need to do our job and 
our legislative advisers prepare our amendments.
<P>
	Today we have thanked the pages and the clerks. I would like 
to take the opportunity to thank as well those who, often behind 
the scene, work so efficiently that our often heavy workload 
seems a little less so.
<P>
	That being said, when it comes time to vote shortly, having 
obtained the guarantees we sought and insisted on in the last 
general election, I will be pleased to vote in favour of the bill 
currently before the House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it has been a very interesting experience listening to 
the speeches this afternoon. The hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell talked about how he got his 
education. We got a history lesson from him and we learned a lot 
about hyperbole. I never realized that by hon. members not 
receiving their pensions democracy would collapse.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14464"> 14464 </A></B>
<P>
	I am amazed by the argument that the Reform Party is 
objecting to the Liberal plan simply because it does not like it. I 
would like to back up our comments with a number of letters 
from our constituents.
<P>
	For example, let me quote from a letter from Mrs. Marjorie 
Hernstedt of Williams Lake, who wrote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Chrétien promised to reform the outrageous pension plan. I am a pensioner 
and this past July, the government couldn't afford to give us our two-dollar 
raise. I live on the pensioners' pension and Canada pension with very careful 
budgeting. The whole outlook is grossly unfair and I urge you, Mr. Mayfield, 
to demand Parliament bring MPs' pensions into line with what is available in 
the private sector.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	How can any of us justify a pension like the one in Bill C-85 
when there are people like Mrs. Hernstedt who are barely 
making ends meet on their own pensions?
<P>
	Is it not ironic while MPs are getting their pensions that Mrs. 
Hernstedt and others like her are being told that the government 
cannot afford a $2 raise in pension benefits. The irony is just 
sickening.
<P>
	Also Mr. Don Ford of Quesnel feels that politicians have to be 
willing to make sacrifices and play a part in cutting government 
expenditures. He said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The pensions of members of Parliament should be based on their 
contributions as a percentage of their salary, to the point of their retirement at 
age 65, a percentage in line with the average Canadian middle income worker, 
and that they be eligible to start receiving the earned pension after reaching 
the age of 65 years, and not when they are defeated in an election.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1550 ) </B>
<P>
	We are not simply speaking on our own behalf; we are 
representing our constituents. Mr. Ford touched on a theme 
heard over and over again in the House: the MP pension plan has 
to be brought into line with what is seen in the private sector.
<P>
	I should also like to mention what some of the media people 
are saying. Barbara Yaffe of the <I>Vancouver Sun</I> had the 
following to say about the MP pension plan:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>British Columbians are not amused. The corpulent cats who remain in the 
plan in future will get nearly four tax dollars for every one dollar they put in, 
while the MPs with guts and principles get zip. Those who opt out deserve real 
credit. The weasels who stay in deserve our enmity.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Those are very strong words: corpulent cats and weasels. 
These are the kinds of words that come from Canadians when 
asked what they think of politicians who opt into the pension 
plan.
<P>
	An article by Bob Cox of <I>Canadian Press</I> stated the 
following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A proposed leaner pension plan for MPs is still four to seven times more 
generous than what other Canadians can earn, says an expert on politicians' 
pensions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Though an improvement on the even richer existing plan, the Liberal 
proposal would still be worth $60,000 before taxes-close to an MP's $64,000 
salary-The Canadian Taxpayers Federation agreed, putting 242 smiling, pink 
pigs on the vast Parliament Hill lawn to represent MPs who have indicated 
they would stay in the new pension plan.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Canadians, not just Reform MPs, do not trust their members 
of Parliament to handle their own compensation. It is conflict of 
interest. It is like appointing a mouse to guard the cheese. The 
time has come to really reform the system.
<P>
	One proposal that has received strong interest in 
Cariboo-Chilcotin was to appoint a volunteer committee to 
examine the pension plan of 10 companies at random on the 
Toronto Stock Exchange. Their pension plans would be 
averaged and the result would be the basis for the new MP 
pension plan. The plan would be reviewed occasionally and 
altered as needed, preferably by some neutral person like the 
auditor general. Others have put forward similar ideas.
<P>
	If we as politicians are to regain the trust of Canadian people, 
we have to start right at the beginning with the MP pension plan. 
The best way to handle the issue is to have the electorate decide 
the compensation with the politicians out of the room. Anything 
less than this is an abuse of power on our part. It is conflict of 
interest and a betrayal of the trust Canadians place in their 
members of Parliament.
<P>
	In conclusion, at a time when the Canadian pension plan is on 
the verge of bankruptcy, when over one million Canadians are 
out of work and many more are barely making ends meet, we are 
being asked to approve a pension that would turn average MPs 
into the comfortably well off in only six years.
<P>
	As a member of Parliament I cannot support the package, 
especially when there are so many Canadians without any 
pension at all. Therefore I will be voting against Bill C-85 at 
third reading and I will be opting out of the pension plan if it 
passes.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Pursuant to order made 
Thursday, June 8, 1995, in accordance with the provisions of 
Standing Order 78 it is my duty to interrupt the proceedings and 
put forthwith every question necessary to dispose of the third 
reading stage of the bill now before the House.
<P>
	Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> All those in favour of the 
motion will please say yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> All those opposed will 
please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> In my opinion the yeas 
have it.

<P>
<B>(1610 ) </B>
<P>
	<I>And the bells having rung:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, we are approaching the end of the 
year and we have certain traditions and conventions in the 
House.
<P>
	Earlier in the session I mentioned a few times the use of props 
in the House. I call on all hon. members to respect the traditions 
of the House. If any hon. members are even considering using 
what I would call props, especially when a vote is being taken, I 
would ask you please to reconsider so that it will preserve the 
decorum of the House.
<P>
	I ask that with all respect, knowing full well that all hon. 
members have very strong opinions. Once again in the name of 
the House, I would ask you to refrain from using any props. I 
make that appeal to all hon. members.

	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (for Minister of Industry )</B> moved that Bill 
C-91, an act to continue the Federal Business Development 
Bank under the name Business Development Bank of Canada, as 
amended, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
<B>(1635 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to say to the leader 
of Her Majesty's loyal opposition, the industry critic for the 
Bloc Quebecois, and the hon. member for Edmonton Southwest 
who is the industry critic for the Reform Party that the 
government appreciates the co-operation on this bill. If we were 
not able to get this bill through today, it would have had an 
adverse impact not just on the bank as we know it but also on 
meeting the objectives of helping small and medium sized 
business over the next three or four months as we adjourn this 
House of Commons.
<P>
	As we have debated over the last couple of days, the new 
Business Development Bank of Canada has been given a new 
mandate. This new mandate allows the capital of the bank to 
increase substantially to close to $18 billion. It also means that 
the bank can be a real force in this country in a complementary 
way in supporting other financial institutions.
<P>
	We also have to acknowledge that the bank is not just there to 
help in making loans to small business. It is also there as a 
counselling assistance bank. Very few Canadians realize that 
one of the unique features of the Business Development Bank of 
Canada is that it has one of the most sophisticated counselling 
assistance programs in any financial institution right across 
Canada.
<P>
	We have given an undertaking that by allowing this bill to 
proceed quickly today with swift passage, that we on this side of 
the House will not accelerate the activity of the bank in the 
province of Quebec before the referendum unless the Bloc 
changes its mind and wants the bank to be much more aggressive 
in its lending activities and its presence. That option is there for 
the Bloc to decide whether or not it wants more activity by the 
bank before the referendum or if it would like us to wait until 
after. That decision is with the Bloc and we will honour that 
commitment.
<P>
	On behalf of all government members and of course all of our 
members on the industry committee we have worked as a team in 
designing this bill and putting it through the House of 
Commons. Without the opposition's co-operation we could not 
have had such  swift passage. This is an example where all of us 
are working together to get this economy going.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise and speak about this bill at third reading, in 
slightly peculiar circumstances. I would like to state right now 
that it is only in the interest of Quebecers that we are going along 
with the government today.
<P>
	What we would have preferred was for the Federal Business 
Development Bank to continue as it was before, with a mandate 
to simply stimulate economic development. We do not want to 
fundamentally change the rules of the game and create a new 
small business bank in Canada, as this bill proposes.
<P>
	There is a fallacy in its very title, because the title does not 
match its contents, the scope of the bill. The first thing, of 
course, is the name change: from the Federal Business 
Development Bank to the Business Development Bank of 
Canada. That is a little pretentious, a little too pretentious, 
presumptuous. This was not reflected anywhere in the 
committee's discussions and debates. In addition, changing the 
name will be a frivolous waste of time and money.
<P>
	More serious still, it would change the Federal Business 
Development Bank's mandate which, up to now, was well 
appreciated by Quebecers. It would go from being the economic 
development bank that it was, the last resort bank for a specific 
clientele, for a very specific market, to a bank which offers 
complementary financing. We are fundamentally changing what 
defined it, what gave it its character as a last resort bank.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	The bank's role will be changed. There will be changes in the 
culture of a bank whose primary mandate was to promote the 
creation and expansion of small business, the culture of 
economic development. The changes will be subtle, as the new 
Business Development Bank of Canada seeks financing from the 
private sector and-this is of major concern to the Bloc 
Quebecois-will have to be profit-oriented, considering the 
rates of interest it will have to pay private investors, who will 
now be invited to invest in the bank. This will bring about a 
thorough change in the philosophy of the Business Development 
Bank of Canada, a bank that in our opinion is set to become a 
commercial bank with a culture that will be more concerned 
about making profits than just breaking even, as was formerly 
the case.
<P>
	Furthermore, and this is probably the most negative 
development from our point of view, this bill ushers in an 
unprecedented offensive by the federal government in the sector 
of regional development, a sector where Quebec has excellent 
resources and a reputation for its expertise. The federal 
government, without consulting with Quebec or the other 
provinces, has the gall to indicate in the bill that it will deal 
directly with provincial agencies, which are creatures of the 
provinces, including  in Quebec, although Quebec has 
legislation that regulates relations between provincial 
agencies-creatures of the Government of Quebec-and the 
federal government. This is supposed to be done through the 
Government of Quebec, and now the federal 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14468"> 14468 </A></B>
<P>
government comes barging in, tracking mud all over the floor as 
it were. We deplore this attitude and we condemn it.
<P>
	Well, let us go on to something else. The bill is full of terms 
that can be interpreted in a number of ways because they are so 
vague that bank directors, and especially political leaders, can 
use them any way they like.
<P>
	When they are referring to programs, when the qualifier 
entrepreneurship is used, no definition is given of an 
entrepreneurship program or indeed of entrepreneurship itself, 
which opens the door to every possible intrusion by the federal 
government in the area of regional development, which in 
Quebec, at least, is considered to be the prerogative and 
responsibility of the Government of Quebec.
<P>
	Finally, we seem to be looking at one of the centrepieces of 
post-referendum Canada which is being put together here in 
Ottawa, in a very low-key way, and which will make Canada a 
centralized country, a unitary country, something Pierre Elliott 
Trudeau never quite managed to do, but now it is being done 
very subtly, without debate, without any speeches and without 
anyone being brave enough to come out and say so. It is being 
done little by little, and the concept that prevails throughout is 
that Quebec is a province like the others and that for these 
people, Quebec as a nation does not exist.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to make it very clear at the outset that our party 
opposes the bill in principle. We feel that it does not make a 
whole lot of sense for the government to be establishing another 
crown corporation to compete with the private financial sector 
at the very time we are desperately trying to get CN, another 
crown corporation, into the private sector.
<P>
	To those Canadians watching, I would like to put the 
magnitude of the new Federal Business Development Bank into 
context. The lending authority of the bank will go to $18 billion. 
The combined total of all of the outstanding loans of all of the 
chartered banks in Canada is less than double that. It is 
something like $26 billion. We have created one huge entity in 
the financial marketplace.
<P>
	This is a government bill and we knew it was going to pass. I 
want to tell the House that the industry committee worked very 
hard to make the bill better. That was the purpose of our 
amendments.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	I think we should also recognize the fact that members of the 
Department of Industry were most co-operative,  very helpful, 
and worked very hard to put this legislation through. As well, 
Mr. François Beaudoin and members of the bank have worked 
very hard.
<P>
	I do not wish to cast any aspersions whatsoever on the role of 
the Federal Business Development Bank as a complementary 
lender and as a mentor to incubating entrepreneurship in 
Canada. That is where the bank should restrict its activities. In 
our view, there is a necessity of having that kind of mentoring in 
our country. They do great work through the CASE program.
<P>
	We feel that we should not be getting ourselves involved in 
the private sector. We did great work in the Small Businesses 
Loans Act working with the banks. This summer the industry 
committee will be working once again with the banks to keep 
their feet to the fire, to make sure they are lending money to 
small business. If the banks do their job, the crown does not have 
to do it. In my view, and in the view of many people on this side 
of the House, the correct approach would be to keep the bank's 
feet to the fire, not exposing more taxpayers' money to small 
business or any business. The business of business is business. 
We should not as taxpayers be throwing money at businesses.
<P>
	Having said that, Mr. Speaker, I want to say through you to the 
House and to people of the Federal Business Development Bank 
that they do have the support of the House. It is a democratic 
institution. It is going to be continued, and we expect them to be 
a complementary lender, not a competitive lender.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is the House ready for the 
question?

<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock</B> moved that the bill be read the third time and 
passed.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to rise today to 
defend Bill C-72, which has widespread support among 
Canadians and, I believe, the support of all members for quick 
passage in the House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, Canadians hold the strong moral view that 
people who commit violent acts against others while voluntarily 
drunk should be held criminally responsible for their actions.
<P>
	As members of this House are aware, last September the 
Supreme Court of Canada, in a case called Daviault, held that 
according to the common law, intoxication, even if 
self-induced, may be a defence to a charge of violence against 
another if the intoxication is so extreme that the accused was in a 
condition akin to automatism or insanity. As a result, the 
Supreme Court of Canada directed a new trial in the Daviault 
case in order to permit the trial court to canvas questions of fact 
relating to that potential ground of defence.
<P>
	In the Daviault judgment the Supreme Court of Canada, in the 
exercise of its proper function, established the common law 
principles that apply in such cases. Today the House of 
Commons has the opportunity, in the exercise of its 
constitutional function, to establish a legislated rule; in short, to 
codify the principles that we believe should be paramount, 
starting with the principle of accountability for one's own 
conduct. As we consider this issue today, I suggest that we, as 
parliamentarians, must examine the question not just as an issue 
involving the common law but as a matter involving common 
sense.
<P>
	The principle of accountability in the criminal justice system 
has been reflected in every measure this government has 
introduced while implementing its safe homes, safe streets 
agenda. During the session of Parliament that ends this week, 
the government has delivered on that agenda.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Bill C-37, which will receive royal assent later 
today, toughens the response to violent youth crime, doubling 
the maximum sentence for first degree murder, introducing 
important changes to the transfer provisions involving the trial 
of 16 and 17-year-olds in adult court when facing charges 
involving serious crimes of violence.
<P>
	Bill C-41, passed by this House last week, codifies the 
principles and the purposes of sentencing, encouraging 
uniformity and predictability in criminal sentences, broadening 
the rights of victims in the criminal justice process and 
increasing their rights to restitution.
<P>
	Bill C-42, passed earlier this year and proclaimed in force in 
mid-February, modernizes the criminal justice system in dozens 
of ways, simplifying criminal procedure and making protection 
ordered by the courts more readily accessible to women who are 
victims of the violence that is caused by the men with whom 
they live.
<P>
<B>(1710 ) </B>
<P>
	Bill C-68 cracks down on the use of guns in crime, providing 
for the longest mandatory minimum penitentiary terms in the 
Criminal Code for those who choose to use firearms in the 
commission of any one of ten serious offences. As passed by the 
House Commons, Bill C-68 also provides for mandatory 
minimum jail terms for those prosecuted on indictment for the 
possession of stolen or smuggled firearms and provides the 
police with valuable new tools in their continuing efforts to 
enhance community safety.
<P>
	Bill C-104, which will be considered by the House later this 
afternoon, provides by amendment to the Criminal Code for the 
taking of bodily samples for DNA testing, providing an 
important tool for police and prosecutors in the investigation 
and prosecution of serious crime.
<P>
	The creation of a national crime prevention council puts 
crime prevention on the national agenda for the first time, 
uniting community action with government policy so that 
Canadians, instead of wringing their hands worrying about 
safety in their communities, can roll up their sleeves and do 
something positive and constructive to increase the safety of 
their homes and of their streets.
<P>
	With Bill C-72, the government has responded quickly and 
effectively to deal with an issue of grave public concern.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The aim of this bill is to amend the Criminal Code so that 
intoxication may never be used as a defence against general 
intent violent crimes such as sexual assault and assault. The bill 
therefore establishes a new standard of care.
<P>
	A person in a state of self-induced intoxication that renders 
them unaware of, or incapable of, consciously controlling their 
behaviour, who causes injury to another person, is criminally 
accountable. This person departs from the standard of 
reasonable care generally recognized in Canadian society and 
cannot claim extreme intoxication as a defence.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The government believes that the approach taken in Bill C-72 
is fundamentally fair, both to the victims of violence and to 
those accused of crime. It is fair to the accused because we will 
set out in clear language in the Criminal Code the minimum 
standard of civilized conduct Canadians are entitled to expect 
from each other in the context of voluntary intoxication. Hence-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14471"> 14471 </A></B>
<P>
forth, let no one suggest that they were unaware of the standards 
by which their conduct in such cases is to be judged.
<P>
	The bill is fair to victims of violence because it ensures 
accountability for the aggressor. It fosters protection for the 
security of the person. It introduces concepts of deterrence and 
punishment to cases of violence involving self-induced 
intoxication.
<P>
	This bill reflects Parliament's grave concern about 
intoxicated violence and particularly its disproportionate effect 
upon women and children in Canada. It is not without 
significance, I suggest, that the Daviault case involved 
allegations of violence by a man against a woman. Almost all of 
the cases that followed the Daviault judgment also involved 
allegations of violence by men against women.
<P>
	In both the preamble and the operative sections of Bill C-72 
we acknowledge the need to deal with violence by men against 
women and we provide an important means to meet that need. 
Bill C-72 is a way in which this government is delivering on its 
commitment to deal squarely with violence by men against 
women.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to thank the speaker and 
the members of the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal 
Affairs for taking time to examine in depth the complex issues 
underlying this bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The evidence heard by the committee is valuable not only as 
an indication of the widespread support for the bill, but it is also 
an important record of Parliament's reasons for legislating in 
this area. To guide those who are called upon to apply the bill or 
to defend or adjudicate upon its constitutional validity, the 
committee heard from practising and academic lawyers, from 
women's groups, from experts on the psychiatric, 
pharmacological, and behavioural effects of intoxication.
<P>
<B>(1715 ) </B>
<P>
	Of key interest in my view was the uncontradicted testimony 
that there is absolutely no scientific evidence that alcohol acting 
alone can medically produce a state of automatism or a state 
akin to automatism.
<P>
	To be sure, there were some witnesses who expressed concern 
about some elements of the bill in relation to the charter of rights 
and freedoms, but most witnesses strongly endorsed the 
legislation as constitutional and as an appropriate response to a 
serious legal and social problem.
<P>
	The bill comes before the House today with two amendments, 
both of which I commend to my colleagues. First, the fourth 
paragraph of the preamble has been strengthened to reflect the 
scientific evidence that the committee heard. Instead of 
referring, as it did at first reading, to scientific evidence that 
many intoxicants, including alcohol, may not cause a person to 
act involuntarily, the revised bill refers to scientific evidence 
that most intoxicants, including alcohol, by themselves will not 
cause a person to act involuntarily.
<P>
	The second amendment involves the term ``basic intent'' as it 
appeared in clause 1. Section 33.11 has been changed to general 
intent. The phrase ``general intent'' is an expression better 
known to the law and lawyers and makes the scope and intent of 
the bill crystal clear.
<P>
	I suggest that Bill C-72 meets the test that Parliament must 
apply to all proposed legislation in the realm of the criminal law. 
It reflects our shared values and our notions of accountability 
while respecting the rights of those who may be charged with 
criminal offences.
<P>
	I suggest that the bill is sound, fair and a workable recognition 
of those important public and constitutional principles of which 
I have spoken. I ask for the support of every member of the 
House for its speedy passage.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
have passed these past few days two controversial and divisive 
bills. The most eclectic views were put forward, and the 
emotional intensity of the debate on bills C-68 and C-41 was 
reflected by some members' virulent outbursts.
<P>
	Unlike these bills, Bill C-72 is not intended to cause 
controversy and debate, but rather to bring them to a close. The 
Supreme Court decision in the Daviault affair has outraged the 
general public. Henri Daviault was charged with sexual assault 
on a hemiplegic woman while intoxicated.
<P>
	He was acquitted by the trial judge who was not absolutely 
certain that Daviault was sufficiently aware of what he was 
doing to form a criminal intent, that is to say the intent to 
sexually assault.
<P>
	The Quebec Appeal Court quashed this decision two years ago 
and convicted Daviault. But on September 30, the Supreme 
Court of Canada ruled that pleading intoxication could be 
admissible in some specific cases and ordered a retrial.
<P>
	Reactions to the decision rendered by the highest court of the 
land were quick to follow. While a plea based on the Daviault 
decision was expected to be used only very exceptionally, the 
interpretation given to this decision by lower courts lead to three 
acquittals within two months.
<P>
	All these cases involved women who had allegedly been 
assaulted, sexually or otherwise. In the Blair case, in Alberta, an 
alcoholic was charged with assaulting his wife. He was 
acquitted on the basis of the Daviault decision. In the Compton 
case, in Prince Edward Island, the accused, who only vaguely 
remembered what happened at a social gathering because he was 
drinking, was acquitted of charges of sexual assault. The judge 
said that he could not make a ruling and that he was not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14472"> 14472 </A></B>
<P>
convinced that the Crown had established the criminal intend 
required to convict the accused.
<P>
	Closer to home, in the district of Hull, in the Thériault case, a 
Court of Quebec judge acquitted a man charged with assaulting 
and threatening his spouse on the grounds that he was too high 
on cocaine to realize what he was doing.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	Three cases of women who were victims of assault and all 
three resulted in acquittals. This is more then the public could 
take. Canadians have had enough of the aberrant decisions made 
by our judicial system. Following the Supreme Court decision, 
the Minister of Justice decided to take action. In fact, the general 
outcry provoked by the Daviault case and the subsequent 
decisions made by lower courts was such that the minister had to 
respond immediately. This is of course a political decision; it is 
only a short term solution, before the Criminal Code undergoes a 
comprehensive review. This is what we call a piecemeal 
approach.
<P>
	The problem with this approach is that it inevitably results in 
a legislative mosaic which lacks cohesion. Although the justice 
minister has done some pretty good patchwork, it is still 
incomplete and inadequate. We wonder whatever happened to 
the judicial and legislative powers. Simple logic tells us that 
Parliament should legislate and then let the courts interpret the 
intent of the legislation. However, this is not the case. The 
courts, and particularly the Supreme Court, seem to be telling 
Parliament how to legislate. The world has gone crazy.
<P>
	It is up to the Minister of Justice to initiate reforms. The 
Supreme Court should not have to lead him by the hand. It is not 
up to the highest court in the country to take the initiative, the 
minister should do it. Enough of stopgap measures. Let us get on 
with it. The Daviault case was not the only opportunity used by 
the Supreme Court to send a message to the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	Indeed, in the McIntosh decision, brought down on February 
23, the court gave a rather surprising interpretation of the notion 
of self-defence. The judges concluded that an aggressor 
responsible for a dispute could avail himself of the principle of 
self-defence in a murder case. Chief Justice Lamer made a very 
telling comment when he wrote, and I quote: ``It is clear that 
legislative action is required to clarify the Criminal Code's 
self-defence regime''. He added: ``It is, in my opinion, 
anomalous that an accused who commits the most serious act 
has the broadest defence. Parliament, after all, has the right to 
legislate illogically''.
<P>
	The message is rather clear. Yet, it remains unanswered. With 
all due respect, the judges of the Supreme Court were not elected 
by the people and it is not their duty to indicate the direction the 
criminal law should take. Jurisprudence has an important role to 
play in the development of the law, but it is not a substitute for 
the decisions we as legislators are supposed to make.
<P>
	As for the bill before us today, the substantive amendments to 
the Criminal Code proposed in Bill C-72 are preceded by a 
preamble setting out the circumstances and considerations 
justifying this new legislative measure. The preamble will 
appear in the texts as an integral part of the amending 
legislation, but it will not be included in the Criminal Code. In 
fact, the preamble is longer than clause 33.1, which will be 
added to the Code. It is therefore difficult to ignore.
<P>
	Generally speaking, the preamble gives the background to the 
bill. Among other things, mention is made of the serious 
concern with violence in society, the close association between 
violence and intoxication and the recognized potential effects of 
alcohol on human behaviour. In this same vein, reference is 
made to the moral view that people who, while in a state of 
self-induced intoxication, violate the physical integrity of 
others are blameworthy and must therefore be held criminally 
accountable for their conduct, whence the need to incorporate in 
the law a standard of care, departure from which would entail 
criminal fault.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	A minor amendment has been suggested by the justice 
committee concerning paragraph 4 of the preamble, which 
points out logically enough that the consumption of intoxicants 
may not necessarily cause a person to act involuntarily.
<P>
	It is difficult to argue with virtue. On the other hand, the 
preamble raises a number of questions and comments. What is 
meant by saying that violence has a particularly disadvantaging 
impact on the equal participation of women and children in 
society. Are we afraid to say what we mean? Why does the 
preamble emphasize violence against women and children? 
Why are we still and always compared with children? It has 
really started to bug me that women are being equated with 
children, when it comes to victimization.
<P>
	Let me make this clear. I am not saying that children do not 
deserve special attention. What bothers me is the condescending 
and paternalistic attitude of the lawmaker. Whenever women 
need protection of any importance, we protect them as if they 
were children. It would seem to me that several people still 
consider us the weaker sex, actually, as weak as a child.
<P>
	Therefore, society should give us women the same protection, 
according to the lawmakers, perhaps; that is a male way of 
thinking. A woman does not need to be taken by the hand. A 
woman does not need to be told to look twice before crossing the 
street. A woman is a mature and responsible being. A woman is a 
mother who raises a child. A woman is not a child.
<P>
	Stop thinking of us in this way. If, in general, women need 
special protection, that protection should be different from the 
protection given to children. And children certainly do not 
encounter the same obstacles as women do, when they try to take 
an active role in society. So, why suggest that they are similar? 
Otherwise, we  would have to reclassify all human beings in our 
society. We would have to start talking about adults, on the one 
hand, and, on the other, women and children. There was a time 
<P>

<B><A NAME="14473"> 14473 </A></B>
<P>
when people used to think this way. It would seem that the 
lawmaker is now heading back in that direction.
<P>
	The summary gives an insight into the legislative 
amendments contained in Bill C-72. However, this litany of 
excuses has no other purpose than to eventually refer the issue to 
the Supreme Court, for an opinion on the approach taken in the 
amendments made in Bill C-72.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice is consistent as he again considers the 
option of a referral asking the Supreme Court to examine the 
amendments to the Criminal Code in Bill C-72, as soon as the 
legislation is passed by Parliament but before the legislation 
comes into force.
<P>
	He would seek a non-binding advisory opinion from the 
Supreme Court, as if Parliament needed the seal of approval of 
the courts! And if the Supreme Court felt that the provisions 
were unconstitutional, we would have to go through the whole 
process again. We would be back to square one, and the time 
spent in the House and in committee would have been wasted.
<P>
	If the Minister of Justice is so sure that his bill would pass the 
test of a constitutional challenge, why bother seeking the 
approval of the Supreme Court?
<P>
	Immediate implementation of these amendments is both 
necessary and crucial. As long as we keep postponing the 
coming into force of this legislation, the number of these sad and 
sordid cases will continue to increase. Courts across the country 
are waiting for the Minister of Justice to act. This time they are 
seeking an opinion from the Supreme Court.
<P>
	Aside from the preamble, the bill is very brief. Just one 
clause. Bill C-72 proposes to add a new section 33.1 to the 
Criminal Code, which consists of three subsections. The first 
one removes the defence of self-induced intoxication, the 
second subsection defines the standard of fault and the third 
specifies the type of offence to which the provision applies.
<P>
	Section 33.1 of the bill will be added to the general part of the 
Criminal Code under the heading <I>Self-induced intoxication</I>. 
However, the section in question provides no definition of this 
term and does not list specific circumstances to which the 
section does not apply. It seems to me that the Minister of 
Justice, who wants to correct a judicial decision, is still leaving 
a lot of room for interpretation. The connection between the 
preamble and subsection three of the article seems somewhat 
ambiguous.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 5.30 p.m., the 
House will now proceed to the consideration of Private 
Members' Business. Before we do, however, I would ask the 
hon. member for Saint-Hubert if she could tell the House how 
long she will need to conclude her remarks. Perhaps we could 
then agree to delay Private Members' Business, or perhaps we 
should ask for unanimous consent.
<P>
	Could the hon. member for Saint-Hubert help us out with this 
information?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Venne:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would need 8 or 9 minutes more.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Under the circumstances, 
I would ask, without wanting the hon. member for Saint-Hubert 
to be bound by her statement, if there is unanimous consent?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Would there be unanimous consent that I not see the clock so 
the hon. member for St. Hubert could conclude her remarks? 
Then at approximately 5.40 p.m. we would go into Private 
Members' Business. Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I believe the 
parliamentary secretary to the House leader has another issue he 
would like to bring forward. If he does I would like to have that 
heard now so that we could proceed. We would agree to the 
request.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> As we say repeatedly 
from the Chair, it is your House and I am only here to accede to 
your wishes.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-72, an act to amend the Criminal Code (self-induced 
intoxication), be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Sint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my colleagues for allowing me to conclude my comments 
on Bill C-72 right away.
<P>
	I was speaking about the preamble and the relationship of the 
preamble to the third paragraph of the new clause. The preamble 
provides that it is necessary to legislate a basis of criminal fault 
in relation to general intent offences involving violence.
<P>
	However, subclause 33.1(3) of the bill provides that the 
section applies to offences including violence or threat of 
violence under the Criminal Code or any other act of Parliament. 
Does this not mean that the section would also apply to specific 
intent offences with violence? This however is not the case.
<P>
	In fact, an individual charged will still be able to claim 
self-induced intoxication as a defence against such serious 
charges as murder, theft, robbery, extortion, breaking and 
entering and torture.
<P>
	As the preamble to the bill indicates, we clearly recognize the 
close association between violence and intoxication. The 
urgency of the situation requires immediate intervention. Every 
day women are battered by their drunken spouse.
<P>
	The results of a national survey on assaults against female 
spouses, in which more than 12,300 women participated, were 
released in March 1994. As I said previously, this survey 
establishes beyond the shadow of a doubt the relationship 
between alcohol and violence. It reveals that alcohol is a prime 
factor in spousal assaults. The aggressor had been drinking in 
half of all the reported assaults.
<P>
	More specifically, the rate of assault on woman living with a 
man who drinks regularly, that is at least four times a week, was 
three times higher than for abstinent husbands.
<P>
	Women whose husbands drink often five drinks or more at one 
time were six times more exposed to assault than women whose 
spouse did not drink. In 1993, 55 per cent of the men who killed 
their partners had consumed alcohol.
<P>
	That being said, Bill C-72 is only part of the solution when 
dealing with the violence issue. When sexual assault results in 
the death of the victim, what was common assault becomes 
culpable homicide. The offender will be able to use the 
intoxica-
<P>

<B><A NAME="14475"> 14475 </A></B>
<P>
tion defence, whereas he could not have presented such a 
defence if the victim had not died, since in that case he would 
have been charged with aggravated sexual assault.
<P>
	Which leads to the following nonsense. If the aggressor hits 
his victim hard enough to cause her death, he can plead that he 
was too intoxicated to know what he was doing. On the other 
hand, if the victim recovers from her injuries, he will no longer 
be able to use this defence. Such nonsense ought to be remedied 
at once. The only way this can be done is by consolidating the 
Criminal  Code and updating our law so that it reflects what 
society condones and what it will not tolerate.
<P>
	Every form of violence should be exterminated like vermin. 
The Minister of Justice should not wait any longer to complete 
the reform of the general part of the Criminal Code. The rules of 
criminal law are archaic and many of its fundamental principles 
are not included in the general part, as they were developed by 
the courts.
<P>
	Precedents shape the law. It is high time for roles to be 
reversed and for lawmakers to act responsibly. The Barreau du 
Québec quite rightly expressed serious concerns about Bill 
C-72.
<P>
	In its brief to the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal 
Affairs, it suggests a global approach to penal law. Here is what 
it said in unequivocal terms. ``The Barreau du Québec wishes to 
emphasize that, far from eliminating the confusion which 
surrounds the concepts applying to criminal law, the proposed 
legislation creates even greater confusion. The urgency is of a 
political nature and is the direct result of the treatment, by the 
media, of the Daviault case. This certainly confirms the need to 
look at the issue, but we must do so in the appropriate general 
context''.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	Other groups showed less tolerance toward Bill C-72. The 
Criminal Lawyers Association called the legislation 
``premature''. These criminal lawyers feel that the bill violates 
the charter of rights and freedoms. They deplore the attitude of 
the Minister of Justice, who is providing a political solution to a 
legal issue. These criminal lawyers also feel that the premises of 
the preamble are flawed and are too open to interpretation.
<P>
	Without necessarily agreeing with these groups, I do see a 
common denominator, namely the need to reform our criminal 
law, particularly the Criminal Code. Using a piecemeal 
approach or merely patching things up only leads to inconsistent 
legislation and absurd precedents.
<P>
	We need a comprehensive review, as Superior Court Justice 
Réjean Paul said:
<P>
	``It has already been quite a while since the Law Reform 
Commission of Canada suggested to Parliament that it should 
undertake major changes regarding substantive law and 
criminal procedure, so as to be able to deal with contemporary 
issues. It is necessary to adopt a new Criminal Code, as well as a 
new Code of procedure. In Canada, we are still using a working 
tool that dates back to the previous century, was reworked in 
1927 and 1952, and patched up several times since to deal with 
new political, economic or social realities''.
<P>
	The chaotic situation prevailing in our criminal law system 
could not be better summed up. Therefore, I exhort the Minister 
of Justice to stop grandstanding and to propose an overhaul in 
September. Criminal law needs a steady hand at the helm, 
someone capable of keeping on course, not someone who will be 
dragged along in the wake of the courts.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to wish all of my colleagues a pleasant 
end of session; we all know that the last sprint is difficult. I wish 
you all a good summer and above all, a happy national holiday, 
Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day, to all Quebecers. May we proudly 
celebrate the joy that comes with belonging to a people who will 
soon, very soon, take charge of their own affairs and create a 
country of their own.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="NATIONALGRANDPARENTSDAY">NATIONAL GRANDPARENTS DAY</A></H3>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.)</B> moved 
that Bill C-259, an act respecting a national grandparent's day, 
be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, in today's times the family seems to be 
under constant attack and so it is that those of us who are chosen 
to represent Canadians and make decisions for Canadians must 
also protect the Canadian way of life.
<P>
	The family is the basic unit for all society, yet it seems to have 
its adversaries, those who seem intent on belittling the 
importance of family in today's world. I am sorry to hear from 
those who do not respect the family for it is our heritage. It is 
mankind's heritage and mankind must protect it if the world is to 
remain strong.
<P>
	From strong families we have strong communities. From 
strong communities we have strong provinces or states, and 
from strong provinces and states we have strong countries. One 
unit builds upon the other.
<P>
	Why is it so important to remain respectful of the family unit? 
When we are born, each of us learns from our parents. We are 
taught who we are and learn the values of living within a family, 
of treating each other with love and respect.
<P>
	Our future behaviour, one of being responsible, carrying one's 
weight and respecting others and our way of life begins in a 
family setting. Later, as we continue to grow and get an 
education, our relationships with others and our treatment of 
others reflect our early family teachings. We are what we are 
taught. We are what we experience.
<P>
	If we are part of the working world and go into business, our 
business reflects our attitudes. If we take a position in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14476"> 14476 </A></B>
<P>
workforce our treatment of others and our ability to work with 
others forms our reputations, that which we become known by or 
judged by and hopefully loved by.
<P>
	The most common reference to the life of mankind is a tree. If 
the roots are strong and well fed, so grows the tree. If families 
teach strong values, good citizenship, respect for others, 
children as they grow will carry out this practice in their every 
day lives. As we know, acorns never fall far from the tree. So it 
goes that our basic teachers who become grandparents are of 
great value to our society.
<P>
	If a country is to remain strong, its people must be strong, for 
a country reflects the values of its people. In Canada we have 
many cultures and we are made aware of this when we travel or 
walk through our large cities, whether we are in a market square 
or a restaurant or a school. If we look closer when we meet our 
fellow Canadians I know we will see the attitude within each of 
these cultures toward their families.
<P>
	We can learn from each other. Whether we watch our 
aboriginal peoples or new cultures that come to Canada from 
other countries, they clearly show respect for their elders in each 
of our many family groupings in Canada.
<P>
	It appears to me to be the underlying theme in most cases, the 
elders in each of our families, the grandparents and the great 
grandparents, those who are wise in the ways of the world. The 
best way to be wise is through life experience and through 
hardships.
<P>
	Let us look at who our grandparents and our great 
grandparents are today. First, I want to point out that this group 
in Canadian society is the very one who gave us many of the 
plans we have today, such as the basic UIC program, workmen's 
compensation, old age security and the health care plan. These 
citizens have paid their way in society. Now we should support 
the intent of my Bill C-259 and help them by recognizing the 
second Sunday in September as grandparent's day, the same as 
we have a father's day and a mother's day.
<P>
	At this time, in this House, it would be a very special thing to 
do. At the end of debate in this session on Private Members' 
Business, we should finish the session by recognizing our 
grandparents in this way.
<P>
	Grandparents and all seniors today are very active. Many are 
still in the workforce. Many are in volunteer organizations. I 
want to take a moment to point out that right now in Ontario we 
have grandparents who are in the volunteer organization Many 
Hands. As a volunteer one does not get paid for one's services. 
There are many grandparents in this program called ``School 
Volunteers Add Life to Their Years''.
<P>
	These are the types of things this group of grandparents and 
seniors do in our communities throughout Ontario: volunteer 
activities and general classroom assistance. These volunteers 
carry out various tasks such as assisting with learning activities, 
oral reading, creating displays, helping young children with 
their clothing. They might also form part of the class 
grandparents which is the intergenerational program in which a 
senior becomes a grandparent to one classroom. They might 
take on remedial education. Volunteers are  needed to assist 
students with reading, language and math skills.
<P>
	They might also do special education. Volunteers work with 
developmentally challenged students, either one to one or 
within an integrated classroom. They might be in mentoring 
where they are working one on one with a student to provide 
friendly support, increase motivation, encourage attendance and 
help prevent dropouts. They might work with languages.
<P>
	Volunteers with fluency in languages could assist in French 
immersion programs or in English as a second language, RESL 
programs. Grandparents might work in the electives. Students 
benefit from hands on learning when volunteers introduce and 
demonstrate their skills in art, drama, music, computers and 
more. They might be resource speakers. How often in my 
classroom did I have seniors speaking to students about various 
skills they have. Volunteers speak on topics of interest to the 
class which include careers, travel, hobbies and special projects. 
They might be part of school clubs. School clubs and science 
fairs all benefit from the involvement of volunteers with 
specialized experience.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	Grandparents might coach team sports. Many school teams 
need help in activities such as coaching, training and managing. 
Grandparents might be library assistants. A busy library needs 
volunteers to assist students to locate materials, prepare library 
cards, repair books, help with circulation tasks and reshelve 
books or work as an office assistant. The school office 
frequently needs help in general clerical assistance, filing, 
copying and telephoning.
<P>
	I have demonstrated that when it comes to volunteering, our 
seniors, our grandparents are invaluable. At least in Ontario we 
already realize what a wonderful resource they are.
<P>
	I wonder how many of us realize that we have something 
called seniors games in our provinces. I know Ontario has 
seniors games because I have in front of me a very beautiful, 
very large magazine that goes out to 160,000 grandparents 
throughout the province.
<P>
	I want to point out that the Ontario senior games have many 
qualifications within them. One must qualify for various 
programs to take part in them. Just some of them are: cribbage, 
contract bridge, carpet bowling, darts, five-pin bowling, golf, 
horseshoes, lawn bowling, shuffle board, tennis, ten-pin 
bowling walking, and it goes on.
<P>
	These activities for grandparents, for seniors are all organized 
and all paid for by volunteers. I know these seniors have a very 
good time. I know this because I partake in the seniors program 
in British Columbia. I competed last year and I will be 
competing again this fall in the same program.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14477"> 14477 </A></B>
<P>
	All of these seniors give their time but they still enjoy life. I 
want us to remember that our grandparents are not too old to 
enjoy life, not too old to take responsibility, not too old to work, 
as many of them still do.
<P>
	In the seniors programs we see a demonstration of sport and 
sports abilities that are second to none. Last year I watched an 
87-year-old senior in British Columbia win the badminton 
finals. A very excellent sports athlete.
<P>
	I also want to point out, as this book does, that seniors are in 
volunteer programs here in Ontario. It says: ``Volunteers make a 
difference; $93.3 million gift to society''. That is what the 
seniors in Ontario have managed to help raise. In 1994 in metro 
Toronto seniors donated an average of four hours a week to 
charities and community work which translates into a whopping 
$93.3 million. Think about all those volunteer hours that are not 
paid for, that are given freely.
<P>
	Seniors have experienced maturity and commitment. They are 
looking for an opportunity to learn new skills, be challenged, 
makes friends and have fun. We should take the time to realize 
that our seniors are very special people.
<P>
	I would like to point out that in my grandparent's Bill C-232, I 
stated something very firmly. It was my opinion of the value of 
grandparents in the home. In this country and in the United 
States grandparents sometimes raise their grandchildren. In that 
case they are attending to needs I am going to talk about. In the 
United States there are over three million grandparents who are 
raising their grandchildren.
<P>
	In Canada we have no records on that. The reason we have no 
record is that we have nothing in legislation yet, even though 
Bill C-232 did get the unanimous support of the House and I 
hope it makes it into legislation shortly.
<P>
	My idea of literacy and crime prevention, which incidentally I 
have been speaking about for over six months, is something I 
feel could start with grandparents and with our senior volunteers 
because literacy begins at birth, it begins in the home. What a 
wonderful opportunity. Grandparents are there. They drop in. 
They visit regularly. They look after their grandchildren. It is an 
opportunity for them to read to them, take time to talk with 
them, to listen to them, to encourage them in that they are doing.
<P>
	This literacy program which I have been talking about for six 
months automatically has a positive result.
<P>
<B>(1755 ) </B>
<P>
	I believe that positive result would be crime prevention. I 
have spoken of this in every every group I have spoken to during 
the last six months, whether in British Columbia, here or in the 
maritimes.
<P>
	I strongly support literacy and crime prevention. I strongly 
support the program as it is outlined by the government, literacy 
and crime prevention. However, I have to take issue with one 
booklet which I am holding in my hand. I know my grandparents 
would agree with me that the language in this booklet is not 
acceptable for use. I know the grandparents that are in the 
gallery and the grandparents that are watching at home would 
agree that perhaps we could take a second at this booklet. We 
agree 100 per cent with literacy and crime prevention but we 
know our children have to read good language in books.
<P>
	I also have a few talking points which relate to Bill C-259, an 
act respecting national grandparent's day. I want to stress it is 
important to recognize even in a symbolic way the contribution 
of our ancestors. They can be recognized, if the House agrees 
that the second Sunday in September would be a great day to 
recognize grandparents on grandparent's day.
<P>
	It is through grandparents and great grandparents, if one is 
fortunate enough to know them, that the oral tradition of family 
history is passed on. How many times did we listen to our 
grandparents telling us stories about their lives?
<P>
	These traditions that go back to our roots are necessary in 
times of great change. It is always encouraging to have a 
touchstone to mark one's activity against and it is important this 
touchstone never change.
<P>
	This is what grandparents do for us: for our children they 
provide a solid base of support and advice. How many times do 
we in the House remember asking for our grandparent's help 
when we were younger?
<P>
	Recognition of grandparent's day is really a recognition of 
grandchildren and their relationship to the future of the country. 
I cannot stress that enough. When we talk about grandparents we 
are reinforcing the rights of our grandchildren. Lifting up the 
role of grandparents gives recognition to the interests of our 
grandchildren, it provides a bridge between the age gaps of 
young and old. When you see seniors working with young 
children, you realize there really are no age gaps. They converse 
very well together and they understand each other very well.
<P>
	We are all aware of the breakdown in the family unit and in 
family values in this last decade of the 20th century. This is our 
opportunity at least as parliamentarians to say that we do not 
want that to happen. We want to support our grandparents.
<P>
	This breakdown is attributable to many causes: the stress of 
modern day living, monetary worries and lack of job 
opportunities. In many cases these stresses have led to the break 
up of families. In a family breakdown most children who are 
involved believe they are at least partially to blame for the 
divorce of their parents. Only grandparents who are not 
immediately involved can act to console the children of divorce, 
to reassure them the divorce is not their fault. Grandparents are 
there in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14478"> 14478 </A></B>
<P>
good times and in bad to lend a hand. They make the 
grandchildren whole again.
<P>
	Those in their later years have contributed greatly to the 
development of this country. It was they who fought in the last 
world war, it was they who have attempted to prevent global war 
since 1945.
<P>
	We do not as a country spend enough time in reflection on our 
past. We have been caught up in the struggle to personally 
succeed, to live our personal success story. Grandparents can 
contribute a quiet assurance to the development of children that 
parents because of jobs and other pressures cannot now give.
<P>
	Bill C-232 dealing with grandparents rights of access to 
grandchildren during a divorce hearing has been debated on 
three occasions in the House and sent to the justice committee 
for study. As I mentioned earlier I would like to see it come back 
in the House.
<P>
	It follows from this heightened awareness of the rights of 
grandparents that one day per year should be set aside to honour 
them. I hope we can agree with this.
<P>
	Finally I want to mention an article I happened to run across 
which contains the words of Pope John Paul. Regardless of our 
religion or absence of religion, we might all realize this is a 
world leader to whom we should listen. He is talking of 
problems of the elderly:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-as the years pass and their strength fails and illness comes to debilitate them further, 
they are made to feel increasingly conscious of their physical fragility, and, above all, 
of the burden of life.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The only way to solve this problem is for our seniors to be taken to heart by 
everybody and accepted as a matter with which the whole of humanity must 
concern itself, for all humanity is called upon to support our seniors.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The experiences of our elders are a treasure the young married folk who, in 
the difficulties of early married life, can find in aged parents agreeable 
counsellors-and confidants, while the children will find in the example and 
affectionate care of their grandparents something that will compensate for the 
absences of their parents, which, for various reasons, are so frequent today.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The fact is that modern cultural patterns in which an unbalanced emphasis 
is often given to economic productivity, efficiency, physical strength and 
beauty, personal comfort, can have the effect of making the elderly seem 
burdensome, superfluous and useless, and of putting them on the margins of 
family and social life-</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The elderly often have the charisma to bridge generation gaps before they 
are made. How many children have found understanding and love in the eyes, 
words and caresses of the aging. And how many old people have willingly 
subscribed to the inspired word that the crown of the aged is their children's 
children?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	It is my hope today that members who are still in the House at 
the end of the time set aside to debate my private member's bill 
will join with me in agreeing that the second Sunday in 
September would be an excellent day to recognize grandparents.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I remind the House that 
we can expect an interruption very shortly for royal assent on 
some bills.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of creating a 
grandparents day for Canada to honour grandparents for their 
significant contributions to both our individual and collective 
lives. We have a mother's day, a father's day and a year of the 
child, yet we have been reluctant to similarly recognize and 
honour grandparents who have contributed so much to our 
attitudes and values as citizens.
<P>
	Grandparents would have been invented if nature had not 
already seen to create them in the hierarchial structure. 
Grandparents come in various sizes and shapes, not to mention 
ages. In fact traditionally one had to be a senior to be a 
grandparent. Today grandparents may be in their forties or 
fifties. In fact I have a friend who is a 35-year old grandmother. 
Even though I am no longer so young, I confess the thought of 
being a grandparent has begun to enter my fantasy and beckon 
seductively. Alas my sons have no wish to comply just yet.
<P>
	My only grandparent who I can remember-all others died 
before I was born-was my grandmother. She was my mentor 
and she was my heroine. She taught me early about advocacy, 
feminism and politics. She had a more profound effect on the 
path I chose in life than my parents. She taught me to be strong 
and to be outspoken, to be independent and to tilt at windmills. 
She taught me more by her example than by dictum. I am the 
woman I am today mostly because of my grandmother.
<P>
	Grandparents are not only mentors. They are nurturers. They 
come to the rescue of their grandchildren. They spoil them. They 
do things for them they would never have done for their own 
children, and so it should be. The grandparent is a grandchild's 
greatest defender and advocate, caretaker, surrogate babysitter, 
money lender, chauffeur and cookie baker. Grandparents are so 
important to our society that where nature did not provide them 
humans have indeed invented them.
<P>
	In B.C. there is an organization of volunteer grandparents who 
take the place of grandparents especially in urban settings. This 
association adopts children the same way as the Big Sister and 
Big Brother organizations, bringing a new and important 
relationship into the lives of lonely young children and young 
people. They become part of the extended family, eventually 
creating mutually beneficial lifelong bonds.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14479"> 14479 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	My own sons, born in a land far away from their own 
biological grandparents, were deprived of that special 
relationship with a grandparent, and they recognize that loss 
even now that they are men.
<P>
	As late 20th century family trends continue and global travel 
creates distances between natural families, grandparents will 
live lonely existences separated from their biological families 
either by divorce or distance, as too will their grandchildren. For 
many children, grandparents may be the only stable caregiver 
they know.
<P>
	True, the new blended family may create new opportunities 
for multiple grandparents and that is a plus. But whatever the 
scenarios, for those of us who remember or still have 
grandparents, we know that their work is indisputable, their 
wisdom invaluable, and their experience as story tellers 
unmatchable. They link the past to the future, bringing a sense of 
continuity, tradition and belonging to this fragmented world of 
ours.
<P>
	Grandparents have built and shaped our world of today and 
with our gratitude and will as parliamentarians we can make 
them an integral part of the world of tomorrow. I suggest we 
honour the immeasurable contribution of grandparents to our 
lives by creating a grandparent's day.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is my second speech in this House about a bill to 
declare a national grandparent's day throughout Canada. Like 
my colleague from Mission-Coquitlam, I also wish to salute 
the seniors, the grandparents sitting in the public gallery 
upstairs.
<P>
	Bill C-259 tabled by my colleague says this:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Whereas it is recognized that grandparents have laid the foundation of our 
family structure and future well-being;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And Whereas it is desirable to encourage all Canadians, and particularly 
children and grandchildren, to remember and appreciate their grandparents;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And Whereas the people of Canada wish to honour all grandparents in 
acknowledgement of their contribution to Canadian society;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The bill proposes that throughout Canada, in each year, the 
second Sunday in September of each year shall be known as 
``National Grandparent's Day''.
<P>
	As the official opposition's representative for seniors' 
organizations, I noticed that my previous comments in support 
of a very similar bill declaring a national grandparent's day 
touched many seniors in my riding of Argenteuil-Papineau and 
across Canada, including the British Columbia seniors' group of 
which my colleague is a member.
<P>
	It is essential to recognize the place of grandparents in our 
society, when we see how many organizations, groups or simply 
themes are entitled to their own days underlining their existence 
and importance. Bill C-259 at last gives seniors a prominent 
place in keeping with the very important role they play in their 
grandchildren's lives.
<P>
	However, to help them play this role properly, the government 
must provide seniors with a minimum level of financial security, 
thus preserving their autonomy. Our seniors' financial situation 
shows that we must not reduce the deficit on the backs of the 
most vulnerable. I refer you once again to the report by the 
National Advisory Council on Aging, which reveals that seniors 
do not enjoy high income levels.
<P>
	As representative for seniors' organizations, I have always 
sought to ensure that the government does not penalize seniors. 
Incidentally, I recently participated in the debate on Bill C-54, 
which specifically affects seniors' pensions either through the 
Canada pension plan or through old age security. We in the Bloc 
Quebecois proposed a series of amendments aimed at protecting 
seniors who would otherwise be penalized by Bill C-54. 
Unfortunately, the government rejected them.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	I suggested, for instance, that Canada Post should not have 
access to personal information provided to the government by 
beneficiaries. I also proposed an amendment that would oblige 
the minister to remit overpayments due to an administrative 
error.
<P>
	Furthermore, the Bloc Quebecois presented an amendment 
that would reinstate the one-year statute of limitation on 
overpayments by the government on old age security pensions 
that were not due to fraudulent intent.
<P>
	The present statute is five years, which means that the 
government has five years to claim amounts paid in excess. In 
fact I spoke yesterday in the House on the subject of Bill C-54, 
to explain the series of amendments proposed by the Bloc 
Quebecois. The bill was passed but the amendments proposed by 
the Bloc Quebecois, the official opposition, were defeated.
<P>
	I support Bill C-259 because it takes into account the 
contribution made by grandparents to our society. However, the 
economic situation of seniors is something we should be 
mindful of every day of the year, so that they can play their role 
as grandparents.
<P>
	We should recognize, even symbolically, the contribution of 
our seniors. Bill C-259 also gives us a chance to recognize their 
relationship with their grandchildren. We are, of course, all 
aware of the breakup of the traditional family.
<P>
	I also spoke in the House not long ago on the subject of Bill 
C-232, an Act to amend the Divorce Act. The purpose of this bill 
is to provide that grandparents will not be required to obtain 
<P>

<B><A NAME="14480"> 14480 </A></B>
<P>
leave of the court to apply for a  temporary, permanent or 
amending order regarding custody of or access to the children.
<P>
	Divorce always leave a bitter aftertaste, and I see it as my duty 
to ensure that seniors continue to enjoy the place that is theirs in 
our society. Personally, I am very concerned about the old age 
pension reform announced by the government, which will come 
into force in 1997.
<P>
	In 1994, the government announced that a document would be 
produced and tabled. Production was delayed, however, and the 
government preferred to wait until after the referendum in 
Quebec. In fact, seniors in Quebec had an opportunity to discuss 
their future at hearings held by the Commission des aînés sur 
l'avenir du Québec. In the course of these consultations, we 
found that seniors' concerns are similar across the country. They 
are concerned about their social and economic situation.
<P>
	Practically everywhere, people argued in favour of letting 
senior citizens use their experience for the benefit of the society 
they will pass on to their grandchildren. Bill C-259 gives 
seniors a decisive role and reflects our recognition of the role of 
seniors in our society.
<P>
	In concluding, I want to say that the official opposition 
supports Bill C-59 standing in the name of the hon. member for 
Mission-Coquitlam. I want to thank the hon. member on behalf 
of all seniors' organizations and also on behalf of all 
grandparents, the young and not so young, in this country for 
drawing attention to their role in our society.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
my pleasure today to be asked to speak in support of Bill C-259, 
an act respecting national grandparent's day.
<P>
	I am sure that my colleague from Mission-Coquitlam asked 
me to speak on the bill because despite my youthful appearance 
she knows that I am a grandfather. So today, to my grandson, 
Marcel I say: ``If you are watching the parliamentary channel on 
TV, Pop says hello''. I am a grandparent and I am proud of it. All 
together my wife and I have four grandchildren. Marcel is five 
going on 16. We also have Alannah, Carson and Brock who are 
quite a bit younger.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	We have a national mother's day and a national father's day. 
Grandparents are either mothers or fathers and I can see the 
logic in setting aside a day to recognize the importance of 
grandparents.
<P>
	Parents are often so caught up in the task of earning a living, 
keeping the house organized and keeping the children on the 
straight and narrow they do not have the energy or the patience 
to enjoy their children in the same way grandparents do.
<P>
	My wife Bernice says she has more fun with our 
grandchildren than she did with our own children. When she was 
a young mother getting the house tidy usually took priority over 
reading to our children and other things. Now she spends time 
with our grandchildren, in particular our grandson Marcel, and 
she says he claims he loves his grandmother more than 
pancakes. I can assure members pancakes are my grandson's 
favourite food.
<P>
	Grandparents have a big influence on their grandchildren. 
They provide their grandchildren with deeper roots and a sense 
of connection with the past. They can teach them different 
things because they have a different perspective. They can be 
more tolerant because discipline is not their responsibility any 
more. They can enjoy their grandchildren for who they really 
are.
<P>
	Our grandson Marcel has already learned a few things from 
watching me in the role of politician. The other day at the dinner 
table he told a story which his mother knew was a little white lie. 
She gave him one of her looks and without even skipping a beat 
our five-year-old grandson said to his mother: ``Mom, I would 
like to rephrase that''. He is watching television and he is 
smooth for a five-year-old.
<P>
	In today's society grandparents can be of enormous help to 
their children. With so many families breaking up and with so 
many families stressed out from making ends meet, an extra pair 
of loving hands is always welcome.
<P>
	If we were to have a national grandparents day it would be set 
aside to honour the role of grandparents and the role they can 
play. It would recognize the wisdom which grandparents can 
bring. It would give grandparents a sense of importance and 
worth. It would be a powerful reminder to those grandparents 
who are not as involved with their grandchildren as perhaps they 
could be that the more time they spend with their grandchildren, 
the longer the memory of their influence will survive.
<P>
	The House should give serious consideration to the bill. It will 
be an important signal to the nation of our ongoing commitment 
to the family. It will strengthen the resolve of those involved in 
taking their roles more seriously and, most important, it will not 
cost a dime.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York-Simcoe, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, sometimes I think grandparents are wasted on the 
young because it is not until later in life when we can look back 
that we really appreciate what our grandparents have given to 
us.
<P>
	I had the great pleasure of knowing three of my grandparents 
very well. One grandmother, who has been gone from us for 
almost 40 years, is still revered by her family as a strong, 
principled woman who worked hard to provide a life for her 
family in the new country.
<P>
	My grandfather impressed on me the importance of my 
responsibility as a citizen, as a new Canadian, ensuring his 
<P>

<B><A NAME="14481"> 14481 </A></B>
<P>
children took great care in participating in  and supporting the 
democracy of Canada. I am here today because of him.
<P>
	My other grandmother provided me with another strong role 
model, a woman with her own special brand of humour, 
intelligence and tenacity.
<P>
	While we discuss a grandparent's day for Canada I would like 
to introduce the idea of reciprocity. The trend from single to 
dual earner families has restructured the family as we know it. 
This has required substantial lifestyle changes within 
households. The trend has produced uncertainties in role 
expectations for spouses, their children and grandparents.
<P>
	Family members or friends provide most of the support for 
seniors needing care. In return, seniors are active contributors to 
their families. They provide financial assistance, care for their 
grandchildren, do housework, they bake and they undertake 
household repairs. More important, they provide emotional 
support and continuity for the younger members of their 
families.
<P>
	Grandparents donate their time as volunteers, they share their 
experience-
