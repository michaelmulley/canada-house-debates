Those members opposite in the Conservative Party of Canada came into our small towns and our harbours, sat with our fishers and plant workers, the hard-working men and women of our province, and promised to protect the Atlantic accords.

    </p><a name="Para688069"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Usually when we stand to speak, we make some reference to the previous speaker. I will do that, but very briefly. I just listened to two things that the hon. <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105459,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105459&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Leader of the Opposition</A> said. </div>
    </p><a name="Para688070"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that the Atlantic accord must be respected. I know he will have to run off as he is a busy person, but let me tell him that the Atlantic accord, in every aspect, will be respected. I do not know whether he heard me. I will say it again. The Atlantic accord will be respected.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688071"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also said he is against the cap. Let me quote from the hon. member on two or three occasions. When asked just in March about excluding 100% of resource revenues from equalization, he said, “No, no, I would not commit to this”. He said:</div>
    </p><a name="Para688072"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para688073"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, “Some provinces want special treatment to maintain their incoming benefits, even as their fiscal capacity increases. I disagree”. This is the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105459,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105459&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Leader of the Opposition</A> who just said he is against the cap.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688074"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also said, “A province that receives equalization payments cannot see its fiscal capacity growing above the fiscal capacity of a province that does not”. What do we call it? We call it a cap, C-A-P.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688075"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could go on. There are a number of other quotes and I only put that on the record to let people know how much they can rely on somebody who says he will give his word. It depends on the time, the place and the occasion, so we will dispense with that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688076"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me talk about the issue at hand. Let us look at a little bit of history here. We have a situation where people opposite think that people on this side, the governing party, somehow or other are going to shaft the provinces of Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia. </div>
    </p><a name="Para688077"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are hanging their hats today on the fact that, unfortunately, one of our members, a pretty good fellow and a good friend of mine, a great member, decided that he would not stay with the party and vote for the budget, that he would go across. </div>
    </p><a name="Para688078"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say perhaps that if the gentleman had waited another few hours, if he had been privy to some of the results of some of the work that he and others of us have been doing, he would not have done that</div>
    </p><a name="Para688079"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the interesting thing about this is that the members opposite, strictly for political reasons as we know, but that is the name of the game and I am not saying we would not have done it had the opposite been true, are lauding the fact that somebody crossed the floor on principle.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688080"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, they had a member who voted for the budget, who voted against his party on principle, and he is now sitting as an independent, so that is what they think about people who stand on principle. That is the name of the political game also. </div>
    </p><a name="Para688081"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interesting thing about it is that the premier of Newfoundland and Labrador is also joining with his newly found feathered friends on the other side and lauding the fact that somebody stood up on principle and walked across the floor.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688082"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interesting thing about this is the comparison with what his colleague, his counterpart in Nova Scotia, is saying. The Nova Scotia premier was calling the member to say, “Please do not do it, because you cannot do any good for us over there. We are working out a deal--”, unlike Newfoundland, by the way, “--with the federal government that will take care of our concerns, or at least that is our hope. We believe we can do it by working collectively. Will you stay there and work with us to make sure we get the deal?” The member did not listen. He went across.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1045"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1045"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1050"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1040"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1045">(1045)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para688083"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it a bit hard to understand when the premier of the province affected, in this case Nova Scotia, said “stick with it boys, and let's get a good deal”, and the premier of Newfoundland and Labrador said “run across the floor, give up, come home, we don't want a deal”. He might not want a deal, but the people of Newfoundland and Labrador want a good deal, and that is what they will get.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688084"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will give the House a bit of history here. What is this all about? If the government had not recognized the fact that there was a fiscal imbalance in the country, then we would not be here today. This would not be an issue. We recognized that there was a fiscal imbalance. The past equalization program threw a few dollars at the provinces that made the loudest noise. As all of us know, that was not very successful.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688085"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government started talking about addressing the fiscal imbalance. In order to do that, we needed a formula that everybody would accept and buy into and one in which everybody could participate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688086"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leading up to the last election, our party said in our blue book that if we formed government, we would be satisfied to take 100% of the non-renewable resources out of the formula. We are not denying that. It is there in black and white in our blue book and on web pages and so on.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688087"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We did not dump that when we were elected. In the election and after the election we said that we, as government, were willing to take 100% of all non-renewable resources, and not just oil and gas, out of the equalization formula. </div>
    </p><a name="Para688088"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The equalization formula affects 10 provinces and three territories. They are affected by whatever formula Ottawa puts in place. Consequently, they will decide if this is the best formula for them collectively. Of course, each province will ask if this is the best formula for it. </div>
    </p><a name="Para688089"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The premiers met on several occasions and the finance ministers met. They could not agree on the formula. The majority of them did not want what we offered in relation to taking out 100% of all non-renewable resources. </div>
    </p><a name="Para688090"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People at home are saying that the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> broke a promise. It was not the Prime Minister; it was the party and then the government. I am not denying that. We made a commitment. We were ready and willing to do that. We did not say to the provinces that we would not do that. The provinces had a whole year to put together a formula, including what we had committed, to address the fiscal imbalance of the country. The majority of the provinces said that it would make it worse for them rather than better. They said that they needed something else.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688091"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back several months ago, the talk about equalization and fiscal imbalance centred around the O'Brien formula. The government of the day, Liberal members opposite, initiated an independent study by highly qualified people, chaired by Mr. O'Brien, who brought forth a formula to address equalization. That became the talk of the town. Everybody, including all the premiers, realized that was probably where they were headed and they started to scramble to get the best they could out of that formula. This is all on the record. I am not it making up.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688092"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Premier of Newfoundland made a request to the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> that the Atlantic accord be protected. The two provinces, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador, had different agreements. They were not special agreements. They were not fancy side deals. They had agreements with the Government of Canada that they had worked hard for, which recognized the fact that their offshore oil and gas resources were located offshore, outside the land mass, and were supposedly controlled and owned by Canada.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1050"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1050"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1055"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1045"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1050">(1050)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para688093"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agreements were put in place to have the resources recognized, basically, as if they were onshore, that the province would be the prime beneficiary, that it would get 100% of the revenues from the developments of the offshore oil and gas.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688094"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1985 the original agreement was signed with the then Conservative government of Canada after the former Trudeau Liberal government had denied it for years. The minister of energy, who in Newfoundland denied it and would not give it the control of our offshore oil and gas benefits, was the former leader of the Liberal Party, Mr. Chrétien. The prime minister was Mr. Trudeau.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688095"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Mulroney government was elected, that deal was signed. There is a picture on my wall, if anyone wants proof, of Prime Minister Mulroney with Minister Crosbie, the regional minister, Senator Pat Carney, who was the minister of energy at the time, along with Premier Peckford from Newfoundland and the then minister of energy, Mr. Marshall. Sitting in the background with myself and others was one of the members on the other side, who is clapping his hands for a great agreement for the Conservatives.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688096"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we moved forward, in 2005 the Williams government, led by finance minister Sullivan, negotiated some improvements to the Atlantic accord. It sounded great when the premier came home, not really cheered then by the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78497,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78497&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Bonavista—Gander—Grand Falls—Windsor</A>.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688097"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The premier came down the escalator waving the cheque, and we all remember it, saying, “We got it, we got it, $2 billion”. Imagine coming into Newfoundland and Labrador with a $2 billion cheque. I would bet that members, if we did a quiz, and I would love to do a quiz, would say that the $2 billion is above and beyond, that it is great stuff.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688098"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is was an advance on Newfoundland and Labrador's income. It is just like if you were making $20,000, Mr. Speaker, and I know you make a little more than that, not at all what you deserve for the job you are doing. I was watching the hockey game last night, as a lot of people were, and thinking about the referees. They work an hour a night, basically, and get paid a lot more than you. I think you would make a tremendous referee because a lot of them are not of physical stature to break up the rackets. With a pair of skates and a much bigger salary, you would do it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688099"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you, Mr. Speaker, were making $20,000 a year and somebody suddenly gave you a cheque for $200,000 and you came home waving it, everybody in the family would be delighted. However, what you did not tell them is that for the next 10 years all of your net income would go into the bank because you just got a $200,000 advance.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688100"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newfoundland and Labrador received a $2 billion advance. That is all it got, nothing extra, nothing that did not belong to it, nothing above and beyond what it would get over time. Newfoundland and Labrador received it so it could pay down our the tremendous debt. The premier almost had a contest asking how people wanted it spent when he knew, because it is written in the agreement, it had to go toward the debt. It is all fun and games.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688101"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of it has not been drawn down yet, but it will be over the next few years. There is still somewhere around $1 billion, or a bit less. Some people think that if anything happens such as caps the province will lose it and it will be clawed back. Absolutely not. Let me state it clearly and categorically that the advance money given to Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador, regardless of what happens, will not be clawed back.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1055"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1055"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1100"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1050"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1055">(1055)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para688102"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any payments the province get because of the Atlantic accords will not be capped. The accord will not be capped. The accord is protected. Write it down. Look at <i>Hansard</i>. Cut it out. Show it to me in five years. We will not know those things right away simply because the province is still receiving equalization money.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688103"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The unfortunate thing about it is it province is not receiving much. In our province, as we say at home, we are getting well off. We are starting to become a have province. I am proud of that. I think the members opposite are proud of that. However, as anybody knows, we cannot have our cake and eat it too. I do not think anybody is really asking for it, if they understood what this is all about. What we do not want is for something that we own, something that we were promised, something that we were given, to be taken away.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688104"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure the members it will not be taken away. How do I know that? Because I have been working on it. I have not been sitting, complaining. I have not been running around the country, yelling and screaming and complaining about Ottawa not doing anything, when I have not even asked it, when I have not met with it and when I have not negotiated. We do not get deals unless we negotiate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688105"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year our province is receiving $477 million in equalization. Next year we will receive only $197 million. It is not, if our economy keeps going, the year after that we will get nothing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688106"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why our equalization is going down is because our revenues from resource development, in particular, including the offshore oil and gas, have been going up. We have not lost any of the money. Anything we have lost in relation to the total revenues we would receive has been given to us by what we call offset payments, through the Atlantic accord, and people think this will end. It will only end when the accord fizzles out.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688107"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the accord agreement was signed in 1985 to give us this money in lieu of clawback, in lieu of equalization losses, it was due to expire in 2011. Nobody has this by the way. It is not a bad deal and others would love to have it. The $2 billion upfront payment, which we could bring home and wave around, was an advance payment. We are not getting a cent directly from government these days in relation to offset payments. It is all kept because the government gave it to us in advance. When the advance is paid off, we will start getting real money again.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688108"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing they did a couple of years ago, in 2005, is they negotiated one extra year on the length of the accord agreement. The accord now ends in 2012. What does that mean? That means that in 2012 that is it. Our province will not get any more of these offset payments, unless in one of the two previous years, 2010 or 2011, we are on equalization. If we are receiving equalization, the accord is extended until 2020. If it is, and I hope it is, we will continue to receive every benefit from that accord because we have committed, with no changes to the accord, no capping of the accord, despite what members say.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688109"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To finish, in relation to equalization, there is not a chance, according to economists, that we will be on equalization in either of these years to qualify for the accord payments, unless we go to the new formula. If we go to the new formula, because of the 10 provinces, we might then qualify. If our province does, the theory is we will be capped. The Atlantic accord will never be capped.</div>

I did not discuss the issue with him at all, period. I can say to the member that I know somebody who did talk to him. It was the premier of his province who called the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78829,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78829&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Cumberland—Colchester—Musquodoboit Valley</A> and asked him to stick with it, to make sure that Nova Scotia got the deal that we said we would deliver but for him to make sure he was there.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have not tampered with anything. We promised the accord would not be touched. We said it would be preserved in its purity. We said it would not be capped. The member asked what we are negotiating. There is a brand new equalization formula, one that is predictable, one that is clear and transparent, one that treats every province properly. How does it relate to all provinces and what effect would it have on past agreements? That needs to be clearly pointed out and that is our job to do. It will be done. Let me again assure the member that it will not be done to the detriment of Nova Scotia or Newfoundland and Labrador.</div>

I would like to think it was because of two reasons. One, they know I am a stubborn Irishman and two, they do not have to because I try to do what is right and principled. Never has anybody told me what to do or say in this or in any other place, except maybe at home.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois will vote in favour of this motion, because it seems to us that the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> should have never made those commitments, which he failed to honour. He should have made sure that he would be able to live up to the commitments he was making to Canadians during the election campaign and on other occasions. Otherwise, he should not have made them or promised such things.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688142"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The text of the motion addresses only that particular issue. The solution that the government came up with, however, although not ideal, is nevertheless a step in the right direction. In that regard, we must put things in perspective. The Liberal Party can say that the government has failed to live up to verbal and written commitments made to premiers, because that is a fact. But, we must also look at the solution. The Bloc will vote in favour of the motion as it stands.<A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2"></A></div>
    </p><a name="Para688143"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to talk about the underlying issue, about equalization. I would remind the House of a number of things. Equalization is fully funded by the federal government using tax money paid by Quebeckers and Canadians from across the country. This equalization program is the result of a fundamental commitment to ensure fairness. In a federation like Canada, equalization has a very specific goal, namely, to ensure that, from coast to coast to coast, Canadians have access to public services at reasonably comparable levels of taxation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688144"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several countries—most of them federations—have equalization programs. The method consists primarily of evaluating the fiscal capacity of the provinces to provide public services. Provinces with a lower capacity to fund comparable public services receive equalization payments, whereas the others receive none. Quebec receives a significant amount in equalization payments, a little more than 50%. However, on a per capita basis, it finds itself behind several other provinces. In this sense, it is not the spoiled child of the system.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688145"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government's equalization payments to the provinces are unconditional and have no strings attached. Equalization does not take into account the expenditure needs of provinces and its sole purpose is to increase the fiscal capacity of the provinces to a common standard. There is no reduction in terms of equalization for provinces with fiscal capacity greater than the common standard. </div>
    </p><a name="Para688146"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the first time that this situation has arisen. In June 2004, the former Liberal prime minister made election promises during the federal campaign. The Premier of Newfoundland got the prime minister to promise to let the Government of Newfoundland keep all its oil revenues with no reduction in amounts disbursed to the province under the equalization program. </div>
    </p><a name="Para688147"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This position was unacceptable to Quebec. However, the Liberal prime minister did not keep this promise. At the first ministers conference of October 26, Ottawa insisted that there be a cap and that amounts exceeding the cap would result in a reduction of equalization payments. The Conservatives went into action on October 26, when the current <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> made a series of very formal commitments.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688148"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently, I was at the Standing Committee on Finance when the Premier of Saskatchewan testified. He showed in a very clear, precise way that those commitments were made at that time. In that sense, the motion that we are debating today is justified. However, within the framework of our discussions on this subject, it seems to us that the equalization formula set out in Budget 2007 is a step forward but it falls well short of the unanimous demands of Quebec. It contains some positive aspects. It is a formula founded on principles. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1115"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1115"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1120"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1110"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1115">(1115)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para688149"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new formula uses the real value of property taxes. The payments are calculated on the basis of the ten province standard, which pretty well puts an end to the notion of ceilings and floors, but nevertheless it does not meet Quebec’s demands. </div>
    </p><a name="Para688150"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What Quebec is demanding is, more or less, the following. It wants an adjustment of the equalization formula that will take into account the ten province standard, 100% of revenue from natural resources and the real value of property taxes. Why 100% of revenue from natural resources? Because, in the past, for example, Quebec developed its own hydroelectric resources without any significant support from the federal government while, in other sectors, other provinces received major financial assistance: Newfoundland, in particular, for the Hibernia project. </div>
    </p><a name="Para688151"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, we want to see 100% of revenue from natural resources included in the formula, so that in the final tally Quebec has a total envelope of more than $16 billion for 2007-08. The only formula that will enable equalization to achieve its objective involves providing receiving provinces with a per capita fiscal capacity equal to the Canadian average. </div>
    </p><a name="Para688152"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quebec’s demands flow from the Séguin report that was published in 2001 and unanimously adopted by the Quebec National Assembly. At that time, the Séguin report proposed four measures for adjusting the equalization formula to make it acceptable to Quebec. That involved the conditions that I mentioned earlier, namely, adopting the ten province standard, including 100% of revenue from natural resources, using real property values in calculating that part of the tax base related to property taxes instead of the theoretical value now in force, and abolishing ceilings and floors in the equalization envelope. </div>
    </p><a name="Para688153"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current government’s proposal to take account of 50% of revenue from development of natural resources seems to us a step in the right direction but it is not entirely what Quebec wants. It continues to advance its demand for the desired result, which is that 100% of revenue from development of natural resources be considered. </div>
    </p><a name="Para688154"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these proposals in Quebec were developed over the years. They resulted not only from the Séguin report, but also from three main documents on equalization reform. In 2004, the Quebec finance department—the Government of Quebec—revised the Séguin report when it tabled the 2004 budget. The document entitled “Correcting Fiscal Imbalance” updates the report of the commission chaired by Mr. Séguin. This document set out Quebec's unanimous demands and estimated the shortfall at $2.8 billion for Quebec for 2004-05 and at $5 billion for Canada as a whole.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688155"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following that report came the Council of the Federation's report in 2005 and, finally, the report of the Expert Panel on Equalization.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688156"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these measures were aimed at recognizing that a fiscal imbalance existed, and it was the Bloc Québécois that raised the issue here in the House. Hon. members will recall that a few years ago, none of the political parties in this House were advocating recognition of a fiscal imbalance. The Bloc Québécois got to work and systematically obtained support from the parties here in the House, until this year's budget was tabled. The federal government has not corrected the fiscal imbalance per se, but it has come up with additional funding that finally corrects an unacceptable situation. The provinces had many needs, while the federal government had the money.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688157"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We backed our position on this issue with help from other people and the information and reports I mentioned earlier. But we brought the issue onto the federal political stage. In the end, we won a commitment from the Conservative government that it would pay attention to this issue and correct the fiscal imbalance.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688158"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we find ourselves facing the same situation that the motion criticizes, which is that the fiscal imbalance has not been completely corrected. Admittedly, there was a significant cash component to the budget. This is why the Bloc Québécois decided to support this budget, and as a representative for Quebeckers, it still feels it was the right choice.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1120"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1120"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1125"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1115"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1120">(1120)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para688159"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is still a fiscal imbalance, and in the years to come we will remain dependent on economic vitality, revenues from the federal government, and the situation of the provinces. A permanent solution would be the transfer of tax points, tax transfers, which is currently not the case.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688160"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the Bloc Québécois will continue to fight for a permanent solution to this current situation in which Quebec does not receive its per capita share compared to the other provinces. The debate on whether or not to take into account revenues from natural resources is an important one and will continue.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688161"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the Liberal motion presented today, we can see that in a number of Canadian provinces, people who had received commitments, and who do not see those commitments in what was adopted, are frustrated. At the same time, it is clear that the discussion held to reach the solution set out in the budget is a step in the right direction. </div>
    </p><a name="Para688162"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> should not have made these commitments if he was not certain he could live up to them. He has not lived up to them, or so the motion says and criticizes. The only thing to come out of all this so far was that the Bloc Québécois obtained significant amounts of money for Quebec through the federal budget. We hope to be able to continue in that vein. Nonetheless, our ultimate goal is truly to come to a solution that will no longer be subject to all the ups and downs that are often caused by election periods.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688163"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier we looked at the background of the situation. In the past, the Liberal Party made commitments that it did not keep. The leader of the Conservative Party made commitments he still has not kept. Ultimately, the motion is on the credibility of politicians and the commitments they make.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688164"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In certain instances, the public is able to understand that something has to give. However, for formal commitments on basic issues such as these, it would have been better if the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> had not made such a commitment. He should have instead promised to work on finding a better solution. That is not the commitment he made to the provinces, which are particularly frustrated. There was also the commitment made to Quebec to do away with the fiscal imbalance. The solution is still not on the table. There is a monetary correction, but no final solutions. Quebeckers are still waiting for a solution to this issue. They will continue to take stock of the effectiveness of the hon. members and the parties in this House, namely on the issue of correcting the fiscal imbalance.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688165"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to have a debate on this motion today because we are talking about the credibility of politicians. We have to be able to make the distinction between keeping a commitment and making proposals as a result of further analysis. In no way can we justify not keeping these formal commitments when there is no good explanation for it. The people in the provinces concerned get the impression they were hung out to dry because the Conservative Party did not keep its election promise.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688166"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a serious warning for the future. This is a minority government that could go to the polls at the drop of a hat. Political parties will continue to make promises. The lesson to be gained from this is that if we wish to maintain our credibility as politicians and political parties, we must not make promises that we cannot keep. </div>
    </p><a name="Para688167"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we be sure that they knew this when they made the promise? That is something we should spend more time considering. All the same, the promise should not have been made. </div>
    </p><a name="Para688168"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, we have been talking about the marked decline in voter participation in the electoral process. Actions like these are damaging. What we are doing today is reminding the government of its responsibilities, and a timely reminder it is, too. However, this reminder is unrelated to the measure in the budget that is a step forward for Quebec.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1125"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1125"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1130"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1120"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1125">(1125)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para688169"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the government will take careful note of the message to be found in the House's vote on this matter. I also hope that, starting now, we can count on the government to keep its promises. If ever it finds that it must change its position on a given measure, I hope that it will be able to justify its action and offer clarification so that the purely partisan tenor of the debate on this issue can be avoided.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688170"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the Bloc Québécois will support this motion because it believes that the government has indeed failed to keep its promises.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the media report on the issues of importance of the day and reach the conclusion that this is a broken promise, it is hard to understand how the government and the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78754,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78754&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Fisheries and Oceans</A> can get up with a straight face and say, “We didn't break the promise.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is so puzzling how the public and everyone has assessed this, and it is objectively determinable what the facts are, and yet a minister of the Crown comes into this place and says something totally different and somehow figures that if he says it often enough people might believe him.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that equalization is a complex concept. There is quite a history behind the evolution of this practice, this distribution of wealth. Above and beyond that, however, a commitment was made by the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> when he was a candidate for election. Basically, his mistake was making a commitment that he was unable to honour afterwards.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688183"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is, people came to realize that the commitment was not necessarily realistic.

Nevertheless, from a political standpoint, the commitment he made should have been honoured. Failing that, a satisfactory explanation should have been given.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688184"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, we do not consider the explanation satisfactory and we see that, throughout all the provinces in question—I was particularly impressed by the testimony given by the Premier of Saskatchewan on this matter—utter frustration abounds. This frustration is due to the fact that the commitment should have been expressed differently. Perhaps he should not have gone so far and should have been less focused on vote-seeking. Ultimately, he should have honoured the commitments he made.</div>

The people decided that they did not want a majority Conservative government because there were not enough guarantees that it was the type of government they were looking for. Furthermore, with a minority government members of the opposition have greater power. They can make presentations and obtain results in the end. We must definitely play a major role as a watchdog.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688189"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take the example of shipbuilding. My riding is near the Davie shipyards. We want to ensure that there is a real shipbuilding policy. We must do some checking to see how far today's announcements will go, and if they go far enough. We also have concerns regarding international agreements. Canada is preparing to sign agreements with several countries. We must ensure, in that regard, that the outcome corresponds to what we hope to achieve—that we optimize manufacturing in Canada, particularly in the area of shipbuilding.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688190"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We travelled around the Maritimes to research this subject. If we can obtain better results, so much the better. The Bloc believes that it has done a very good job with regard to the budget by obtaining part of the solution to the fiscal imbalance. We will continue to work towards a complete solution. </div>

I would urge him to get out the budget document, to look at annex 4 and to read the document, where it states explicitly that these accords are being honoured and that it is the choice of the provinces if they want to move to the other plan.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to start my comments in this debate by picking up where I left off yesterday afternoon in question period, when I made a plea, frankly, in the form of a question. To be accurate, let me quote it:</div>

</div>
    </p><a name="Para688201"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could have said “this betrayal”, but I said mistake, because notwithstanding some of the comments we have heard this morning, this is both a mistake and a spectacular betrayal of a commitment made by the current <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> of this country, who not so very long ago, in a slightly different role in between his political careers, talked about building a firewall around Alberta. The real purpose of that was to communicate to Canadians that just maybe Albertans would want to say, “Let us keep all of the benefits of our resources and let Atlantic Canadians freeze in the dark”. </div>
    </p><a name="Para688202"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That kind of thinking went out in this country a very long time ago, so when the current <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> decided to make a political comeback he had to figure out how to jettison that view of the world, that view of our Canadian world, which was going to haunt him forever. I cannot help but think that part of the reason why he championed the Atlantic accord, in addition to just grubbing for votes in an election, was to try to change his image, to try to change his reputation as a politician in terms of how he viewed the Canada that we have been trying to build for a very long time in this country.</div>

One has to wonder what it is that now has changed his mind so that he has decided to basically break this promise. </div>
    </p><a name="Para688204"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What needs to be understood is what this broken promise is really all about, and I can tell members that it is understood in Atlantic Canada, but I believe it is also understood by people in the most prosperous and more populous parts of Canada. I am going to put it in Maritime terms. What it is really all about is that the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> and his ministers, including the ministers who are supposed to be representing the interests of Atlantic Canada, have decided to turf overboard the Atlantic accord commitment they made because they have other fish to fry and bigger votes to catch, to go after and grub for, in the more prosperous and more populous parts of Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688205"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> should understand that in those more populous and prosperous parts of Canada there are also a great many Canadians of all political stripes, who think that, first, prime ministers should keep their promises and, second, the kind of Canada they want to live in is one where we actually try to find ways to ensure that those who are living with fewer resources and trying to get themselves out of the have not status should be supported. They think that this is the way we want to make Canada work better.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688206"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think he should consider the possibility that there are a lot of Canadians who are going to take the view, whether they live outside of Atlantic Canada or not, that they do not approve of the broken promises and they do not approve of this attempt to block the very purpose of the Atlantic accord, which was to give the possibility and the potential, no guarantee but the possibility, that offshore resource revenues could actually help move Atlantic Canada out of a have not status. It is not just about Nova Scotia and Newfoundland either, because of course what impacts economically on our two provinces impacts on all of the Atlantic region economically.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is accurate to say that Atlantic Canadians feel absolutely betrayed and that there is a sense of the Conservative government breaking faith with Atlantic Canada. Let me just quickly revisit where this Atlantic accord started. Credit should be given where it is due, but there are also political lessons from it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688208"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Premier John Hamm, a Conservative premier, called together representatives of all political parties at the provincial level in Nova Scotia and then called together all political representatives at the federal level. I remember sitting in his office when he put to us the proposition that we work together across party lines and jurisdictional lines. We did that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688209"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the lesson showed was that when all parties work together for the common good, they can achieve things that some might have thought were ridiculous. I remember that the Liberal member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78801,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78801&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Halifax West</A> dumped all over John Hamm's initiative even though he sat around that table and pledged that he would commit to it. He basically said that in the end we just were never going to get agreement on it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688210"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let it not be said that it cannot be done. Do not let them say that it cannot be done, because it was done, by respecting the fact that as elected representatives, whether we are federal or provincial, whatever party we represent, we share a responsibility to all of our citizens. That is why, in the few moments I have left, I want to make a plea that this debate not be about beating up on one another. This debate needs to be about fixing a problem.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688211"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This debate has to send a message, frankly, in part to the premier of Nova Scotia, to tell him to take a lesson out of his own predecessor's book and work across party lines and across jurisdictions to fix this problem. I think it is regrettable that on the three occasions I made representations, through my staff, to the premier's office to say that we would like to have a briefing on exactly where we are with the impact of this broken promise reflected in the budget, on those three occasions we followed up and no such briefing was ever given. There is no way on earth that John Hamm as premier would have failed to bring together the parties that still need to work together to fix this problem.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688212"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is an obvious one: this is a minority government. That is the party, no longer the Progressive Conservative Party but the Conservative Party, that said the wishes of this Parliament should be respected, especially in a minority government. Let us be clear that part of how we got the Atlantic accord in the first place was through cooperation and collaboration. Second, in a minority Parliament, it should be easier to fix it. However, we think the government should step forward, take its responsibility seriously and actually take some leadership to say that this is going to be fixed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688213"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard some members suggest that there is no real loss, that there is no real problem here, and that we are misrepresenting the potential loss to Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador from this broken promise, so let me just quickly give an analogy. It is a bit like Mr. Smith being called in by his boss one day, being commended for the tremendously valuable work he was doing and being told that he is getting a bonus. He is very pleased. </div>
    </p><a name="Para688214"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next year the company is doing very well, partly because Mr. Smith has made such a contribution to improving the lot of that company, and he is told that the good news is that everybody else is going to get a bonus this year because of his good work, but that he may not be as happy because he is not going to get the bonus. Mr. Smith says, “Wait a minute, where is the fairness in that?” He is told that he got a big bonus last year. </div>
    </p><a name="Para688215"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After arguing it out, the boss finally says to Mr. Smith that he actually can make a choice. Either he can give back his bonus from last year and get the same bonus that everyone else is getting, or he can keep last year's bonus and go without this year's.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688216"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an analogy that helps to give an understanding of what this choice is that the Conservative government keeps talking about and that Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador should be happy about. It is analogous to the unfairness of what I have just described between a boss and an employee.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1145"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1145"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1150"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1140"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1145">(1145)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para688217"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us use this opportunity. Let us not allow the Conservatives to say that it is too late. This is something my leader has said again and again when it comes to dealing with tough problems and things people say are impossible. This can be fixed. It is our responsibility to learn the lessons of history and work together to fix it.</div>

    </p><a name="Para688219"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will not be a surprise that in the 1950s the Canadian government concluded an agreement with western Canada, particularly with the province of Alberta, to provide an extra 5¢ a gallon to ensure we could develop the infrastructure in Alberta, which would be good not only for Alberta but for the entire country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688220"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That government and successive governments never abrogated that agreement, recognizing at the same time that the revenues would flow to the provinces and at the same time there would be a subsidy in order to make this infrastructure a reality that we are benefiting from today.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688221"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a question for the hon. member.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is no guarantee of that.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the important debate happening here, as a result of the guts and courage shown by the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78829,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78829&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Cumberland—Colchester—Musquodoboit Valley</A>, it can still be fixed. It is obvious what needs to be done. The Atlantic accord needs to stand, and the new provisions of the equalization formula proposed by the Conservative government in the budget should have no impact. It is as simple as that.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member from Alberta, who refuses to keep his mouth quiet, says that there were no broken promises. If that is the case, is he then saying that Premier Williams, a Conservative; Premier MacDonald, a Conservative; the former minister, Mr. Crosbie, a Conservative; and the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78829,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78829&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Cumberland—Colchester—Musquodoboit Valley</A>, a Conservative; are not telling the truth?

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was not even born in Canada. I was raised in Vancouver and in Yukon but after moving to Nova Scotia I quickly learned one thing about the people in Atlantic Canada. This is no reflection on the people in the rest of Canada. Our former colleague, Mr. Gordon Earle, who was an MP for Halifax West from 1997 to 2000, the first black African Nova Scotian to be elected as a member of Parliament to this chamber, said it very well when he said that a people have their word. The thing I learned was that I could take a Maritimer or an Atlantic Canadian at his word. When an Atlantic Canadian gives his or her word it can be taken to the bank.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688242"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was with the hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78793,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78793&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Halifax</A> and the former premier of Nova Scotia, Mr. John Hamm, who was a Conservative. I did not agree with everything Premier Hamm did but the one thing I have always admired him for and is his grace, his dignity and his ability to work with the official opposition leader, Daryl Dexter, and the NDP, and other people to build the province of Nova Scotia. </div>
    </p><a name="Para688243"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Premier Hamm came to Ottawa I remember being in the parliamentary restaurant with senators and MPs from all parties listening to the proposal by John Hamm. In my case it was the first time that I had heard it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688244"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, knowing the man himself, from the Stanfield tradition of a Progressive Conservative, that we could trust him in what he was saying. After careful reflection afterward and listening to the people of Newfoundland and Labrador and their representatives, we in the NDP very quickly said that this was something we would work with and support the Conservative premiers in achieving the Atlantic accord to give us that leg up, to allow Atlantic Canadians to develop their natural resources, in this case the offshore resources, for the betterment of all people in Atlantic Canada. What is good for Atlantic Canada is also good for the rest of the country.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being an MP in this place for 10 years I can list the litany of broken promises from the Liberals when they were the government but, hopefully, they have learned from that. </div>
    </p><a name="Para688246"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We then had the sanctimonious Conservatives, while in opposition, saying that they would bring Canadians a clean government, an open government, an honest government and a transparent government.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me isolate the Conservatives' broken promise in one very simple little letter that was written on June 28, 2005 to Mrs. Joyce Carter, a widow of one of our heroes, a World War II veteran. Her request was quite dignified, quite right and quite affordable. Her request would actually save the taxpayer money. She asked that all widows and veterans would received the veterans independence program regardless of the time of death or regardless of application.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688248"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposition leader at that time, who is now the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>, wrote in that letter on June 28, 2005, that if the Conservatives form a government, she could be assured that as a Conservative government it would immediately extend the veterans independence program to all veterans and all widows, regardless of application or time of death.</div>

If they can deliberately mislead and betray a promise to a widow of a veteran, can we imagine the broken promise to Nova Scotia—</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sad thing is there are some very good people in that Conservative Party whom I would love to call my neighbour.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me refer to something that is in the <i>Daily News</i> today written by a gentleman named Mr. David Rodenheiser who is a well known columnist of the <i>Daily News.</i> Mr. Rodenheiser is certainly not a New Democrat. I do not think we could accuse him of being a Liberal. Here is what he said about the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> and the Conservative Party, “The Prime Minister's Conservatives area vicious, vindictive—, and I cannot say the last word because it is unparliamentary, but it starts with an <i>l</i> and ends with an <i>r</i> and there are two vowels in the middle. </div>
    </p><a name="Para688261"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is this is what their own commentators are saying now about the Conservatives. It is most unfortunate. We had hoped that there would be openness and transparency, and they would honestly keep their promises. The income trusts promise, gone; VIP promises for widows of veterans, gone; assisted deduction problem for injured soldiers, gone; the excise fuel tax not to raise it above a certain amount, gone; the Atlantic accord, gone.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March, in the federal budget, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland were given a choice. That is the problem. There was not supposed to be a choice. They would have retained the Atlantic accords plus the equalization. There was supposed to be no choice at all between the provincial accords and the old equalization system called the O'Brien formula with a cap on offshore revenues.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It went something like this, “We, the undersigned, residents of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, would like to draw the attention of the House of Commons that in the last federal election the Prime Minister broke his promise”. </div>
    </p><a name="Para688291"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would a petition of this size garner in only a few weeks time? Members probably think a few pages here and there.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are some names that lead the way on this petition, on the very first page, because at times the Conservative Party will say, “Well, this is a partisan issue”. </div>

    </p><a name="Para688294"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three signatures lead the way: number one, Danny Williams, premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Newfoundland and Labrador; followed by Gerry Reid, leader of the opposition, leader of the Liberal Party of Newfoundland and Labrador; the third signature, Lorraine Michael, leader of the New Democratic Party of Newfoundland and Labrador.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interesting thing is that my colleagues from the Conservatives, the three members of Parliament from Newfoundland and Labrador will say that they continue to work on this issue.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now how shameful is that.

It was based on the provinces of Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia having the ability to receive 100% of their offshore revenue without any impact on that equalization agreement or any further equalization agreements after that.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budget 2007 follows through on every commitment of the plan and it goes even further.

It takes another step toward restoring fiscal balance with Canadian taxpayers through major tax reductions and the tax back guarantee. It makes governments more accountable to Canadians by clarifying roles and responsibilities. It strengthens the economic union based on the plan set out in “Advantage Canada”.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget should move forward and not be used for petty partisan games that could result in the loss of funding for important programs to improve the lives of Canadians: $1.5 billion in clean air funding to assist provinces with projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, gone; $225 million in new funding for the Nature Conservancy of Canada to preserve and protect environmentally sensitive lands across the country, gone; $30 million to protect British Columbia's Great Bear Rainforest, gone; more than a billion dollars in health care funding to help provinces reduce patient waiting times and improve the delivery of health services, gone; $614 million in funding for federal-provincial infrastructure projects and labour market training, gone; $30 million in funding for the Rick Hansen Foundation spinal cord injury translational research network to improve the lives of more than 40,000 Canadians with permanent spinal cord injuries, gone; and $135 million in new aid to help the people of Afghanistan rebuild their lives and their country, gone.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am particularly proud to note that our approach to restoring fiscal balance is the result of significant consultations conducted with all of our partners as committed to in budget 2006.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our approach to restore fiscal balance was not conducted in a vacuum. Rather, broad consultations were conducted by the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105827,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105827&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Human Resources and Social Development</A>, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78772,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78772&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Health</A> and the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78771,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78771&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities</A>. </div>
    </p><a name="Para688387"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former minister of intergovernmental affairs' predecessor held face to face meetings with his counterparts between August and November, 2006 seeking views on ways to achieve a balance between a principled based approach to the limitation of the federal spending power and the need to continue to offer and ensure flexibility.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688388"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister sought perspectives on lessons learned from the past, options for future consideration and potential priority areas for action. Written submissions from provinces and territories were also provided. These consultations allowed the Government of Canada to demonstrate to provinces and territories its commitment to a new and open federalism. They also provided an opportunity to obtain provincial and territorial views on ways to achieve enhanced accountability through a clarity in roles and responsibilities of all orders of government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688389"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government took into account all that we gleaned from these consultations and we also committed to returning the equalization program to a principles based, formula driven footing as part of our plan to restore fiscal balance.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688390"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In doing so, we relied extensively on the recommendations of the independent expert panel chaired by Al O'Brien, a former Alberta deputy treasurer.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following extensive consultations, the O'Brien report proposed a comprehensive, principled based set of reforms to the equalization program. As a <i>Globe and Mail</i> editorial pronounced, the O'Brien report “presented a largely acceptable approach to the predicament”, a predicament caused by what <i>The Globe and Mail</i> termed “recklessly” and “dubious meddling” of the old government. </div>
    </p><a name="Para688394"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We reviewed this report and consulted extensively with Canadians and with provincial governments. We have concluded that the O'Brien report forms a solid foundation for the renewal of the equalization program.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688395"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the <i>Toronto Star</i> noted, “the Conservative government is cleaning up the equalization mess the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78571,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78571&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">LaSalle—Émard</A> left behind”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688396"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the new program meets our commitment on fully excluding natural resource revenues from the program. We said that we would exclude non-renewable natural resource revenues without adversely affecting provinces by the changes to the equalization formula, and we did. Budget 2007 delivers on this commitment. </div>
    </p><a name="Para688397"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new equalization program will give provinces the higher of the payments calculated under 50% natural resources exclusion or full exclusion. </div>
    </p><a name="Para688398"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would expect the exclusion of 50% of natural resource revenues to provide higher payments in most cases because it increases the equalization standard. However, this of course depends on resource production, the levels and natural resource prices.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688399"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giving provinces the benefit of full exclusion or 50% exclusion, fulfills the government's commitment to fully exclude non-renewable natural resource revenues from equalization without lowering payments to any province.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688400"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We said that we would respect the offshore accords with Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia, and we did. Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia can continue to get the benefits of their offshore accords and operate under the previous equalization system, ensuring that these provinces continue to receive the full benefit envisioned in these agreements.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688401"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As <i>The Globe and Mail</i> editorial bluntly remarked, there is no cap”. It said that resource revenues were not included when the province's share of equalization was calculated. The article goes on to state:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will conclude my remarks by reminding the member opposite that we do not and we have not abandoned any principles. We have not abandoned the Atlantic accords. Rather, we have taken action on fulfilling our commitments, in an open and principled way, to strengthen our Federation so that government can work in a collaborative way to provide tangible results for all Canadians. </div>
    </p><a name="Para688405"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the members opposite do not believe us, they should listen to what the independent equalization experts are saying, the people who do not have a particular bias, as the former Liberal finance minister would call them. We have people like Thomas Courchene, who rendered a thumbs up to budget 2007 and its major accomplishment to remove the fiscal basis of our Federation from its earlier state of disarray and to strive to reposition Canadian fiscal federalism within a framework of principles, fiscal, institutional and political. </div>
    </p><a name="Para688406"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We just need to listen to the former NDP Saskatchewan finance minister, in that respect an academic, Janice MacKinnon, who lamented the former Liberal government for turning “its back on the long established, formula-driven, rules based process for deciding equalization entitlements in favour of an ad hoc approach”.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1250"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1250"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1255"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1245"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1250">(1250)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para688407"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MacKinnon wants federal-provincial fiscal relations to be put on a more predictable, stable footing and be based on rules and established formulas that prevent the federal government from making ad hoc decisions and, in her words, “the 2007 federal budget goes a long way to achieving this goal”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688408"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us listen to what Al O'Brien, the head of the expert federal panel, had to say. He said, “Budget 2007 adopted our recommendation. Our recommendation is the core framework and I'm really quite encouraged”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688409"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tackling this issue was not easy. It was not a simple proposition. It involved making tough decisions and seeking compromise. Fundamental to the working of any successful federation is compromise or, as MacKinnon put it, “Federal-provincial relations require compromise and a willingness of provinces to look beyond their own provincial borders”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688410"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through our efforts, equalization has been restored to a principles based program after years of ignoring it. Instead of working for partisan interests, we made our decisions in the best interests of all Canadians, including those in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador. That is what all premiers asked and all Canadians expect us to do. We will not apologize for that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688411"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at what we have done and the commitments we have made to each province and territory in this country, it is clear that decisions are not easy and tough decisions are that much more difficult to make. When we look at Newfoundland and Labrador or Nova Scotia, they receive $1.3 billion under the new equalization formula: $130 million in offshore accord offsets, $639 million under the Canada health care transfer and $277 million for the Canada social transfer, which includes additional funding for post-secondary education and child care. Commitments made throughout the country in each province and territory are included in the budget.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688412"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget went through committee and the committee heard from witnesses, including the Saskatchewan premier who was given an hour to ensure he had a full opportunity to present his thoughts and his position on the budget and what he felt it did not include. We did not ignore anyone who wanted the opportunity to speak to this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688413"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what is important at the end of the day is that we have a budget, which the finance committee went through clause by clause. We are debating it in the House today. It should go through the Senate process of being heard but, as I indicated in my speaking notes, there are close to $5 billion worth of priorities waiting.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688414"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that we have put a number to it is important and relevant from a numbers perspective but what needs to be heard is that there are many programs that hinge on that funding to be implemented in this year. </div>
    </p><a name="Para688415"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We obviously look to the leaders in the Senate, the majority of whom are from the Liberal Party, to dedicate themselves, prior to the end of this month, to ensuring the budget passes and becomes law so the expenditures within it can be met, whether they be from one end of the country to the other, for defence, the environment or the investment in the work Rick Hansen has done for decades in this country, which has now been recognized.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688416"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the over 450 presentations at the finance committee, 44 recommendations were put together by all parties and they were given to the finance minister. Many of those recommendations, which were agreed to by all parties, are in the budget, but there are two parties today that are opposed to the budget.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those reasons, I sure hope, while the debate happens and the debate continues, that at the end of the day respect for this process is brought and that budget is passed by the Senate.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the hon. member to answer two questions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688427"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, he talked about the offset payments involved here. However, an independent economist says that over the life of the accords $1 billion will be lost under this formula. How can he justify the offset payments that he talked about, but at the loss of $1 billion over the Atlantic accords, which is fundamentally breaking a promise?</div>
    </p><a name="Para688428"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other issue is this. The member talked about how the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">finance minister</A> and the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> did not break a promise, but yet almost every Atlantic Canada Conservative MP has said that they are continually working behind the scenes to ensure that we get what is right, obviously admitting that it is not right currently as it sits. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I encourage the member not to talk about other aspects of the budget. If he talks about other aspects of the budget, he will fully admit that he has no idea what he is talking about when it comes to the offset payments to the Atlantic accord. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will get back to the point of the accord. There are many things the government left out of the budget, but it will not speak about those parts.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that is not the case. The fact is the accord applies, as it says, to equalization as it exists at the time.

Is that what the government is saying? Is it saying that we cannot have this because we are going to have that?

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two things that everyone in Nova Scotia knows.

It was a signed deal, a signed contract; I know, because I signed it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688467"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing is that the hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78900,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78900&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Central Nova</A> and the hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78823,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78823&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">South Shore—St. Margaret's</A> had the chance to stand up for their province.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know one thing, that voters in Nova Scotia and across Atlantic Canada will remember the lack of support those Conservative MPs from Atlantic Canada showed the region. When the next election is called and the members are out knocking on doors, I think they will hear about it. Voters will remember that the budget betrayal at the hands of the Conservatives may cost my province, for example, $1 billion for things that we need, such as better hospitals, schools, fixing roads and many other important investments. They will remember that those Conservative members of Parliament squandered a deal that gave Nova Scotia 100% of its offshore revenues with no clawback. </div>
    </p><a name="Para688470"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is exactly what those Conservative members promised when they sent out a brochure to Atlantic Canadians a few years ago, which said on its cover, “There is no greater fraud than a promise broken”.

    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para688500"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite serious when we have to stand in the House and make such a resolution about the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>, about his engagement, his respecting of his word. There are institutions that Canadians have to be able to depend on. One is the office of the Prime Minister. While we may debate policy, while we may have different opinions on how to bring the country forward and what the right programs are for our country, we should always be able to depend on the office of the Prime Minister, and that whoever occupies that office at the time will be a person of integrity who is true to his or her word.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688501"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very disappointing that we are in the situation where Canadians cannot trust the office of the Prime Minister because the person who holds the office has shown time and again that his word is completely meaningless. Let us remember back to before the same individual became <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>. He said that supply management was a communist scheme of price fixing. He said that we had to build firewalls around Alberta. On national unity he said he did not care how many national capitals there were, and he now calls himself the great defender of national unity. That is the person in whom we should be able to put our trust and confidence in trying to advance the interests of the citizens of this country and the country's future.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688502"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at the example of the Atlantic accord, I think first we should look at what the accord is. The accord is quite simple. It says that Nova Scotia and Newfoundland shall benefit from 100% of the revenues from their non-renewable resources, in this case offshore oil and gas, to the exclusion of all other programs. That means if there is change in equalization, if there is additional money given in other programs by the federal government to the provinces, that Nova Scotia and Newfoundland would their share and the Atlantic accord is separate from that. It is above and beyond all other programs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688503"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget turns it into an either/or situation. The province of Nova Scotia and its finance minister must decide whether to participate in the new equalization formula which has some advantages for Nova Scotia, or to maintain the Atlantic accord which also has some advantages for Nova Scotia. If Nova Scotia goes into the new equalization formula, the Atlantic accord substantially disappears, the amount of revenue is capped and Nova Scotia stands to lose $1 billion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688504"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some may argue that in the current system the accord is a disproportionate benefit for Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador. Well, perhaps one could make that argument. Perhaps the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> could advance that argument but that is not the argument he advanced during the election campaign. He said in writing and verbally that he would honour the letter and the intent of the accord.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688505"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember when I was on the government side of the House, we presented a budget that included the ways and means to implement the Atlantic accord. The <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> and members of his party, the opposition at that time, asked that we split the bill, that we remove the Atlantic accord from the budget because the intention of the opposition members at that time was to vote against the budget but they wanted to vote in favour of the accord.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688506"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was the very same accord they are now knee-capping. That is pure hypocrisy and it is a betrayal. It is a betrayal to the people of Atlantic Canada and it is a betrayal to the people of Saskatchewan who were promised that they would get 100% of the revenues of non-renewable natural resources outside of the equalization formula.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688507"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was pointed out by the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78975,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78975&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Labrador</A> that we are getting hit now, as will others, each at their time.</div>

That is not what he promised. He promised that there would be 100% exclusion of non-renewable natural resource revenues from the equalization payment and that the accord would be maintained.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was disappointed. I happen to have the privilege of sitting on the finance committee, where we evaluated the budget. Premier Lorne Calvert came before us and made a very good presentation on behalf of his government. I was very disappointed, as was mentioned by the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78801,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78801&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Halifax West</A>, by the relative weakness of the premier of Nova Scotia on this issue. </div>
    </p><a name="Para688510"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that he is in a dire political situation. We see in the polls that he is in third place. There is not a lot of confidence in his government. People are looking for alternatives. Rather than showing strength and fighting for what already has been won by his predecessor, the relative weakness of the premier of Nova Scotia on this issue can be seen. We are not asking for anything new here. We are asking that the Government of Canada honour its commitment. </div>
    </p><a name="Para688511"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That brings me to the second point, which is the institutions. We must be able to trust the Office of the Prime Minister and whoever occupies it, and we also must be able to trust the legacy of the succession of the Government of Canada, in that an agreement signed by one Government of Canada lasts until the end of its natural course. In this case, it would be 2020. An agreement is an agreement is an agreement.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688512"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Premier Rodney MacDonald should accept the invitation of Stephen McNeil, leader of the Liberal Party, to put forward a common front. Although I have not been in discussions with him, I am sure Darrell Dexter would join. We would have a common front with all Nova Scotians fighting for 100% of the Atlantic accord.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688513"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we see and hear in the papers and the media is that there are negotiations happening, and the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78754,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78754&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Fisheries and Oceans</A> mentioned that in question period, negotiations for improvements in the bill presented by the government, but not the 100% retention of the Atlantic accord.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A promise 90% kept or 80% kept or 70% kept is 100% broken. The accord is a signed deal. It should be maintained.

Let us look at our <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>.

They gave that solemn promise to Canadians. Canadians, many of them seniors, were encouraged to invest even more within the income trust sector as they had the promise of the Prime Minister that they would not be taxed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688516"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does he do? At the first occasion, there is a 33% tax and a 100% betrayal of those investors, with $25 billion worth of capital loss, a lot of it in the hands of seniors, either retired or preparing to retire. Let us imagine this. I spoke to some seniors who told me that they went from having a comfortable retirement, and being economically and financially self-sufficient, to poverty, essentially, to sustenance living on small pensions and reduced savings.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688517"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were losing $10,000 to $15,000 of revenue a year. When one's revenue is $35,000 to $45,000, losing $10,000 is a lot. It is huge.

</div>
    </p><a name="Para688538"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois supports this motion because to do otherwise would be to deny the obvious. As we have said in the past, we did not agree with the Atlantic accords in principle, and we still do not agree with them. However, it is perfectly obvious that the government has broken its promise, and we will not argue with that whether we like it or not. No matter what we think of the promise, we do, in principle, agree with the motion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688539"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, this is not the only commitment that this government has broken since coming to power. This government calls itself the “new government” and promised to do things differently from the previous Liberal government. Unfortunately, it seems that the government has learned quickly and has wasted no time following in its Liberal predecessors' footsteps. This government has broken a lot of promises.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688540"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Atlantic accords we are talking about today are a prime example, even though—and I will come back to this later in my speech—we do not agree with these accords and we do not think the government should move forward with them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688541"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to this motion—or at least according to the Bloc's interpretation of it—the government is being criticized for, deliberately or not, making irresponsible election promises. I would hope it did so out of incompetence and not with the deliberate intention of misleading and fooling the electors. The fact remains that a promise was made and it is not being kept. The Bloc Québécois denounces this irresponsible promise.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688542"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the many other areas where the government has not kept its promises is the matter of the seat at UNESCO. Once again, the government is playing with words and repeating the same thing ad nauseam—that it made good on its promises— in the hope that by constantly repeating the same thing, whether it is true or not, the public will believe it one day. That is what happened with the seat at UNESCO.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688543"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the election campaign the Prime Minister promised to give Quebec a seat at UNESCO, like the seat Quebec has in the Francophonie. That is what he said, verbatim, what he repeated, what he wrote down and has never denied. Obviously, when we talk about a seat in the Francophonie, we are talking about a full seat, a voice and a vote. That is what all Quebeckers were expecting. That is what everyone was talking about. The Prime Minister never said to Quebeckers during the election campaign that what he was really promising was a small folding seat, a little stool at the back where they could whisper their agreement, or stay quiet should they disagree. That was never the case.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688544"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Conservative government proposed this accord, it was saying to Quebeckers that it agreed to bring its delegation along, that it would be allowed to participate and give its opinion provided that this opinion fell within the general position of the federal government, or something to that effect.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1340"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1340"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1345"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1335"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1340">(1340)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para688545"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, Quebec would have the right to indicate its agreement, but if it does not agree, it would not be allowed to say so. More importantly, unlike what was promised, Quebeckers would have no right to vote, as it does at the OIF. That is another promise that was completely broken. It is so true that nothing has been done. When the government made that proposal, even my predecessor in Jeanne-Le Ber, who was once the Minister of Canadian Heritage, said that, in any case, that was already how it was done. No one ever stopped Quebec representatives from coming along, sitting in the background and whispering comments. We are really no further ahead. This has been nothing but smoke and mirrors, with basically nothing new to indicate that this promise, giving Quebec the right to vote, will be honoured.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688546"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> resorted to false arguments concerning the issue of Quebec's right to vote, saying that, at UNESCO, only independent states have the right to vote. First of all, with all due respect, I would point out that, when the Prime Minister and the Conservatives made this promise to Quebeckers, they knew that. Second, they could have allowed for a mechanism by which, when the two positions are at odds, Quebec would abstain, which would mean the same result. That is another broken promise. For people in the maritime provinces, there was a broken promise regarding the Atlantic Accords, and for Quebec, it was our seat at UNESCO. Income trusts have been discussed at length in this House. The structure of these income trusts allowed certain legal entities to get out of paying taxes, and we saw more and more businesses convert to income trusts under pressure from their shareholders to pay less tax.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688547"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois had asked for a moratorium on the conversion to income trusts. It has always said that the conversion of businesses to income trusts for tax purposes was not a good thing. This was its position before, during and after the election campaign. Naturally, when the government decided to tax income trusts to partly close this loophole in Canadian taxation, we thought it was a good idea and we supported it. Nevertheless, that was another promise that the Conservatives did not keep. The <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> had personally promised, in black and white, during the election campaign to never—and not just maybe—never tax income trusts. Consequently, some Quebeckers and Canadians, taken in by the Prime Minister, invested in income trusts believing that they would realize large returns. The value of income trusts continued to climb on the premise of the Prime Minister's good faith. The mistake made by these investors was that they probably believed the Conservatives would keep their promise. They did not. The day the government announced that it would put an end to the special tax treatment for income trusts, they dropped sharply in value, placing many investors in very unfortunate circumstances because they suffered huge losses. And all this because the government, to get elected, made unacceptable and irresponsible promises resulting in this situation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688548"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that is not all. Many other promises were broken by this government. I would like to speak in more detail about the promise regarding the fiscal imbalance. This has been a long fight for the Bloc Québécois</div>
    </p><a name="Para688549"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again, the government seems to think that it only has to continue repeating the same thing and the public will end up believing it.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was amazed to see how the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Finance</A> “corrected the fiscal imbalance” in his latest budget. He just tabled a budget, increased cash transfers to Quebec and the provinces and then got up in the House and said that the fiscal imbalance had been fixed. To him, just saying that, despite all the evidence to the contrary, was enough to convince people. When the Conservatives promised Quebeckers to correct the fiscal imbalance, Quebeckers expected that the solution would be along the lines of the consensus that had formed in Quebec, which had been built around the Séguin commission on the fiscal imbalance. When the concept of fiscal imbalance was put forward, the phrase “fiscal imbalance” was not chosen at random, out of a hat, it was chosen deliberately, because there was an imbalance between the federal government and the provinces and this imbalance was fiscal in nature. Otherwise, it would have been called the budgetary imbalance or the monetary imbalance. But it was called the fiscal imbalance. </div>
    </p><a name="Para688551"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Conservatives promised Quebeckers to correct the fiscal imbalance, Quebeckers had reason to expect a fiscal solution. Yet this budget contains no tax measures. I asked the finance committee, officials and the minister himself. The minister admitted quite candidly that his budget contained no tax transfers to Quebec or the provinces. At the same time as he is saying that the budget contains no tax transfers, no tax measures to correct the fiscal imbalance, he is telling us that it has been fixed. Something is wrong there.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688552"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We voted for the budget because it represented a step forward and transferred significant amounts to Quebec and the provinces. But there is no guarantee that those amounts will still be there in one year, two years or three years. Quebec and the other provinces that receive equalization transfers, for example, are still subject to the whims of the federal government. The equalization formula has just been amended, but it could be amended again in the next budget, whether that budget is brought down by this or another government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688553"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quebec wanted financial autonomy, it wanted to receive stable, predictable revenues which would grow over time, and over which it would have control, so that it would not be at the mercy of the federal government's choices. It is so true that the fiscal imbalance is not permanently corrected and that Quebec still depends on the federal government, that even the Conservatives' Quebec advertising says—and I want to get this right—that the Leader of the Opposition, if he became prime minister, could take back the money. This is what the Conservatives are saying. Their advertisements in Quebec say that the fiscal imbalance that they claim has been permanently corrected, could return if another government were elected. This is not a correction. It would have been corrected if tax fields had been transferred, GST for example, to the Government of Quebec. It could have had complete and total control over the revenues, which would be predictable over time, and all this with no chance of the federal government backtracking. It could have been the transfer of tax points, as was done in the past, but this was not the case.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688554"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of promises have been broken by this government, and the government before it. We can objectively say that it is fortunate this is a minority government, because it is breaking just as many promises despite the fact that it is a minority. I cannot imagine what would happen if it was a majority government and could do what it wanted in the House.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today's Liberal motion has the advantage of being a reminder to Quebeckers. They must send as many Bloc Québécois members as possible to Ottawa to ensure that their voice is strong. No matter which party is in power, we are crossing our fingers that it is a minority so that it cannot do whatever it wants.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688557"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have made a list of some election promises broken by the government. I would now like to get down to specifics and talk about the Atlantic accords, which the Bloc Québécois does not agree with. On the one hand, these accords violate the equalization principle, which should ensure that all provinces can offer similar services to all their citizens, with a similar tax rate, regardless of how rich the province is. On the other hand, Quebec has already contributed financially to the development of the fossil fuels industry. Now that this development has taken place, we absolutely do not agree with continuing to contribute to it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688558"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, from 1970 to 1999, Ottawa gave $66 billion in direct subsidies to the fossil fuels industry, including coal, natural gas and oil—an industry that for all intents and purposes does not exist in Quebec. During the same period, a paltry $329 million was given to the renewable energy sector. Of that money, not a penny went to hydroelectricity. While Quebec was investing in hydroelectricity, Ottawa was supporting the development of polluting energy sources instead. </div>
    </p><a name="Para688559"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oil and gas industry was developed in large part with the taxes paid by Quebeckers, even though this development went against the fundamental interests of Quebec, economically or environmentally speaking, since polluting energy sources, as their name suggests, create more pollution. Some $66 billion has already gone toward this development. In the case of Hibernia, we can talk about $5 billion, roughly a quarter of which came from Quebeckers' taxes. Now that we have paid for this development, now that the companies have become profitable and the development of these non-renewable resources has become lucrative for the provinces, Quebeckers are being asked to keep paying for this development? It seems completely illogical to me to give a bonus to provinces for developing non-renewable energies, but not for renewable energies.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688560"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This exclusion of non-renewable resources is completely arbitrary. Why was this choice made when there are hardly any such resources in Quebec and other tax fields could have been excluded? Excluding the aerospace industry, for example, would have benefited Quebec greatly. Excluding renewable energies such as hydroelectricity would also have represented billions of dollars in equalization, but no. Non-renewable resources were chosen and are excluded from the equalization calculation. This seems completely arbitrary and unjustified.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688561"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to close by dispelling a myth I have heard far too often in this House, that Quebeckers were the main beneficiaries of equalization. It is true that the amount is greater. That said, the population of Quebec is larger and, per capita, Quebeckers receive the least amount of equalization. Just take the amount and divide it by the number of people in Quebec.</div>

    </p><a name="Para688595"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are undoubtedly aware of the unfortunate accident that caused the death of two Laval University students on May 28 in Bolivia. The young women were on field training for an agricultural economics course and decided to end their stay with a vacation in a small community. The hotel where they decided to spend the night they died as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning caused by a faulty heating system. </div>
    </p><a name="Para688596"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of these students, Andréanne Lacroix-Pelletier, was the daughter of Hélène Lacroix and Clarence Pelletier, a lung specialist at Hôtel-Dieu Hospital in Lévis. In a cruel twist of fate, these same parents lost their older daughter in January in an automobile accident. They had only these two children.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688597"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit of human solidarity makes it impossible to pass over such circumstances in silence. I wish to extend, on behalf of my colleagues and myself, sincere sympathy and support to these bereaved families.</div>

    </p><a name="Para688604"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals commissioned a report surrounding Status of Women Canada's role.

    </p><a name="Para688605"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Liberals were happy to allow this 30 year old agency to become, as its own officials described it, a relic of the past, it took a Conservative government to modernize the agency, inject new money into programming for women and prioritize areas of concern. </div>
    </p><a name="Para688606"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is true political leadership from a government that knows how to make a difference, a real change from Liberals who are still scratching their heads and telling Canadians, “Do you think it's easy to make priorities?”</div>
    </p><a name="Para688607"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth is out. They were out of touch with women. They could not deliver results but we did. Canadian women deserve better and now they know the truth.</div>

    </p><a name="Para688610"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten communities in my riding, La Ronge, Beauval, Buffalo Narrows, Cumberland House, Île-à-la-Crosse, La Loche, Pinehouse Lake, Sandy Bay, Stony Rapids and Black Lake are involved in the project so far.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688611"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The program allows first nations, Métis and non-aboriginal young people to participate in elected youth councils that run parallel to the local councils and report to them once a month. The goal of the program is to engage a generation of young people in civic issues so that they may encourage their peers to reject crime, substance abuse, vandalism and violence. Some of the project ideas in the various communities include the creation of a youth centre, a skate park and working more closely with elders. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 45 year terms for unelected, unaccountable politicians are simply not acceptable.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the most important initiatives in British Columbia's history and it is crucial to addressing our infrastructure needs in western Canada.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Conservative government backs the Asia-Pacific Gateway. We believe in creating Canadian jobs through world sales.

We can talk about other priorities after we see an indication that it will be heading for royal assent. If we do not have it, it will result in the loss of $4.3 billion in 2006-07 year end measures which include: $1.5 billion for the Canada ecotrust for the provinces; $600 million for patient wait times guarantees; $400 million for Canada Health Infoway; $200 million for protection of endangered species; $30 million for the Great Bear rain forest; $600 million for labour market agreements for the provinces; $30 million for the Rick Hansen Foundation; $100 million in aid for Afghanistan; $100 million to Genome Canada; and so on.

I will rise on a point of order with the understanding that you may decide that it is a question that deals with members' privileges.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688851"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer to a discussion that was held in the House yesterday regarding the motion to concur in the 53rd report of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs which did not receive the unanimous consent of the House of Commons. The four independent members of the House did not give their consent.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688852"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was really no problem until this was presented by the whip of the Bloc Québécois. He presented it to the standing committee, not to remedy the orders of the House but in order to silence a former member of that party because the Bloc considered she was getting too many questions in the House. That was the purpose of this amendment.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688853"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What surprises me is that all the other parties consented to the motion. Every party consented to the motion and it opened a can of worms.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688854"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an issue that the standing committee presented that affects the privileges of all independent members of Parliament.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688855"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I submit that it is in your exclusive jurisdiction to protect the privileges of every member of the House of Commons. I ask that until this matter is resolved, and since there are only four of us but our party is growing, I am asking for your assurance that this matter will not come before the House for unanimous consent unless some of us are present in order not to give consent and then the matter can be resolved either in committee or through your wise counsel.</div>

I know that the whips have discussed looking at clearing this up. Perhaps I could explain it to other members because I think there is a lot of concern not only by the independent members but by others about what it is that the whips and the procedure and House affairs committee are concerned about here.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688861"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I understand the issue, it is this: When there are a number of independent members there are obviously a certain number of questions and Standing Order 31 statements by members that could be assigned to those independent members. </div>
    </p><a name="Para688862"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had cases in the past, and indeed we could have cases in the future, where a party falls below the requisite 12 members. For that purpose there has been a precedent set for Speakers to pool the questions that those independent members would be entitled to so that they could assign their questions to their leader or to some other member of their caucus. </div>
    </p><a name="Para688863"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my political lifetime, members will recall that post-1993, we had that situation with two parties in the House of Commons. While the Progressive Conservative Party and the New Democratic Party were recognized registered political parties outside of this chamber, they did not have the requisite 12 members to be a recognized party in the chamber at the time. One had two members and the other had nine, as I recall. The Speaker at the time pooled, or bundled, or whatever term one wants to use, the number of questions that they would get during question period and then assigned the questions to them as a group.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688864"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this is where the problem lies, Mr. Speaker. Let us take into consideration that there are currently four independent members of Parliament. Of the questions that we usually go through in the rotation, the number of questions in a day, if we divide those, excluding the three that the government gets, by the number of opposition members of Parliament, whether they are one of the three recognized parties or the four independent members, we get to a ratio of how often each member would be eligible for a question, all things being equal.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688865"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem arises if, for example, there were three independent members, each one of them should get one question per week. That makes sense. To make it equal, whether they were in a recognized party or sitting as an independent, they would have exactly the same rights to ask one question per week.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688866"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has been happening as I understand it, Mr. Speaker, is that if you bundle those questions together and there are three questions for independents in a week and then two of the independents choose not to ask a question and you give the other questions to that other member as though they were a party, then that individual independent member would obviously get more questions than they would be entitled to if they sat in a recognized party.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688867"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that is the question that we are trying to deal with. Certainly, and I can speak for myself here, I do not want to see any inequity. I want to see the same rights and responsibilities for every member of Parliament, whether the member is an independent or whether the member sits in a recognized party, with no greater or lesser advantage to being in a party or sitting as an independent when it comes to those rights of a Standing Order 31 statement or asking a question in our chamber.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688868"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the goal is to ensure that if we take that equation, the number of questions asked per day or the number of questions asked per week and divide it by all the opposition members and we get to how many questions that person would get in a week, then it should be the same whether the person is an independent member or in a party.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1515"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1515"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1520"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1510"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1515">(1515)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para688869"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously when a member is in a party, there is a mechanism in place to assign that question. Let us say for argument's sake, every member would get one question per week, whether the member was an independent or was in the Liberal Party, for example. </div>
    </p><a name="Para688870"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously the Liberal Party has a mechanism in place in its caucus to assign those questions to certain members, whether it is the leader, the deputy leader or whoever it is. However, it should not detract from the basic rule that each member is equal in the eyes of this chamber. That is what we are trying to get to, I believe. I would look for others to support that fundamental principle of equality.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask that question deliberately because the Bloc is the party in this House that protects and stands to protect provincial rights.

    </p><a name="Para688895"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general idea is this. Each province's revenues and fiscal capacity are examined and compared to the Canadian average. Provinces whose fiscal capacity is below the Canadian average receive funds from the federal government to bring them up to the average. That is the principle.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688896"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem lies in how fiscal capacity is calculated. Under the Atlantic accords, the fiscal capacity of the Atlantic provinces is underestimated to make them appear poorer than they are, when the calculation is done, so that they receive more money than they would normally get if the principle were honoured.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688897"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois believes that this has nothing to do with ensuring that the Canadian federation works well. Rather, it is a purely arbitrary choice. The government decided to exclude non-renewable natural resources simply because that favoured a few provinces. It could have excluded other sectors of the economy that would have benefited Quebec.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688898"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that if the government had decided to exclude hydroelectricity and aerospace, for example, from the equalization calculation, many people would have stood up and asked why the government was deviating from the principle just to please Quebec. And they likely would have been right.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688899"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that the same rule should apply to everyone. If we are going to compare the provinces' fiscal capacities, we have to do so without playing with the figures, without excluding one sector or another of the economy to benefit one province or another.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688900"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, equalization has nothing to do with the fiscal imbalance because equalization is a budget transfer. With the latest equalization formula and other transfers, the Government of Quebec receives more money than before. This does not correct the fiscal imbalance, because it is not a real transfer of tax room, such as the GST or tax points. </div>
    </p><a name="Para688901"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the next budget, the federal government can take back what it gave to Quebec, as it just took back what it had given to the Atlantic provinces. This shows that the problem of the fiscal imbalance has not been resolved at all. Even though we do not basically agree with the Atlantic accords, they are eloquent proof that, in a system based on equalization, the provinces are all at the mercy of the federal government’s benevolence at any given time for their finances. That is what we do not like and have been fighting for a very long time. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know about the previous government's tenure, but I know he is going to speak about the province of Quebec. However, it applies to all provinces. Because of the fiscal imbalance, how difficult was it for provinces to provide health care, education, post-secondary education, in addition to other types of strains? Why is it important to have a principled approach toward fiscal balance in Canada in order to provide capacity to the provinces to provide these services?</div>

For 13 years, the Liberal government did not even recognize the existence of a fiscal imbalance, and the Liberal Party still does not recognize it. They refuse to admit that there is a fiscal imbalance. People say that Quebec and the provinces have been hard hit by this, but it is really the people of Quebec and the provinces who have suffered. We cannot say that it is just the provinces and so we do not really care. People have gone without services because of the imbalance between the constitutional obligations of the federal and provincial governments and their respective revenues.</div>

This means that, every year and for every budget, Quebec is ultimately at the mercy of the ideological and political choices that the federal government may make in light of the political situation at the time, regardless of whether the Conservatives, the Liberals, or some other party is in power. </div>
    </p><a name="Para688906"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the nub of the problem. That is why Quebeckers of all political stripes in the National Assembly, regardless of whether they are Liberals, ADQ or Parti Québécois, are demanding a genuine fiscal solution. That was the thrust of the Séguin commission which asked, for example, that the GST be transferred to the provinces. Equalization would have to be re-worked, of course, if the direct transfers to the provinces were cut by this much. If there is a tax transfer to the provinces, however, they will have stable, predictable revenues over which they have full control and which are not subject to every whim of the federal government. </div>
    </p><a name="Para688907"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is really the nub of the issue. The Liberals have never even acknowledged the existence of a fiscal imbalance, and even though the Conservatives acknowledge it in theory, they still do not understand the real nature of it. We are working hard to get this fixed in the next budget. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am pleased today to debate this issue and I will focus most of my remarks on the Atlantic accord aspect of the debate today. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to address the comments made by the very distinguished member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78709,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78709&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Edmonton—Leduc</A> who tried to provide the perspective perhaps from Alberta. However, the part of the debate that I am focused on is not whether equalization is right or wrong or what is best for this province or that province. My focus is on the fact that I think the Government of Canada should honour a signed contract.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688947"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that when the Government of Canada signs a contract this should be gold-plated. It should be bulletproof. When the Government of Canada signs its name, with the little red flag, on a piece of paper, whether it is a person in Tokyo, in Moscow, in Halifax or in St. John's, Newfoundland, the person should be able to count on that signature as being solid gold.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688948"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contract we are talking about today, the one that has been amended so much in the budget, Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2801101,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2801101&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-52</A>, was only signed in 2005. It is a 14-year contract signed by the Government of Canada and the Province of Nova Scotia. We are only two years into the contract and the government has decided it does not like it. Consequently, the government has put 12 amendments in the budget. I want the members opposite to notice, because what they say is not accurate, but under consequential amendments there are 12 paragraphs of amendments to the Atlantic accord.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688949"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we go further, there are six paragraphs of amendments to the offshore revenue agreement that John Hamm signed two years ago in 2005. The government is now taking the contract signed by the Government of Nova Scotia and the Government of Canada and amending it with six fundamental changes to the contract. This is simply right or wrong and I think every Canadian has an interest in this. This is not just in the interest of Nova Scotia or Newfoundland. Every member of Parliament in this House should insist that if the Government of Canada signs a document, no matter if it is a Liberal government, a Conservative government, an NDP government or, heaven forbid, a Bloc government, the Government of Canada should honour the contract, no matter what, for the life of the contract. It is not flexible and it is not amendable.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do want to say that it is a good budget and it is good for my riding. Many things in the budget do support and help my rural riding. However, that does not give the government permission to break a contract. Just because the government does some good things, it does not give it permission to break a contract. My opposition to the budget and the reason I voted against it was that I am 100% convinced that the budget does break this contract.</div>

I am going to start speaking out publicly”. He took exception to that. I said, “We have to put pressure on it to make it move ahead”. I gave it to him in writing. I did not want to broadside him. I waited two days and then I made my first statement. Again, we made no progress.</div>

If the Atlantic accord were honoured, it would get the $95 million, plus the benefits of the offset that are not included in this. That is the fundamental part of the problem. </div>
    </p><a name="Para688959"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe the Atlantic accord could be changed with four or five words. The problem is that the budget and the accord have different wording. I have pointed this out to the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> and the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">finance minister</A> several times. The accord says that the calculation of the payment will be based on the equalization formula that exists at the time. Any time the Government of Nova Scotia wants to calculate its offset payment, it would use the equalization formula that exists at the time. </div>
    </p><a name="Para688960"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if we change it in 2010, it is that formula. If we change it in 2015, it is that formula. If we change it in 2019, it is that formula. That is what the accord says, which is a signed agreement and agreed to by both sides.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688961"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if we go to page 115 in the budget, it says that from now on it will be based on the previous formula. Instead of the vision of the accord, which is to follow along as the equalization formula evolves and changes, the budget locks it in at the previous formula. It, therefore, amends and changes the Atlantic accord fundamentally. </div>
    </p><a name="Para688962"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Finance</A> today if he would stop saying that Nova Scotia has the option of the new formula or the old Atlantic accord, because it does not. He said it a thousand times. Many of the ministers have. I said it myself, because I believed it, until I got into this. However, it is not true. The Province of Nova Scotia and the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador do not have the option of the new formula or the old Atlantic accord. Everybody in this House has heard the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Finance</A> say that a dozen times. It is not true because the budget changes both Atlantic accord agreements. Twelve paragraphs in the accord are changed and amended and six paragraphs on the John Hamm agreement that was negotiated in 2005. </div>
    </p><a name="Para688963"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government wants to be honest and accurate, it should say that the Province of Nova Scotia has the choice of the new formula or an amended Atlantic accord, but that it does not have access to the old Atlantic accord.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688964"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had hoped the minister would take my advice and be accurate and say that if that is the case. When I asked that question, he pointed out that I said that the budget was good. I did say the budget was good and that it was good for my riding but it does not give anybody the right to break a contract. We all sign contracts and we all honour them. All Canadians honour contracts. The Government of Canada should honour its contracts, no matter who signs them, whether it is the Liberals, the Conservatives, the NDP or whichever party is the government at the time. I feel very strongly about that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688965"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will go back to this nine paragraph agreement called the Atlantic accord. It was signed and agreed to by John Hamm and the very distinguished minister of fisheries and oceans at the time, the member from Halifax. It is a simple agreement but a very meaningful one to Nova Scotia. </div>
    </p><a name="Para688966"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newfoundland and Labrador has a similar agreement and it means the world to Newfoundland and Labrador, as it does to Nova Scotia. </div>

This is our special deal and we value it tremendously. </div>
    </p><a name="Para688968"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We just signed an agreement with British Columbia to give it hundreds of millions of dollars for the Pacific Gateway. Manitoba did not get a Pacific Gateway fund, neither did Ontario nor did Digby.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688969"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nova Scotia's special deal is the Atlantic accord and we are not flexible on it. We will continue to demand the Atlantic accord. It is only nine paragraphs long but it is a work of art. I did not realize how good it was until we got into this debate and I started to study it. It is really neat. I was moved to call John Hamm, the former premier of the province, because it is magic. I sold cars for 20 years and made a lot of deals but I could not make a deal as good as this one. It is an excellent deal and John Hamm deserves the credit.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John Hamm also agrees that this budget changes the purpose, the intent and the spirit of this agreement. I have great faith in John Hamm and his comments on it.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the member has been carrying around for weeks a copy of the offshore accord and he referred to it at some length in his recent comments. I know he is aware that it talks about the fact that it is to apply to the equalization formula as it exists at the time. It seems to me, as I have heard comments from Conservative members today, that there has been a failure to comprehend that, a failure to comprehend what the accord is actually all about and what it means. The fact that no matter how equalization might change in the future, the accord and its provisions and the payments under it were to apply so that there would not be a clawback of offshore resource royalties from Nova Scotia or Newfoundland and Labrador.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there has been a failure to understand that on the other side but it is time they did. It is time that they lived up to this signed agreement. The member is absolutely right when he says that when the Government of Canada signs a contract it should live up to it. I signed that contract on behalf of the Government of Canada, as he has pointed out to me a few times, and it is time for the government to live up to it.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we sat together with John Hamm, the premier of Nova Scotia at the time, he expressed some reservations quite openly. What we saw is that the more people did get their head around what it really meant for Nova Scotia, then none of us was prepared to take no for an answer if working across party lines and across jurisdictional lines we could actually get the Atlantic accord into an agreement that would be honoured by the Government of Canada.</div>

    </p><a name="Para688980"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question arises out of the response that was very clear from Nova Scotians yesterday to the gutsy stand that the member took in saying that he could simply not live with the broken commitment. There was an actual accord that needed to be honoured and he could not live with any other outcome.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688981"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was also struck by the fact that Premier Rodney MacDonald made it very clear in his commentary to the media, and I have no reason to think it is not accurate reporting because I read it again and again, that he also acknowledges that this is a broken promise, that it is not fixed and that there is no offer on the table to fix it. I want to know whether the member has any advice for the rest of us on how we can work together to support the current premier in trying to get this fixed and what efforts he has made and to what effect.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a 14 year contract was signed. We were only into it for two years. The government has decided it wants to change the contract without the permission of the Nova Scotia government. The government has 18 paragraphs of amendments in the budget, which unilaterally change this agreement. I think that not only we in the House but every Canadian should say that we want every contract signed by the Government of Canada to be honoured 100%. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not just Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador, it is our reputation as a country.

I have listened carefully to remarks today, many of which were aimed at me. That is the slings and arrows of this place, Mr. Speaker, as you know full well having served here for so many years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688987"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did find myself curiously agreeing with some of the comments by my colleague from Halifax, though. She quite rightly pointed out, when she asked a question a moment ago, that the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78801,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78801&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Halifax West</A> could be described as somewhat of a recent convert of the Atlantic accord. During the time he filled the post as minister for Nova Scotia, the post I currently hold, he was pushing the province of Nova Scotia to accept a deal that was not in the best interest of my province.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688988"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember at the time the member from Halifax said, “If Nova Scotians were as wealthy as Ontarians in eight years time I don't believe they would be expected to keep getting equalization”. He said this on October 26. This was in advance of the Atlantic accord being signed. He also urged the minister of energy at the time, Cecil Clarke, to accept the deal, that it was an excellent deal for Nova Scotia. Yet the numbers now clearly show that at the time the offer that was put forward by the member from Halifax was for $640 million. We know the final deal that was arrived at with Nova Scotia was for $830 million. Therefore, he was bargaining hard for his province, my province, to take hundreds of millions of dollars less than it actually achieved. </div>
    </p><a name="Para688989"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what he had to say at the time, “I can't imagine for the life of me why Nova Scotia would not accept a deal this rich”. In October 2004 he told the Halifax <i>ChronicleHerald</i>, “They're turning up their noses at an excellent offer. I really can't understand why they're not agreeing to it and why they're so hung up on this question of eight years”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688990"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member can be here today and sanctimoniously hold himself out as a champion of this cause, but at the end of the day he really had to be brought on side by the pushing and prodding of the premier of the day, John Hamm, as has been mentioned, who truly was the champion of the Atlantic accord, along with Cecil Clarke, the energy minister.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688991"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78571,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78571&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">LaSalle—Émard</A>, the Liberal leader and prime minister at that time, and the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78938,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78938&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">West Nova</A> all voted against the motion in the House recognizing the Atlantic accord, all recognizing at that time that Nova Scotia should be the primary beneficiary of offshore oil and gas revenues. That is what they did. On November 15, 2004, I was here as were you, Mr. Speaker. There was a motion before the House that you and I both supported. They voted against it. Every member in the Liberal Party who has spoken today, with the exception perhaps of the not so newly elected member, who was not here in 2004, voted against the Atlantic accord.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688992"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I will not take any lessons or any sanctimonious, disingenuous, holding themselves out as champions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688993"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really about, when we strip away the rhetorical flourish, when we take away some of the contrasting views of a contract and when we strip away the discussion of what this comes down to, it is about equalization for the country, an offshore oil and gas revenue deal that was put in place to insist that Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador in a similar vein receive primary benefits of their offshore oil and gas.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688994"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People have talked about special deals. This is not a special deal. This is the same sort of deal, others have mentioned this, historically in the context as Alberta enjoys with respect to their underground oil and gas. The Auto Pact could be singled out for the province of Ontario as something specific to it. Quebec has similar deals, one in fact that affects Newfoundland and Labrador, which is quite contentious. That is of course Churchill Falls.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688995"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, this is about ensuring fairness. That is exactly what we intend to do. The budget is exactly about that. Liberals have repeatedly refused in the past to recognize accords such as this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688996"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill itself, when it finally came to fruition, when it finally came before the House, put in place a recognition of natural gas revenues that were to come to the province of Nova Scotia.</div>
    </p><a name="Para688997"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fast forward to what we have in the budget. After 13 years of the Liberal government denying that there was fiscal imbalance in the country, our government immediately upon taking office, under the leadership of the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Finance</A> and the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>, went about consultation with the provinces to see that fiscal imbalance did exist. A lengthy, indepth and complex discussion took place about how we set the fiscal imbalance right.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am a member from Nova Scotia. That is my home, that is where I was born and raised and that is where I will retire. I will always be there. The member opposite, who is also from my home province, can try to beat his chest, put on floppy shoes and a red hat and try to be clown, but that is not going to get him anywhere. People at home know this is a serious issue. If he wants to make it personal, that is fine, that is his right. He can continue in that vein. </div>
    </p><a name="Para688999"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are here to talk about a serious issue. This is a serious issue that affects my province. It affects very much the well-being and the future of the province of Nova Scotia. That is why I have undertaken to continue in the same vein as the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">finance minister</A>, to meet directly with the Premier of Nova Scotia, the premier who is now charged with protecting Nova Scotia's interests, as do I. I stand shoulder to shoulder with him in that exercise.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689000"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We met this morning and we have spoken in the past repeatedly, since the budget came down, about how we protect Nova Scotia's interests and how we do so together. That is exactly what we are doing. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689001"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is very much about clarifying our commitment with respect to the Atlantic accord. This is about ensuring the implementation of the new O'Brien equalization formula, which is the option for which Nova Scotia has opted. This formula benefits my home province to the extent of $95 million more. That allows us to put more money into education, infrastructure, health, all sorts of important life altering and quality of life aspects. It has allowed Premier MacDonald and the provincial government make those investments.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689002"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to some of the apocalyptical discussion here about how Nova Scotia was going to be forced into financial ruin, the budget provides Nova Scotia with $2.4 billion in the year 2007-08, $130 million in offshore accord offsets, $639 million in Canada health transfers, $277 million in Canada social transfers with respect to post-secondary education and child care and the list goes on. Millions of dollars are going into the Nova Scotia economy. All of that is buttressed with an additional $95 million that is coming from the federal government this year. That is what members opposite are voting against.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689003"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should have indicated at the start, Mr. Speaker, that I will be splitting my time with the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78678,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78678&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Edmonton—Spruce Grove</A>, who is the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105831,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105831&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs</A>. She will be giving a riveting speech, as she has in the past, with respect to how the province of Alberta is very much in concert with the province of Nova Scotia on the recognition of offshore oil and gas revenues. She, as do all members of the Conservative caucus, wants to see that Nova Scotia is treated fairly. They want to know that we will be treated the same way in Atlantic Canada as the west was during the period in time it was developing its natural resources.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689004"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is all about that. The offshore oil and gas revenue stream is protected, it is intact and it is whole. That is the intent and the spirit of what has taken place. That was the commitment that was given by the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to acknowledge my colleague opposite, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78829,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78829&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Cumberland—Colchester—Musquodoboit Valley</A>, who has been a long-serving member of this place, a hard-working member here in Ottawa and in his constituency. He is a well respected friend, and I say that with great earnest. I feel very badly for the position he finds himself in because he is sincere and pure of heart in what he believes he has done. What is unfortunate is he is not among us. He is not here now to continue these discussions on behalf of the government in dealing directly with the province of Nova Scotia. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our colleagues from St. John's, our colleagues from New Brunswick, our colleagues from Newfoundland and Labrador, have been closely involved and work diligently to see that Atlantic Canada is treated fairly, that their provinces are treated fairly and that they receive a fair share of equalization and a fair share of offshore oil and gas revenue.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the people of Nova Scotia, that is the critical issue. We can talk about caps and O'Brien formulas, and changes to the offshore and transfers. What they know and what they need to know is that, as a result of this budget, my province, the province of Nova Scotia, will receive $95 million more than it did last year. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689008"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That has allowed my home province to balance the budget this year and to move forward on other important projects. We will continue to work with it, as we did with ecotrust announcements, as we did with health arrangements, and as we continue to work toward an important infrastructure deal as regards to transportation and ports in the province of Nova Scotia.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689009"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am committed to that. No one has to remind me of my obligations or responsibilities to the people of Central Nova and the people of Nova Scotia whom I represent.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The members opposite have their views on this. What I know is that I have been working in a very productive and positive way with the premier of Nova Scotia. He continues, of course, to stand up for and bring a very positive and patient attitude to this discussion, and to that extent, I want to thank--</div>

Why was the member opposite misleading the people of Nova Scotia by trying to represent that budget deal that was not a good deal, that would have cost our province hundreds of millions of dollars? He championed that cause. He repeatedly publicly urged our province to sign onto a deal that would have cost us hundreds of millions of dollars. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that he is voting against a budget that will give the province $95 million more, so he can talk about the past. He can talk about the future. What is happening here is that he is voting against the interests of the people of Nova Scotia. He in fact broke his word to the people of Nova Scotia when he tried to surreptitiously get them to sign onto a deal that would have cost them hundreds of millions of dollars. That is not good representation for the people of Halifax or the people of Nova Scotia.</div>

    </p><a name="Para689022"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Atlantic accord anticipated precisely the situation in which we might find ourselves today, and that is precisely why the accord explicitly says in clause 4 that Nova Scotia does not have to choose.

    </p><a name="Para689023"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accord has been broken, and so no matter how many times the government says Nova Scotia is going to get more benefits, the issue is not whether there are going to be more benefits, the issue is whether Nova Scotia is going to end up being forced to make a choice where it would in part forfeit benefits that were promised. There was never any understanding that the government would end up forcing Nova Scotia into making this choice.</div>

First, I would disagree that Nova Scotians would not want more money. That in fact, given the choice to receive $95 million more, they would say “yes, we would prefer to have the $95 million more”. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689025"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that there would be more money in fact again next year. That is also an option. There is flexibility here and there has been a choice offered. The province of Nova Scotia chose to take more money, which is a wise choice, I would submit.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689026"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the member's comments about equalization and how in fact the province of Nova Scotia will benefit, it is clear the province will benefit. It is clear that our province, sadly a have-not province, is in need of the fiscal support that it receives from Ottawa. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689027"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been a lot of glossing over of fact here, trying to suggest somehow that Nova Scotia was going to come out at the short end of the stick, that it was going to receive less. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689028"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not heard a single member from any opposition party take issue with the fact that the province is getting more money. That is what it boils down to. That is, by the way, what equalization is meant to do. It is meant to recognize the circumstances that exist in regions such as ours. It is meant to give people in Nova Scotia an opportunity to stay and work, and be in their communities and towns and cities, rather than have to take the option to go out west to work.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689029"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope to see the day when the trend is reversed and Nova Scotians and Atlantic Canadians are coming home in droves because there will be jobs there. That is what our government intends to do. We intend to work toward that day when we will see the jobs, opportunities, and prosperity available in our province of Nova Scotia as it is elsewhere in Canada.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When our government assumed its role, it made a commitment to promote open federalism. In our 2007 budget, we kept this promise and announced a long-term plan to restore fiscal balance within the federation. Our plan responds to the concerns of all Canadians, the provinces and the territories.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para689032"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take a moment to note just how far we have come in 16 months. This government inherited an equalization program that was divorced from principle. It also did not suit the demands of the day and our federation. It was obvious that federalism was not functioning as it should. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689033"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous Liberal administration did not even give a thought to tomorrow or to the future of the provinces. The approach that it used was stagnant and unresponsive to the changing needs of Canadians and to the changing needs of the provinces. What we saw with the previous Liberal governments for years was what we call “chequebook federalism”.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para689034"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is when the concept of open federalism was born. Under this concept, the federation is no longer an inactive entity, but an evolving institution that has to adapt to the changes and impacts of the modern world.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para689035"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government has already taken tangible measures to ensure, for example, that Quebec has the tools that it needs to develop within a united Canada, the recognition that the Québécois form a nation within a united Canada and the restoration of the fiscal balance. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689036"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the historic presence of Quebec at the Canadian delegation to UNESCO is a concrete example of that commitment. Open federalism demands that we recognize the maturation and the evolution of the provinces within our federation.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para689037"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This concept recognizes the important and precise role the provinces must play in developing national policy.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para689038"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was clearly a time for a new approach to federalism, one that we believe could accomplish, among other things, ensuring a return to a principled based approach to federal fiscal transfers and recognizing, of course, the evolving nature of the federation. We believe in the need to capitalize on the strengths the provinces have to the benefit of all of Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689039"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was with great pride that I watched the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Finance Minister </A> deliver his budget in the House last March. Budget 2007, of course, was described as a historic agreement and with very good reason. I am particularly proud to note that our approach to open federalism and restoring fiscal balance is the result of significant consultations with all of the provinces and territories, as we committed to last year in our budget 2006.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689040"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was in the spirit of open federalism that we worked with every province and territory, and we sought their views on ways to help achieve a balance between a principled based approach to the limitation of our spending powers and the need to ensure flexibility in our country. We sought their perspectives on lessons learned from the past, options for future consideration, and potential priority areas for action for the future.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689041"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we have to be clear about where we were when our government came to power. Canada was in a situation where the Liberal approach to equalization created, as we know, division between the federal and provincial governments, and between the provinces, particularly between different regions of our country. We saw this clearly in the inability of the Council of the Federation to come to any sort of consistent position on equalization.</div>

    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para689043"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We provided an opportunity to provinces and territories to share their views on ways to achieve enhanced accountability. We committed to returning the equalization program to a principled based, formula driven plan to restore the fiscal balance.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689044"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The equalization formula, as we know, was thoroughly studied by an independent expert panel that was chaired by Al O'Brien, in fact a former Alberta deputy treasurer. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689045"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The O'Brien report proposed a comprehensive principled based set of reforms to the equalization program. We reviewed this report and we consulted extensively with Canadians and with provincial governments. We concluded that the O'Brien report formed a solid foundation for the renewal of the equalization program.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689046"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we know, in our budget 2007, we finally tackled the longstanding irritant of provinces called double equalization by committing finally to a principled move to per capita health and social transfers. With this move we clearly demonstrate a principle that the equalization formula itself is meant to address interprovincial and interregional disparities, while other federal transfers, like health and social transfers, should ensure equal treatment of Canadians in all parts of our country. We also advanced the principles of transparency and accountability.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689047"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we know, the provinces have responsibilities and ultimate accountability in their own fields and in their own areas of jurisdiction, while the federal government offers clear and predictable support to them. By providing equitable and predictable funding for shared priorities and attempting to clarify the roles and responsibilities in our federation, we have offered a solid, principled based approach on which government can continue to work into the future.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689048"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This commitment was a reassertion of the benefits that can be found in a flexible federation that, of course, allows our diversity to serve as a source, both of strength and innovation, a reassertion of the need for an open, honest and respectful relationship with the provinces, and a reassertion that true collaboration can really only take place when resources and accountability are matched with responsibility.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689049"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned earlier, our second major policy goal for our approach to open federalism is to identify and facilitate opportunities for provinces to play a greater role in our own jurisdiction, the federal jurisdiction, when our moves and actions actually impact on provincial jurisdiction.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para689050"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our opinion, the provinces have various means available to them to play a more active role on the national and international stage for the good of the federation.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para689051"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that by identifying strategic opportunities to work with the provinces, seizing these opportunities, and responding with a readiness to work collaboratively will benefit the entire country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689052"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, now the question, both for the provinces and for the federal government, is which opportunities and when. We have already started to capitalize on those.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689053"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We committed in our 2006 election platform to find those kinds of practical ways to facilitate provincial involvement in areas of federal jurisdiction when provincial jurisdiction is affected, and the Quebec participation at UNESCO is a perfect example. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689054"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we wrote that policy, what we had in mind is this kind of identification of clear, practical opportunities like that where the federal government could work with the provinces in areas of mutual interest.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689055"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will conclude my remarks proudly stating that we continue to live by those principles.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the O'Brien commission came back with its report, it recommended a number of changes to the equalization formula to return it to a principle based approach. The reason for that was so we would not have the Liberal approach to chequebook federalism, pitting provinces against provinces, pitting regions against regions to the detriment of the federation. A principle based approach brings back the best for all regions of this country in a fair approach.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the member knows, these key changes to the equalization formula are in the best interest of the entire federation. These include a 10 province standard and that provinces can opt for an equalization payment formula. Provinces have a choice, as the member knows, which is what would affect Newfoundland and Labrador. It has a choice to either have a payment formula that would be based on the full exclusion of natural resources or it could move to a formula that contains 50% exclusion, whatever it wishes to do and whichever formula is in its best interest.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am quite pleased today to speak on the subject of equalization. I am pleased because this debate affords me the opportunity to speak about this important topic while raising issues such as fairness, justice, truthfulness and honesty. Some people might argue that terms such as these may be a bit flowery for the often arcane statistical language one uses when speaking about Canada's complex equalization formula. The precise details are well known to those of us who deal with the minutiae of government policy on a day to day basis, but these details may not be known to the average Canadian.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regular folks do not have the time to pore over the thousands and thousands of pages of information on government programs produced by our country's hard-working public servants. Regular folks are more concerned with working hard, making sure that their children and grandchildren grow up with good values so that they too may some day contribute in meaningful ways to their communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689086"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regular folks expect their elected officials to do the monotonous work of combing through the endless documents to make sure that nothing is lost in the fine lines and they expect their public officials to do this in a fair, just, true and honest manner. Regular folks in Saskatchewan in most instances probably could not quote the precise numbers of the equalization formula, but regular folks in Saskatchewan know that a promise is a promise and that the Conservative government has broken far too many of them.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I am pleased today to speak on this subject, I must admit that I get no pleasure in seeing the way the Conservative government has treated Saskatchewan's share of equalization in the last budget. I would like to take a brief moment to quote Premier Lorne Calvert's testimony to the Standing Committee on Finance last week. He said:</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Calvert went on during this testimony to outline promises from the 2006 Conservative election platform which restate the same promises that he received in the 2004 letter from the then leader of the opposition and now our <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689090"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether here in Ottawa or at home in Saskatchewan, Mr. Calvert has been a tireless crusader advocating fairness for Saskatchewan in equalization at every opportunity. While I may not agree with the New Democratic premier of Saskatchewan and many of his ideological positions, as a proud resident of that great province I admire his tenacity and the way in which he represents honesty and integrity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689091"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some have argued that his campaign is to bring attention to the Conservative government's betrayal of Saskatchewan as simple posturing, an attempt to shift attention away from his own government's issues and place blame on Ottawa's politicians. Like some of my colleagues in the House, I certainly would not try to know the thoughts or motivations of Mr. Calvert, but I am proud to say that I agree with his logic on this issue 100%.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689092"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simply, a promise was made to Saskatchewan and a promise was broken to Saskatchewan. It appears as though promises were made to Canadians and to the people of Saskatchewan simply to mislead for political gain. When a political party or a government misleads the electorate, the political games are short-lived. Canadians do not like to be used for a political party's or MP's personal gain.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689093"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am disappointed in what I have heard coming from the Conservative Party's Saskatchewan members of Parliament when this subject is discussed. Never in my time in public life, whether here in Ottawa or in first nations government and education have I been a witness to such deceit and breach of trust when people are placed in a position of prominence whereby their actions could help raise awareness of a great injustice and yet decide to sit mutely and do as they are told. Indeed it is a great tragedy.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Promises were made to the people of Saskatchewan by the Conservatives regarding the equalization formula, promises that were wilfully not kept, promises to remove non-renewable resources from the formula, promises not to claw back resource revenues and promises to ensure that as Saskatchewan further develops its resources its residents are not penalized for their success. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some ways Saskatchewan has had a rough go of it in recent times vis-à-vis its neighbours, especially Alberta and British Columbia. There was a time not so long ago that Saskatchewan was the third most populous province in this great country. Decades of stagnation, out-migration and systemic changes in the agricultural economy have led to Saskatchewan's designation as a have not province more often than not, but this does not have to be a sad story.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am proud to report that Saskatchewan is on the cusp of a major comeback focused on two important factors: our wealth of natural resources and our emerging competitive advantage brought about by unique and exciting demographic factors in the form of our fastest growing youthful aboriginal population.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689097"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the Conservative government in a remarkably short period of time has taken steps to slow Saskatchewan's comeback through these broken promises which will adversely affect the amount of fiscal benefit derived from our natural resources.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We spent decades struggling to transition Saskatchewan out of its have not status toward have status. It is very simple to understand that non-renewable resources are non-renewable. Once they are gone, they are gone forever. Saskatchewan wants to keep the fiscal benefit derived from its non-renewable resources to build a stronger Saskatchewan, a strong, vibrant and viable economy that would entrench Saskatchewan as a have province for decades to come and at the same time make Canada stronger.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689099"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the federal government has done is put the long term socio-economic viability of Saskatchewan at risk. I know Saskatchewan very well and this deceit from the Conservatives is a huge blow. It is a huge blow that is compounded by another betrayal. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689100"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cancellation of the Kelowna accord harms the potential of our other underutilized natural resource, our first nations and Métis young people. The Conservative government has purposefully disadvantaged Saskatchewan. I believe it does not even have a clue or even understand what it has done to hurt Saskatchewan. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689101"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kelowna accord was a necessary first step that would have worked toward closing the gaps between aboriginal and non-aboriginal Canadians in areas such as poverty, housing, education and health.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689102"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous Liberal government, the provincial and territorial governments and aboriginal governments all agreed Kelowna was a historic event and yet the Conservative government dismissed and betrayed first nations, Métis and Inuit people across this country. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689103"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saskatchewan's lost share of Kelowna was projected to be in the neighbourhood of $650 million to $700 million over five years, coupled with the twin blow of the broken equalization promise showing that aiding Saskatchewan's return to greatness is not a priority for the government. I believe Saskatchewan will make it despite these challenges, but the government certainly is not making that situation any easier.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689104"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silence of the Saskatchewan caucus is a shame. In only one year the Conservatives have dealt a $1.5 billion blow to Saskatchewan. Instead of fairness that allows a province to reap the rewards of its economic development, we are given a new formula with pitiful justifications for its implementation. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689105"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of the justice that Kelowna would have provided, we are given inequality, prejudice and discrimination. Instead of truthfulness and honesty, we are given broken promises defended through clumsy talking points that are so embarrassing the speakers must quietly shudder to themselves every time they have to repeat them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689106"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude, I would like to acknowledge the tremendous courage shown by the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78829,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78829&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Cumberland—Colchester—Musquodoboit Valley</A> on June 5. Similar to Saskatchewan, the people in Nova Scotia were subjected to promises and agreements that were arbitrarily and capriciously thrown away by the Conservative government. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689107"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Media reports make reference to a heated debate behind the scenes during the past few weeks between the courageous member from Nova Scotia and his colleagues regarding how this budget negatively affects equalization in his province. It appears as though the member in question was not the only one among his now former Atlantic Conservative colleagues to raise concerns. Irrespective of how his colleagues may have individually voted, it appears as though several of the Atlantic Canadian Conservative members at least tried to do the right thing for their constituents. At least they tried. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689108"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The comparison between the members from Atlantic Canada and their seatmates from Saskatchewan is not flattering for the latter group. We have yet to see one small example of backbone from the terrified 12 on the subject of Saskatchewan's equalization. I must admit, however, that they are well practised in the art of parroting the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">finance minister</A>'s talking points. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689109"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile regular folks in Saskatchewan go about their business, saddened in the knowledge that so many of their elected representatives refuse to fight for what is right. It appears to me that they are either too scared to stand up for their province or they truly believe that breaking promises which damage and risk Saskatchewan's future is the proper course of action. I do not know which prospect is scarier.</div>

    </p><a name="Para689111"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The comment is that during the 13 years his party was in power there were absolutely no changes made to the equalization formula that would have benefited Saskatchewan. In fact, had the changes that we made just recently been enacted back in the mid-1990s over a period of a decade, the province of Saskatchewan, according to the Department of Finance's own figures from the province of Saskatchewan, would have received an additional $4 billion. But the Liberals did nothing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689112"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is a simple one. I have asked three other members on the opposite side this question and I have yet to get an accurate response. I asked the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78801,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78801&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Halifax West</A>, when he finished his presentation, if he could confirm the comments made by his leader who said in March of this year that, first, he did not believe that non-renewable natural resources should be excluded from the equalization formula and, second, he said that he believed that on top of that there should be a fiscal capacity cap. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689113"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course those two elements would result in Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Saskatchewan receiving absolutely zero dollars in equalization.

    </p><a name="Para689121"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that there is a longstanding tradition within Canadian Parliament that the actual idea of people casting votes for someone running for office is that this someone would represent them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689122"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have a very clear example here in the House. A Conservative member obviously wrestled with this issue for some time as to whether he could support this budget, which he saw as doing harm to his constituents and his province, and he was summarily dismissed by his party. The party then blocked computer records and access, which apparently have been restored, but as for even just the intention, I think that a lot of viewers who are watching and a lot of Canadians paying attention to this debate, if they can, do worry about the idea of sending someone to Ottawa and then having them tossed from a party because of a vote against a budget or not.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689123"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals do not have a clean record on this because they did the same thing not so long ago for one of their members. I have a question for my hon. colleague. Does he support what his party and the Conservative Party did? As for attempts to make any reference to what happened to a dear friend of mine in terms of what were her choices and what were not, I would recommend that he does not, because the continuation of these falsities does no service for any of us in this place.</div>

I totally supported the premier on that decision. In doing that right thing, he brought down the annual interest in the province of Nova Scotia by between $40 million and $50 million annually. That $40 million or $50 million goes into highways, hospitals and education. It benefits all Nova Scotians. That was the right thing to do. It was honourable of our former prime minister to do to make sure that money was issued upfront.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689139"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just so members understand, what the accord did was make sure that the clawback provisions from equalization were no longer applied. There were no more clawback provisions through equalization because of the offshore revenues. It was meant to be a building block so that Nova Scotia could move from being a have not province to a have province. There is activity in the economy in Nova Scotia, but the accord was in essence the foundation, a building block, and then, with the equalization on top, suddenly the revenues started to make some sense. The province was able to start getting at that debt that we continue to carry and that continues to be a burden on the people of Nova Scotia.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689140"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what happened when the budget was tabled was that the rug was pulled out from under the feet of Nova Scotians. The foundation was removed with the pulling out of the accord. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1655"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1655"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1700"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1650"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1655">(1655)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para689141"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The comments that are coming from the government today are about how “they can have one or they can have the other”. That was never the deal. This was both. This was the accord. This was equalization and no provision of clawbacks. Indeed, when we held government, we did increase the amount of equalization through a change in the formula. We increased the amount of equalization to the province of Nova Scotia and there was no impact on the accord. It in no way compromised the accord. This could be done. We know that this is not what happened in this case.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689142"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Numbers get bandied about in the House. In order for us to get a true view of it, let me mention that I read a great op-ed article a number of weeks back. It was from Peter O'Brien, the former Atlantic representative on the Canadian Federation of Independent Business. He was never a great friend of the Liberal Party of Canada, by any means, and when there was an issue he would take issue with the government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689143"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in regard to his position on this aspect of the budget, the accord, he said that when it was first announced the message coming from the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Finance</A> and the regional minister was, “Hey, this is all good, there is no change, no cap, and no compromising the Atlantic accord”. He took it at face value. In the article, he goes on to talk about two of this country's strongest and most respected economists, Wade Locke, from Memorial University in Newfoundland, and Paul Hobson, from Acadia University in Wolfville, Nova Scotia.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689144"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. O'Brien has been in a number of prebudget lockups with these gentlemen. He said that their work is exemplary and he trusts them completely. Mr. O'Brien said that by Wade Locke identifying and going through the process, and showing that the province of Newfoundland and Labrador will lose $11 billion with these changes and the province of Nova Scotia will lose a billion dollars with these changes, he knows that what he was getting from the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Finance</A> and the regional minister was nothing but spin. The truth is that both of those provinces lose with the changes that are made to this accord, and that is truly shameful. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689145"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard about this throughout this debate since the budget was tabled. I remember the day it was tabled. We were on our feet on this side of the House questioning the government about the impacts on the accord for both Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador. We knew there was going to be a net loss to the citizens of those two provinces, but the government said no, that was not the way it was at all. It said that this is great, we do not compromise anything, and they end up coming out ahead.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689146"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, when there was a unanimous resolution that came from the legislature in Nova Scotia, an all party resolution that called for the government to reinstitute the accord, those guys stood up and said, “Hey, there's no problem, it's all good”. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689147"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government sent its <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">finance minister</A> to meet with the finance minister for Nova Scotia. They had a six hour meeting. That is no reflection of us being slow learners in Nova Scotia. It is because the finance minister for the province of Nova Scotia knew what it had lost under the changes in the government's budget.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689148"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, of course, yesterday was the big day when this thing all came to a head.

    </p><a name="Para689150"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I want to do is call on the government to make sure that it abides by this agreement that was signed between the federal government and those provinces and that it reinstitutes the accords so that the people can share in what is rightfully theirs.</div>

I think it somewhat hypocritical for any member in any party in the House to criticize any party or individual for doing something. Parties and members do it because they have specific reasons. In this case there are reasons. There are reasons why members from the other side crossed the floor. To criticize one party or the other party seems to me somewhat hypocritical.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689152"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the member says there are some facts at issue. Some of the facts for Newfoundland are this. Does he not agree that restoring a fiscal balance to Newfoundland and Labrador, it will have approximately $1.5 billion more in 2007 and 2008 as a result of this budget? It will have $477 million in equalization, $494 million offshore accord offset, $347 million under the Canada Health transfer, $151 million for the Canada social transfer and $52 million for infrastructure.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think this is the first time we have talked about these issues. We in the Atlantic provinces are used to people making promises and then breaking them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689173"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the current <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> was in opposition, he said that the Atlantic accord was necessary. At the time, the current Prime Minister pushed the Liberal government to sign the accord. The accord was signed, thereby giving Nova Scotia and Newfoundland the right to keep the profits from their oil wells and a promise that equalization and transfer payments would not be affected.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689174"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time, the opposition said that the Liberal government was wrong because it did not want to give the Atlantic provinces and Saskatchewan a chance. Now we have a government that thinks it has all of the answers and knows everything. They think that it is up to Conservatives in Ottawa to decide what is best for Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, even though people like Danny Williams, the Premier of Newfoundland, do not agree with their plan. Furthermore, former Progressive Conservative member John Crosbie, a former minister who is well respected by his counterparts in Newfoundland and Ottawa, is critical of the Conservative government's failure to keep its promise.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689175"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Hamm, the former premier of Nova Scotia, and Rodney MacDonald, the current premier of Nova Scotia, do not agree with the federal government imposing a choice between the accord or equalization, not both, in its budget. It has to be one or the other.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689176"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then we wonder why, in our country, the provinces are often upset with the federal government. It is because everything is centralized in Ottawa and everything is decided in Ottawa. It is because of things like that. The Conservatives should remember that in 1996, the Liberals decided to make cuts to employment insurance, not just in our provinces, but across the country. I am sure that the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78918,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78918&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Cape Breton—Canso</A> remembers this well. In 1997, few Liberals were re-elected in the Atlantic provinces. In Nova Scotia, there were none. The Liberals were wiped out. Now, the Conservatives—remember this—are going to be wiped out in the Atlantic provinces. The fact that there is finally a special accord for Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, the country's poorest provinces, is nothing for the Atlantic provinces to get excited about.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689177"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having been kicked in the behind by the Liberals with their employment insurance cuts, a riding like mine is losing $81 million a year in employment insurance benefits, and people are having to go work in Alberta. They must leave their families, their wives and their children, who miss their fathers. The family is split up.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689178"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives said that if they were elected, they would give us this and we would have that. The Liberals were scared of these promises and gave it to us in 2005. Now, the Conservatives are coming and taking it away. There was a light at the end of the tunnel, but it was just a little fluorescent light, and it ran out of power.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The light has gone out. They have lost the light again. That is what has happened in Atlantic Canada. Have we not suffered enough? We lost our fishing industry. It is not the fault of the people in Atlantic Canada that the fishery has been lost. The people earned their pay. They went fishing and they tried to earn income to provide for the needs of their families. In the final analysis, there were no more fish. All this has hurt them. Families have gone through many difficulties. In addition, the Liberals slashed employment insurance. They decided to punish fishers even more, and the Conservatives supported them. The only thing the Conservatives said was that premiums were too high and they would lower the premiums because companies were paying too much, but they could not give benefits to the workers. That is what has happened. Finally, there was an agreement. I have spoken about the fishery but the fishery was not the only issue. At Bathurst, in my riding, the Smurfit-Stone paper plant, an industry that had been there for 100 years, has closed its doors. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This week, UPN announced that the Miramichi plant will close in August for nine or perhaps 12 months and 600 people will be put out of work. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New Brunswick says that if Nova Scotia can straighten out its finances and become prosperous; if Newfoundland can do the same; and if New Brunswick can draw people back to their home province, perhaps it too will benefit. Perhaps New Brunswick could work with Nova Scotia if that province is more prosperous. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689182"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But no, the government is not able to give us a chance to establish a climate of economic development. It cannot give us that chance. It is not able to give us a chance to survive. I think, perhaps, that is the plan. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689183"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They want to crush us. They say that if we do not want to be crushed, we need only move to Alberta, where there is an abundance of work. They say our country’s economic system is working well. If it is working, it is in Alberta. I am happy for Albertans. I am not jealous of them. But we should not be obliged to leave our region. We have a right in our country to earn our fair share and to receive assistance. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689184"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the provinces cannot help each other out within federalism, then what is the point? It is at times like this that we can see why the Bloc Québécois or Quebec wonders why it should stay in this country. They are given ample reason to say such things. When we are treated the way the federal government is treating us, we wonder what we are doing within a confederation, within a federation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689185"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this keeps up, we may have to form a Bloc Acadien. Then maybe the government will pump money to us, like it does elsewhere. We will not have oil wells like in Alberta, but we will have a pipeline that goes from Ottawa straight to Acadia. Maybe then we will not have 20% unemployment. Maybe then people back home will have work.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689186"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does anyone think these things are pleasant? Does anyone think people are happy to see how the government treats them? It made a promise. It made a promise to Nova Scotia. It made a promise to Newfoundland. It signed the Atlantic accord, but it did not say it would take it away. It is acting like a grandparent. It thinks it knows everything and, as a grandparent, it is demanding respect.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives signed an accord and contracts and these provinces want them to be respected. The only thing we are asking the Government of Canada to do is to respect these accords and respect a contract once it has been signed. It should not do what it just did. I hope the government will change its mind. An accord is an accord. The Conservatives should not breach this accord and force a member of their party to go the benches on the other side of the House of Commons. They should respect the accord and invite the member back.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government now has a $54 billion surplus in the employment insurance fund. We are used to getting hit right between the eyes, but we are sick and tired of it. We are sick and tired of being told, “Here is some hope, but we will take it away from you”, and, “If you do not have a job, just jump on the train or take the first flight leaving Moncton, Halifax or St. John's, go to Alberta or Fort McMurray and you will have a job, and if you do not, it is just because you are lazy and do not want to work”.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689194"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what we were being told by Liberal ministers. One Liberal human resources minister said the people from Atlantic Canada were just lazy and did not want to work and that is why they were cutting employment insurance. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689195"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal government signed the Atlantic accord when it got pushed into it, and now here is another minister coming up and saying it will be taken away from us.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689196"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are so used to being given things and having them taken away before we get them. We are getting sick of it because it hurts families. I get calls in my office from women who say they have no food to give to their children. We are not in Ottawa, I can tell members that. Even in Ottawa, a beautiful city that we have here, we see people on the street begging for food. It is not the type of country that we should have.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689197"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we have 1.4 million children who are hungry in our country, we should be ashamed of it. In 1989 we passed a motion that within 10 years, not one child would be hungry in our country. When we go to Toronto, in front of City Hall, we have people lying on cardboard to sleep. In a country like Canada, we should be ashamed of that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689198"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not too proud sometimes of my country, particularly the way that we treat human beings and the way that we treat our children. I am not too pleased. I do not have much to say about what we have passed in the last 100 years. That is why I said to my dad, “Might as well vote for something other than the Conservatives and the Liberals because we served them on a silver plate and we are the poorest ones in the country”. </div>

    </p><a name="Para689209"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I must congratulate my hon. colleagues from Atlantic Canada, and especially my hon. colleague from <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78825,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78825&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Acadie—Bathurst</A> for his credibility and his principles.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para689210"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also important today to again acknowledge the incredible valour of another member in the House, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78829,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78829&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Cumberland—Colchester—Musquodoboit Valley</A>, who yesterday made a very difficult decision to stand up for a principle he believed in and to take the consequences despite being assured publicly by colleagues that he would never be shunned by his political party or forced to leave the Conservative Party because he stood on principle.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689211"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know in the House that it is never easy to take that kind of principled position and to suffer those kinds of consequences. Obviously today, we salute the member and thank him for his courage, but we do not relish it or take glee in it because his act was a reflection on a failure by this place. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689212"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It marked a very black day in the history of this country because in fact what we are dealing with is a development that will feed and contribute to even more cynicism and skepticism on the part of Canadians everywhere.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689213"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who can believe in their politicians, democratically elected institutions and governments, when promise after promise gets broken? How do we encourage voters to take an interest in politics and exercise their franchise, when it all becomes so meaningless after the fact?</div>
    </p><a name="Para689214"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voters in this country have been through too much on that front, whether we are talking about the past 10 or 13 years of Liberal government, who broke so many promises that we cannot even begin to count them, or whether we are talking about this most egregious broken word by the Conservative government today in terms of the Atlantic accords and, I might add, the Saskatchewan agreement. It is unbelievable. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689215"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is absolutely beyond the realm of comprehension to think that our system would have degenerated to this point, to the point where we cannot count on anybody anywhere these days. We do not know who to trust.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689216"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to something as fundamental as the future economy of our Atlantic provinces, which have suffered through many years of economic ups and downs, despair, gloom and lack of hope, it was so important in this case to find a way to keep a promise.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689217"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not lose sight of what actually happened. We are talking about an agreement that was made back in January 2005. The provinces of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador reached a deal with the federal government on January 28 of that year to keep 100% of their offshore energy revenues.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689218"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of what has happened since, no matter how many studies have been conducted to find out how equalization should work in the future, we have to remember that this was a written accord with a government now that promised when in opposition to abide by the accord. Members of the Conservative Party in this place clearly stood on the principle of keeping an accord and an agreement.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689219"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have condemned others in this place for not abiding by their principles or appearing to be watering down their commitments. It is nothing short of absolute hypocrisy on the part of members on the government side.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689220"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not lose sight of what in fact we are trying to do today, which is to at least ensure that the government's word is as good as the paper it is written on, that in fact a bond between the federal government and two provincial jurisdictions that is written in the form of a formal agreement is kept. That is what is fundamental today. It is not just a matter of what is written down as an agreement. It is also what is stated as a principle and as a fundamental word between two jurisdictions.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1725"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1725"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1730"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1720"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1725">(1725)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para689221"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I also want to include Saskatchewan which felt that it had a deal with the federal government. It felt that it had in fact won a concession from the Conservatives that it would be able to hold on to its resources, its revenues from the oil and gas natural resources while it developed its economy. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689222"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what we are talking about, provinces that have asked for resources to ensure they can develop their economies until such time as they have achieved a status of economic certainty and well-being for all of its citizens.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689223"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I want to say that this whole can of worms is a result of political expediency and lack of courage going through many terms of government. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689224"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us remember how this started. Let us go back to the Liberals in the year 2000 when the issue of equalization was front and centre, when it was absolutely imperative and recognized as such that we resolve the question about a proper formula for equalization.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689225"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals had a chance when they were in government to fix this problem forever, but in the interest of political expediency, in the interest of wanting to put all of their money against the debt as opposed to building the provinces of the country and the economic livelihoods of people everywhere in the country, they choose to work, to vote, to act against Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689226"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to go back to that date in the history of Canada. The House will know that back in the year 2003 there was an agreement between the provinces and the federal government on an equalization formula. There was unanimity. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689227"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every province had agreed with the federal government on a proper formula for equalization, but guess what? The federal Liberals under the finance minister at that time, who is now the House leader of the Liberal Party, decided it was too much money, as they put $80 billion against the debt without the extra billion that was required in terms of equalization. Here we have two parties acting exactly the same--</div>

    </p><a name="Para689237"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I find it absolutely incredible that the member from Cape Breton would stand in this House and name-call and get personally insulting by making innuendoes about someone's style of speaking. I happen to think it is far more important to speak with integrity and passion than to speak with two faces and talk double-cross. It shows that he has absolutely no interest in fixing this problem.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689238"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to mention to the member that his government had the chance to fix this problem but it chose to put $80 billion in surplus revenue against the debt, which hardly changed our debt to GDP ratio one iota. All the while, the people in his region and his province were suffering under high unemployment and economic despair.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689239"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All we are saying is that we should take a portion of that money, a couple of billion dollars, and put it toward fixing the equalization formulation as the Liberals had the chance to do in 2003.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689240"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to remind the member that in the 2003 negotiations we were compelled by the five year legislative review requirement. The provinces and territories brought a consensus position to the table calling for a return to the 10 province standard; the inclusion of provincial revenues, including user fees, in equalization calculations; the minimizing of unpredictable factors; the forgiveness of census related losses; and the taking into account of any dramatic changes to provincial and territorial tax bases. There was a consensus with Quebec, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador, British Columbia and all the other provinces. His government refused to move on this because of what it would cost, which was a few million dollars extra that it said it could not afford. However, it did have $80 billion to put against the debt while the roof was leaking.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome the opportunity to speak today to this motion and, subsequently, to an issue that has been much misunderstood and often misrepresented. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689247"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's government was the first government to recognize the existence of a fiscal imbalance with the provinces. We committed to respecting provincial jurisdiction and to clarifying roles and responsibilities. We also recognized the need for a comprehensive package of measures to restore the fiscal balance. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689248"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In budget 2006, and in other key pieces of legislation passed over the last year, we began to take concrete action. Finally, in budget 2007 we restored fiscal balance while living up to our commitments with respect to the equalization program and the Atlantic accord. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689249"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will first speak about a better Canada. The first step to making Canada even better tomorrow is to restore fiscal balance in this country today. It is not in defending turf, not in engaging in parochial politics and not in confronting for the sake of confrontation, but acting in the best interests of Canadians in all parts of this country.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last few years there has been a lot of talk about fiscal balance but what is it really about? It is about better roads and renewed public transit, better health care, better equipped universities, cleaner oceans, rivers, lakes and air, and training to help Canadians get the skills they need. It is all about building a better future for our country. That means ensuring predictable long term funding to provincial and territorial governments.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689251"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through budget 2007, we are delivering a historic plan worth over $39 billion in additional funding to restore fiscal balance in Canada. Restoring fiscal balance brings federal support for provinces and territories to an unprecedented level. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689252"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the previous Liberal government, which did not and still does not recognize the very existence of the fiscal imbalance, our plan is based on a clear set of principles: accountability through clarity of roles and responsibilities; fiscal responsibility and budgetary transparency; predictable long term fiscal arrangements; a competitive and efficient economic union; and effective collaborative management of the federation. Reflecting these principles, we have kept our commitments on equalization and on the Atlantic accord.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689253"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In coming to office, Canada's new government promised to protect the Atlantic accord. Budget 2007 does just that. It provides 100% protection for the Atlantic accord signed in 2005. In fact, we are returning to a principled, formula-based equalization program. As we promised, every province will be better off under the new system.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689254"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving to the new system, the budget took every action to fully protect the benefits of the Atlantic accord, consistent with our commitments and as requested by the Governments of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador. I want to be clear that both Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador can continue to operate under the existing equalization system for the life of the Atlantic accord, exactly the same system today and in the future as before the 2007 budget.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689255"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as these provinces continue to operate under the existing equalization program, there is absolutely no change to either the accord or the equalization calculation on which it is based. What is more, both provinces have been given the right to opt permanently into a new improved Canada-wide equalization system. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689256"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, while the new equalization system automatically applies to the other eight provinces, both Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia have a choice. They can keep their existing arrangements or opt permanently into the new principled and formula-based equalization system when and if it becomes more advantageous for them over the remaining life of their Atlantic accords.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1740"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1740"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1745"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1735"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1740">(1740)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para689257"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's new government went even further to facilitate that choice. The budget legislation also offers increased flexibility in making the transition to a new equalization system by giving both provinces a full year before deciding whether to opt permanently into the new system. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689258"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simply put, we said that we would respect the Atlantic accord and we have taken every step to keep our word to the people of Nova Scotia and of Newfoundland and Labrador.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689259"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is much more to restoring fiscal balance than just equalization. The actions taken in budget 2007 will restore fiscal balance, putting all major transfers back on a long term, fair and predictable basis. We are fulfilling our commitment to restoring equal per capita cash allocations in other major transfers to the provinces. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689260"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting in 2007-08, we will put the Canada social transfer payments on an equal per capita cash basis to ensure equal federal support to Canadians in all parts of the country for post-secondary education, social assistance and social services.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689261"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also committing to move the Canada health transfer to an equal per capita cash basis when the current arrangement expires in 2014. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689262"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are keeping our commitment to building Canada's future by improving our infrastructure. In fact, the government's investment in infrastructure is by far the largest component of the fiscal balance package. We are making an unprecedented investment in Canada's infrastructure of $16.3 billion in new funding, for a total of $37 billion over the next seven years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689263"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These investments will be of particular importance to the future economic vitality of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador. Indeed, restoring fiscal balance brings federal support for Newfoundland and Labrador to more than $1.5 billion in 2007-08 and for Nova Scotia this totals more than $2.4 billion in those same years.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689264"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This includes equalization payments amounting to $477 million for Newfoundland and Labrador and over $1.3 billion for Nova Scotia, assuming these provinces choose to retain the previous equalization program on which their Atlantic accords are based.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689265"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's new government is committed to abide by the principles it has set out and, in doing so, to demonstrate to Canadians and to their provincial and territorial governments that fiscal balance has not only been restored but that it will be maintained going forward.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689266"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to be clear about what this means. It means a commitment by the Government of Canada to reducing the burden on taxpayers, not only in line with the tax back guarantee, but also if and when future government revenues again come to exceed its responsibility, and if future governments believe their responsibilities have come to exceed their revenues, it means they should be accountable to taxpayers for raising the additional revenues they may need to raise.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689267"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintaining fiscal balance over the long term also means maintaining the government's commitment to long term, predictable funding in all areas that continue to share priorities of governments in all parts of this country. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689268"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also means upholding the equitable treatment of Canadians in all parts of the country by: maintaining a formula based equalization program that applies the same principle based approach in all parts of the country; ensuring equal access to funding support for shared priorities in areas where needs are Canada-wide in nature; and continuing to respond to the sometimes very different needs of Canadians in different parts of the country for programs in areas of clear federal responsibility, including infrastructure projects of national importance.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689269"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having restored fiscal balance and put in place the principle based approach that will help maintain it, it is now time for Canadians in all parts of the country to do their part in moving the country forward by working together to secure and expand our advantages as set out by the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Finance</A> in the advantage Canada economic plan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689270"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These advantages include a fiscal advantage grounded in the goal of eliminating Canada's total government net debt in less than a generation. It includes an infrastructure advantage based on modern, world-class infrastructure to ensure the seamless flow of people, goods and services within Canada and through our gateways and border crossings to the world beyond.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an entrepreneurial advantage freed up by the elimination of unnecessary regulation and a reduction in the burden of tax compliance and more competitive business. It is a knowledge advantage and a tax advantage.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689272"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I know that we can count on the provinces of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador, and especially on the people of these great provinces to remain focused on building Canada's future prosperity and sustainable environment by expanding the many advantages we already possess as a nation.</div>

Actually there is absolutely no change to the accord or the equalization program. What has changed is that the provinces mentioned now have a choice. They can take a balance of the two, provided they do not exceed. It is interesting that the member should talk about promises. I will not get into the negativity. I want to get into the positive messages to Nova Scotia in this budget.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689282"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the payments for Nova Scotia in millions of dollars, if we left it at the status quo it would mean a difference of about $95 million in this current budget and in 2008-09, an additional $59 million. Under budget 2007, under the O'Brien plan, equalization goes from $1.344 billion in 2005-06 to $1.465 billion in 2007-08. The total increase right across the board is millions and millions of dollars extra for both of those provinces. There are millions and millions of dollars more for Saskatchewan. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689283"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are interpretations, but we are maintaining our commitment. We are maintaining the very commitment that the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> made.

The member doubts that the government has honoured its commitments. I can assure the House that nothing could be further from the truth.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689286"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budget 2007 provides important benefits to the people of Nova Scotia as part of the Government of Canada's commitment to fair and equitable financial support for provincial and territorial health care, post-secondary education, child care, social programs and infrastructure. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689287"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budget 2007 does even more. Nova Scotia will continue to receive 100% of offshore resource revenues, including royalties, as if these resources were on land. This fundamental aspect of Nova Scotia's relationship with its offshore resources, its ability to manage the resource, to tax and collect the royalties remains the same. This will help Nova Scotia to develop its economic potential and ensure its future prosperity.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689288"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me remind the House that it was a Conservative government that signed the 1986 Canada-Nova Scotia offshore petroleum resources accord, which facilitated the development of the oil and gas reserves off the coast of Nova Scotia. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689289"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In specific terms, budget 2007 will allow the governments of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador to continue to enjoy the benefits of their 2005 offshore accords. Again, I remind the House that it was a Conservative opposition that forced the previous government to sign these agreements. The accords are unique in Canada in recognition of the provinces' unique economic and fiscal circumstances. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689290"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budget 2007 offers Nova Scotia a positive choice for the future. It can operate under the existing equalization formula, or it can choose to opt into the new equalization formula based on the O'Brien report, if and when the province determines this as being most advantageous. By having this additional choice, Nova Scotia potentially stands to receive even higher benefits than under the existing formula while retaining its right to offset payments under the accords.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689291"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, if the Nova Scotia government chooses the new equalization formula, it is only fair that the whole package would apply, including the fiscal capacity cap that is an integral part of the new equalization formula. It would not be fair to other provinces if only Nova Scotia were allowed to choose those parts of the new equalization program that benefit the province.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689292"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Nova Scotia has been given additional flexibility beyond what was set out in budget 2007. Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2801101,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2801101&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">C-52</A> would allow Nova Scotia to benefit from the new O'Brien formula for 2007-08 and provides more time to assess whether it wants to permanently opt into the new equalization formula. This option has given Nova Scotia an additional $95 million, for total benefits of $1.5 billion in 2007-08. Under this arrangement Nova Scotia will receive its full offset payments under the offshore accords.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689293"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One can begin to see the difference where it matters. In April 2007 Nova Scotia's labour force participation rate of 64% was close to a 30 year high and full time jobs have increased by 2.5% over a year ago. The economy is strong in Nova Scotia.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689294"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is a sharing community. Nova Scotia's growing prosperity is in part due to strong federal support and is something to celebrate. With 100% protection of the Atlantic accords and a positive choice for the future, the province can make sustained improvements to its economic and fiscal situation for the benefit of individuals and families throughout Nova Scotia.</div>

They are opposed to $277 million for the Canada social transfer, including additional funding for post-secondary education and child care. The $73 million for infrastructure would be lost. The $24.2 million available to the Nova Scotia government through the patient wait times guarantee trust over the next three fiscal years would be lost. The $8.5 million available to the Nova Scotia government to implement the human papilloma virus immunization program to combat cervical cancer over the next three fiscal years potentially would be lost. The $23.2 million in gas tax funding for municipalities in Nova Scotia in 2007-08 would be potentially lost. The $2 million in corporate income tax relief from changes in capital cost allowances for buildings could be lost. The $7 million in additional corporate income tax relief from the temporary two year writeoff for manufacturing equipment over the next two years is threatened. Nova Scotia will receive $42.5 million from the Canada ecotrust for clean air and climate change.</div>

    </p><a name="Para689310"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a fair treatment for all of the provinces in this country. The cap is in place to make sure that provinces receiving equalization do not have greater fiscal capacity than non-receiving provinces. That is only fair and reasonable.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The province of Nova Scotia has been given a choice. The province has got, as a matter of fact, an extra year to even figure out what choice it wants to make.

I think it helps to explain why the Conservatives gave up on their plans earlier this year to engineer a premature spring election in Canada. They very much wanted to call one. They doled out more than $12 billion for pre-election government spending to buy votes through January, February and into March. They added another $4 million for some very abusive attack advertising. Their budget was delayed to suit their election timing. They thought they would use it to launch a campaign about the middle of March. However, then everything began to fall apart.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689320"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The budget, instead of launching, landed with a dull thud. It confirmed increases in personal income taxes, and that was not popular with Canadians. It slashed things like student summer jobs, which has been debated extensively in the House about the disappointment across the country among both the employers and the employees. The budget mangled the funding for aboriginal people, for foreign aid, in Africa especially, for the fight against climate change and, quite surprisingly, it reduced federal help for farmers.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689321"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The budget demonstrated utter Conservative incompetence on issues like the hollowing out of Canadian enterprise, and it broke promises left, right and centre. For example, the Conservatives drove a stake through the heart of the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>'s promise on income trusts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689322"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me quote one particular journalist who has written a lot on this topic. John Ibbitson, writing in the <i>Globe and Mail</i>, stated:</div>

</div>
    </p><a name="Para689324"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of broken promises and broken trusts, the same is true on equalization and the Atlantic accords, especially betraying Saskatchewan, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador. These provinces were given explicit and written promises by the leader of the Conservative Party, now the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>, and incidentally by every Conservative candidate.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689325"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Atlantic Canada, the Conservative promise was to respect the spirit and the letter of the Atlantic accords as they were signed in February 2005.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689326"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Saskatchewan, the promise was to calculate the province's entitlement to equalization, as if Saskatchewan had no provincial revenue whatsoever from oil and gas. The Conservatives were good enough to calculate exactly what that promise to Saskatchewan would mean. They promised an extra $800 million in equalization benefits to Saskatchewan every year.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689327"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I point out that when the finance committee made the opportunity available for the Premier of Saskatchewan to be heard on this matter, he read into the record chapter and verse of the Conservative speeches, the Conservative pamphlets, the Conservative promises that made the point absolutely crystal clear. There were no ifs, ands or buts. It was absolutely unmistakable, absolutely unequivocal. It was in writing and in every Conservative speech about Saskatchewan for more than two full years. Then out of the blue, on budget day 2007, it all came to a crashing halt. Saskatchewan was sucker punched.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689328"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should point out that these promises, which had been accumulating on the part of the Conservatives, have been accumulating, as I said a moment ago, over a period of two years. When the election came and went and the Conservatives were elected in January 2006, Saskatchewan people anticipated that this would be, that is the promise to Saskatchewan, one of the very first things with which the newly elected government would be dealing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689329"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It did not appear in the throne speech. It did not appear in its first budget. The government said that it would have to wait for first ministers meetings and for other negotiations. Therefore, Saskatchewan put its expectations on hold. It thought for sure it would come in the fall of 2006, but the first ministers meetings were cancelled.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1805"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1805"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1810"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1800"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1805">(1805)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para689330"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, there was no action in the fall of 2006, so Saskatchewan put its expectations on hold again and deferred its waiting period until the budget of 2007. When March 19th came and went, it all came to a crashing halt. Saskatchewan was sucker punched. There was no $800 million more to go to Saskatchewan from equalization every year, not even close. Why?</div>
    </p><a name="Para689331"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is very much the same as the problem that afflicted the promise to Atlantic Canada with the Atlantic accords. A never before mentioned Conservative cap on how much Saskatchewan could gain was suddenly imposed in the budget of 2007. That cap effectively guts the entire promise to Saskatchewan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689332"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My province will get about $226 million once this year and this year only, then it is over. There will be nothing thereafter. We must remember that the promise was $800 million per year ongoing. The promise was clearly broken and it was broken by the cap.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689333"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of reforming equalization began much more successfully for Saskatchewan under the previous Liberal government. Between 2004 and 2005, Liberal changes to how equalization works brought in to Saskatchewan an extra $799 million in direct equalization benefits over those two years. That was the biggest equalization bonus in history.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689334"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also increased other federal transfers to the provinces to an all time record high level, and Saskatchewan, like all provinces, benefited from that. We invested and put into the financial projections of the Government of Canada another $100 billion in steadily increasing federal transfers over the coming decade, particularly for health care and equalization, but also for a number of other things like child care, for example.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689335"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Conservatives arrived in office, they reduced or cancelled a broad range of federal transfers, programs and services for Saskatchewan and its citizens. We lost funding for child care, for student aid, for workplace training, for rural roads, for farmers and for aboriginal people. The net loss, after we add in the few trinkets and bells and whistles invented by the Conservative government, after we add in all the puts and takes, is $250 million per year. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689336"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives have made what they call the fiscal imbalance worse for Saskatchewan, not better. The net result is to take money away. However, that, of course, was all to be fixed by this new hypothetical equalization formula that they were working on and that would be forthcoming in the budget of 2007, except whatever new formula is used, the Conservative cap still applies and that cap effectively cuts Saskatchewan off at the knees.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689337"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Premier of Saskatchewan and the provincial leader of the opposition, who is a Conservative I would point out, and the news media and the people of Saskatchewan generally all feel that they have been betrayed and misled. The Conservative government's feeble defence is now to say that it never promised not to slap a cap on Saskatchewan.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689338"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">finance minister</A>, his parliamentary secretary and Conservative Saskatchewan MPs now claim that it was really always their intention to have such a cap. Anyone with half a brain they said would have been able to figure that out, but they forgot to mention it in the run up to an election. That means that they knew exactly what they were going to do. They knew exactly that they were going to break their word. They knew exactly that they were going to have a cap.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a diversionary tactic, the Conservatives have concocted a rather wild yarn lately that their budget is in fact investing $878 million in what they call new money in Saskatchewan.

    </p><a name="Para689348"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not annual, new funding. It is a wild conglomeration of bits and pieces of this and that, spread over several years into the future, but all added together now to make it sound big. It is not big.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts are these. The Conservatives have in fact failed to tell the truth about equalization from the very beginning, from 2004 when they first began to talk about the subject. Members remember very well that we had a number of debates in this House, not just question period and the back and forth during that sometimes rather hostile period in the House of Commons, but full opposition day debates and other debates about the future of equalization. The position of the Conservative Party was always clear: take non-renewable natural resources 100% out of the formula. It never once mentioned a cap.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives have, it seems to me, taken a page out of the Karl Rove playbook for the republican party in the United States.

It is nice to have a little chutzpah, but the fact of the matter is their behaviour on this issue has changed the issue. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689357"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no longer some narrow technical argument about which complicated equalization formula is better. It is not a clash of various types of arithmetic and mathematics. That is past. The issue is now a character issue. It is a trust issue. It is an honesty issue. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689358"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an issue that goes directly to the government's integrity, or, as most Saskatchewan people now see it, the government's obvious lack of integrity. Saskatchewan has been used and abused on this issue. Saskatchewan has been taken for granted and so have the people of Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very telling exchange with respect to the Atlantic accords just took place a few moments ago in the course of the question and answer period before I began my remarks. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689360"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the members on our side asked the government member who was speaking that if everything was so perfect, if the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78829,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78829&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Cumberland—Colchester—Musquodoboit Valley</A> had no valid reason for crossing the floor, if the government was doing everything right on equalization and the Atlantic accords, why then is there this flurry of activity for the government now trying to change the rules yet again? If the Conservatives have it so right, why are they still trying to change it? Why did they offer, with one minute to go on Tuesday night, some deathbed deal to try to keep the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78829,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78829&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Cumberland—Colchester—Musquodoboit Valley</A> from doing what he intended to do and cross the floor?</div>
    </p><a name="Para689361"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think all members of this House have an enormous respect for the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78829,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78829&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Cumberland—Colchester—Musquodoboit Valley</A> and for the courage that he demonstrated on Tuesday night. It is clear that his constituents have a very huge regard for him. It is clear that the public and the media in Atlantic Canada are praising his actions.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689362"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is equally clear is that there are observers and media commentators across this country who are praising the member, including in my province of Saskatchewan, where they are asking why there was not a Saskatchewan Conservative who was willing to demonstrate that kind of backbone. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689363"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan have been betrayed, and so have a great many other Canadians in many ways by this budget. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689364"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one common theme that underlies all of this concern. It is a sense among a great many Canadians that they have not been told the truth, a sense that they have been betrayed at the hands of a dishonest government. The depth of that feeling, which exists in this country today and which is growing, is something that the Conservatives will not be able to cap.</div>

    </p><a name="Para689366"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first comment I would make refers to my hon. colleague's comments concerning his previous government's efforts to raise transfer payments. He called it at one time “to record highs”. I would remind all Canadians, including of course the hon. member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78924,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78924&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Wascana</A>, that it was his government that cut $25 billion in health care transfers to the provinces during his terms of office while he was in cabinet and he did nothing to stop that, absolutely nothing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689367"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I would point out that during the 13 years that the member was in cabinet, the Liberals did absolutely nothing to help the equalization problem in Saskatchewan. If they would have done as we have recently done in budget 2007 and removed non-renewable natural resources, 100% removal, it would have meant during a decade of have not years in Saskatchewan $4 billion in additional revenue for the province. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689368"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those figures come not from me, but from the department of finance in the province of Saskatchewan. Yet, the member has the gall to stand up and make it appear that the Liberal Party is the great protector of Saskatchewan. I would suggest only this, that it was absolutely not the case.</div>

    </p><a name="Para689371"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very cap that the member is criticizing is being advocated by his own leader, except for one small detail.

    </p><a name="Para689374"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the member's questions, he talked about the cuts that were made in various government programs in the course of the 1990s. I think he would recall that fiscal restraint in the middle of the 1990s was rather necessary because the previous Conservative government had left Canada with a $600 billion debt and a ballooning deficit that was rising at the rate of $40 billion per year. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689375"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The country was a basket case in terms of its fiscal situation because of the pathetic performance of the previous Conservative government. It created that problem and Canadians wanted that problem solved.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689376"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had to get the balance sheet under control and we did that. I would point out that the Conservatives at the time and Reformers at the time said we were not cutting enough. They said we should cut more back in the mid-1990s, so they can hardly argue about the cuts that were made when they wanted more cuts. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689377"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would point out that the fact remains that after the period of restraint, we did raise transfer payments to the provinces to an all time record high and we had booked $100 billion more in those transfer payments to come.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689378"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the hon. gentleman said Liberals did not help the situation in Saskatchewan. I would point out that in fact we made changes in the formula that put $799 million in extra equalization benefits into Saskatchewan between 2004 and 2005. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689379"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on the issue of the promises that have been made, I would point out that it is his leader and his <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> who made the promise of removing non-renewable natural resources.

We are going to let everyone know what we have done because the main estimates present information on both budgetary and non-budgetary spending authorities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689395"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2007-08 main estimates provide information on $210.3 billion in total budgetary expenditures, including $74.9 billion in voted appropriations such as departmental operating and capital expenditures, and $135.4 billion in statutory items previously approved by Parliament. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689396"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In total, the 2007-08 main estimates have increased by $12 billion or 6% relative to the 2006-07 main estimates. This increase is accounted for by increases of $11.7 billion in budgetary spending and $256.6 million in non-budgetary spending. However, when the 2007-08 main estimates are compared to the total 2006-07 estimates, including supplementary estimates (A) and (B), the year over year increase in total projected spending is $2.3 billion or only 1.1%.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689397"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are the main estimates so important? The estimates help to ensure that parliamentarians and Canadians are sufficiently informed of the government's expenditure and resource plans so that the government may be held to account for the allocation and management of public funds.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689398"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is moving forward with priorities announced in budget 2006 and the November 2006 economic and fiscal update, including increased funding for the environment, defence and security, and social programs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689399"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2007-08 main estimates demonstrate the government's approach to effective and transparent management of taxpayers' hard-earned dollars and its commitment to keep growth in spending to a rate that is sustainable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689400"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These main estimates show that the government is keeping its fiscal house in order and taking the right steps to effectively manage taxpayers' hard-earned dollars and ensure that they do get the best value for government programs and services. The estimates, in conjunction with the budget and the economic and fiscal update, reflect the government's annual resource planning and allocation priorities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689401"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last November, the finance department released Advantage Canada, which has four core principles: first, focusing government, which means making sure that spending is efficient, effective and accountable; second, creating new opportunities and choices for people, which means creating incentives and ensuring opportunities for Canadians to succeed right here at home; third, investing for sustainable growth, which means investing in the areas that are needed for a strong economy, including scientific research, infrastructure, and a clean and sustainable environment; and finally, freeing business to grow and succeed, which means ensuring that government is facilitating business and not hindering growth through excessive tax or regulatory burdens.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689402"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those four core principles build upon the five comparative advantages, which are: fiscal advantages, tax advantages, obvious infrastructure advantages, knowledge advantages and, what we are so strong at here in our country, entrepreneurial advantages.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689403"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will talk a little about 2007 budget spending.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689404"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With respect to infrastructure, budget 2007 delivers more than $16 billion to infrastructure. Including the infrastructure funding provided in budget 2006, federal support under the plan will total $33 billion over the next seven years. That is about $1,000 for every Canadian. Provided are an estimated $17.6 billion in base funding, $8.8 billion for the building Canada fund, and $2.1 billion for the national fund for gateways and border crossings. Part of this amount will be used to make a contribution toward the cost of a new access road that will link a new crossing at Windsor-Detroit with Highway 401.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1835"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1835"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1840"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1830"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1835">(1835)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para689405"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also provided are $1.26 billion for the national fund for public-private partnerships and $510 million to the Canada Foundation for Innovation to enable it to undertake another major competition before 2010. The government will account for the funds as they are disbursed by the CFI to institutions. It is anticipated that $70 million will be provided to institutions in 2008-09. That is not bad for those in my riding who are students at Brock University. To enable additional young Canadians to pursue graduate level studies, budget 2007 provides $35 million over two years to expand these scholarships.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689406"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As border communities, and we have many of them in our country, we will see an increase of $146.8 million in net funding for the Canada Border Services Agency. This is primarily as a result of budget 2006, which outlined the government's commitments to securing Canada's borders and to further implementing the security and prosperity partnership of the North America initiative.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689407"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These major items include $390 million to go toward the electronic eManifest program aimed at streamlining and speeding up border crossings without sacrificing security. There is also $60.5 million to arm border service officers and eliminate work-alone situations in order to enhance border security and certainly enhance officer safety.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689408"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is $15.1 million for the provision of border services in relation to a new container facility in Port Rupert as part of the Asia-Pacific gateway and corridor initiative, and there is also $8.7 million to screen marine crews and passengers on the Great Lakes under the securing Canada's marine transportation initiative.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689409"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to seniors, budget 2007 provides an additional $10 million per year to new horizons for seniors, which will bring the total budget for the program to an astounding $35 million per year.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689410"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's government is making solid progress on its priorities, including investment in environment, defence, security, our nation's health, and our social programs.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689411"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The largest portion of program spending is devoted to social programs, which account for $97.4 billion, or 46.3% of the total program spending for 2007-08. This represents by far the largest component of total program spending.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689412"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the remainder, spending on public debt charges, international immigration and defence programs and general government services account for an additional $82.9 billion, or 39.4% of total spending.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689413"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has made a commitment to ensuring that Canada's aid programs deliver tangible results while making effective and efficient use of our resources.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689414"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main estimates for 2007-08 include $3.026 billion in budgetary spending for CIDA and a further $22.6 million in non-budgetary investments. Together, these amounts represent a $74.3 million increase over CIDA's main estimates for the fiscal year now drawing to a close.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689415"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Finance</A> reiterated the government's commitment to increase spending on international assistance by 8% in this fiscal year as part of the overall objective to double Canada's international aid between 2001 and 2011.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689416"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to arts spending, the operating base of Canada Council for the Arts is increasing by $30.9 million, or 20.5%. Of this, virtually all of the funding is for individual artists, art organizations and increased touring and dissemination of artwork to support innovation, growth and success in Canada's cultural communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689417"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remainder of the funding is to support the interdepartmental partnership with the official languages community program.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689418"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Canadian Museum of Nature spending is increasing by a net of $25.1 million, or 42.4%. The increase is reflected in its capital budget, with $25 million for a major renovation of the Victoria Memorial Museum Building. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1840"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1840"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1845"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1835"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1840">(1840)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para689419"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total spending requirements are being partially offset by a decrease in the operating budget. The National Battlefield Commission spending is increasing by $4.3 million, or almost 49%. Virtually all of this increase is for the rehabilitation of roads, sidewalks, storm sewers in several areas of the Battlefields Park, the construction of a restroom/office building and landscaping at the major events in site preparation for the celebration of the park's 100th anniversary and the 400th anniversary of Quebec City.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689420"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the environment, the Parks Canada Agency spending is increasing by $21.3 million, or 3.7%, of which the major increases are the following: the enhancement of Parks Canada's ability to manage ecological integrity; the 400th anniversary of the Quebec celebration; the Asian-Pacific Gateway initiative; and repair and restoration of infrastructure in national parks.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689421"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Capital Commission's spending is increasing by a net of $2.8 million, or 3.1%, mainly as a result of increases in capital projects being funded from their acquisition and disposal fund.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689422"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department of Natural Resources' spending is also increasing by a net of $719.1 million, or 50.4%, with some $536.1 million in new funds for contributions and other transfer payments, and the remainder in operating and grants.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689423"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the variety of program initiatives receiving funding, the most noteworthy include: the nuclear legacy liabilities program; the clean air agenda; the Port Hope low level radioactive waste cleanup program; the federal response to the mountain pine beetle program; and the forest industry long term competitiveness strategies program.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689424"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, there are major increases in statutory payments to the Newfoundland offshore petroleum resource revenue fund, which is $241.6 million, and the Nova Scotia offshore revenue account.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689425"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department of the Environment is anticipating a net increase in spending of $38.1 million, or 4.7%, with much of the increase due to the implementation of the new environmental management agenda and its clean air initiatives, which represent $250 million.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689426"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Food Inspection Agency's spending is increasing by $15.8 million, or 2.8%, for increased operating and capital costs, the major item being an increase in funding for avian and pandemic influenza preparedness, something on which we focused in budget 2006 as well.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689427"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission's spending is increasing by $15.8 million, or 20.1%, in order to deal with new demand in regulatory workload associated with industry growth and the licensing of new nuclear power plants.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689428"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Security and public safety program sectors in 2007-08 is estimated at $6.5 billion, which represents 3.1% of total program spending. Compared to the previous year, this sector's spending in 2007-08 has increased by $484.8 million, or 8%. Among the major drivers contributing to the increase in planned spending is the increase of $298 million in net funding for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689429"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we can hear, there is a lot in the estimates for 2007-08. I certainly want to compliment the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105829,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105829&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">President of the Treasury Board</A> for the work that he did in preparing these estimates, working long hours to ensure the ministries were prepared and that we were prepared to implement budget 2007-08 and that we would stay on track.</div>

I think we will see that at the end of 2007 and 2008 we will have accomplished a lot for the people in this country. We will have accomplished a lot because we set a budget in place that, hopefully, will pass very soon, of which its estimates will ensure that we spend the money appropriately, accountably and in the way that we should.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member mentioned a whole lot of programs, and there is no doubt a lot of good in those programs. I am not downplaying that in any way, shape or form. However, the second program is literacy, a program that is hurting every community across Canada because of the cuts. The government cut a lot of money from literacy programs. As a past literacy provider, I can tell members that it is hurting some of our most vulnerable people, people who are in jobs and who cannot read, who have difficulty, who cannot progress and who are having trouble.

When we attack the ordinary, everyday person who is part of the Canadian fabric, who we are supposed to represent, we, the government, make a grievous error. I plead today for the reinstatement of these two programs.</div>

    </p><a name="Para689437"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member makes two very excellent points. On the first one, regarding Big Brothers Big Sisters, I appreciate her offer to go back and do a little bit of investigating to see where that program stands and to see if in fact what she has stated is the case.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689438"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I do want to make note of something she mentioned about Big Brothers Big Sisters. In my riding of St. Catharines, Big Brothers Big Sisters do great work. One of the many positive components of the Canada summer job programs for students is that, maybe in the member's riding but certainly in my riding, young people are participating in the program, and Big Brothers Big Sisters was one of the programs that benefited in my community. I anticipate that across the province and across the country that is also the case, showing clearly that this government shows support for Big Brothers Big Sisters. However, I take her point and certainly will look into it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689439"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will comment briefing on adult literacy. I certainly share her point, her goal and her feelings about adult literacy. It is very important in terms of adults who do not have or have not had the opportunity to learn. However, in terms of funding, we have addressed those issues, maybe not in the program that she formerly stated but let me just show from budget 2006 that we invested an additional $350 million per year in aboriginal funding for education.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689440"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also made sure that within that there was a priority that additional funds, which did not exist in any previous budgets, would certainly be there to try to address those issues of youth and ensuring that our young people, certainly aboriginal young people, have the opportunity to learn to read and write, but at the same time also ensuring that the help is there for aboriginal adults who need it. It was there in 2006 and obviously it is there in 2007 as well. </div>

I will make a small correction. Port Rupert does not exist. The funding for the Port of Prince Rupert was provided by the previous government with much insistence from this corner. I am not sure if the Conservative government is trying to take credit for the money but that is what governments do. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689442"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to my point around the environmental spending my colleague talked about. The government, by its own admission, misunderstood and much underplayed the issue of the environment for Canadians. We were slightly surprised by the vehemence of the reaction from the Canadian public when the government did not come forward with more progressive ideas. The government dragged its feet on greenhouse gases and spent most of its first 12 months blaming the previous regime's performance. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689443"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We initially did not have a problem with this because we in the NDP have consistently said that the previous government was not performing well when it came to climate change, but yet offered the Conservative government no excuse. Previous Liberal failures do not condone present Conservative failures when it comes to greenhouse gases.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689444"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member talked about the ecotrust funding. It is just by coincidence that today department officials were in front of committee. We asked them if the money had been spent because the minister had stood in his place and said the money had gone out the door. He said the cheques were not just signed, not just in the mail, but they had been cashed. However, when we checked with the provinces, no one had seen any of the money. There seems to be an enormous discrepancy here. The minister is taking much credit for all these environmental initiatives when the money has not gone out the door.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689445"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not a single string attached to this money so that it will actually lead to reductions in greenhouse gases, further continuing Canada's deplorable record on greenhouse gas emissions and delaying action from other countries.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689446"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the government actually takes credit for programs and spending on initiatives, it seems to me that it would be wise that it actually spend the money. When those members were in opposition, I know they were paying attention to the Liberal government's tendency to re-spend and re-announce and re-announce until it was beating a dead horse, but I would resist the temptation if I were that member. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689447"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that Canadians need to know what has happened. The environmental initiatives and the ecotrust funding have not happened. The money has not been spent. The money has not been delivered. The provinces have not seen it.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689448"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if my colleague could take this opportunity to clarify the record. I know he does not wish to mislead Canadians or those who are watching, but I wonder if he would like to correct the record here in the House to ensure we actually understand what is afoot.</div>

    </p><a name="Para689450"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to his point about the expenditures for the environment, this government has taken a strong approach. I take my colleague's comments about whether or not it is our job to blame previous governments, or whether it is our job to address those issues. I will not even talk about casting blame, but I will talk about what our commitments to Kyoto were supposed to be and what has not happened in the past number of years. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689451"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, to take the type of approach that the member's party would like to take would certainly bring this country's economy to its knees. That is not our intent. That is not going to be our approach. We have set money aside. We have put money in the budget. We have developed programs, including “Turning the Corner”, which speaks specifically to the issues that the member spoke to.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689452"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this budget does not pass through the Senate, the money that is booked to be spent on the environment will need to come out of this year. The difficulty that the member speaks about is a fair one in terms of where that revenue is going to come from, where it is going to go, how much is going to be spent and where it is going to be allocated.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689453"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we need to do to specifically address the issues my colleague mentioned, is to get the budget through the House and through the Senate. </div>

    </p><a name="Para689455"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that these debates are very important. For the benefit of the many Canadians who are watching at home, I would like to begin by explaining that this evening we are debating estimates. We are talking tonight about the money that is being spent, but we are also going to talk about the money that is not being spent. I expect we will hear that clearly from that side of the House by the minority Conservative government.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689456"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to remind Canadians that the Conservatives inherited from our great Liberal government the best fiscal situation in the history of Canada. Back in 1993 when the Liberals took over as government from the Conservatives, what we inherited to the great surprise to those who were elected at the time was something like a $42 billion deficit. The country was almost at a point of bankruptcy for a variety of reasons. Certainly fiscal mismanagement was a big part of that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689457"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We made a lot of commitments of things that we had wanted to do. Then we got into government and found out that it was impossible. It took years of constraints, of having to cut programs and for Canadians having to cope with all of that while we attempted to get the government out of the deficit position it was in. It was a difficult time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689458"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast to the Conservative government of today, when the Conservatives got in they found an $11 billion surplus. That is a very different thing. They had lots of money to throw around in a lot of places. That is part of the reason for the discussion tonight about some of the areas into which I would like to have seen them put some more money.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689459"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the minority Conservative government has preferred to cut many of the important programs, those that were Liberal, and they will reintroduce them under the Conservative name. Whatever they are called, they were good programs. A lot of them are being reintroduced under the Conservative logo because they were good programs. We knew what the needs of Canadians were. We were out there with our full intention to meet the needs of Canadians and to give Canadian individuals and communities the necessary tools.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689460"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the funding cuts made by the Conservatives, in spite of the surplus that the Conservatives had, targeted women in particular, students, many people who are in need of affordable housing and other groups for which the Conservatives have traditionally shown very little concern.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689461"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some $5 million was cut from Status of Women Canada. This is an organization that was established by the Liberal government just a couple of years ago, in order to give women more opportunities to be advocates for the needs of women in Canada, and to make sure that women's voices were being heard loud and clear.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689462"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was $45 million cut from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation programs. This was done at a time when we are hearing more and more about the needs for affordable housing throughout the country. We had a minister of housing under the previous Liberal government who was working with the provinces to ensure that affordable housing would be built throughout our country. We had committed around $675 million to the province of Ontario alone to build affordable housing and $45 million was cut from that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689463"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was $10 million cut with the elimination of the support for the Canadian volunteerism initiative. That is a really difficult one, given that volunteerism is such an important part of Canadian society today. So many people volunteer the utmost amount of hours. If we had to, we would never have enough money to pay people for all of what they do.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689464"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was $10 million cut with the elimination of the international youth internship program. This was a wonderful opportunity for young people to travel abroad to learn more about other countries and the rest of the world.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689465"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives cut $6 million from the Canada Firearms Centre. They cut $18 million from youth employment initiatives. We are hearing about that through the summer employment programs. There is a great need for youth employment initiatives to provide opportunities for our young people to talk about careers and focus on where they will go in the future.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689466"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was $18 million cut from the literacy skills program. It is unbelievable the number of people who still cannot read and write in Canada. If we truly want to see people in Canada aspire to be a successful citizen, they need to be able to read and write.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cut the money out of programs that are the fundamental basics that we need to have a successful country frankly was unbelievable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689468"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court challenges program, another $6 million, was looked upon as not necessary. If it was not for the court challenges program we probably would not have the Charter of Rights and Freedoms today. These cuts are from programs that are very important in the lives of Canadians.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689469"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us talk about child care and all the spaces that were not produced. What is early learning all about? Early learning is not about child care. Early learning is about investing in our youngsters from the very beginning so that we can plan a positive future for them. That came out as a result of a lot of work that was done across this country through a variety of agencies talking about how to ensure that our children can compete with those in countries abroad that are investing a lot of money in their children. That was the first social program specifically geared to early learning and child care that was going to put our children at a real advantage over many of the others.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689470"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of evidence has proven that early learning contributes immensely to the development of children and helps to give children the best start in life. Canada needs a high quality early learning and child care system, and I am not talking about a babysitting system. Early learning is very important for our precious children to get the best possible start. They need the highest quality early learning opportunities that we can provide in order to ensure that our children can grow and prosper.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689471"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever since the election of the minority Conservative government, child care and early learning have suffered immensely. The <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A>'s so-called universal child care plan is not child care. It is an allowance, much like the baby bonus that people used to receive, and it is a meagre one at that. It is taxable. It is unaccountable. Certainly it is not a plan, by any means.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689472"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> promised to provide funding for 125,000 new child care spaces. I can still hear the Prime Minister to this day saying how the Conservatives were going to produce 125,000 child care spaces. I have not seen one created yet. Once he got into power he so desperately wanted to cut the funds to child care. The Conservatives have not created one space that they can talk about.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689473"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous Liberal government had committed to give every child a good start in life. It invested $5 billion over five years for the creation of a Canada-wide system of early learning and child care based on the principles of quality, universal inclusiveness and accessibility, all very important principles.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689474"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten provinces had signed bilateral agreements to increase investments in early learning and child care. As a nation we were moving forward with our plans to create a new national system. Just getting 10 provinces to agree on something like that was a huge amount of work and something that we all desired. We had to give it time to come to fruition and we also had to have the money. It took that long to get it all together and organized. Sadly, the Conservative government cancelled all of the agreements and undid all of the good work that had been done.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689475"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cutting literacy programs, as I indicated earlier, is another heartless act by the government. Literacy reaches far and wide. To foster a healthy, vibrant economy, we must ensure that our population has strong literacy skills. If Canada is to maintain its place in the world, we must improve literacy skills, especially for our most vulnerable citizens. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689476"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can the Conservative government justify cutting $17.7 million in funding from the adult learning and literary skills program? I have not heard anybody justify it yet. The Conservatives simply say they are reinvesting it differently, and so on and so forth. I have not seen them produce a specific program to indicate they are helping adults who are suffering from literacy issues.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689477"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the Conservatives' targets is the Status of Women Canada which I mentioned earlier, which has long been on the hit list of social Conservatives. They cut the Status of Women's budget by $5 million, compromising the agency's ability to do important work and to allow for the advocacy of women and women's issues. The minority Conservative government's decision to close 12 regional offices of the Status of Women Canada leaving only four to serve Canadian women is reprehensible. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689478"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadian women are still only earning 71¢ for every dollar earned by their male counterparts. More and more women are living in poverty and we are still waiting for the government to create child care spaces. The Conservatives stood here and argued with us and said they were so proud of the 125,000 spaces they were going to create. I am looking forward to hearing, and we may hear it tonight in this discussion, where those spaces are and when we can see the official opening of those spaces. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the closure of the regional offices of the Status of Women, the government is taking away one of the very few remaining resources for women to get the kind of assistance that they need. It will also take away the government's ability to be aware of what are the issues facing women today and what is the government's role in ensuring that women have full access to opportunity. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689480"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the reason these 12 offices were created across Canada. These offices were established to assist women in advocating for equality. Clearly, the Conservative government is against that goal of equality just by the kind of cuts that it is making.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689481"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year we celebrated the 25th anniversary of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, something that I believe every one of us in this House is very proud of. The Conservatives have undermined the charter at every turn. Clearly, by cancelling the court challenges program and the Law Commission of Canada, by endangering judicial independence, and by trying to stack the courts, I do not think they believe in it at all.</div>

    </p><a name="Para689483"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The charter is the centrepiece of Canadian democracy. Its legacy is too precious for us to remain indifferent to those who would seek to undermine it. The Liberal opposition will not permit the charter to be weakened by a federal government not committed to keeping it accessible to the Canadian people. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to fight the cuts to the court challenges program, as there are other groups clearly doing the exact same thing because they understand the value of it. It had been cut some years back by the previous Mulroney government and I gather after about five years of protests the Conservatives reinstated the program because they realized just how important that was. For such a small amount of money of $6 million it delivers a huge amount of opportunity for people to be able to get their points across.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689485"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder Canadians do not trust this government. From politicizing the public service and cancelling the court challenges program to stacking the judiciary, and undermining the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, this government's ideological attacks are designed to reshape Canada to fit its narrow neo-conservative views.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for the opportunity, Mr. Speaker, to be able to join and participate in this debate tonight. It is important. Every time we talk about budgets, they are important to all of us, not only as parliamentarians but as Canadians. There is always a fair amount of benefits to the country when those budgets are there and it is important that we move forward. </div>

    </p><a name="Para689488"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can look at justice. We have had tougher legislation to deal with sexual predators, repeat offenders and conditional sentencing. We raised the age of protection.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she talks about the literacy funding being cut, we increased funding by $307 million for immigrant settlement services. We also have $6 million allocated for the protection of sexually exploited children.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we want to talk about health: vaccines for cervical cancer, wait times for prenatal aboriginal women, $120 million for the global fight against AIDS, and $7 million annual funding for the family violence initiative.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we want to talk about human resources, we have the universal child care benefit. There is $5.6 billion a year going into early learning and child care. That is twice what her party had ever given toward early learning and child care.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had the new pilot training program in New Brunswick for women in non-traditional work.

The role of government is to ensure that it meets the needs of Canadians. It is all about that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689497"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservatives clearly have their priorities and their ideology and will function that way. The Liberals want to ensure that we build a healthy Canada. When the Liberal government had to make the cuts because we had the huge deficit to deal with, all Canadians had to buckle in and live within those cuts. Once the money started coming back in, because the economy was doing well and so on, then we had the money to reinvest in people and those areas.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689498"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the Conservatives have made cuts in areas of adult literacy, youth initiatives, summer career placement program and a whole lot of the other issues that matter to those folks who are in the lower income levels. It is important that we invest in those areas. There was no reason for Conservatives to make the kind of cuts they made previously when they had an overabundance of money.</div>

This was the point I was trying to make earlier to the Conservative member of Parliament who spoke. It is all very well and good to list a whole list of things they do. It is onerous, we cannot take it in, it is so huge that nobody really knows to what money has been given.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689500"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what we do know is what the Conservatives have not done, and I want to go back to literacy. These are programs on the ground. The two Conservative members of Parliament who just spoke will have these programs in their own cities and towns. These programs deliver service to people we represent who cannot read and who need that tool.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689501"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservative government has taken $18 million out of that fund. It is extremely important that the money be reinstated. While members can list all kinds of things, we have to look at the person in the street who cannot read, the person in the street who cannot get along, people who the Liberals were actually helping. Now the Conservatives have taken that away.</div>

I spoke when the budget came down and I will repeat some of the points I made at that time.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689507"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was thinking about the budget as I was preparing for tonight. I tried to think of an analogy of what the budget was. What it reminds me of is a paint gun, one of those guns that shoot balls of paint. It is a big burst, it splatters everywhere and it makes a hell of a mess. I would make the analogy of this budget to a paint gun. It was a big burst but not a lot of meaningful initiatives for people and for many it left one big mess.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689508"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will quickly go through some of the broken promises to my and your province, Mr. Speaker. It has been profoundly impacted negatively. We heard early from my colleague about the literacy program. We have heard about the women's program. We have heard about the closing of the women's office in the city of Winnipeg, which had been such a huge support to women's groups there.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689509"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard in previous times about the cancellation of the labour market partnership, a signed agreement with the Government of Canada, not with the Liberal Party, $129 million gone.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689510"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard much about the court challenges program, in and of itself, and the merits of the program for women's groups, for other minority groups and for francophone groups. However, we have not talked about it in the context of the city of Winnipeg. It was one of the very few national programs in the city of Winnipeg and it too is gone.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689511"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the homelessness initiative, we have heard much from members opposite about their great concern about crime and young people on the street. One of the members opposite even had the audacity to say that the streets of Winnipeg were, and I really do not want to repeat it, filled with uncharitable and unkind people who were lawless and involved in crime. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689512"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time as they talk about crime, building jails, putting people behind bars and increasing the sentences, they are also cancelling funding for a major youth initiative that keeps young people off the streets. What one hand does, the other hand does not know. This has had a significant impact on my community and what it has done there.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689513"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard a lot about child care. My colleague who preceded me spoke about the impact of the loss of the child care program and the ineffectiveness of the $100 a month to families. We have heard much from members opposite about the importance of having choice.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689514"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I allege that one cannot have choice if there is no choice. What the government has basically done is removed choice for parents, the choice to go back to work, the choice to go back to school, the choice of where a child might be cared for. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689515"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the city of Winnipeg, 80% of the centres have waiting lists. The province of Manitoba was slated to receive $176 million over five years. That program was cancelled. We now know, under the current allocation, the province of Manitoba will receive an annual $9 million grant, obviously considerably less than $174 million that would have been in place for the province of Manitoba. We also know the $100 a month might provide three days of child care for a family in the city of Winnipeg.</div>
    </p><A NAME="T1920"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1920"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1925"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1915"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1920">(1920)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para689516"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city of Winnipeg and the province of Manitoba had a well laid out plan for the development of child care, for the training and development of a skilled workforce. It has gone and there is much challenge and struggle to maintain that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689517"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have to look at child care, not simply as a social issue, but as an economic issue. Women cannot go to work if they do not have the option. I have heard recently about women who have been leaving their employment because of their inability to access good, safe child care for their children. We have to be wary of that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689518"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the very large disappointments in the province of Manitoba is the funding, or the lack thereof, for the remediation of Lake Winnipeg. For many, Lake Winnipeg is a symbol. I have heard many call it their beloved Lake Winnipeg. It is a form of economic development. It is a place for recreation. It is a place for memories. It is a place for history. It is beautiful. It is an inland ocean, but unfortunately, it needs considerable remediation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689519"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous government made a commitment for the restoration of Lake Winnipeg for $120 million. What we have now is a small sum allocated now for the clean up of Lake Winnipeg, which one of my colleagues said might be enough to rake the beaches. If we are to clean up Lake Winnipeg, let us not do it in a messy way. Let us do it in a way that will have a real impact and outcome and that will serve for generations to come.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689520"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue I want to focus on, because it has a profound impact on my province and on Canadians from coast to coast to coast, is what the government has done or has not done for aboriginal people.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689521"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not belabour the cancelling of the Kelowna accord. We have talked about it in the House. We have talked about it in committee. It has been talked about in legislatures across the country. First and foremost, that has had a profound impact and disappointment. Kelowna had become a symbol of hope for many, and that hope has gone.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689522"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we hear the minister opposite speak about funding for aboriginal peoples, on budget day, March 19, I heard the minister, in the course of three hours, give three different figures. The budget document said $9.1 billion. He later said $10.1 billion. At a scrum outside the House, he used the figure $11 billion.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689523"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moneys used or portrayed as being used for aboriginal people are being provided as misinformation or not factual information to Canadians. What other group in Canada has the amount spent in its area factored out to a per person cost? We do not hear any other group singled out as how much we spend per individual in that group. That is quite shameful.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689524"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been hearing that they are taking great initiatives in aboriginal communities, but what the minister is not telling us is that he is taking dollars committed for one community and reallocating them for another community.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689525"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague, the member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78989,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78989&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Kenora</A>, told me just yesterday of two projects being cancelled in his community, one for a school and one for a treatment facility.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This truly is the biggest challenge facing Canadians within Canada. We have seen no commitment from the government. We have seen smoke and mirrors with figures. We have seen money taken from one pot and allocated to another pot, ostensibly in the guise of doing something and not talking about the community being left behind.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689531"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say that this is the greatest shame. From a high water point 18 months ago between the Government of Canada and first nations and aboriginal people across this country, we are at an all time low, a low that is now mobilizing aboriginal people across this country to a day of protest, a day of action, in order to show their displeasure, their disappointment, and the profound lack of hope that aboriginal people now have as it relates to this government.</div>

    </p><a name="Para689533"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She talked about the things that were cancelled. There will not be $1.5 billion for the Canada ecotrust, for clean air and climate change; $600 million for patient wait times guarantee, which she was concerned about; $400 million for the Canada Health Infoway; $30 million for the Rick Hansen Foundation; $100 million for aid to Afghanistan; and $100 million the Genome Canada.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689534"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She said, regarding universal child care, that if people do not have child care spaces, they will not be able to work. For those who are working, the $2,000 child tax credit will be welcomed. We believe in fairness for single earner families. We have $4.3 billion in total that includes $400 million in new tax measures. I encourage the member to think about what she is not voting for.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689535"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When she talks about an aboriginal strategy, we do have an aboriginal strategy. The $300 million will give first nation members the opportunity to own their own homes when a new approach to on reserve housing is developed. There is $14.5 million over two years to expand the aboriginal justice strategy, about which she has expressed some concern.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689536"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to remind the member that when she is speaking about all these cuts that she says happened, perhaps the money has been refocused and she will see tangible results. I would like to ask the member why she is voting against these items?</div>

It is, “Give a little here and maybe they will vote for us, give a little there and perhaps that group will vote for us”. It really is deceptive.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689538"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the aboriginal items that she cites, I would remind her that the $300 million was identified for housing in the previous budget and reannounced in this budget. I would remind her as well that the aboriginal procurement policy was cancelled. It has had a profound impact on aboriginal businesses across the country, many of whom have had to go out of business because of the cancellation of this project. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689539"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would remind her of the cancellation of the aboriginal language funding, which also is having a profound impact on aboriginal people across the country, and in some cases not allowing them to celebrate aboriginal awareness day on June 21. There are significant implications in this budget. I find it very difficult to support what I call a spattered approach.</div>

As we all remember, this budget was tabled on March 19. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689549"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are some things in this budget that really need to be pointed out. Among friends, colleagues, political parties and taxpayers, we must describe things as they really are to improve conditions for the people of Canada and, when an error has been made, we should make every effort to correct it. As you well know, enlightenment comes when ideas collide. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689550"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to talk about several points in the budget that deserve our attention. The first point deals with the Conservative government’s retention of the festival support program. I have had discussions today, and for several days, with representatives of volunteer groups and organizations which are organizing festivals planned for summer 2007. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689551"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This year, the federal government set aside $30 million for summer festivals. A large number of the organizers of these festivals have been told that the government—to be more precise, the Department of Canadian Heritage— is in the process of considering how the funds will be distributed. We are now into June and people have been told that it may be the fall before we have a clear answer on how the funds will be distributed. However, we must show some respect for the organizers of summer festivals in Quebec and elsewhere, because, after all, the seasons change. To find an analogy with what the Conservatives are doing, I think back to the Social Credit party. At one point, the Social Credit party said there were only four problems in Canada: spring, summer, fall and winter. Apart from that, everything would be fine. I must emphasize that summer festivals take place in the summer. An answer in the fall is of no use. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689552"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specifically, I would like to underline the value of a festival. What does a festival mean to the population? Today, I debated with an economist from the Institut économique de Montréal. On a radio station in my riding, CJRC, not to mention names, I heard it said that—hold tight, Mr. Speaker, or you might fall off your chair—festivals were a means of preventing movie theatres from making money. The argument was that when people went to a festival, money was going to the wrong place. They added that festivals were not something very important in economic terms, because a dollar spent at one place is like a dollar spent at another place. A festival does not result in any value added. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689553"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I really had to answer that. I would like you, Mr. Speaker, and above all my colleagues opposite—the Conservatives, of course— to understand that a festival is a way for a city, a community or a region to become better known. A festival can attract people into the community, into the region. It gets people moving from one region to another to take part in activities. That makes our region better known, and, at the same time, it brings money into the region. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689554"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, I think of the Festival de montgolfières in Gatineau, of which you are surely aware, and which for the past 20 years has taken place during the first weekend of September. It is celebrating its 20th anniversary in 2007. Last year, the festival generated revenue of $6 million. Since its creation, more than 3.3 million people have attended the festival. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689555"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The federal government invests in these programs. I must also mention that the organizers of these festivals do not count solely on the support of the federal government. They do their own fund-raising at various levels. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1935"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1935"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1940"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1930"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1935">(1935)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para689556"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the federal government does not step in as it used to, tourism will suffer. That is what the organizers told me. They will also not be able to bring in as many artists. That is another aspect. Festivals are a question of pride. People show off their culture and discover others, depending on the themes of the show, and this leads to a broadening of minds at festivals. The Conservatives are holding things up here for reasons that are really beyond me. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689557"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just wanted to point all this out to our colleagues because I am sure that they will react quite quickly when they see that what they are saying does not make any sense, especially as the money for this was approved in the budget. It is very important, therefore, to point this out. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689558"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a statistic showing that, in Quebec in the year 2000, festivals got 18% of their funding from the three levels of government: federal, provincial and municipal. That same year in the United States—our neighbour to the south where capitalism is a kind of religion—the three levels of government subsidized festivals to the tune of 23% to 26%. Maybe they thought it was important for them to add value. In France, festivals are subsidized at a rate of 47%. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689559"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Conservative colleagues should say to themselves that even though they are not providing very much, they really should make it available before the end of the summer or else we will be in an absolutely ridiculous situation. In view of this, I would like my Conservative colleagues to understand that they have to keep the commitments they made in their budget. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689560"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In regard to a completely different issue, I would like to mention a very embarrassing situation. September 25 or 26, 2006 was a black day in human history because that was when the federal government cancelled the court challenges program. The Conservative government decided last March not to renew this program, even though a great many social stakeholders from both the English and French minority communities as well as citizens rights groups demanded that it be saved. This meant that $5 or $6 million could be cut from the federal budget. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689561"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I took some political science courses at the University of Ottawa in the 1980s, and one of my professors, Mr. Carrier, told us that $1 million in the coffers of the federal government of Canada was like a penny to an average worker in Canada or Quebec. When $5 or $6 million are cut from a rights program like the court challenges program, it is clearly not very much in view of the $220 billion budgets that Canada’s federal government generally has. So this is an ideological cut. The government wants to prevent something, rather than helping citizens challenge decisions made by the federal or a provincial government or even a school board, a town or municipality, or a department that was not complying with the law of the land, that is to say, the Constitution. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689562"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The government comes with all its lawyers and sets them on a parent or business person who wants his or her rights respected. Without the court challenges program, there is no level playing field. </div>
    </p><A NAME="T1940"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1940"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1945"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1935"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1940">(1940)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para689563"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People cannot spend the kind of money that the government, the federal State, can spend on its own army of lawyers. I could provide some pretty unbelievable examples of this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689564"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, there is something even worse. We often hear our Conservative colleagues say that the Bloc Québécois did not support Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',2154793,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=2154793&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">S-3</A>, which was in fact passed—on division, as they say—in the previous Parliament.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689565"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By eliminating the court challenges program, the Conservative government is failing to respect the Official Languages Act. I would refer the members to the Standing Committee on Official Languages, which just came back to life today. The Commissioner of Official Languages, Graham Fraser, taught a very interesting lesson to all members of the committee—and we are very pleased that the Conservatives have decided to come back—about how eliminating the court challenges program violated legislation passed in this House. That is pretty serious. Those who violate laws must pay in the end. They have violated this law, and they must pay the price.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689566"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to understand a few things about this program. The committee heard witnesses who work for the program. It also heard people who fought for the Montfort Hospital, for example. That happened in the mid-1990s. We were around then; this was not something that happened back in Louis Riel's day—which is another subject about which much could be said. This was back in 1995, when the Government of Ontario wanted to do away with the services of a French-language hospital right here in Ottawa. I was born in that province, and so was my youngest daughter, my baby. She was born in the Montfort Hospital.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689567"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who came to talk about this situation had been told by a Prime Minister whom we know well, our current Prime Minister, that the Government of Canada had no intention of continuing to pay for Liberal lawyers in the court challenges program.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689568"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet Ms. Lalonde and Mr. Gratton, who attended the committee meeting, demonstrated quite clearly that the lawyers who helped the Montfort Hospital fight the indignity foisted upon it by Mike Harris' government and three of his ministers, who are now known here as the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78777,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78777&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Finance</A>, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',105835,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=105835&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of the Environment</A> and the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78772,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78772&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister of Health</A>, did it for free.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689569"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to the infamous criticism that partisan politics were involved, I would remind the House that Mr. Gratton was Brian Mulroney's press secretary. As far as I know, he did not belong to the Conservative Party, but rather to the Progressive Conservative Party. There are hints of this Reform-Alliance mindset still causing problems today. It is going to burst, sooner or later, like last time, but that is their problem. Gisèle Lalonde once ran—hold on to your hats—as a candidate for the Conservative Party of Ontario. This jambalaya—although jambalaya can sometimes be quite tasty—, all this mishmash being served up by the Conservatives, involving partisan politics when it comes to the rights of minorities, it is appalling. I see them turning red. They are ashamed, and I understand why.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, the elimination of the court challenges program, illustrated by the ideology reflected in the budget, seriously jeopardizes the recognition of the existence of French-language minority communities in Canada.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is prejudicial. The day the Montfort Hospital file reached its full scope was the day that the Premier of Quebec—Lucien Bouchard of the Parti Québécois, not to mention any names—declared that, indeed, it was seriously prejudicial. Every fighting force for democracy and the respect of the rights of minorities from Quebec and Ontario, including myself, who was in Saskatchewan at the time as president of the Fédération des francophones de Saskatoon, we all signed petitions and raised money to tell the Harris government that it was unacceptable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689572"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course the Liberal government—this was during the Chrétien years—looked at the issue and said it could not intervene because it was a provincial jurisdiction. Well, now would be the time for Canada to pull up its socks and get to work, because, under such circumstances, it is through the court challenges program and political action that we must ensure the rights of minorities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689573"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court challenges program also has an impact on the social aspect of the fight against poverty and injustice. For example, people with disabilities had to fight their own government, demanding that it install ramps so they could have access to the same services as people with full mobility. We must not forget this.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689574"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A broad range of services was provided to society. In 1997 and 2003, evaluations of the court challenges program determined that the needs of Quebec and Canadian society were well served by the program. Without it, we would not have rights of access to minority language education. The disabled would not be able to access certain areas and premises. It is very important to take note of these facts.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689575"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the Fédération des communautés francophones et acadienne du Canada is taking the government to court because it abolished the court challenges program and is not fulfilling its obligations under the Official Languages Act. My colleagues should hang on to their hats when they hear what I have to say. This government says that it wanted to abolish the program because, among other things, it no longer wished to pay lawyers who challenge federal or provincial governments, school boards or others who do not respect these rights. That is why it abolished the program. Now it is paying lawyers to ensure that it does not pay lawyers in future. Talk about unbelievable. The logic is rather complicated.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689576"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question that the court challenges program must be reinstated. We must realize that society evolves. By way of illustration, consider that at one time horses ruled the road. Then along came the Model T Ford. Today, things are altogether different; we have other means of transportation. In terms of citizens' rights, we cannot predict how current situations will unfold in the near future. Therefore, it is important to have the court challenges program, precisely to protect the state from itself.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the movie, <i>The Name of the Rose</i>, based on the novel by Umberto Eco, old Jorge, a professional criminal, believes only in sublime repetition. The Conservatives are the sublime copy of the Mulroney Conservatives. They are doing the same thing—abolishing the court challenges program in today's context. It is quite deplorable.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689578"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should be emulating William of Baskerville. I recommend reading about the dialectic that belongs to society. In fact, we are evolving.

Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.)</A>: </b><span class="nextIntervention"><a class="nav_link" href="#Int-2136530"><img src="/common/images/arrow2_left.gif" border="0" alt="previous intervention"></a></span>&nbsp;</div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I listened very intently to my colleague. This is not a debate about the budget. This is a debate about the estimates.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689590"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say that in my 10 years in Parliament one of the things that I have come to realize is that intent matters with the government. My hon. Bloc colleague did talk about the meanspirited way in which the government has dealt with many things. He referred to some of the vestiges of the Harris Ontario government, the triumvirate, the ministers of health, finance and environment, that we actually see very much in evidence in this Parliament.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689591"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I recognize that while there are many things that make the Bloc unique in some of its approaches, I find that its social approaches to many of the solutions in Parliament are actually quite aligned with the Liberal Party.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689592"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to refer to something very specific in my riding. The Kitchener-Waterloo Multicultural Centre in my riding has actually put forward a stunning presentation. It is a very integral part of my riding which is the fourth largest settlement area for new Canadians in Canada, despite the fact that as a region we are only half a million people.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689593"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a proposal for ethnocultural racial minorities to participate in public decision making. The centre had been through many levels of scrutiny and I think had actually been agreed to by three different levels of government which said this was something worthwhile doing.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689594"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three program officers and departmental approval was gained. Yet, at the very final hour, as a matter of fact today, it found out that this wonderful project was not going to receive funding. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689595"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar thing happened with the K-W counselling services in my riding as well. These services fit perfectly with the criteria that the government was saying it wanted in order to engage new Canadians in order to make a good community. Yet, the government decided that this funding was not worthwhile.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689596"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask my colleague from the Bloc this question. Has he seen similar cutbacks in the fundamental bedrock of what helps define communities, not only in Kitchener Centre, but right across Canada? Has he experienced the fact that to the government their intent matters. The government believes in the trickle down theory, that there is only a certain sector of Canada that it is speaking to, and it happens to be its electorate. If people do not fall into that minority then they are not covered by the priorities of the government. Would my colleague like to comment on that?</div>

    </p><a name="Para689598"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to my riding, and in reference to her example, I will speak of the Canada Summer Jobs program. The federal government has decided to go with a new way of doing things. The former program worked well. It seems that, when things are working well, our Conservative colleagues have a knack for dismantling them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689599"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our multi-ethnic organizations are probably smaller than those in my colleague's riding. Nevertheless, we do have an Arab community and a Portuguese community. I am thinking of self-help and anti-poverty organizations, which provided young people with summer jobs in youth job cooperatives or summer camps that were axed because of a set of criteria developed by the government that did not make sense.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689600"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the Bloc Québécois, the New Democratic Party, the Liberal Party of Canada and community groups—those affected first and the fabric of our society—challenged the government. I have to acknowledge the Conservatives for recognizing that they made mistakes. However, that is as far as I will go because they have not recognized all their mistakes. They should have kept what was working well.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689601"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will therefore say to my hon. colleague that my riding has experienced certain difficulties in that regard. An element of unfairness is introduced when using a points-based assessment, and when riding officials no longer have a say and everything is sent to Montreal—which is a lovely city but where the people are not familiar with the social fabric and events in the Gatineau riding—rather than relying on the work of government employees who are very familiar with the riding. I empathize with the multicultural communities, which unfortunately—and I did use the term unfortunately—have had to pay the price for this lack of judgment. But there is always hope. One never knows. Perhaps our colleagues will come to their senses in this matter?</div>

These estimates before us give a road map of where the government intends to take this country. Normally one would expect to see within all of these numbers a vision, a plan for building a country, a plan for building a country with a vision of prosperity, equality and justice for all people. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689603"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, after all, is the objective of government, is it not? We are here as an institution that stands for upholding the rights of people and ensuring that government works for all the people all of the time. When we see a budget or a set of spending estimates that helps only a tiny portion of the people in this land, we have to stand on behalf of those Canadians and make sure they are counted. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689604"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tonight, many, many thousands of people across this nation are not counted. They are not part of these spending estimates, because the government has decided that its aim and objective is to enhance the lives of those who are already well off, those who are already living in the lap of luxury, and to ignore the vast majority of Canadians who struggle each and every day to make a living to sustain themselves and their families.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689605"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tonight I want to speak for my kids, Mr. Speaker, who I hope are watching tonight. I know you would probably say, “I really wonder about that”, but I am hoping that my son Joe, who is 18, and my son Nick, who is 22, are watching tonight because they know the importance of this place and they know why I am here and what I am trying to do.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689606"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, Mr. Speaker, like you and others in my caucus, I am trying to stand up for those young people who have so much to give to this country and need to be afforded every opportunity. They do not come with their hands out; they come with the ambition, the vision and the dreams of building a better world. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689607"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of my older son Nick, who is 22, he happens to have a disability, but he lives in a group home. Thanks to the government of Manitoba, which has its spending priorities right, he is able to live with dignity and make a difference and contribute to our society. He is not looking for a handout. He is looking to be recognized for his talents and to put them to the use that God has given him.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689608"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, he is able to make a difference in the lives of people around him. It is not a wasted dollar. It is a dollar well spent, because for every dollar we invest in children and people with disabilities we get many dollars back. Statistics show that for every dollar we invest in a child with a disability we get $7 back.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689609"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us start thinking about proper economics in this case and try to get this government onto a sound fiscal footing, which it has not been on up to this point. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689610"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give members some lessons from other provinces like Manitoba, which has had an NDP government for three consecutive terms, making history in this country. Let me speak about the unending number of budgets under the Tommy Douglas government in Saskatchewan that have given this nation an example of and a model for what fiscal prudence and fiscal planning are all about. It means ensuring that everyone, the least among us, is able to afford the greatest niceties in life, to enjoy as much as those with money and wealth in their pockets.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689611"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is about ensuring that everyone among us is able to live under his or her own fig tree, as Tommy Douglas always used to say, without fear, without worry and without trepidation, regardless of their circumstances, their abilities, their colour of skin, their sex or their gender or their geography. Here tonight we aim to try to focus the government on that principle about a balanced approach to government to ensure that everyone among us able to achieve his or her fullest potential. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also speak tonight for some young kids from the Point Douglas area in my constituency, who have just had the great honour of meeting our Governor General. Point Douglas is among the poorest neighbourhoods in the country. It is a place where people struggle day to day and strive to make a difference despite great odds.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689613"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Governor General visited this area and said the following:</div>
    </p><a name="Para689614"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Yet despite all the sadness, the fear, and the trepidation, I also met a community that had decided once and for all to break the silence and transform their community into a space where security, solidarity and compassion would prevail.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para689615"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what this community is like. That is what so many communities across this country are like. They want to be a place of security where there is great quality of life. They expect government to work with them as partners to build those communities of safety, security, decency and civility.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why this budget is so important. That is why these estimates have to be dissected and debated. The government has its plans and priorities all wrong. It has followed for too long the past governments of this land that have whittled away our huge surpluses and have taken available money and put it against one cause only, and that was the debt, regardless of what difference that made in the lives of this nation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689617"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimates tonight are about looking for fiscal wisdom, for balanced fiscal planning, for prudence, and for ensuring that we live up to all of our responsibilities as government. Yet the Conservative government, like the previous ones over the last 10 or 20 years, has chosen instead to invest in those areas that have the least amount of spinoff and benefit for the rest of the country but which enhance the wealth, the status and the power of a very few in our society today.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689618"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is anything a budget should do, anything these spending estimates should do, it should be to narrow the gap between the rich and the poor. It should be to narrow the gap between the most wealthy and the rest of Canadians. It should be to support and help ordinary families, working people like those in Transcona, Winnipeg North, Sherbrooke or Regina. People work hard in this country and they do not want a handout, as I said, but they do want the support of government to make a difference.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689619"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This budget does not do one thing to close the prosperity gap. In fact, it makes the problem worse rather than better. Let us look at the spending priorities of the government. Let us look at the fiscal management of the Conservatives. Let me look at the wisdom of a few things.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689620"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the Conservatives decided to give a tax break to Canadians and reduced the GST by 1%, which cost about $5 billion. Their own records show, by a freedom of information request exercised by a member of the media, that in fact this $5 billion has not made any difference in the lives of ordinary Canadians. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689621"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has not made life easier. It has not made it possible to buy essential goods. It has not brought down the price of gas. That $5 billion has not made housing more affordable. The government has not done anything except scatter $5 billion across this land without any impact and without any significant or lasting end product. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689622"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us imagine what we could do with that $5 billion. Let us imagine that we were going to live up to the Atlantic accord and we put $1 billion there. Let us make sure that we at least keep our word, we would say, and then we would work on a formula that made sense. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689623"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if we took $1 billion of that and, instead of giving zero to our first nations communities, actually gave them $1 billion to help them deal with decrepit housing conditions, third world housing conditions that are an embarrassment around the world? Canada has a blemished reputation around the world because of that.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689624"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if we took $1 billion and actually saved the child care program? What if we actually took that $1 billion and provided families with the certainty that their kids were in a safe place when they went off to work to make a living to support themselves and their families?</div>
    </p><A NAME="T2010"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2010"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2015"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2005"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2010">(2010)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para689625"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if we in fact saw that this money invested in day care multiplied? What if we recognized that this is not just about giving money to families? The Conservatives probably would think it is going to women who should be at home or to families who really do not need it, but in fact it is going to the ordinary families who are trying to work for a living and need care for their children. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689626"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if we looked beyond just that issue about supporting families and looked at the economic dividends? What if we look at it as this article did in the <i>Winnipeg Free Press</i> of May 12, in an article by Laura Rance? A researcher showed, says Rance, the following:</div>
    </p><a name="Para689627"></a><p>
      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Her research found that 12 licensed child care nurseries providing services for just under 400 households in the Parkland region north of Riding Mountain National Park were worth $1.73 million to the economy of six rural municipalities and five towns and villages. </small></td>

</div>

      <div>
        <table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
          <tr valign="top">
            <td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>As that money rippled through the economy, it produced $2.74 million in additional direct and indirect benefits. It employed 76 people full- and part-time in addition to creating an additional 28 jobs. Meanwhile, parents using the child care services generated $12.4 million in income.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
    </p><a name="Para689629"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The findings were similar in many other places, the research showed.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689630"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what we mean. We are not talking about frittering away money. We are talking about investing money in areas that produce multiple effects and achieve different objectives.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689631"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, we help those families support themselves. We make sure they are not under stress and their kids are not uncared for in poor and unsafe situations. Good enough, because we know the savings from that would be enormous. If we can keep families from becoming dysfunctional, if we can keep kids from falling between the cracks, we will save millions and billions of dollars down the road. What if we understood, though, that every dollar we invest in child care produced another dollar in the economy, just as the writer in the <i>Winnipeg Free Press</i> said?</div>
    </p><a name="Para689632"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member for <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78580,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78580&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Selkirk—Interlake</A> should take note of this. He should know that in fact his government has quashed all hopes for rural day care. He should know what a difference it would make to his community and to rural communities everywhere if families had the day care they needed, if workers had the jobs they wanted, and if the communities had the economic spinoffs they needed. That is just one example to think about.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689633"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us think about the government and its $9.2 billion in unanticipated surplus, which is because of lowballing. That is because the Conservatives are doing what the Liberals did for all those years. They refuse to give us proper economic forecasts. Therefore, if they end up being in the position of having to spend that money on needs of Canadians, they can say, “Well, we did not know and therefore we have to put it all against the debt”. Hogwash. They knew darn well that there was extra money. They knew darn well that it was not $9.2 billion when we got these estimates. It is now at $9.7 billion or $10 billion, all of it gone against the debt. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689634"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not disagree with some money going against the debt. We know that is important. As homeowners, we know that we have to try to pay off our mortgage as well as look after our family's needs, but we do not put all of our money against the house if our kids need to go to university and we need some of that money, or if the roof is leaking. As I have said so many times in this House, we do not just put it all in one place if there are many needs. We try to ensure that the needs of our family are met, just as a responsible government would try to ensure that the needs of all communities in this country are met.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689635"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us imagine if we had taken, say, $3 billion off that $10 billion and put it against the debt, which is reasonable. That would bring our debt to GDP ratio down to below that of most industrialized countries. Let us imagine, then, that we still had $6 billion or $7 billion left to help build this country. We could invest in infrastructure, where we have a $60 billion deficit that is getting bigger every day because the bad roads are getting worse, the weak bridges are caving in, and the sewers are getting holes. Who knows? Things go from bad to worse if we do not invest. Obviously I am not a city maintenance person or an engineer, but I do know bad roads when I see them, and I know they get worse over time if we do not repair them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689636"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if we invested some of that money in our declining infrastructure, which would then build up the attractiveness of cities, make people enjoy their communities more, and let people get to work and home more quickly?</div>
    </p><a name="Para689637"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What if we put some of that money into environmental projects which actually would help ensure that we save this planet? What if we took some of that money from those billions and put just a bit of it into saving the oceans?</div>
    </p><A NAME="T2015"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2015"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a>&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2010"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2015">(2015)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a name="Para689638"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We just had the David Suzuki Foundation at our committee saying the oceans are just about dead. It asked for some money to protect some marine projects. What did it get from the government? It got $9 million. As I said at committee, never mind a drop in the bucket, it is a teardrop in the ocean.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689639"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It makes us want to cry when we see the poor judgment of the government and what it is doing to future generations. It is our environment that is at risk. It is the lives of our kids that are at risk. It is the industries and the economic sectors in this country that are at risk because we are not investing in them.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689640"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to the prosperity gap, we are at an all time high in terms of the width of that gap. In fact, the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives has said that we are in a situation now that we have not seen in 30 years. We are seeing those at the top end of the income scale making more in one week than a vast majority of Canadians can hope to earn in a year.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689641"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at some of the executive benefits for CEO bank heads and we look at the packages they get, like the $6 million that the head of CIBC takes home, and compare that to the fact that this is a bank that would not even pay the $30,000 that is owed to the bank tellers. It would not even pay for the overtime worked by bank tellers. That is symptomatic of this society and this government. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689642"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have policies now that widen the gap. Instead of dealing with the problems left by the Liberals, the Conservatives are making them worse. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689643"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, here are the biggest concerns that I have had with the Liberal government. It failed to keep its child care promise until 13 years after the first day that it made it. All those kids in those 13 years ended up in difficult situations and their families had to struggle even more.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689644"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It killed the national housing program, so that we are the only nation in the industrialized world that does not have a national housing policy. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689645"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It refused to address the deplorable living and housing conditions of our first nations on reserves and our aboriginal people everywhere. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689646"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It refused in fact to advance seriously on environmental projects and urban transit.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689647"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One more thing that really grates me, and I am sure others, is that it cut the core funding out of women's groups.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689648"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the Liberals have the gall to stand up and complain about what the Conservatives did to take more money away so that more offices closed and more people are living with poor housing. Goodness gracious, they caused the problem in the first place, so at least stand up and admit it. At least stand up and say, “We made a mistake and we do not want the Conservatives to do the same thing”, because that was the very beginning of deep erosion in this country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689649"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen it in my own constituency. Ten years ago the housing started to deteriorate, exactly at the same time that the Liberals cut away any programs that people could draw on to restore housing, to renew housing, to build new housing, to develop social housing, and to explore and expand co-op housing. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689650"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It all came to a dead halt. Except for the bits that the province had been able to pull together, except for the money that the NDP managed to get out of that Liberal minority government, and except for some generous charitable organizations like Habitat for Humanity, we would be nowhere.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689651"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is, we can put a few band-aids on the situation, but that is not going to hold us in good stead for very long. We need the federal government working in partnership with us, with communities like Winnipeg North, with Just Housing, with North End Community Renewal Corporation, with North End Women's Resource Centre, with Nadinawe, and all of the other organizations that are so determined to make a difference.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689652"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are groups and organizations that see the value of helping others to help themselves. They only expect that much of government. I ask members today, is that too much for us to expect of our government?</div>

    </p><a name="Para689654"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She talked about her disabled son. I want to remind her that she would probably enjoy the Canada disability savings grant of $1,000 annually to promote the financial security of the children of lower income families. Many parents of disabled children asked for the registered disability savings plan, which will help parents to save money and care for their families.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot forget the $45 million of the new enabling accessibility fund to help Canadians recovering from or dealing with challenges to participate in their communities.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689656"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member talked about child care. We have a plan. We have a strategy and it is comprehensive. It is three tiered. We work with the provinces and will allocate $250 million for them to create spaces. We work with businesses and we have given them tax incentives to put toward creating spaces in their business, up to $10,000 through taxation.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689657"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of all we have given families the universal child care benefit of $100 to each and every child under the age of six. There is a $2,000 tax benefit that goes to every child under the age of 18.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689658"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remind the member, when she is acknowledging the good news that our budgets have brought, that we do have a strategy. It is comprehensive and we do have a vision, far from what I have seen. </div>

She misses the point and that has been the problem with this whole budget. Little tax credits, deductions, and tax incentives do not create programs that make a difference and ensure that everyone is able to be treated equally.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689661"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tax credit for people with disabilities will help those who have put away all kinds of money. How many people with disabilities does the parliamentary secretary know that are so wealthy they can put aside all this money so that they can then have tax credits to support themselves in their adult lives? It does not make any sense.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689662"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does she know how far that money would go if in fact we took the money for that tax credit and put it into housing for people with disabilities, into programs that gave better salaries to the people who look after those people with disabilities, and if we helped to support communities rather than to give out little tax incentives that do not go very far?</div>
    </p><a name="Para689663"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at a similar tax incentive, the child tax credit. How is it that the government can stand and support a tax credit that actually gives more money to a family with one person at home that is making $100,000? That family gets more of a child tax credit than a single parent mother making less than $30,000. How is that justice? Would we not want to try to correct those kinds of inequities?</div>

A tax deduction is money taken away. Tax credits actually invest money in the economy.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689672"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I wish my colleague would be a little less insulting of Canadians. I look around this room and see my colleagues from York and PEI and my friends from Saskatoon, Quebec and Rimouski. There is not a member in the House who does not believe in supporting Canadians and helping kids. We just have different ways of getting there. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689673"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conservatives believe in empowering families through lower taxes and economic growth and giving parents more choice in how they want to raise their kids. We have a different way of doing things and the NDP has a way of doing things. Neither she nor I care any less or more about kids than the other. I will not impugn her motives because her political ideology is different than mine.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689674"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish she would perhaps show a little more sophistication in terms of respecting the intelligence of Canadians as they choose which political party best represents the best way to get to what we all want, which is a strong Canada.</div>

    </p><a name="Para689749"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had asked the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78775,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78775&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister for la Francophonie and Official Languages</A> some questions following certain events and decisions taken by the government. The questions had to do with the text panels filled with errors in French at Vimy, the appointment of a unilingual English ombudsman for victims of crime, and the elimination of compulsory bilingualism for the senior ranks of the army. On those issues, we wanted to know what the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> or the minister had to say to the Commissioner of Official Languages regarding the way the Conservative government is trampling the rights of linguistic minorities. The situation is not getting any better in that regard, especially considering the court challenges program.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689750"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today in the Standing Committee on Official Languages we had the pleasure of receiving the Commissioner of Official Languages. He told us that the Conservative government is absolutely not obeying former Bill <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Document',1426991,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Document&amp;ResourceID=1426991&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">S-3</A>, which was passed during the last Parliament and implemented things and gave more teeth to the Official Languages Act, to section 7 among other things. Eliminating the court challenges program is another breach of the act.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689751"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78738,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78738&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Prime Minister</A> tells us that he wants to eliminate this program because his government will respect the Canadian Constitution and we will therefore no longer need the court challenges program. The Commissioner of Official Languages made it quite clear that we do indeed need this type of program. Furthermore, Mr. Matte, the chair of the court challenges program, and Gisèle Lalonde, who advocated for the Montfort Hospital thanks to this program, illustrated the need for this program.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689752"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government cannot force a province, a school board or any agency in society that does not recognize or respect the Canadian Constitution. In Canada, some citizens have to pressure the government through the court in order to have their rights respected and the government shows up with a whole host of lawyers. These agencies do not have the money they need to deal with the expertise before them. The court challenges program is so very necessary.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689753"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of this situation, I want to know what my Conservative colleagues have to say to the Commissioner of Official Languages about their non-respect for the application of the Official Languages Act, with respect to the examples I have just given. </div>

    </p><a name="Para689755"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our government is firmly committed to supporting and promoting official language minority communities. We have signed agreements with the provinces and territories on services and education to the tune of $1.18 billion over four years. Dozens of other funding agreements with groups and community organizations have also been concluded, as well as cooperation agreements with the provinces and territories on minority language services to the tune of $64 million over four years. </div>

By providing better programs and services in French-language day cares, schools and universities, where francophones are in the minority, our goal is to allow young Canadians to start, continue and complete their studies in their language.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689757"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Government of Canada is allocating $80 million per year to second language education programs to support official language education for 2.4 million young Canadians. Our government recognizes that official language minority communities face huge challenges, and we want to support them in a very real way through investments designed to help them develop and thrive. </div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October, the <A class="WebOption" onclick="GetWebOptions('PRISM','Affiliation',78775,'1');return false;" onmouseout="inDiv=0;setTimeout('TimeoutHide()',1000);return false;" HREF="/HousePublications/GetWebOptionsCallBack.aspx?SourceSystem=PRISM&amp;ResourceType=Affiliation&amp;ResourceID=78775&amp;language=1&amp;DisplayMode=2">Minister for la Francophonie and Official Languages</A> co-chaired the Ministerial Conference on the Canadian Francophonie. There is a great spirit of cooperation among various levels of government, a spirit of cooperation that has enabled us to support minority rights. In that respect, I am delighted that Quebec has once again become a full partner in our efforts to support la Francophonie. Quebec is the cradle of Canadian Francophonie, and the support of our partners in Quebec is vital to the development of French throughout Canada. </div>
    </p><a name="Para689759"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cooperation with our partners has had a number of positive results, including: an education agreement with Ontario worth over $300 million for 2005-06 to 2008-09 to support minority language education and second language learning; a special agreement with New Brunswick to establish two school and community centres; funds to set up a New Brunswick institute to support the development of second language education across Canada; and financial support for various festivals and cultural events, such as the Franco-Ontarian Festival, <i>L'écho d'un peuple</i> in Ontario, Quebec 2008 and the États généraux des arts et de la culture in Caraquet.</div>
    </p><a name="Para689760"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, with respect to immigration, the government has developed a plan to encourage francophone immigrants to settle in minority language communities. This is crucial to the future and the vitality of official language minority communities. With this summary—</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This file is damaging to French-language minority communities, just as it is damaging to anyone who believes the Constitution should protect the rights of vulnerable people in our society. Furthermore, the Commissioner of Official Languages and other key players in Quebec and Canadian society have demonstrated that this program has helped to strengthen the fight against assimilation. It is a very important tool for those communities.</div>

We are making new investments to ensure the development of both official languages throughout the country. In April, we announced that five minority communities would participate in a pilot project to analysed the effects of French-language enriched services on linguistic, cultural and overall development of pre-school children. Our government has made a commitment of $10.8 million over five years for this pilot project.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In budget 2007, the government increased funding for official language minority communities by an additional $30 million over two years. These monies will finance cultural and extra-curricular activities, community centres as well as activities that will help enhance the benefits related to linguistic duality for children. This is in addition to the $751.3 million over five years provided by the action plan for official languages.</div>
