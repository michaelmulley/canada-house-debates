	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Labour and Deputy 
Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.)</B> 
moved that Bill C-3, an act to amend the Canada Labour Code 
(nuclear undertakings) and to make a related amendment to another 
act, be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am happy to rise this morning to present 
to the House Bill C-3, an act to amend the Canada Labour Code 
(nuclear undertakings) and to make a related amendment to another 
act. This bill is aimed at promoting stable and productive labour 
relations at Canada's nuclear plants.
<P>
	I first want to point out that this legislative measure does not 
diminish in any way Canada's responsibility to protect people 
against radiation from some nuclear plants.
<P>
	In 1993, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that Part I of the 
Canada Labour Code applied to some Hydro Ontario employees, 
namely all those working at nuclear plants, which are subject to 
section 18 of the Atomic Energy Control Act. This section deals 
with nuclear plants that are declared to be for the general advantage 
of Canada.
<P>
	The Supreme Court made this statement following a 1988 ruling 
by the Ontario Labour Relations Board that it was not 
constitutionally qualified to hear an accreditation application from 
the Society of Ontario Hydro Professional and Administrative 
Employees.
<P>
	This decision was appealed to the Ontario courts, then to the 
Supreme Court of Canada, which ruled that Part I of the Canada 
Labour Code governing labour relations applied to Hydro Ontario's 
nuclear plant workers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Subsequently it was clear that part II and part III of the code, 
along with the Non-Smokers' Health Act, also applied to these 
workers. Part II of the code covers occupational safety and health 
and part III covers labour standards.
<P>
	In practical terms the results of the decision means that 
approximately 42 per cent of Ontario Hydro's employees are under 
the jurisdiction of the Government of Canada and the remainder are 
subject to the labour laws of Ontario.
<P>
<B>(1005)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is clear that two separate labour legislations applying to a 
single group of employees constitutes an exceptional situation. But 
while being exceptional, this particular and complex situation 
causes problems to the employees, their union and Hydro Ontario. 
These problems result from having to work under two similar but 
slightly different labour systems.
<P>
	For example, while producing the same effects, occupational 
health and safety regulations may vary.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There are some differences between federal and provincial 
technical specifications for the design of scaffolding. However, the 
cost of replacing scaffolding to meet federal requirements would 
not provide a corresponding improvement in safety.
<P>
	A similar situation applies to portable power tools. Under federal 
legislation, portable power tools must meet standards set by the 
Canadian Standards Association but Ontario Hydro requires that 
three-pronged CSA approved plugs on portable power tools be 
replaced with a twist lock plug. Replacing all plugs and outlets or 
seeking the approval of the Canadian Standards Association for the 
twist lock plug would result in substantial costs with no 
corresponding improvement in safety.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	These few examples go to show that split jurisdictions are 
inefficient, entail costs to companies and governments and do not 
produce any real benefit. After consideration, Ontario Hydro 
concluded that workers are provided the same protection under 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="466"> 466 </A></B>
<P>
provincial and  federal laws, even if the means prescribed to ensure 
this protection may differ.
<P>
	However, these differences add to costs but the employees' 
safety is not enhanced in any way as a result.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Regarding collective bargaining, the company and unions must 
contend with two conciliation processes in the negotiation of 
collective agreements. Ontario Hydro and the unions have a 
longstanding collective bargaining relationship under the 
provincial regime going back 50 years.
<P>
	Because of these concerns, early in 1994 federal and provincial 
government officials began to discuss the complicated issue of how 
to apply provincial law to Ontario Hydro. Initially the talks, which 
also included the company and the union, focused on occupational 
safety and health law. As talks progressed between my officials and 
their provincial counterparts, Ontario officials expressed the desire 
to have all provincial labour laws apply to the province's nuclear 
facilities.
<P>
	Federal officials agreed that from a practical standpoint it would 
be logical to have all provincial labour law apply to Ontario Hydro 
as well as any ad hoc labour legislation the province might adopt in 
the future.
<P>
	Because of the difficulties produced by a split jurisdiction and 
the type of work done at Ontario Hydro, it is felt that the 
application of provincial labour legislation would be the best 
guarantee of efficient and stable labour relations at Ontario Hydro.
<P>
	The effects of the 1993 Supreme Court ruling did not stop at the 
province of Ontario, but are also relevant as far as Point LePreau 
generating station in New Brunswick and Quebec's Gentilly II. 
Both provincial crowns appear to be in a legislative void for the 
purposes of labour law, although in practice provincial laws 
continue to be applied.
<P>
	In the case of Gentilly II this was confirmed by a 1995 Federal 
Court of Appeal decision. In its decision the Federal Court invited 
Parliament to forthwith fill the void.
<P>
<B>(1010)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I must point out that the bill before the House does not affect in 
any way the Canadian government's responsibility concerning 
radiation protection in nuclear plants. Today we are setting a 
legislative framework for the transfer to the provinces-be it 
Quebec, New Brunswick, Ontario or even Saskatchewan, because 
federal and provincial apply to mines-of our jurisdiction over 
labour under the Labour Code and related legislation.
<P>
	Of course, in Quebec's case, it is quite simple, because we are 
just not involved over there. Workers there are  governed by 
provincial labour laws. So, immediately after this legislation is 
passed, we expect Quebec to submit its draft regulations, upon 
which the federal jurisdiction over labour will be transferred.
<P>
	It is up to the Atomic Energy Control Board to ensure this kind 
of protection. The proposed changes will have no impact on the 
board's mandate in this regard.
<P>
	For many years, conventional, that is non nuclear, occupational 
safety and health legislation administered by the provinces have 
coexisted with the provisions of the Atomic Energy Control Act 
regarding radiation protection.
<P>
	This sharing of responsibility between provincial governments 
and the Atomic Energy Control Board does not pose any problem 
and never raised any concerns over nuclear safety.
<P>
	Finally, as regards the other act amended by the bill, hon. 
members can rest assured that the Ontario legislation governing the 
use of tobacco in the workplace protects workers as well as the 
corresponding federal measure does. Consequently, one should not 
be concerned if we transfer the powers provided in the 
Non-smokers' Health Act. Provincial legislation is as good as ours.
<P>
	This is what led us to introduce this bill today.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	By simply amending the Canada Labour Code and the 
Non-Smokers' Health Act, the federal government will provide a 
mechanism that allows for the application of provincial labour law 
at nuclear facilities. It is a move that makes much sense in terms of 
promoting efficient and stable labour relations in these industries.
<P>
	The bill provides a mechanism to eliminate the split jurisdiction 
in Ontario and can also be applied in New Brunswick and Quebec, 
as I stated before. In addition, the mechanism may be applied to the 
uranium mines in Saskatchewan which are also regulated by the 
Atomic Energy Control Act.
<P>
	Let us begin with the split jurisdiction in Ontario. At present, the 
company is faced with having to comply with two sets of labour 
legislation, one federal and one provincial. The bill provides a 
mechanism to correct that. It works this way. First, the company is 
exempted from having to comply with the Canada Labour Code. At 
the same time, it is made subject to provincial labour laws which 
are incorporated by reference into federal regulations.
<P>
	The mechanism may be triggered by passing regulations in 
respect of industrial relations, including ad hoc or emergency 
legislation, occupational safety and health, labour standards or 
workplace smoking rules and regulations. Once the regulations are 
in place, provincial labour laws may be applied to nuclear 
facilities.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="467"> 467 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to turn now to some specific points regarding the 
ramifications of the bill. Regarding occupational safety and health, 
the bill provides that provincial occupational safety and health 
inspectors may carry out on site inspections. The bill also allows 
the provincial labour relations board to hear and determine cases 
in respect of labour relations law applying to these nuclear 
facilities.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	In this case of collective bargaining any bargaining agent that 
was recognized under part I of the Canada Labour Code remains 
the bargaining agent under the provision of this bill. This ensures 
successor rights to the bargaining agent and prohibits other unions 
from applying to represent that bargaining unit outside of regular 
procedures.
<P>
	Any collective agreement concluded under part I of the Canada 
Labour Code continues in force until the life of the contract 
expires. This ensures the rights, privileges and duties of both 
parties to the collective agreement remain intact.
<P>
	Other provisions in the bill deal with the application of 
regulations, administration, the penalty for committing an offence, 
responsibility for prosecutions and the disposition of any fines that 
might be levied.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As hon. members know, the government pledged to manage its 
finances efficiently and to ensure that the administrative authority 
rests with the level of government that is best able to exercise that 
authority. By passing the amendments before us today, the 
government will fulfil that commitment.
<P>
	In conclusion, I want to re-emphasize that these changes do not 
weaken the authority and the responsibility of the Atomic Energy 
Control Board in the least, since we would be going back to the 
structure that existed before the related 1993 Supreme Court 
decision.
<P>
	It is because that structure worked very well that I ask hon. 
members to support Bill C-3. With leave of the House, if there is 
unanimous consent, we could agree that, instead of referring this 
bill to the human resources development committee, we could 
discuss it here in committee of the whole and then proceed 
immediately with third reading.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> There has been a request by 
the hon. Minister of Labour for unanimous consent that we proceed 
in all stages through committee of the whole as opposed to the 
standing committee.
<P>
	Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to begin, as tradition dictates, with my 
congratulations to the new Minister of Labour on the 
responsibilities conferred upon him by the Prime Minister this past 
January. I am certain he will be equal to those responsibilities, and 
I know that his community, both the people of Saint-Léonard and 
the members of his community of origin, must be extremely proud 
to see one of their own rise to such heights, knowing the great 
influence that goes with the position.
<P>
	Before going to the heart of the subject, I would like to state that 
I would have liked to see him begin his career as Minister of 
Labour begin by introducing legislation similar to Quebec's 
anti-scab legislation. I have no doubt that he will do so in the 
coming days and months, and this will represent a real test of his 
influence within Cabinet. I am issuing this friendly challenge to 
him, in the certainty that he will be capable of honouring that 
commitment.
<P>
	The Bloc supports the bill most enthusiastically, for in the end it 
represents a delegation of powers, as we have said. The thought has 
crossed our minds that, if the Minister of Labour respects his 
commitments properly, he could be moved to the 
intergovernmental relations portfolio and, inspired by the 
dynamics of Bill C-3, step up the return of powers to the provinces.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	Essentially, as the Minister has pointed out, we are remedying a 
situation in which, if he did not act, there would have been a very 
real risk of split labour relations jurisdiction in three nuclear 
facilities, as well as in the Saskatchewan uranium mines.
<P>
	As the minister has said, the 1993 Supreme Court ruled that 
labour relations relating to nuclear facilities came under the 
Canada Labour Code, which went against 50 years of labour 
relations practice, because the provinces had been the ones to pass 
regulations, set guidelines and generally oversee labour relations 
for all that time.
<P>
	We are delighted that the minister thinks it better we return to the 
status quo. This approach to intervention leaves the Bloc very 
comfortable supporting Bill C-3. Could you perhaps check later 
whether there is consent for the House to go into committee of the 
whole, and I will even propose it, if I may, because we would like 
to act quickly.
<P>
	I should perhaps point out what we are talking about in our 
attempt to describe the nuclear sector. If the bill is adopted, it 
would apply to, as we said, Ontario Hydro, Hydro-Québec, New 
Brunswick Power and Saskatchewan uranium mines. It could apply 
to some 9,000 workers, including between 6,000 and 8,000 in 
Ontario.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="468"> 468 </A></B>
<P>
	We can understand the minister's desire to act quickly, because 
Ontario, with 6,000 employees in the nuclear sector, gets 60 per 
cent of its hydro electric power from nuclear energy. I understand 
the minister is also concerned about the vote at Ontario Hydro 
among the unions represented on the subject of strike mandates. 
If the situation remains unchanged, if our information is correct, 
Ontario Hydro and the unions represented could declare a strike 
as of April 1.
<P>
	I understand that the minister obviously does not want anyone to 
be deprived of his right to strike, which is a last resort means, but 
which, in certain circumstances, is appropriate. But the minister, 
like us, thinks that strike action should be a matter for provincial 
labour relations.
<P>
	We repeat, this practice should be contagious. We are obviously 
delighted by the minister's decision to retroactively return the field 
of labour relations in the nuclear sector to the provinces. At the 
start of the debate, we thought the minister should do so, not by 
regulating it, but within a legislative context through a delegation 
of power between legislative bodies or through amicable 
agreement.
<P>
	The minister, with the help of his officials, has convinced us that, 
in this specific case, a number of technical reasons make it 
impossible; however I do understand-this is a solemn promise on 
the part of the minister, who is known to be true to his words, and 
through him of the whole community he represents-that when the 
Quebec labour minister, the MLA for Matane, sends him the 
regulatory framework proposed by Quebec, the minister is 
promising it will be the regulatory framework that will apply to 
Hydro-Québec and the Gentilly nuclear plant.
<P>
	Why does Quebec want to have its own regulatory framework? 
Quite simply, it is very important for us, and I do understand why 
the minister did not want to venture out in this area, since the 
regulatory framework will define which Quebec laws will apply to 
this field of jurisdiction, as Quebec workers will henceforth come 
under Quebec laws, still of course very specifically within the 
nuclear industry.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	For the information of our listeners, and to make sure it is 
absolutely clear in the minister's mind, this delegation of authority 
will result in the Act respecting Labour Standards applying to a 
number of non unionized workers. You know, Mr. Speaker, how 
important this act is. My colleague sitting next to me, who is an 
expert in labour relations, knows very well that, for all non 
unionized workers, labour standards are the closest thing they have 
to a collective agreement. They deal with bereavement leave, 
holidays, monetary as well as normative issues.
<P>
	We understand that the Essential Services Act would also apply, 
for the benefit of these workers. I imagine  that the minister must 
be very pleased; now he can begin to reflect on the need, for the 
federal government, to establish a mechanism similar to what we 
have in Quebec with the Essential Services Council. The minister 
will find there a model which has allowed us to strike not a perfect 
balance, but a rather satisfactory balance in labour relations.
<P>
	Legislation on essential services and councils authorises the 
workers to go out on strike in very clearly determined 
circumstances and always as an ultimate recourse. We know that 
strikes always penalize, but they can also be necessary in some 
situations, but users and consumers cannot be left without services 
we consider to be essential.
<P>
	Retrocession would also give the CSST authority for all workers 
concerned, and the minister mentioned that point. I am also 
thinking, again if our information is accurate, of the construction 
workers.
<P>
	This is not the most important bill the minister will introduce in 
this House, we will not judge him on this bill, but I understand 
there is a regulatory vacuum in this area which made it imperative 
for him to correct the situation. We support this bill, again I repeat, 
because of the retrocession to those provinces that request it.
<P>
	On that point, in committee of the whole, I will have the 
opportunity to ask the minister to ensure that the provinces approve 
the retrocession because, according to the briefing we had, the bill 
specifies ``after consultation with the provinces''.
<P>
	I wonder whether it would not have been more appropriate, from 
a legislative point of view, to mention agreement with the 
provinces rather than consultation. The minister, given his political 
experience, knows that he could find himself in the following 
situation. As he is well aware, labour relations in Ontario are in 
turmoil, the premier of that province has a right-wing agenda and 
has threatened, even started, to dismantle the anti-scab legislation. 
It is not impossible that the minister would come under pressure 
from workers who would find it more advantageous to work under 
the provisions of the Canada Labour Code in some particular 
situations.
<P>
	He could even come under pressure from third parties, in 
particular unions working within a labour confederation, interested 
in having the Canada Labour Code apply to their workplace.
<P>
	I know that the minister will not waver and that he will make 
sure that his contacts, unlike what happened with Bill C-76, are not 
various intermediary bodies or other groups like unions or 
employers, although in that case this last example is probably not 
relevant, and that the delegation of authority will be given with the 
consent of the provinces.
<P>
	We are also going to make sure in committee of the whole that 
this delegation of authority, even if it is through regulation, is total 
and final. What worries a  number of unions, in particular the 
Syndicat des professionnels d'Hydro-Québec-and we understand 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="469"> 469 </A></B>
<P>
that from a parliamentary point of view-is that a regulation could 
easily be overridden by another regulation.
<P>
	We are going to make sure that we do not find ourselves in a 
situation where the delegation of authority could be temporary, 
lasting only a few months before being superseded by a new 
regulation that would undo what the minister is proposing today.
<P>
	We support the bill, and we will co-operate so that it can be 
passed as quickly as possible.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	However, the minister will allow me to go back to the antiscab 
legislation and, if he wants, I will readily work very hard with him 
so that we can have a debate in the House on this subject and I 
know that the hon. member for Manicouagan has dealt with the 
matter.
<P>
	It is inconceivable that some 18 years after Quebec gave itself an 
antiscab legislation, workers under federal jurisdiction still cannot 
use it. It is no small matter; it concerns 10 per cent of the labour 
force, employees who are working in major areas such as the public 
service, interprovincial transportation, radio and television 
broadcasting, telecommunications, cable television, banks and 
nuclear plants.
<P>
	Need I remind the House that it affects-I mention this because I 
got the exact numbers yesterday-more than 8,500 employers in 
40,000 work locations. Imagine the rejoicing in this Parliament if 
the minister decided to make history and to fully exert his influence 
in cabinet. He would give us the pleasure, during the present 
session, in the context of the work of this House, of providing 
Canada with provisions that would be included in the labour code 
and offer an additional guarantee, an additional means.
<P>
	What is a legislation that sets out guidelines for the right to 
strike? What is a legislation that prevents the use of scabs? It is an 
additional way of having civilized labour relations.
<P>
	I think the hon. member for Manicouagan was extremely 
eloquent on that. There is a direct correlation between the existence 
of an antiscab legislation and the recurrence of labour disputes.
<P>
	If the minister wants, we will both be very relentless on this 
issue. We will be the ``Laurel and Hardy'' of labour relations in 
terms of antiscab legislation and I want to assure him of my whole 
co-operation on this matter.
<P>
	For the time being, we support Bill C-3 and may I be allowed to 
move once again that we sit in committee of the whole in order to 
speed up things.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> If I understood well, the hon. 
member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve is asking for unanimous 
consent?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard: </B>Yes, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is there unanimous consent 
to study the bill in committee of the whole House instead sending it 
to the standing committee?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> There is not unanimous 
consent. Resuming debate with the hon. member for Wetaskiwin.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate my colleague on his appointment as Minister of 
Labour.
<P>
	Bill C-3, an act to amend the Canada Labour Code, is heading in 
the right direction. Certainly there is a lot of confusion under the 
circumstances where there is one group of people under two sets of 
labour legislation, provincial and federal.
<P>
	With all due respect to the minister and his portfolio, we should 
be working toward a time when there simply is no federal labour 
portfolio. It is a duplication. I refer to the budget speech. The 
Minister of Finance, on page 9, talks about duplication of services 
and uses as an example meat inspectors, health inspectors and food 
inspectors.
<P>
	This carries on into the Department of Labour and we should see 
a devolution of powers in all areas of labour from federal to 
provincial in order to downsize government, to get these decisions 
closer to the people and to make them more effective and more 
efficient. I am wondering why it would not apply right across the 
board. Atomic energy facilities are a place to start. I would like to 
see legislation move along that line so we could have provincial 
jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	Duplicate departments create overbudensome bureaucracy and 
overlap that nobody needs, especially in such difficult fiscal times. 
Smaller government is something we should be looking at. I cannot 
help but reflect on the Government of Alberta in the 1950s and the 
1960s under the guidance of Ernest Manning, recently deceased. 
He gave Albertans only essential government. Waste, inefficiency 
and duplicity were something he was ever vigilant of. I believe all 
governments can learn a great deal about effective government 
from the example set in Alberta during that time.
<P>
	While the Reform Party generally agrees with the bill as set out 
by the minister, we will be contemplating amendments later on as 
the bill goes through this process. We would provide our qualified 
support at this time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak today on Bill C-3, an 
act to amend the Canada  Labour Code relating to nuclear 
undertakings. Like my colleagues on the opposition benches, I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="470"> 470 </A></B>
<P>
extend my congratulations to the minister on his appointment. He 
has served this country well in his other capacities in opposition 
and in government. I look forward to working with him in his 
capacity as Minister of Labour.
<P>
	I was appointed by my leader on January 10, 1996 as the New 
Democratic Party labour critic. I have spent a considerable amount 
of time over the last few weeks bringing myself up to speed with 
the various legislation the government may be engaged in, such as 
the review of the Canada Labour Code, and with various union 
responses to government undertakings in this regard. I will enjoy 
the debates with the minister and the Liberal government over the 
next year relating to human activity and the conditions affecting 
Canadians in the workplace.
<P>
	The government and the opposition seem to think this bill is 
nothing but housekeeping; that it simply transfers from one level of 
government to another a process that should be simple and easy to 
understand. My colleagues in the Reform Party want to extend this 
across the board, beyond the specific legislation. That is another 
matter entirely.
<P>
	We have a very specific bill here aimed at the workers of Ontario 
Hydro. I want to make clear at the outset that I was one of those in 
the House today denying unanimous consent to speed all aspects of 
the bill through the House today.
<P>
<B>(1040 )</B>
<P>
	I did that simply because I do not believe that all aspects of this 
legislation have been heard by members of the House. I think 
reference to the committee will be useful in that members of the 
House, particularly members of the opposition, might be able to 
hear from some of those people who will be affected directly by 
this legislation to assist them in making up their minds about 
whether this is the proper thing to do.
<P>
	I do not feel comfortable as a member of the House having to 
make decisions affecting people's lives when I have not heard all 
sides of the story, especially as they would be presented in 
argument to us as legislators.
<P>
	Let me put forward a couple of matters that have come to my 
attention. I will repeat some of the things the minister put on the 
table because it is important to understand the full context in which 
the bill is being brought to us.
<P>
	As indicated, before 1994 workers at nuclear power plants in 
Canada came under the jurisdiction of provincial labour 
legislation. In Ontario this would be the Ontario Labour Relations 
Act.
<P>
	In 1993 the Society of Ontario Hydro Professional and 
Administrative Employees applied to the Ontario Labour Relations 
Board to be certified under the Canada Labour Code; in other 
words, federal jurisdiction. The  application ended up in litigation 
before the Supreme Court of Canada. In 1994 the supreme court 
decided the nuclear operations of Ontario Hydro did fall within 
federal jurisdiction.
<P>
	A certification was requested by the workers of Ontario Hydro 
under the Canada Labour Code. The supreme court upheld them in 
this decision. The decision also applied therefore to nuclear 
workers in Quebec and New Brunswick, and that is where I believe 
some of the confusion exists today.
<P>
	If they were under provincial jurisdiction and the workers 
wanted to be under federal jurisdiction, and the supreme court 
agreed with them to be under federal jurisdiction, why is the 
government today moving with great haste to put them back under 
provincial jurisdiction?
<P>
	I want to clarify this contradiction. I cannot in all good 
conscience stand here and agree with the members of the 
government and the members of the opposition in allowing this to 
go through. It is important that the workers, especially those who 
are part of that application just two years ago, are heard by the 
members of the House and consulted and perhaps listened to.
<P>
	The legislation today puts labour relations involving nuclear 
workers back under the jurisdiction of provincial labour relations 
instead of under the Canada Labour Code. The government says the 
legislation is needed because it is too difficult for provincial 
utilities to manage their labour relations if their workforce is under 
two different jurisdictions. Non-nuclear hydro employees are still 
covered by provincial legislation.
<P>
	Obviously, as the minister indicated, the legislation is intended 
for the Ontario Hydro workforce but will apply in future after 
negotiations with Quebec, New Brunswick and even 
Saskatchewan.
<P>
	I have been informed that both the Society of Ontario Hydro 
Professional and Administrative Employees and the power workers 
union in Ontario are opposed to this legislation. We have not heard 
that indicated in the debate today.
<P>
	The workers want to continue to be covered by the Canada 
Labour Code because in all fairness they are quite worried about 
how they might be treated by the present Ontario government. The 
provincial government has already legislated away rights and 
benefits of public sector employees and has taken provincial labour 
legislation back 20 years.
<P>
	The Mike Harris government in Ontario is not a friend to public 
sector workers. For the federal government to arbitrarily send 
workers under federal labour legislation under the arm of the Harris 
government has many of them quite fearful.
<P>
	As I understand it, the unions say the federal government 
introduced Bill C-3 without notice or  consultation with them. They 
believe the government is pushing this through because the federal 
and provincial governments want to strengthen management's hand 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="471"> 471 </A></B>
<P>
when the power workers' contract is about to expire and contract 
negotiations are about to begin.
<P>
<B>(1045 )</B>
<P>
	The unions believe that this move may have implications on how 
workers, who may not be pleased with the process and who may be 
considering strike action, will be dealt with. In other words, the 
provincial government will have the ability to legislate all striking 
hydro workers back to work without consideration of the collective 
bargaining process. This could have severe consequences 
concerning the hydro union's rights if nuclear operations are sold 
or transferred as is being considered within the Ontario context.
<P>
	There is a great deal to be considered under these circumstances. 
As many members know, the privatization of the system in the 
province of Ontario is under serious consideration.
<P>
	It would be improper for the federal government to be seen 
intervening on behalf of an employer at a sensitive point in the 
collective bargaining process. I believe that is exactly what is being 
carried on right now. There is no credible justification for this 
legislation and certainly no credible justification for the haste with 
which the legislation is proceeding. Certainly the timing is suspect.
<P>
	The legislation is being advanced with unseemly haste and 
without consultation or opportunity for appropriate review, not just 
by the people who are involved but by the members of this 
Chamber who have a duty to question every aspect of government 
legislation before it becomes law. We are not being given, under 
the process that is being advocated today, the opportunity to do 
that.
<P>
	I have not been able to gather a consensus in the industry or 
among the workers on this issue. Without that consensus, it is the 
duty and the responsibility of politicians and parliamentarians to 
try to seek one before legislating rights. In fact, the proposed 
legislation goes far beyond anything that was previously suggested 
in discussions that had taken place.
<P>
	No explanation has been provided why the initiative is 
proceeding independent of the current review of the Canada Labour 
Code.
<P>
	Just a couple of days ago the minister tabled the Sims report that 
deals extensively with part I of the Canada Labour Code. No doubt 
there will be significant amendments come forward to the Canada 
Labour Code. Members will be first of all reviewing, consulting 
and debating amendments that the government is going to put 
forward.
<P>
	I do not feel comfortable without having the benefit of a 
thorough and broad debate of the Sims report and the amendments 
that the government will bring forward in making decisions 
relating to changes in the Canada Labour Code and jurisdiction at 
this point.
<P>
	The government should reconsider the haste with which it is 
moving today. Certainly it should not proceed with this proposed 
legislation until its details have been carefully considered, fair 
consultation has been taken and all the affected parties brought in, 
consulted with, talked to and all of the issues put on the table.
<P>
	Certainly members of this Parliament owe the nuclear workers in 
the province of Ontario the benefit of the doubt when they consider 
the future potential of labour legislation in the province of Ontario.
<P>
	I did not want to prolong debate but I wanted to make sure that 
those matters were put on the table today. I appreciate the House's 
indulgence for that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (St. Boniface, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a very brief question. I appreciate my colleague's points. I 
wonder whether at the same time he might give me an indication of 
what his party's position is with respect to the nuclear industry 
itself. I would be interested in that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question. The party's 
position on nuclear matters is quite clear. As members know, the 
issue in front of the House is labour legislation. It is people 
involved in existing industries. They are people who have 
collective bargaining rights and those rights must be respected. 
Regardless of the future position of the nuclear industry and 
whether there are federal funds available to continue subsidizing it, 
as it has been for years, the workers in the industry deserve the 
respect and protection that they have been afforded in the past. I 
think we should keep the issue centred on that for the debate today.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. George Proud (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to take part in 
the debate this morning dealing with Bill C-3. As the Minister of 
Labour has explained, Bill C-3 will promote efficient and stable 
labour relations at Canada's nuclear power stations.
<P>
	Contrary to comments, consultations did take place with all 
parties. Furthermore we are not attempting to take away anyone's 
collective bargaining rights. I would not want to be party to that 
and I know the minister would not either.
<P>
	Nuclear power stations are in an unusual situation with respect to 
federal labour law. It has always been assumed that provincial 
labour laws apply to nuclear power stations, but as has been said 
here this morning many times, a 1993 ruling by the Supreme Court 
of Canada determined that nuclear generating stations at Ontario 
Hydro were subject to the Canada Labour Code. A split jurisdiction 
was created at Ontario Hydro whereby the nuclear power workers 
<P>

<B><A NAME="472"> 472 </A></B>
<P>
are subject to federal labour law  but the other power workers in 
conventional generating plants are subject to provincial labour law.
<P>
	Passage of this legislation will address that ruling of the 
Supreme Court of 1993 by resolving the question of a split 
jurisdiction at Ontario Hydro. Ontario and other provinces with 
nuclear undertakings will then have a mechanism available 
permitting the application of provincial labour laws. This action is 
designed to foster efficient and stable labour relations at nuclear 
facilities.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	With Bill C-3, the government proposes to revert to the situation 
as it stood before the ruling of the Supreme Court of Canada in 
1993.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A corollary of this decision is in keeping with the federal 
government's commitment to flexible federalism. To that end the 
legislation before us is consistent with the clarification of roles and 
responsibilities between the provinces and the federal government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Since the labour minister has dealt with health and security in his 
speech, I would like to speak about labour relations and 
employment standards.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The majority of workers in Canada's labour force, currently 
around 13 million, are subject to provincial statutes. These statutes 
govern such activities as local transportation, manufacturing, 
construction, the forest products industry and provincial and 
municipal employment. But in those activities which cross 
provincial or national borders, federal jurisdiction over labour laws 
prevail as mandated by the Constitution Act and interpreted by the 
courts.
<P>
	Those areas of federal private sector jurisdiction include 
international and interprovincial transportation by land, sea or air, 
such as railways, airlines, shipping and specific trucking and 
busing operations. As well, federal jurisdiction applies to 
communications and broadcasting, including telecommunications, 
radio and television; also federally chartered banks, longshoring 
operations, federal crown corporations such as Canada Post and 
national museums; as well industries declared to be for the general 
advantage of Canada such as uranium mining and grain handling.
<P>
	Part I of the Canada Labour Code, which covers employees 
engaged in these federal industries, also provides the legislative 
framework for conducting labour relations in the Yukon and the 
Northwest Territories. The exceptions are employees in territorial 
governments.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	Hon. members will know that Parliament has adopted separate 
legislation, namely the Public Service Staff Relations Act, to 
provide for collective bargaining in the  public service. In all, some 
700,000 employees are subject to part I of the Canada Labour Code 
and approximately 250,000 federal government employees come 
under the Public Service Staff Relations Act.
<P>
	The federal government and each province have collective 
bargaining legislation. Independent labour relations boards which 
administer labour laws exist at both the federal and provincial 
levels. It differs slightly in Quebec, which has a labour court and 
equivalent administrative mechanisms.
<P>
	With certain exceptions, both levels of government recognize the 
right of employees to join trade unions and to bargain collectively. 
Unions and employers have a duty to bargain in good faith. 
Collective bargaining agreements generally take the form of 
legally binding contracts.
<P>
	These contracts cover such things as hours of work, wages, 
working conditions and job security.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Normally, those contracts cover one to three years, during which 
strikes and lockouts are prohibited, in all jurisdictions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Finally, Canadian labour laws generally outline a range of unfair 
practices and prohibitions relating to both employers and trade 
unions. Labour relations boards or the labour court in Quebec hear 
complaints of unfair labour practices and have broad corrective 
powers.
<P>
	I trust that this outline of industrial relations in Canada has been 
helpful. I believe that some members may be concerned that there 
are discrepancies between the federal and provincial employment 
standards. That is not necessarily so. Although not identical, labour 
standards-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member will have the floor immediately 
following Question Period to complete his speech.
<P>
	It being 11 a.m. the House will proceed to Statements by 
Members.

	The government has not extended any special powers to the 
renewable fuels industry, it has just levelled the playing field with

	<B>Mr. Michel Daviault (Ahuntsic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to draw attention to International Women's Day.
<P>
	Today more than ever before, it is important to keep a watchful 
eye on the gains made by women in recent years, as their 
socioeconomic situation makes them more vulnerable to the impact 
of cuts being made left and right in these times of fiscal austerity.
<P>
	More than 58 per cent of single mother families live under the 
poverty line. Women who work full time earn on average less than 
70 per cent of what their male counterparts make.
<P>
	The federal government recently abandoned its child care plan 
and announced in the last budget that seniors' pension benefits 
would be calculated on the basis of family income. This represents 
an incredible setback for women.
<P>
	The struggle for equality is far from over. That is why the Bloc 
Quebecois will always be there to remind this Liberal government

the throne promises to ``promote the long term conservation and 
revitalization of fisheries in Canada''. Those are nice words but 
what have the Liberals actually done?
<P>
	The Liberals have cut funding to salmon hatcheries in British 
Columbia, a proven enhancement program. They have cut funding 
to sea lamprey control on the Great Lakes, a proven conservation 
program. They have implemented groundfish management plans 
on both coasts which are unacceptable. Their plan will put B.C. 
ground fishermen out of work. So much for revitalization. They 
have strangled fishermen by the  wallet with a $50 million tax grab 
when fishermen can least afford it.
<P>
	The only thing that has been conserved and revitalized by this 
government is the ivory tower on Kent Street and the minister's 
office decor.
<P>
	I call on the minister to restore funding for conservation and 
enhancement, cut his bloated bureaucracy and consult with ground 
fishermen on both coasts to ensure viability in the fishery.

	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday's announcement by the President of the 
Treasury Board concerning a lifting of the freeze on public service 
wages must be taken with a grain of salt. We cannot forget that 
collective bargaining in the federal public service has been 
suspended for almost six years during which time there has been 
massive job loss throughout all departments and agencies.
<P>
	Let us keep in mind that the Treasury Board package offered 
yesterday ties the new wage package to privatization, further 
contracting out of existing jobs, and additional schemes that make 
it easier for people to leave the public service, things the New 
Democratic Party find completely unacceptable.
<P>
	Again, we are seeing the Liberals supporting the collective 
bargaining process but setting the terms of the negotiations before 
they even begin. The Liberals seem once again to want their cake 
and eat it too.

	Today, women make up the majority of undergraduate students 
in Canadian universities and just under half the student population 
at the master's level. In addition, more women are teaching in 
colleges and universities.
<P>
	The government promised it would encourage students, 
particularly women, to excel in the fields of science, mathematics, 
technology and engineering. Our government recognizes that 
access to education is a key factor in ensuring that women achieve 
social equality and economic independence. We shall pursue our 
efforts in this regard.

Women's Day and pay tribute to women's accomplishments in 
Canada and around the world.
<P>
	The federal theme for International Women's Day 1996 is 
Strategy for Equality: Managing Change. Its focus is our need to 
maintain the momentum toward gender equality in the face of deep 
societal change. The Liberal government continues to support 
Canadian women in these times of fiscal restraint, globalization, 
restructuring, and new technologies.
<P>
	In the federal plan for gender equality we outlined specific 
actions we are taking to advance women's equality to the brink of 
the 21st century. The foundation of that plan is a new policy of 
gender based analysis of all federal government policies, programs 
and legislation.

They are looking for good, permanent, sustainable jobs. They are

government has provided none. They want section 745 of the 
Criminal Code to disappear. It is still with us. They want 
meaningful changes to the Young Offenders Act that would deter 
youth from crime. That has not happened. They want to feel safe in 
their schools, communities and on the streets but they do not. Most 
of all they want to be heard and governed accordingly instead of the

Speaker, on this international women's day, the Bloc Quebecois 
strongly condemns the unacceptable situation in which women are 
placed regarding pay equity. In 1996, Canadian women still earn 
only 70 per cent of what Canadian men make. This situation has 
bad consequences for society as a whole. Equal work should mean 
equal pay. However, as we near the third millennium, this is still 
not the case.
<P>
	The only initiative taken by this government regarding 
employment was the infrastructure program, which essentially 
created temporary employment traditionally associated with men. 
Women are also still underrepresented in certain employment 
categories. For example, in the federal public service, women only 
account for 25 per cent of Transport Canada's departmental 
population and 34 per cent of DND's workforce. Moreover, they 
hold only 19 per cent of management positions. The government

worked out between the divorcing parents at the time of divorce, 
hopefully with the help of a mediator.
<P>
	My main concern is that these new rules can be made retroactive. 
This new legislation will open the floodgates for renegotiation of 
agreements. This will lead to enough litigation among family law 
lawyers across the country to ensure that very few of them will be 
sitting idle.
<P>
	The obvious increase in litigation resulting from this change 
announced in the budget is particularly upsetting for me. The 
justice minister and his Liberal colleagues on the justice committee 
voted down my private member's bill on grandparents rights 
because Liberal committee members argued it would increase 
litigation, in spite of the fact that three eminent family lawyers 
argued to the contrary.

	<B>Mrs. Beryl Gaffney (Nepean, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is very 
appropriate during International Women's Week that the finance 
minister as part of his annual budget would include changes 
affecting child support. These changes affect the most needy in our 
society, namely women and children. It is primarily the children of 
Canada who are experiencing hardship as a result of marriage 
breakdown and subsequent divorce.
<P>
	Few Canadians think it is right to tax child support as income to 
one parent while giving a tax break to another. These changes to 
child support will ensure that the benefits will reach the children it 
is targeted for and will update a law designed over 50 years ago.

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="477"> 477 </A></B>
<P>
	The Liberal government's third budget calls for women's 
pensions to be determined according to their partner's income in 
future, thus reducing their level of benefits and their degree of 
economic independence. When questioned yesterday in the House 
on this subject, the Minister responded as follows: ``Nine out of 
ten women will get more money because of our reform''.
<P>
	Did the Minister of Finance deliberately attempt to trick senior 
women by referring to inappropriate statistics which apply to 
single women, not married ones on whom there are no statistics in 
his budget documents?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, in 
his budget, the Minister of Finance has tried to be as equitable as 
possible, by enabling the most vulnerable members of our society 
to continue to receive a pension over the long term, and he has done 
so by reducing what would otherwise have gone to the better off.
<P>
	Clearly women will benefit from this exercise, for they 
constitute one of the major vulnerable groups in our society. We 
support a system of social programs which redistributes funds from 
the most well off to the most vulnerable.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Really, Mr. Speaker, I have no idea whom the minister thinks he is 
addressing with that response to a simple, clear, precisely set out 
question. Either he just likes to hear the sound of his own voice or 
he did not get the question, so I shall repeat it.
<P>
	On page 16 of the budget speech, we find the following, and I 
quote: ``nine out of ten single senior women''-not those with 
spouses but single women-``will be better off'' and so on. The 
reference was to single women, but the Minister is playing with the 
semantics of rich and poor. I want him to answer the opposition's 
question on what will happen to married women.
<P>
	Why is the minister twisting his own statistics and what he said 
in his speech? Why will he not answer my question, not his own 
idea of a question, but what I asked?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the 
important question relating to women is how the government is 
treating women in general, whether single or not. And the 
important principle is not what the opposition member is 
proposing. The important principle is: How are we fulfilling our 
redistributory role by taking from the most fortunate a portion of 
their surplus to pass it on to the most vulnerable members of 
society, which include women?
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	The present situation, particularly in Quebec, is such that it is 
mainly women who are poor and vulnerable, and our desire to help 
vulnerable women is what has prompted changes to our program in 
order to ensure them of long term protection. We make no 
distinction between categories of women. We want to give all 
women the protection to which they are entitled.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister is determined not to understand the real 
question.
<P>
	Will the minister admit, without any shilly-shallying, that the 
new method of calculating old age security based on family income 
treats women like dependent children and represents an 
unacceptable backward step for the women of Quebec and of 
Canada in their struggle for equality and financial independence?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member of the opposition is determined to create a problem 
where none exists, and to refuse to grasp the true principle behind 
our reform.
<P>
	That underlying principle is that vulnerable women are entitled 
to government protection. In the system as it exists at the present 
time, the guaranteed income supplement already includes the 
yardstick of the couple's income, the revenue of the husband and of 
the wife. We have extended the principle that applies at the present 
time to the guaranteed income supplement to the reform as a 
whole.
<P>
	We have brought in this reform because we, unlike the Bloc 
Quebecois, want people to be able to receive government 
assistance when they experience hardship. We are the ones 
implementing true social democracy.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, and we 
say women will continue to be hard headed.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. At a conference on 
violence against women organized this year by the UNESCO 
women's program, it was concluded that women's financial 
independence is the key to change. As the minister has already 
determined the fate of female senior citizens by making them more 
dependent, would he be willing to improve women's financial 
situation generally, and, if so, how would he do it?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, here 
again, the important principle is our desire to protect women who 
are most at risk, and we are doing so.
<P>
	We will have revenues redistributed to the women who are the 
least well off. In Quebec it is clear that most of those receiving or 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="478"> 478 </A></B>
<P>
who will receive the increased pension are women. Furthermore, 
cheques distributed to couples  will be divided equally between 
husband and wife so that each gets half the money due the couple 
and so that each may remain independent.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the key 
to change lies in women's economic independence. That means 
jobs.
<P>
	In the budget speech, at page 26, the minister said, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-that ten years hence increasing child poverty rates will be a thing of the 
past-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Are we to understand that the Minister of Finance advocates the 
status quo in this area? Is he telling us that his government is 
resigned to keeping 1.3 million children in poverty?
<P>
[English] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status 
of Women), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is absolutely 
right. The key to women's equality lies in their economic 
independence. The government recognizes that fully.
<P>
	When one looks at the initiatives we have taken in the past and 
looks even closer now at the initiative we took during this budget, 
we looked at women at every stage of their lives in order to ensure 
their economic independence.
<P>
	When we look at the education changes we made in terms of 
increasing the eligibility for day care and the tax credits for going 
to school, we are ensuring single women get the same break as 
women who live in families. The child support of the WIS will be 
doubled in the next two years.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	In the seniors package we are ensuring that 90 per cent of 
women, whether they live singly or in couples, will benefit from 
this new seniors benefit. We are talking about the economic 
independence of women.

	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
government finger pointing on its broken GST promise seems to be 
intensifying.
<P>
	Yesterday it was somehow the fault of Canadians that the 
government has failed to meet its promise and has failed to scrap 
the GST. Today we find out it is blaming the provinces. We had this 
embarrassing display from government members from 
Saskatchewan saying to the premier: ``Please help us hide and 
expand the GST''. It is ridiculous.
<P>
	Why does the government not admit, why does it not come clean 
with Canadians and tell us it has absolutely no intention of killing, 
scrapping or abolishing the GST despite what it said during the 
election campaign?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is very easy to 
answer that question. We do have every intention of keeping our 
promise and every intention of replacing the GST.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is an 
issue of trust. The government has betrayed the trust of Canadians 
on this issue. It made promises to scrap the GST. It did not say 
harmonization. The only people interested in the government's new 
super tax are the members opposite.
<P>
	Ontario has said no, Manitoba has said no, Saskatchewan has 
said no, Alberta has said no and British Columbia has said no. The 
only provinces that the government is trying to get on side are the 
Atlantic provinces and the only way it can do that is to pay them.
<P>
	Since the provinces have no intention of being co-conspirators in 
the government's efforts to fudge the public record, why will the 
government not simply live up to its election promise and scrap the 
GST?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what the hon. member 
forgets is that there are significant advantages to a harmonization 
program. There are significant advantages to having the GST 
replaced by a retail tax on an equal basis across the country. The 
advantages are clearly there. If the Reform Party does not want to 
see those advantages, fine.
<P>
	It is unfortunate to have the Reform Party accuse the Atlantic 
provinces of taking bribes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is the 
hon. member who said they were taking bribes. We said nothing of 
the sort.
<P>
	I remind the hon. member that the Deputy Prime Minister said in 
the House that the GST was a job killer. We also know the GST 
harmonized would kill 70,000 jobs in Ontario alone. That is four 
times as many as the public servants in Ontario are currently 
striking over.
<P>
	It does not matter how many times Liberal members read from 
the small print in the red book. They can pretend all they want that 
harmonization was what they told Canadians on the campaign trail, 
but Canadians know that is not true.
<P>
	I ask a simple question which Canadians across the country want 
answered. Why did you lie?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> In the course of question period sometimes words 
are used that should not be. I ask the hon. member to withdraw the 
word ``lie''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, I withdraw the word ``lie'' and 
simply ask why did it break its election promise to scrap the GST?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada,  Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I want to put on the record again exactly what was this party's 
election promise. It was spelled out not in the fine print of some 
hidden document but in the red book, the basic statement of the 
platform, the commitments of this party, on which it was elected by 
the Canadian people: ``A Liberal government will replace the GST 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="479"> 479 </A></B>
<P>
with a system that generates equivalent revenues, is fairer to 
consumers and to small business, minimizes disruption to small 
business and'', get this, ``promotes federal-provincial fiscal 
co-operation and harmonization''.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	Our commitment was based on the concept of harmonization and 
any attempt by the Reform Party to say otherwise indicates how 
blind and deaf it is when it comes to the truth.

	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Justice intends to introduce, without amendments, Bill 
C-119 on juvenile prostitution, sexual harassment and female 
genital mutilation.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Justice. Why did the minister 
turn a deaf ear to repeated demands the of the Bloc Quebecois that 
severe sanctions be imposed on anyone who helps, encourages or 
incites someone to mutilate a young girl?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the bill which we will reintroduce 
provides clearly that for anyone who engages in the mutilation of a 
child or of a woman it is aggravated assault within the meaning of 
that term in the Criminal Code and will carry very heavy penalties.
<P>
	The principles that apply generally in criminal law with respect 
to those who aid, abet, counsel or assist will be as applicable to this 
offence as they are to any other.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, since 
information and education are essential to solve this issue, why 
does the Minister of Justice, in co-operation with his colleague 
from immigration, not inform newcomers right away that the 
excision of the clitoris is considered to be a criminal practice that is 
not tolerated in Canada?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member and her 
colleagues are aware that if we are to eradicate this criminal and 
savage practice we have to not only take steps in criminal law but 
also educate and inform.
<P>
	The Minister of Health, the Minister of Immigration and 
Citizenship and the Department of Justice have been working

in Canada and those coming to Canada that this is criminal conduct

	We know in the budget that the federal government is planning 
to cut transfers to the provinces for health, education and CAP by 
$7 billion over the next few years.
<P>
	We all know the provinces have been balancing their budgets. Is 
it not the real budget strategy of the government to get the 
provinces to balance the federal budget as well?

	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
numbers and facts in the budget and the actions of the government

to 31 per cent for the last six years the cumulative cuts affecting 
these groups?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status

stressed very much the economic independence of women.
<P>
	We have talked about initiatives in tax credits. We have talked 
about changing the child support program. We have taken money to 
be gained out of that program and placed it into ways to eliminate 
poverty. We have looked at how we can empower single women to 
go to school and to get training through tax initiatives. There is 
more than one way to skin a cat.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status 
of Women), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, very important in terms of 
women's equality is that the government has agreed to put forward 
a plan for gender analysis that will cross every single government 
department.
<P>
	Gender analysis means that every time a policy, a law or an 
initiative is taken there will be a lens to look at that policy, law or 
initiative to see how it could disadvantage women or men. That 
kind of thing has led to changes in the employment insurance bill 
and to all of the initiatives we have seen in the budget.

Vancouver and Victoria.
<P>
	The cowardly inaction of this government has given the U.S. an 
upper hand. That is odd given that when the Prime Minister was in

prevent American boats from entering Canadian waters without 
permission. He talked tough then; he is now rolling over.

challenge to Canadian sovereignty that will not be tolerated?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question.
<P>
	He talks about the U.S. passing laws. The U.S. put its name to a 
law 150 years ago, the Treaty of Oregon, which recognized without 
contention that the inside passage was internal waters. In internal 
waters there is no right of innocent passage.
<P>
	Irrespective of any laws the U.S. may have passed which ask it to 
look for the fees to be returned, which we have refused, this treaty 
has stood the test of time and will stand us in good stead if we have 
to look at this downstream.

	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, at the core of this 
is the Pacific salmon dispute with the Americans.
<P>
	The Minister of Foreign Affairs said this week that our 
disagreement with the Americans over Cuba was a very serious 
affair, while the west coast fishing dispute was merely ``an 
annoyance''. His statement underscores the government's attitude 
toward British Columbia: just an annoyance.

Mr. Speaker, I certainly understand the thrust of the hon. member's 
question.
<P>
	All members of the House are concerned for the 16,000 
commercial fishermen in British Columbia who fish a very 
difficult species. There are 4,000 stocks, 1,500 streams and a 
migration pattern that takes two to five years leading to the Alaskan 
and Aleutians Islands. There is a great concern about this.
<P>
	The mediation process that has been going on since last summer, 
of which the hon. member is aware, has stalled. It has not been 100 
per cent successful but it has been at least 75 per cent successful. 
The success that has been achieved was the basis of a discussion 
between the Minister of Foreign Affairs and myself yesterday. I can 
assure the House he will be going to Washington with some very 
good and very strong options that will support the fishermen of 
British Columbia and their concerns.

minister, has announced $800 million in cuts to the defence 
department which are directed at equipment procurement, such as 
armoured personnel carriers, search and rescue helicopters, 
shipborne helicopters, submarines, that are all needed to maintain 
Canada's combat capability.
<P>
	How and when will the defence minister manage to purchase this 
equipment which is essential to maintain our sovereignty and to 
support our troops around the world.?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Mr. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member's assertion is absolutely wrong.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="482"> 482 </A></B>
<P>
	In the white paper in 1994 we committed to three major 
purchases, the armoured personnel carrier, search and rescue 
helicopters, maritime helicopters and if a deal was favourable, 
submarines.
<P>
	The question of submarines is still to be decided and has not 
been affected by the budget announcement of this week.
<P>
	The armoured personnel carrier announcement was made last 
August and search and rescue in October. Those programs will 
proceed.
<P>
	With respect to maritime helicopters, as a result of the $150 
million one-time charge two years hence, we will be deferring the 
maritime helicopter program decision for one further year.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, one thing is very clear from the Liberal government. 
It has placed the blame for Canada's growing debt on the men and 
women of the Canadian armed forces and that is wrong.
<P>
	The government has promised to foot the bill for some $23 
million for a mission in Haiti and it will not even seek 
reimbursement from the United Nations, which is normal practice. 
At the same time it is gutting the defence budget by some $800 
million which will put Canadian sovereignty at risk.
<P>
	Will the minister agree to reassess each and every overseas 
mission until it can adequately fund the Canadian Armed Forces or 
at least make the UN contribute to our costs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Mr. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Reform 
Party in the last election championed massive spending cuts. In 
fact, the leader of his party in reply to the Minister of Finance this 
week said the government is not going fast enough. Now we are 
told that we should not be cutting in certain areas.
<P>
	In fact, the Reform Party tried to pose this week as the 
guarantors of health and other social programs. Canadians will see 
through this rhetoric.

	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs. So as not to 
jeopardize its trade, the Canadian government is closing its eyes to 
the treatment of babies in Chinese orphanages, abandoning them to 
their fate. It would appear, however, that people in Canada and 
Quebec disagree.
<P>
	Could the minister tell us what kind of concrete measures his 
government intends to take to put an end to the blatant abuse of 
human rights in Chinese orphanages?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Christine Stewart (Secretary of State (Latin America 
and Africa), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to respond to the 
question.
<P>
	Federal government officials have visited China. During 
conversations with officials the issue of the situation with babies 
and small children in China has been raised. We have told them of 
our concern about the deplorable conditions we learned about in 
which some Chinese children are living. We have offered our 
assistance to help them deal with this situation. We have also 
referred them to UNICEF. We understand that right now China is in 
dialogue with UNICEF and that UNICEF will be providing some 
assistance.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	The Government of Canada supports UNICEF financially and 
we will keep an eye on this issue to make sure there are 
improvements being made.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister knows full well what we want, and what the Bloc 
Quebecois has been condemning for many months now. We want 
an unequivocal condemnation by the Canadian government of 
children's human rights abuse in Chinese orphanages. Behind the 
scene dealings will not protect Canada's reputation in the world.
<P>
	I would like the minister to tell us when her government is 
finally going to adhere to a consistent policy on the issue of trade 
and human rights, in order to protect the reputation Canada used to 
have, and I do mean used to have, throughout the world?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Christine Stewart (Secretary of State (Latin America 
and Africa), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Government of Canada is very 
sympathetic to the issues that the member raises with regard to 
human rights issues worldwide. We have officially addressed 
abuses to human rights in China. Among those, we have raised the 
issue of the conditions in which children and babies find 
themselves.
<P>
	The United Nations Human Rights Commission will be 
convening shortly. The Minister of Foreign Affairs will be 
attending that meeting in Geneva, along with, we hope, other 
parliamentarians. We will all have an opportunity to address these 
very serious issues, not only in China but in other areas of the 
world where we have serious concerns.
<P>
	The Canadian government, through CIDA, has also put together 
a policy on human rights, democratic development and good 
governance. I would be very happy to share this with any 
parliamentarian here.

	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	On January 24 the minister appointed Mr. John Desotti of 
Sudbury, judge of the Ontario court in Sarnia. At the time of this 
appointment, was the minister aware that a three-year-old, 
unresolved complaint alleging professional misconduct was 
pending against Mr. Desotti before the Law Society of Upper 
Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker. In order to be fair to the man 
and fair to the facts, I hasten to add that I was also aware that the 
complaint had been investigated and dismissed by the Law Society 
of Upper Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
absolutely clear that it was a three-year case, that a review into the 
matter was under way and that the appointment by this justice 
minister simply threw a cloak of immunity over Mr. Desotti and the 
Law Society of Upper Canada lost jurisdiction as a result of this 
appointment.
<P>
	Because of his actions, which violated the fundamental principle 
of due process and violated the right of the complainants in this 
case to a fair hearing, I ask the minister what action he will take to 
have the appointment of Mr. Desotti rescinded until the complaint 
or the complainant receives a fair and just hearing and to ensure the 
ethics of the newly appointed judge are no longer in question?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, involvement in public life brings a 
certain responsibility, including a responsibility to be fair to the 
reputation of people. I invite the hon. member to bear that in mind.
<P>
	What is required of us, as responsible public officials, is more 
than simply to cobble together bits of phrases that sound very 
righteous and to combine them with indignation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Here is the file.
<P>
<B>(1155 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Mr. Speaker, I know the facts of this case, so let me 
tell the House and the hon. member what really happened.
<P>
	A client complained to the Law Society about Mr. Desotti when 
he was in practice. The Law Society investigated that complaint 
and found it without foundation and decided not to proceed. In 
those circumstances, having regard to the fact that finding had been 
made and looking at the facts and the nature of the complaint, I 
exercised my judgment and I brought the man's name forward to 
cabinet because he is going to be a good judge.
<P>
	The client, unhappy with the fact that the complaint had been 
found without merit, asked for a review by a lay bencher of the Law 
Society. It was while that review was pending that the appointment 
was made.
<P>
	Our judgment and our determination was that the appointment 
was appropriate and I invite the hon. member to be fair to Mr. 
Desotti and to the system.

non-commissioned members of the Canadian forces will receive a 
2.2 per cent pay catch-up to bring them in line with federal public 
salaries. This is welcome news to the men and women who have 
dedicated their lives to serving of our country.
<P>
	Will the Minister of National Defence tell the House when these 
truly deserving members of the Canadian forces can expect this 
measure to take effect? This is another good news story to follow 
up on his clarification of the purchase of equipment which he made 
just a few minutes ago.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Mr. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
thank the hon. member for Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke for his 
intervention.
<P>
	Very few other members in the House have had such a long and 
distinguished record in support of Canada's armed forces and I 
think that should be recognized.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Collenette:</B> Mr. Speaker, to answer the specific question, 
this measure, which is long overdue, will take place on April 1 of 
this year.
<P>
	I would like to thank publicly the men and women of the armed 
forces and in particular, the 50,000 non-commissioned members 
who will be affected by this pay catch-up. These people have made 
a sacrifice over and above the sacrifice made by public servants in 
the last couple of years. They were not only caught with the freeze 
but their catch-up, which was due in the 1990-1993 period, was 
also caught in the freeze. This measure now corrects that injustice.
<P>
	The morale of the men and women who serve in the armed forces 
is particularly good. I saw it last week in Bosnia. I hope this shows 
Canadians' appreciation for the work and the sacrifice that they 
have been making over the last few years.

Mr. Speaker, in the budget the Minister of Finance briefly referred 
to the disposal of a fleet of grain hopper cars. This issue is 
extremely important to farmers and they need answers to some 
questions very soon. They need the government to reveal its 
intentions or even its inclinations of how it is going to deal with 
this matter.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Transport please give the House a couple of 
simple answers. When will the government dispose of the 13,000 
hopper cars and more important, what is the department's asking 
price? The farmers who are interested in buying should at least 
know what the numbers are on the price tag.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

for his question. I know him to be a visitor to the transport 
committee and an interested participant.
<P>
<B>(1200 )</B>
<P>
	In answer to his question on the hopper cars, the current policy 
of the government is to get out of the business of transportation 
assets and transportation services. That is a very successful policy. 
This means we are trying to create efficiencies.
<P>
	The price, as the hon. member will know, on the hopper cars has 
yet to be established. That is only fair because, as pointed out 
earlier this fall, what we have to do as a government is consult with 
the interested parties, CN and CP, but also there has been a call by 
the farmers and the producers who will be using those grain cars 
and  who want to have a say in the opportunity of taking ownership 
of those 13,300 grain cars.
<P>
	We will have to get together and establish who will buy those 
hopper cars but only after all the parties have come to the table for

<BLOCKQUOTE>Quality accessible child care is an economic advantage for Canada. It enables 
single parents to end dependence on welfare and food banks by re-entering the

average, one person is employed for every five child care spaces created.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is clear the Prime Minister has abandoned his promise to a 
national child care program. In the budget the Minister of Finance 
clearly has abandoned that promise as well. A voucher system is 
not a child care system.

<P>
	The cornerstone of the government's initiatives for equality 
among women is gender analysis. I said earlier how that empowers 
and will increase women's economic independence, will look at 
their social life and will look at their physical well-being.
<P>
	We talked earlier about some of the initiatives we have taken 
with regard to child support, with regard to the WIS, with regard to 
the Canada student loan programs, with regard to employment 
insurance. By simply applying gender analysis we have looked at 
hours of work instead of weeks of work because we know so many 
women work hours in terms of part time jobs and need to get 
benefits.

	We have talked about empowering education and looking at the 
issues that will help young women get an education. We have

	<B>The Speaker:</B> I will now rule on the question of privilege raised 
by the hon. member for Beaver River on Monday, March 4, 1996 
concerning the alleged interference of an official of the Prime 
Minister's office in a request to the printing services of the House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I want to thank the Deputy Leader of the Government in the 
House, the Chief Government Whip, the whip of the Reform Party 
and the hon. member for Mississauga-South for their comments on 
this question.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In her submission the hon. member argued that an employee of 
the Prime Minister's office had attempted to coerce, intimidate and 
incite the staff of the House of Commons to refuse a request for 
printing which she had made on February 28. This, she claimed, 
constituted a contempt of the House and she requested that I rule a 
prima facie case.
<P>
	As hon. members know, I did rule on the matter of the printing of 
this document when it was first raised on February 28. As I noted at 
that time, the House staff erred by not complying with the request 
made by the hon. member for Beaver River, which was entirely in 
accordance with the guidelines of the Board of Internal Economy.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="486"> 486 </A></B>
<P>
	The document was subsequently printed and I, in the House, 
apologized to her for any inconvenience. I also met privately with 
the member and she was made aware of all the circumstances 
surrounding this matter.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Chair takes very seriously any matter concerning the 
privileges of members, particularly any matter which may 
constitute a contempt of the House.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	The hon. member for Beaver River is correct in pointing out that 
new forms of contempt may arise and the House should not be 
constrained in dealing with them.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In dealing with matters of privilege and contempt, it is the House 
which determines whether a breach of its privileges or a contempt 
has occurred. It is the role of the Chair, based on evidence 
presented by the member, to determine whether or not the alleged 
contempt is of such importance that the regular business of the 
House should be set aside to deal with the matter immediately; that 
is, whether or not the matter is prima facie.
<P>
	Therefore it is the responsibility of any member in raising a 
question of privilege, particularly a possible contempt, to bring 
forth sufficient evidence to enable the Speaker to find that a prima 
facie case exists.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Beauchesne's, 6th Edition, Citation 117(1) states in part:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Once the claim of breach of privilege has been made, it is the duty of the 
Speaker to decide if a prima facie case can be established. The Speaker requires 
to be satisfied,-that privilege appears to be sufficiently involved to justify 
giving such precedence-</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Since the original matter was raised on February 28 I have had 
further discussions with senior House officials. There is no doubt 
that House staff was responsible for the mismanagement of this 
printing request.
<P>
	Since the official from the Prime Minister's office did not 
initiate the situation but rather reacted based on inquiry from 
House staff, it is difficult to conclude from the facts presented by 
the hon. member that the official coerced, intimidated or incited the 
staff of the House of Commons.
<P>
	It appears to me that what occurred in this case was done 
inadvertently and that it represents an unfortunate but isolated 
incident.
<P>
	I must find that the hon. member did not provide the Chair with 
sufficient evidence to allow it to find that a prima facie contempt 
had occurred.
<P>
	I assure all members that the staff of the House of Commons 
continues to strive for a high standard of competence and 
professionalism in the services it officers. However, I do want to 
remind the staff as well as government officials that in dealing with 
members of Parliament confidentiality is key and that members 
must be able to rely on their complete discretion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to thank the hon. member for Beaver River for 
having raised this very serious issue and assure her, and all 
members of this Houses, that corrective steps have been put in 
place to ensure that such an occurrence does not take place again.

them as they continue the inexorable march toward economic and 
social justice.
<P>
	Today we applaud the remarkable Canadians who have made 
outstanding contributions toward that struggle for equality. I want 
to acknowledge one such remarkable individual, Senator Florence 
Bird, former head of the Royal Commission on the Status of 
Women in Canada, journalist and activist.
<P>
	Later today I will attend the first presentation of the annual 
Florence Bird award. This award honours the work of a 
communicator who has succeeded in sensitizing the public to the 
fact that women's rights are not special interest rights or marginal 
rights but basic human rights.
<P>
	Through the efforts of Canadians like Senator Bird and today's 
award winner Karen Levine, executive producer of CBC Radio's 
``As it Happens'', Canada has earned a reputation for excellence in 
advancing women's equality. Initiatives such as the Florence Bird 
award will ensure the important role of public awareness continues. 
However, public awareness alone will not ensure women's 
equality. It is only one part of many initiatives that will finally 
achieve our objective.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Our government will continue to do its part to promote equality, 
for it is a basic Canadian value. It is part of our national identity as 
well as a source of pride.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This government believes each and every individual group and 
community in Canada must be treated equally and with respect. As 
Secretary of State for the Status of Women, I have made the 
economic equality of women a priority. Women are today among 
the poorest in our society in Canada and in the world. Poverty of 
women has a negative impact on the well-being of children, on the 
economic viability of a nation and on its social structures.
<P>
	Economic independence is the first step in eradicating poverty, 
violence and low health status. If women were economically 
independent, they would be able to create better lives for 
themselves and their families. They would be better able to 
contribute to the economy and to the  life of a nation and the 
benefits would accrue to all of us. In the budget we put in place a 
number of measures that will improve the economic status of 
women in all stages of their lives: as mothers, workers, business 
owners, students and as seniors.
<P>
	The budget demonstrates our commitment to the federal plan for 
gender equality which outlines our specific commitment to 
advance women's equality through the process of gender based 
analysis. Gender based analysis means that every new policy 
program and law must be critiqued to see whether it creates a 
disadvantage to men or women.
<P>
	Women and men in general experience life differently, 
economically, socially and physiologically. We need public policy 
that recognizes those differences. The child support package does 
exactly that. It recognizes that the majority of custodial parents are 
women and that many children are poor because their mothers are 
poor. It will make child support predictable, consistent and fairer 
for all children and their parents.
<P>
	The seniors benefit package has made adjustments not only to 
ensure that low and modest income seniors are better supported but 
it also recognizes through the splitting of cheques to couples that 
family income is not always shared equally.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	I cannot think of a more appropriate time to announce the child 
support package and the seniors benefit than during International 
Women's Week. These initiatives illustrate how good public policy 
must take a closer look at the reality of men's and women's lives if 
it wishes to be relevant and effective.
<P>
	Yet the principle of gender analysis should not be limited to 
government policy alone. It should be extended to the judicial 
system, education and health services. It should be a starting point 
for decision making throughout society, for each one of us has a 
role to play in creating equality, in building the Canada of 
tomorrow, a Canada of prosperity, security and hope, a Canada we 
will be proud to bequeath to our sons and especially to our 
daughters, a Canada that will continue to stand as a model to the 
world.
<P>
	Today on International Women's Day we owe as much to the 
world's women, their husbands and their children.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on this 
International Women's Day, I wish to honour women from all 
walks of life, from all occupations, from all cultures, from all 
faiths; mothers, single women, women with partners; in short, all 
women who make up our society.
<P>
	The main purpose of International Women's Day is to take stock 
of women's progress toward equality and of what remains to be 
done.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="488"> 488 </A></B>
<P>
	The fourth international conference on women, which was held 
in Beijing earlier this year, was quite helpful in achieving this 
goal. An action plan was established, which participating countries 
vowed to implement at home.
<P>
	As far as Canada is concerned, the Secretary of State for the 
Status of Women just gave us an overview of her government's 
efforts to achieve equality for women. This is very good, and I 
applaud her government's declared commitment to the issue of 
equality between men and women.
<P>
	Before outlining some of her government's policies, the 
secretary of state paid tribute, and with good reason, to a great 
Canadian, Florence Bird. Needless to say, we wish to join in this 
tribute. As for myself, I would like to remind the House of the work 
done by a great Quebecer, Simonne Monet-Chartrand.
<P>
	This staunch and tireless militant feminist was known 
throughout Quebec and Canada. Yesterday, the award created in her 
honour was given to Danielle Fournier, who has been involved with 
various community-based organizations over the past 16 years.
<P>
	I would now like to come back to the Canadian policy on the 
status of women and raise a few questions about the impact it will 
have on women. The secretary of state said earlier that equality was 
a basic Canadian value. Very well.
<P>
	However, this statement raises a few questions and comments as 
far as I am concerned. First, there is the cost issue. How much is the 
government prepared to pay to promote equality for women? Let 
me phrase the question differently: On this International Women's 
Day, will the government undertake to invest as much in helping 
women enter the job market as it has already invested and will 
invest in all its initiatives to promote Canadian unity? If indeed 
equality for women is a basic Canadian value, is it worth at least 
$14 million, or the amount the government plans to spend on 
propaganda this year?
<P>
	Women's groups have seen their meagre grants cut by 31 per 
cent over the past six years, and would certainly be delighted to 
learn that they can expect to receive $14 million instead of the 
$8,165,000 currently allocated to them this year in Status of 
Women Canada's estimates. I agree with the principle, but what 
about the costs?
<P>
	I have another question, on the same subject. How are equal 
rights to be interpreted and the sexual equality plan to be used in 
the context of the three budgets tabled to date by this government?
<P>
	One might be tempted to adopt a cynical view and wonder if this 
right is not, in fact, a right to unemployment insurance, to poverty 
and to income supplements, given that the government did not 
propose any job creation initiative.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	I remind the secretary of state that, in her speech, she referred to 
economic equality. This raises another issue: how can one achieve
<P>
economic equality when one does not have a job and must fight 
with the government to keep the few miserable dollars that one gets 
from it to survive? I am anxious to discuss this issue with the 
secretary of state.
<P>
	I do not want to use International Women's Day as a pretext to 
give a negative report on the government. However, I want to stress 
the importance, in the current context, of solidarity between 
women, and also between men and women.
<P>
	It is by working together that we will gradually eliminate the 
obstacles that still prevent women from enjoying true equality. 
These obstacles are violence, pornography, poverty, 
unemployment, pay inequity, sexual exploitation and genital 
mutilation, to mention just a few.
<P>
	I believe a great deal of solidarity is required to build a just and 
fair society. Governments will have to promote that solidarity 
through every means at their disposal.
<P>
	In conclusion, I want to remind the House of the conditions in 
which women from other countries live. This morning, Taslima 
Nasreen reminded us that, today, elsewhere, many women will be 
raped, sold, forced to engage in prostitution, repudiated, strangled 
by their husband, brutalized, disfigured or lapidated because they 
gave birth to a girl.
<P>
	I would ask this House to observe one minute of silence for all 
these women.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Does the House agree?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	[<I>Editor's Note: The House stood in silence.</I>]

	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure today to have this opportunity 
to speak on International Women's Day. It gives me a chance to 
acknowledge the contributions of women across Canada, not only 
the professionals but all the women who have had a very positive 
influence on their families, friends and even on strangers.
<P>
	It is a pleasure to respond to the comments of the Secretary of 
State for the Status of Women and Multiculturalism because I too 
want to talk about equality. The secretary of state said that equality 
is a fundamental Canadian value. She stated that equality is a right 
in this country, not a special right but a human right. She went on to 
state that her government has a strong belief that every person, 
every group and every community in this country is entitled to 
equality.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="489"> 489 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1230 )</B>
<P>
	What she did not say is that in spite of its commitment to 
equality, the Liberal government has passed a great deal of 
legislation that will treat people differently based on their race, 
their ethnic background, their language, their physical abilities and 
their gender.
<P>
	How can the secretary of state possibly say that the government 
is interested in equality when a person has to fill out a form about 
their ethnic background, their aboriginal status, their disabilities or 
their gender before it decides how they will be treated?
<P>
	How can the government state that it believes in equality on one 
hand and then grant distinct society status to some Canadians on 
the other hand?
<P>
	Equality is important in this country. Actually it is vital to the 
existence of this country. But it has to be true equality. It has to 
mean that all laws apply equally to all Canadians, regardless of 
race, creed, colour or gender. It has to mean that all Canadians have 
the same opportunities regardless of race, creed, colour or gender. 
Only then will this country achieve the true equality that is so 
essential and vital to the continued existence of our nation.
<P>
	The secretary of state claims that economic equality is at the 
forefront of her objectives. She states that many of the issues that 
women face: poverty, violence and poor health are linked to 
economic inequity. Does she suggest that marginalizing women is a 
positive way to deal with and foster equality in Canadian society?
<P>
	It is an interesting statement that the secretary makes. Is she 
suggesting that men are spared poverty? Is she suggesting that men 
are not victims of violent crime? Is she suggesting that men do not 
suffer from poor health? If she really believes that poor health is 
only an issue for women, how does she explain that the average 
Canadian male will only live to 74.5 years while the average 
Canadian female will live to be 81 years old.
<P>
	There is no question that poverty, violence and poor health are 
issues that must concern the federal government. But I would like 
to think that any fair minded government would be concerned 
about these issues equally for all Canadians, not just a select group.
<P>
	However, the government does not appear to be fair minded. Its 
response to these problems appears to be the creation of, and I 
quote ``the federal plan for gender equality'' which will see a 
gender based analysis of every new policy, program and law.
<P>
	In other words, the government thinks it can solve the problem 
of the economic inequality that women face by having a bunch of 
highly paid bureaucrats sitting around discussing how everything 
the government does will impact on women.
<P>
	If the government is really concerned about the economic 
situation of women, I will be happy to give  them a piece of advice. 
Quit wasting the taxpayers' money so that women and men can 
have more money to spend on their families, on their children and 
on themselves instead of paying higher taxes and the high priced 
salaries of bureaucrats who are sitting around reviewing legislation 
for gender inequality.
<P>
	Striving for equality is a noble pursuit but it has to be true 
equality. As a baby boomer, I have witnessed a great change in the 
role of Canadian women. There is no question that there was 
institutionalized discrimination against women in the 1950s, 1960s 
and 1970s.
<P>
	I have had my share of run-ins with male chauvinists who 
believe that a woman's place is in the home. I have also confronted 
a great number of females who share that belief. It is not something 
that only men believe. However, I am happy to say that the vast 
majority of men and women that I deal with truly believe that men 
and women should have equal opportunities and be treated equally.
<P>
<B>(1235 )</B>
<P>
	The one noticeable exception is this Liberal government. It still 
seems to think that women need some form of government 
intervention to compete with men on an equal basis. I find it 
somewhat insulting that the government thinks that I need some 
form of assistance to compete equally with my male colleagues. 
That may be the case on that side of the House, but I assure you, 
Mr. Speaker, it is not the case on this side of the House.
<P>
	If the government is really concerned about creating equality it 
should remember that to be truly effective, equality, like justice, 
must be blind. Every Canadian should have the same rights and 
privileges, as well as the same duties and responsibilities, 
regardless of their race, their creed, their colour or their gender.
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLaughlin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
would like to seek the unanimous consent of the House to respond 
on behalf of the New Democratic Party to the ministerial statement.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Does the hon. member have 
unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
International Women's Day I would like to thank and congratulate 
the new Secretary of State for the Status of Women for her 
comments. Especially, as this is a day of celebration, I would like 
to congratulate all of those women, in all walks of life, who 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="490"> 490 </A></B>
<P>
contribute so much to every community and who bind the country 
together through the kind of work which they do in the family, in 
the community, in the business world, in the political world, as 
homemakers, as truck drivers, whatever profession or work the 
women are doing. I want to  congratulate every woman who has 
made a substantial contribution historically to the country.
<P>
	In terms of the federal government's commitment to women, 
about which the minister spoke, I have no doubt that in a rhetorical 
sense the government is committed to the advancement of women. 
However, the proof of what one says is really in what one does.
<P>
	In relation to the budget, which the secretary of state presented 
in such favourable terms, I would like to know how the ending of a 
national child care program and reducing grants to women's 
organizations by 5 per cent, which already work on very limited 
funds without core funding, contributes to the equality of women. 
How does a reduction in provincial and territorial federal transfers, 
which means a reduction in social programs, contribute to the 
advancement of women? How does the federal government's 
refusal to pay the outstanding amount of pay equity that is due to 
women working for the federal public service-some 80,000 
women are owed $1.5 billion, as has been directed by the human 
rights commission-contribute to the advancement of women. 
Finally, how in this budget, with a lack of focus on jobs, can this 
government be seen to be furthering the equality of women?
<P>
	Similarly, I would like to know how the changes to the 
unemployment insurance system and the lack of benefits for 
women in many areas of this country, such as seasonal workers and 
part time workers, can in any way further the equality of women.
<P>
	With respect to the budget the government certainly deserves to 
receive a D minus on furthering equality for women. The Secretary 
of State for the Status of Women must deal openly and honestly 
with women when she is talking about her general commitment.
<P>
	We still, because of the economic policies of this and prior 
governments, are dealing with an increasing gap between the rich 
and the poor. One in five children in this country live in poverty. 
We have a long way to go.
<P>
	On this International Women's Day I would challenge the 
secretary of state responsible for women to seriously address the 
issues which I have raised with respect to child care and facilitating 
independence for women and families. I would seriously challenge 
her to deal with the issue of violence against women, pornography 
and the inequities which still remain with the huge wage gaps 
between women and men in most non-unionized sectors.
<P>
	Finally, I hope that on International Women's Day the 
government and all members of the House will join me in 
celebrating the women of this country and their work and will 
commit to working for equality, in all fields, for women in Canada 
and abroad.

officials because of these antics; most recently with the Liberals' 
promise to eliminate the goods and services tax, a promise which it 
has broken.
<P>
	Therefore the petitioners request that Parliament oppose and 
condemn the federal government's plan to rework the goods and 
services tax into a value added tax which may be expanded to 
foodstuffs and prescription drugs.

	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the second petition is from the communities of Eston 
and Elrose calling on the federal government to make sure there is 
full utilization of the port of Churchill to improve the economies of 
the prairie provinces and Canada as well.
<P>
	The petitioners call on the federal government to act 
immediately to develop a strategy in order to utilize this important 
seaport to ship other exports as well as grain. They pray and call on 
the House to direct the minister responsible for the wheat board to 
ensure that for the upcoming shipping season the port is used to its 
maximum and at the very least 5 per cent of Canada's annual grain 
shipments be shipped through the port of Churchill.

	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Third, Mr. Speaker, I have a petition that perhaps is a bit late but 
which may be appropriate for next year as well. It was anticipating 
the budget which was read a few days ago, prior to my being able to 
table this.
<P>
	The petitioners are also from my riding, in the 
Kindersley-Coleville area as well as Brock and Biggar. They are 
telling the federal government they are paying approximately 52 
per cent of the cost of a litre of gasoline to the government in the 
form of taxes. Last year the tax was increased by 1.5 cents per litre 
in the federal budget. They are hearing rumours that it may be 
increased by 2 cents per litre.
<P>
	The petitioners also say that in the past 10 years the excise tax on 
gasoline has increased by 566 per cent and they do not want any 
more tax increases on gas in this budget or, I presume, in future 
budgets.
<P>
	I am glad to present these petitions on behalf of my constituents.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-3, an 
act to amend the Canada Labour Code (nuclear undertakings) and 
to make a related amendment to another act, be read a second time 
and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George Proud (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, prior to question period when I was 
speaking on Bill C-3, I talked about the concerns some members 
have regarding the possible discrepancies between federal and 
provincial employment standards. As I said, this is not so.
<P>
	Although the standards are not identical under federal and 
provincial laws, they are comparable. Of course these are 
minimum standards only. Collective agreements and company 
policies often exceed these minimums.
<P>
	Consider the case of the collective agreement that applies to the 
power workers in Ontario for the most part. Its provisions exceed 
the labour standards of both the Canada Labour Code and the 
Ontario Employment Standards Act. By way of example, the 
Canada Labour Code provides for nine holidays with pay, the 
Ontario law for eight. The collective agreement at Ontario Hydro 
exceeds these levels with 10 holidays.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I will give the House another example of labour standards. Let us 
take the example of hours of work. An employee's hours of work 
are limited in two ways.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	First, payment of overtime at a rate of one and one-half times the 
regular rate is required after eight hours in a day and 40 hours in a 
week under the Canada Labour Code, and after 44 hours in a week 
under the Ontario Employment Standards Act. Second, there exists 
a maximum limit on hours of work, which is 48 hours under the 
Canada Labour Code, and eight hours in a day and 48 hours under 
the Ontario law.
<P>
	At the same time flexibility is essential to a well managed 
operation, so both federal and Ontario law allows for employees to 
work in excess of the legislated maximums in the case of an 
emergency or by a permit. Where a permit has been issued under 
Ontario law, such work requires the consent of the employees' 
representatives.
<P>
	The collective agreement between Ontario Hydro and the Power 
Workers Union meets or exceeds these standards. I could go on 
with further examples but hon. members can see that having all 
provincial labour laws  apply to Ontario Hydro's nuclear workers is 
the best guarantee for stability at Ontario Hydro.
<P>
	For that reason I ask that all hon. members support the passage 
of Bill C-3. Thank you for the opportunity to speak on this bill 
today and I look forward to its early passage.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is the House ready for the 
question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is it the pleasure of the 
House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> On division.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to, bill read the second time and referred to a 
committee.)
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.
<P>
	It is not the government's intention to proceed with any other 
legislation this afternoon. I therefore call upon the Chair to call it 
2.30 p.m., the regular time of adjournment.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is it agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Pursuant to Standing Order 
24, the House stands adjourned until Monday, March 11 at 11 a.m.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 1.01 p.m.)
