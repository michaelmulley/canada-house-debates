	<B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.)</B> moved for 
leave to introduce Bill C-302, an act to amend the Canada 
Health Act (nutrition services).
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, I have the honour to introduce today 
in this House a bill to amend the Canada Health Act with regard 
to nutrition services.
<P>
	This bill includes the expression ``nutrition services'' in the 
definition of health services provided under the existing Canada 
Health Act. We all know that nutrition is an essential component 
of health and that Canadian dieticians are the only health 
professionals duly trained and authorized to evaluate a person's 
nutritional status.
<P>
	Furthermore, the Canadian government recognizes dieticians 
as key resources in developing health policies such as Canada's 
Food Guide, which sets guidelines for good health. I therefore 
feel that it is important, as much for the general public as for the 
order of dieticians, that they be formally recognized and 
included in the Canada Health Act.

	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.)</B> moved 
for leave to introduce Bill C-303, an act to amend the Criminal 
Code (dangerous intoxication).
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to introduce this bill. 
I know other members in the House were working on similar 
bills. The motivation behind the bill is to remove the ability of 
persons to hold themselves harmless from responsibility for 
self-induced intoxication.
<P>
	As members know, recently the Supreme Court held that 
persons could be held harmless from the result of their own 
actions because of self-induced intoxication. This goes against 
the grain of all thinking Canadians and common sense.
<P>
	This bill, which I would ask all members in the House to 
support, would create a separate offence. The offence of being 
criminally intoxicated would ensure that Canadians are held 
personally responsible for the results of their actions. They 
cannot hide behind the charter of rights and freedoms to escape 
responsibility for what they have done. This would prevent 
violence to others who are innocent.

	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it gives me pleasure to present a petition today from 
men and women in southern Ontario.
<P>
	The petitioners would like to draw the attention of the House 
to the fact that public safety is the number one priority of the 
criminal justice system. The existing controls on law-abiding, 
responsible firearm owners are more than enough to ensure 
public safety and that the current and proposed laws 
criminalizing certain firearm activities when the danger to the 
public safety and criminal intent is either virtually non-existent 
or totally absent.
<P>
	The target for all gun control laws in the Criminal Code of 
Canada must be the criminals who are either a danger to the 
safety of the public or those who have criminal intent, not 
law-abiding, responsible firearm owners. No amount of gun 
control has ever succeeded in preventing criminals from 
acquiring guns by illegal means. What our criminal justice 
system must ensure is that criminals who steal, import, sell and 
possess guns and/or use guns in the commission of a crime will 
be severely punished.
<P>
	Therefore, the petitioners pray and request Parliament to 
support laws that will severely punish all violent criminals who 
use weapons in the commission of a crime; second, support new 
Criminal Code firearms control provisions which recognize and 
protect the right of law-abiding citizens to own and use 
recreational firearms, and last, support legislation which repeals 
and modifies existing controls-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> May I remind hon. 
members that it is normal to read the prayer only and not to enter 
into a form of debate when presenting petitions.

in society in all of its forms, on radio and television, have 
become a major concern of the Canadian population.

<P>
	They want the government to ensure that the CRTC is able to 
regulate it and reduce it and if possible remove it, I suspect.

	<B>Mr. Jim Jordan (Leeds-Grenville, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker 
I have petition with 1,826 signatures. It is a rather interesting 
petition. It was the inspiration of a Mrs. Ruby Stone who lives in 
my riding.
<P>
	She is petitioning the government as all these people are 
against the introduction of a $2 coin. Some of us may not be 
aware that there is a study going on in this country to introduce a 
$2 coin. Sometimes these things are slipped in. I know this 
government would not likely do that.
<P>
	I think we should introduce more $2 bills because if you use a 
$5 bill you usually get four coins back. People are getting tired 
carrying them around. I support these petitioners.

people in Beaverton, Fenelon Falls, Woodville and Cannington 
in the riding of Victoria-Haliburton.

phrase sexual orientation.

Columbia, who call upon this Parliament to reject any further 
firearms control legislation, regulations or orders in council and 
rather focus on the misuse of firearms by violent criminals.

Madam Speaker, I present a petition today from some 25 lower

Westminster-Burnaby, British Columbia.
<P>
	The petitioners fear that inclusion of sexual orientation in the 
Canadian Human Rights Act will infringe on the historic rights 
of Canadians such as the freedoms of religion, conscience, 
expression and association. Therefore, they call upon 
Parliament to oppose any amendments to the Canadian Human 
Rights Act or the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
which provide for the inclusion of the phrase sexual orientation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tony Ianno (Trinity-Spadina, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to present several petitions. Several members of my 
constituency of Trinity-Spadina call upon the Government of 
Canada to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act so as to give 
statutory recognition of homosexual relationships and to 
enshrine their equality before the law with that of heterosexual 
relationships.

petitions.

Simcoe Centre today. The first group of petitioners request that 
the Government of Canada not amend the human rights act to 
include the phrase sexual orientation. The petitioners fear that 
such an inclusion could lead to homosexuals receiving the same 
benefits and societal privileges as married people.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="MARRIAGE">MARRIAGE</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
second petition concerns the subject of the family. The 
petitioners request that Parliament oppose any legislation that

provision of marriage and family benefits to those who are not 
related by ties of blood, marriage or adoption, where marriage is 
defined as a legal union between a man and a woman.

	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the second petition from the constituents of 
Hamilton-Wentworth calls upon Parliament to put an end to 
the discriminatory treatment of gay and lesbian citizens and 
their familial relationships by amending federal legislation that 
currently allows unequal treatment, including an amendment to 
the Canadian Human Rights Act to prohibit discrimination 
based on sexual orientation.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, the third petition calls for Parliament to not 
amend the human rights code, the Canadian Human Rights Act 
or the charter of rights and freedoms in any way which would 
tend to indicate societal approval of same sex relationships or of 
homosexuality, including amending the human rights code to 
include in the prohibited grounds of discrimination the 
undefined phrase sexual orientation.

the honour to present a petition on behalf of the citizens of the 
great communities of Logan Lake, Kamloops, Ashcroft, Cache 
Creek, Merritt and Savona. There are hundreds of names on this 
petition.
<P>
	The people point out that Canada's mining industry is a 
mainstay of employment in over 150 communities across 
Canada, an important contributor to Canada's gross domestic 
product in total exports and a cornerstone of our economic 
future. They point out that the industry has proposed a 10 point 
plan of action which would enhance the mining industry of 
Canada.
<P>
	They are calling upon Parliament to take any action that will 
increase employment in this sector, promote exploration, 
rebuild Canada's mineral reserves, sustain mining communities 
and essentially keep mining in Canada.

	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> I am 
informed by the Departments of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development and Canadian Heritage as follows:
<P>
	In so far as the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, DIAND, is concerned:
<P>
	(a) For the year ended March 31, 1993, 159 Indian bands, 
tribal councils and aboriginal organizations are in a deficit 
position.1-2
<P>
	(b) With respect to the names and deficit situation of Indian 
bands, tribal councils and aboriginal organizations, this 
information is confidential third party financial information 
under section 20(1)(b) of the Access to Information Act and 
cannot be released.
<P>
1 DIAND does not fund Metis organizations. Please refer to the answer by 
Canadian Heritage.
<P>
2 DIAND determines a recipient's deficit position by applying an indicator of 
whether the recipient's cumulative deficit is greater than 8 per cent of its total 
revenues, one month's cashflow. Statistics are collected on this basis.
<P>
	In so far as the Department of Canadian Heritage is 
concerned:
<P>
	(a) Based on the 1992-93 audited financial statements 
available-48 per cent were available-27 organizations were 
in a deficit situation.
<P>
	(b) With respect to the name and deficit situation of these 
organizations, this information is confidential third party 
financial information under section 20(1)(b) of the Access to 
Information Act and cannot be released.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>What action will be taken on the recommendation made by the Auditor 
General in his 1994 annual report that the ``Ice Services Branch must ensure that 
its contingency plans can be put into effect quickly and successfully'' in the 
event of systems malfunction or communications failure so as to avert any 
possible ``rerouting or disruption of ship traffic in and out of Canadian ports or, 
at worst, loss of life and property?''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Data collection buoys are stationed 
so that in the event of an emergency they can back each other up. 
These buoys are equipped with information transmission 
devices which ensure transmittal of all necessary information. 
The buoys and equipment have been designed and are situated so 
that, short of several stations failing at once, the ice services 
program will be maintained.
<P>
	A complete failure of all the ice program systems at once is 
highly unlikely. In the event of a major catastrophe, we have an 
agreement with the U.S. National Ice Centre to provide essential 
ice information to our clients until our normal operations can be 
resumed. We can do the same for the U.S. We developed this 
backup plan over the past year and it will be tested shortly.

	The House proceeded to the consideration of Bill C-60, an act 
respecting an agreement between Her Majesty in right of 
Canada and the Pictou Landing Indian Band, as reported 
(without amendment) from the committee.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.)</B> moved that the bill be concurred in.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to.)
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> When shall the bill be 
read a third time? By leave, now?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Irwin</B> moved that the bill be read the third time and 
passed.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Roseanne Skoke (Central Nova, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I rise to address the House on third and final reading of Bill 
C-60, the Pictou Landing Indian Band Agreement Act.
<P>
	As the member of Parliament for Central Nova, on behalf of 
the Pictou Landing Micmac First Nations people in my riding, I 
thank hon. members for their support of this bill at second 
reading and in committee. I am certain that the more than 400 
Pictou Landing Micmacs appreciate your support in helping to 
bring much awaited certainty to their lives.
<P>
	This may appear to be a minor piece of legislation but it is 
very important to the First Nation concerned. Therefore it 
deserves quick passage through Parliament.
<P>
	Bill C-60 is important for three reasons. First, the bill will 
ensure that claims by members of the First Nations related to the 
effluent treatment system at Boat Harbour are to be directed to a 
fund established for that purpose under the agreement. As a 
result it will protect both the Government of Canada and the 
Pictou Landing Micmac from further claims.
<P>
	Second, Bill C-60 will ensure that the Pictou Landing 
Micmac are responsible for managing the settlement money that 
has been and will be paid out by the federal government.
<P>
	Third, Bill C-60 will confirm that the Government of Canada 
intends to live up to its commitment to aboriginal people, 
including commitments made by previous governments.
<P>
	Hon. members from all sides should recognize that the 
settlement agreement with the Pictou Landing Micmac is 
already well on its way to full and complete implementation. We 
are not being asked today to approve new arrangements, to make 
new commitments, or to break new ground. We are being asked 
to live up to outstanding commitments that have been made by 
the Government of Canada to the Pictou Landing Micmac of 
Nova Scotia. Living up to that commitment is very important, so 
important is it that this government put it in writing in an 
agreement.
<P>
	In our red book we mapped out our intention to build new 
partnerships with aboriginal people. Today we are being asked 
to live up to that pledge, not just for the Pictou Landing Micmac 
but for all aboriginal people. Specifically, this bill asks us to 
take appropriate action to protect both the Government of 
Canada and the First Nation from further claims related to the 
Boat Harbour effluent treatment system.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, let me tell you a little more about Boat 
Harbour back when. Imagine a picture with rolling hills dipping 
to the ocean, sandy beaches, boats drifting by with multitudes of 
fish in the ocean and majestic black cormorants nesting in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9699"> 9699 </A></B>
<P>
Pictou Harbour. I hope this image  will bring you and my hon. 
colleagues closer to Pictou Landing and closer to the 
understanding of the importance of this bill, because in spite of 
this picture just painted this is not the Boat Harbour that exists 
today.
<P>
<B>(1115 ) </B>
<P>
	For more than two decades treated effluent from Scott Pulp 
and Paper Mill at Abercrombie Point has been released into Boat 
Harbour, less than half a kilometre from the Pictou Landing 
Micmac community. This has had a serious and negative impact 
on the environment and on the quality of life on the reserve and 
in the surrounding communities in Pictou County.
<P>
	Now Boat Harbour is an industrial effluent treatment facility 
operated by the province of Nova Scotia. It serves the nearby 
Scott Maritimes Limited kraft paper mill. Boat Harbour is 
adjacent to Pictou Harbour, about 150 kilometres northeast of 
Halifax.
<P>
	The Boat Harbour holding pond was created by blocking the 
entrance of a former tidal estuary to the Northumberland Strait. 
Boat Harbour is currently surrounded by provincial crown land 
and the reserve lands of the Pictou Landing Micmac.
<P>
	It bears repeating the First Nation was not happy about this 
effluent treatment system when first approached in 1966. It 
agreed only after intense lobbying by Nova Scotia.
<P>
	The damming of Boat Harbour permanently raised the level of 
the harbour and flooded approximately 12 hectares of reserve 
land. The harbour became devoid of oxygen almost immediately 
after the treatment facility commenced operation.
<P>
	Over the ensuing 12 years the First Nation made a number of 
representations to the Government of Nova Scotia seeking 
compensation for damage to its land and for the flooding.
<P>
	Although the province made improvements to the treatment 
facility, it ended negotiations with the First Nation in 1982 by 
refusing to recognize its claim. The Pictou Landing Micmac 
then entered the federal government's specific claims process. 
In 1986 the First Nation filed suit against the federal 
government alleging breach of fiduciary duty.
<P>
	Boat Harbour has been lost as a source of food for the 
Micmac. For the past 25 years this First Nation has also had to 
forego hunting, wildlife harvesting and other benefits on some 
12 hectares of flooded reserve land.
<P>
	As a result of the federal government's fiduciary 
responsibility to the First Nation people the government reached 
an out of court settlement with the First Nation that has avoided 
a potentially lengthy and costly legal battle. Now it rests with 
this hon. House to bring this chapter in the government's 
relations with the Pictou Landing Micmac to a close. There 
should be no hesitation to do so by the hon. House.
<P>
	As my hon. colleague the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development pointed 
out at second reading, Bill C-60 is very straightforward.
<P>
	The settlement agreement ratified by community members in 
a 141 to 25 vote in the summer of 1993 is a $35 million 
settlement which includes a $20 million compensation package; 
$8 million was earmarked to be distributed among the members 
of the First Nation for individual compensation. Much of this 
money has already been paid out; $9.725 million was placed in a 
continuing compensation fund to address special claims by 
members of the First Nation related to the Boat Harbour 
environmental problem; $2.275 million was allocated to support 
projects that would benefit the First Nation, including the 
building of a multi-purpose recreational centre and the 
establishment of a Pictou Landing economic development 
promotional package. This money is intended to compensate the 
members of the First Nation for general impact associated with 
the Boat Harbour facility.
<P>
	The remaining $15 million in the settlement has been directed 
into a community development trust fund that will enable 
members of the First Nation to relocate if necessary. This fund is 
being administered by the First Nation and will ensure that the 
First Nation and its members will be able to protect themselves 
from any future health effects from Boat Harbour.
<P>
	This bill accomplishes two basic objectives, both of which are 
in the interests of the First Nation, the federal government and 
the Canadian taxpayer. The first objective is to ensure that the 
$35 million settlement fund that has been agreed upon will be 
the full amount for which the Government of Canada will be 
liable related to the Boat Harbour effluent treatment system.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	As the House has been previously informed, about 80 per cent 
of the settlement funds have already been transferred to the First 
Nation. In turn, the First Nation has paid out most of the $8 
million earmarked for individual compensation to eligible 
members.
<P>
	Any claims over and above this amount will be addressed 
through the $9.725 million continuing compensation fund. The 
Pictou Landing Micmac have also been using the $2.75 million 
allocated to the band compensation and development account to 
support projects that will benefit the entire community such as 
the building of a multi-purpose centre and the establishment of 
a Pictou Landing economic development promotional package.
<P>
	These two initiatives and others pursued by the Pictou 
Landing Micmac will be of great benefit not only to the First 
Nation but to other residents of Pictou County.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9700"> 9700 </A></B>
<P>
	Bill C-60 provides that any claims by the members of the 
First Nation that are not already settled by acceptance of the 
payments to individuals be directed to the continuing 
compensation fund. It will ensure that both the Government of 
Canada and the First Nation are protected from any such claims.
<P>
	The second objective to be achieved by Bill C-60 is to 
stipulate that the moneys paid to the Pictou Landing Micmac 
under the final agreement will not be considered Indian moneys 
as defined by the Indian Act.
<P>
	This benefits the federal government because it releases the 
Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development from 
any responsibility for managing these moneys. In these times of 
fiscal restraint the department should avoid taking on 
administrative functions that can and should be performed by 
First Nations.
<P>
	This provision of Bill C-60 benefits the First Nation because 
it will ensure that the Pictou Landing Micmac have complete 
control over their compensation dollars. This would not be 
possible if the moneys were considered Indian moneys as 
defined pursuant to the Indian Act.
<P>
	This is one of the most important provisions of this bill. I have 
said this government is committed to fulfilling its obligations to 
aboriginal people. Beyond just fulfilling commitments, we want 
to build a new partnership, a partnership based on trust, mutual 
respect and participation in the decision making process.
<P>
	This provision of Bill C-60 is a step toward making this goal a 
reality. Management of their own funds affords First Nations 
opportunities to chart their own course for economic 
development.
<P>
	I am confident that my constituents, the Pictou Landing 
Micmac, like many First Nations across the country will 
prosper. The government recognizes that the untapped potential 
of aboriginal people is untapped for Canada. In a small way the 
development opportunities afforded by the provision of Bill 
C-60 open the door to potential.
<P>
	The projects already borne from this settlement like the 
Pictou Landing economic development promotional package 
are just the beginning, a beginning not only for the First Nation 
but for other communities in Pictou County and in Nova Scotia 
as a whole.
<P>
	Implementation of the Boat Harbour agreement has been 
proceeding well with no significant problems encountered by 
either party to the agreement. Nevertheless, the settlement 
agreement does require Canada to explore ways that might yield 
a solution to the environmental problem that now exists at Boat 
Harbour.
<P>
	Toward this end several federal departments are facilitating 
and working with the Pictou Landing Micmac and other 
concerned parties to achieve the rehabilitation of Boat Harbour.
<P>
	I want to advise hon. members in this House that the federal 
government is committed to ensuring that the clean-up of Boat 
Harbour meets Canada's high environmental standards. This 
proposed legislation will have no impact on this process.
<P>
	As a party to the final agreement, the Pictou Landing Micmac 
have clearly indicated that they want and expect this legislation 
to be enacted.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	To ensure that Bill C-60 meets with this understanding in the 
settlement agreement the First Nation was consulted during the 
drafting of the legislation. Members of the First Nation are now 
awaiting Parliament's decision. In making that decision I would 
ask my hon. colleagues to keep the crown's honour in mind.
<P>
	I would ask them to remember that this legislation is the 
product of a clear and genuine commitment which was made at 
the request of the Pictou Landing Micmac more than a year ago. 
I would remind them that the government's word was accepted 
by the First Nation in good faith despite the problems it has 
endured over the past 25 years.
<P>
	It is time to put the unfinished business behind us so that the 
First Nations and the federal government's energy can be 
devoted to building for the future rather than rectifying past 
mistakes. We can and must do so by giving our unanimous 
support to Bill C-60.
<P>
	Therefore, as the member of Parliament for Central Nova I 
ask on behalf of my constituents, the Micmac First Nations 
people, for unanimous support from this honourable House for 
Bill C-60.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Madam Speaker, let 
me tell you right away that the Bloc Quebecois will be 
supporting this bill. As usual, I will try and explain the Micmac 
reality. I think it is important to give a little background because 
the Micmac Nation has always been recognized as a fishing 
nation living for the most part by rivers, lagoons or the sea.
<P>
	Many people wonder about the meaning of the word 
``Micmac''. In fact, there are two: ``a nation and its language'', 
and ``my family and friends''. When I travelled just recently to 
the Restigouche reserve, which by the way is called Listuguj, 
Whatever meaning you give to the word Micmac, what I saw and 
experienced on the reserve of which Chief Miller is the worthy 
representative confirms that both meanings perfectly describe 
the reality as I experienced it on this reserve.
<P>
	I saw people bound by very strong ties of friendship. Families 
form a very tightly knit fabric. Micmacs are also very proud of 
their language. In fact, they make a point of promoting the 
Micmac language in schools. Micmacs  have traditionally been 
very close to their roots and accorded great importance to their 
culture.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9701"> 9701 </A></B>
<P>
	Historically, what set Micmac villages apart from others was 
the fact that lodgings often housed one or more families and 
were located by the water. The significance of this bill's impact 
comes from the fact that the Pictou Landing reserve was located 
by the water, which is essential. Naturally, all that has happened 
over the course of the last three decades has had a direct impact 
on Micmacs' lifestyle. I felt that this needed to be pointed out.
<P>
	The Micmac Nation is a nation who was much affected by the 
arrival of Europeans. A population decline ensued. In the early 
days of the colony, there were about 50,000 Micmacs, as 
compared to a mere 10,000 registered Micmacs today. Some 
kind of socio-cultural conflict arose also because, for the 
Micmac Nation as for other aboriginal nations, exposure to the 
European culture did not always prove beneficial.
<P>
	Socio-cultural shocks have led this nation, and others, into 
dire poverty. Even during British rule, efforts were made to turn 
Micmacs into farmers but, given their traditional way of life, 
these efforts failed of course. Integration attempts continued, 
with Micmacs being sent out to work on the railway and in 
logging. Finally, you realize that these people were really 
sincere in the importance they accorded to their culture, a 
culture that has not only lived on to this day but is still highly 
valued, while all integration attempts have failed.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	Therefore, I felt it was important to present this short 
scenario, because the bill relates to a Micmac nation, the Pictou 
Landing community, which has always lived close to water. This 
bill deals with a specific body of water, the Boat Harbour.
<P>
	The problem started when the Scott Maritimes Limited Pulp 
and Paper Mills settled at Abercrombie Point. As we know, pulp 
and paper companies tend to pollute the environment. As well, 
the protection of the environment was not seen as vital then as it 
is now. The priority was to create jobs in an area largely covered 
with forests. In fact, that is where the bulk of wood harvesting 
took place.
<P>
	However, in 1965, the provincial government decided to build 
a waste treatment plant after realizing that the company was 
polluting the water. It was thought to be a good idea to set up a 
treatment plant to try to solve the problem. I say ``to try to 
solve'' because, as I will show in the next few minutes, that 
attempt unfortunately failed, with the result that lots of 
contaminants ended up in the water.
<P>
	That plant, which was built to treat the water coming from the 
pulp and paper mill, created a body of water covering several 
acres, in the vicinity of the reserve, and even on reserve land. 
From the very beginning, there was a lack of movement on the 
government's part regarding the cleaning up of this 
environmental catastrophe. This is  deplorable. For two 
decades, from 1965 to 1985, the Micmac tried to come to an 
amicable settlement with the federal government, which is 
responsible for native issues, and also with the Province of Nova 
Scotia, which has jurisdiction over the environment.
<P>
	For almost 20 years, the Micmac tried to reach some 
agreement. Because nothing was being done, they finally 
decided, in 1986, to sue the government.
<P>
	In this area, the environment has reached the critical stage in 
terms of its deterioration. According to some information, the 
level of pollution is such that it has been blamed for a number of 
deaths on the reserve.
<P>
	Through an agreement in principle, the government proposed 
a financial out-of-court settlement to the Pictou Landing Indian 
band. That agreement in principle was reached in December 
1992 and ratified in July 1993. It is a compensation agreement 
intended to settle out of court a suit brought by the Micmac in 
1986.
<P>
	The bill may look like a minor piece of legislation. There are 
only four clauses. Consequently, one might think that it does not 
deal with a complex issue. However, I know from experience 
that the number of clauses is no indication of how complex a 
piece of legislation can be. That bill may have only four clauses, 
but the last one refers to a specific agreement which, as I will 
show in a minute, is flawed in many ways. Although the bill does 
have some merits, as the hon. member pointed out. For instance, 
the money to be paid will not be money as provided under the 
Indian Act, which means that the community will be able to 
spend it as it sees fit.
<P>
	This is probably one of the few positive factors I found in the 
bill. If we refer to the agreement as such, and there is a reference 
to the agreement in clause 4, we realize that it does not really 
deal with the environmental problem. And I am not so sure that 
we are doing the Pictou Landing First Nation a big favour.
<P>
	Clause 4 of the bill, where we find the reference to section 13 
of the agreement, mentions a compensation account. In the 
event of legal proceedings in the days and months to come, 
claims may only be made against this compensation account.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	We in the Bloc Quebecois considered trying to help those who 
did not waive their rights, because, as I will explain later on, the 
people who use this compensation fund waive their right to sue 
the federal government, and in return, the government gives 
them $35 million, and I will give you a breakdown of this 
amount later on. In any case, at first we had some questions 
about section 13, because some people had not waived their 
rights.
<P>
	What happens to those people? I will expand on this later on, 
but before I go any further, I would also like to thank my 
colleagues on the standing committee who agreed to adjourn so I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9702"> 9702 </A></B>
<P>
could investigate this particular point, since we were not 
entirely satisfied with the response we got from the bureaucracy.
<P>
	That day, after meeting with officials from the Department of 
Indian Affairs, we were supposed to adopt the bill clause by 
clause, but because of my questions and the response from the 
officials, we agreed, many thanks to my colleagues, to adjourn 
for two days and-it never rains but it pours-I was given a draft 
amendment a few minutes before the committee started a special 
sitting to hear the Bloc Quebecois amendment, but 
unfortunately, the amendment suggested by our legal expert was 
not quite what we had in mind. As a result, I had to go before the 
committee empty-handed and apologize.
<P>
	We then considered introducing an amendment at the report 
stage, and although I did not discuss this with my colleagues on 
the standing committee, in the end, we decided not to introduce 
an amendment, after receiving additional information from the 
officials and getting in touch with the community of Pictou 
Landing.
<P>
	Initially, and I will provide some details later on, we were 
somewhat dubious in the case of individuals who did not waive 
their right, about their ability to bring legal proceedings against 
the company or Nova Scotia, and we could perhaps discuss this 
later on, but meanwhile, I would like to say a word of thanks to 
my colleagues, because they gave me a chance to get to the 
bottom of this matter and do a decent job in committee, in other 
words, to carefully examine each clause and then decide 
whether or not we wanted an amendment.
<P>
	I touched on this earlier, and I would just like to say, very 
briefly, that this is money that will not be subject to the 
provisions of section 35 of the Indian Act. This means the Pictou 
Landing community will be able to use this money as it sees fit, 
without being restricted by the provisions of the Indian Act.
<P>
	I would now like to comment on the agreement as such, and 
perhaps I should point out that only $17 million remains to be 
paid to the community, so the rest of the money has already been 
paid, and that being said, I may have quite a few things to say 
later on about the logic of having a bill before the House today 
when the process has already started and all the money or almost 
all has been paid, so that the government is saying: I just want 
you to agree and adopt this bill.
<P>
	It seems to me that certain elements with respect to the 
process of negotiation with the band must be taken into account, 
the government's fiduciary responsibility, the Bloc Quebecois' 
responsibility as the official opposition and the responsibility of 
the opposition parties of the time, have been overlooked. The 
whole thing is now presented to us as a package. Now we are 
faced with an alternative, that is, do we vote in favour of the bill 
or not. Since 95 per cent of the people in the community voted in 
favour, our options are somewhat limited.
<P>
	So, therefore, naturally, we will support the bill without 
amendment. We do, however, have a few things to say about the 
agreement, and I think we will use this debate to express them. I 
said earlier that the agreement was signed on July 20, 1993 and 
was ratified following a referendum. At the time, 95 per cent of 
the people said they were in favour of it. In a minute we will 
have a look at why they were in favour. I have my own personal 
idea on the matter. In democratic terms, however, we cannot 
criticize the agreement as such. Given the very high rate of 
participation-80 per cent-and the strong vote in favour-95 
per cent-, we really cannot criticize the democratic aspect of 
the question.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	Furthermore, according to the officials we asked, the 
remaining 5 per cent are people registered on the list of band 
members, but who do not live on the reservation. We were told 
they could live as far away as California. There were also a 
number of people with intellectual handicaps, who were unable 
to vote because they could not understand the scope of the 
agreement.
<P>
	I will quickly go through the agreement, section by section, to 
highlight certain comments that, among other things, raise 
doubt about the seriousness of the government's intention to 
really resolve the legal action issue and also the basic 
environmental issue.
<P>
	In section 2 of the agreement, Canada agrees to pay a $35 
million settlement. This amount is intended to cover 
compensation and to fulfil the government's fiduciary duty. 
Three funds have been created: one for band compensation and 
development, one for community development and one for 
individual compensation and development. I do not wish to get 
into the breakdown of the $35 million, so suffice it to say that the 
three funds exist. I will repeat throughout my speech that, in our 
opinion, this is not enough to compensate for the current 
environmental damage and the wrong done to these people.
<P>
	As I have said, since 1965, it is clear that the environment has 
been seriously harmed by the construction of the effluent 
treatment facility. Over the past 30 years, the government has 
been slow to put facilities in place. It has somewhat neglected its 
fiduciary duty towards first nations because they continually 
protested the way they were being treated, and neither the 
federal nor the Nova Scotia government made many firm 
commitments or took much real action to correct the situation.
<P>
	We can also say that the negative effects have taken on 
catastrophic proportions at present. Earlier, I mentioned 162 
hectares. Responsibility for resolving the issue and for taking 
legal action is now in the government's lap. We think that the 
government is not only hesitating now and will be hesitant in the 
future to enter into legal proceedings, but that it will also 
eventually take legal proceedings in the event that Boat Harbour 
is further developed. Therefore, we have reason to doubt wheth-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9703"> 9703 </A></B>
<P>
er the government really has the will to really resolve the main 
issue.
<P>
	The true problem remains the same, even with this bill, 
because pollution has not disappeared. All that is proposed is 
that some aboriginals be relocated. We might also wonder what 
type of land aboriginal people will be able to afford with that 
$35 million. And we are told that moneys have already been 
earmarked for purchasing this land. But will these people be 
better off? Unfortunately, we do not have the answer. I see this 
merely as an attempt to relieve the federal government of its 
fiduciary duty to aboriginals and to get out of a tight spot. So we 
have to find out whether the move will solve the problem.
<P>
	I also know that the governments of Canada and Nova Scotia 
are trying to assess the issue of environment versus 
employment. One cannot deny that Scott Paper creates a lot of 
jobs in Nova Scotia. We also know that this community suffers 
from a high rate of unemployment. So can we afford to say to 
this company, given the present situation, that standards will be 
set so high, that we will allow so many suits that, in the end, it 
will have to close its doors and lay off a lot of employees?
<P>
	We are caught in this tension between the environment and 
employment. I understand that employment was easily given 
higher priority than the environment at the time. But, for several 
years now, there seems to have been increasing concern over the 
environment. So the debate or tension between the environment 
and employment remains unresolved. And for our part, we can 
see that the government has decided to give priority to 
employment over the environment.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	I would like to move on to section 5 now. In this section, one 
begins to see the Canadian government's position in the matter. 
The agreement was reached in December 1992 and ratified in 
July 1993. Even before the agreement was signed, each band 
member had received $2,000. This, in itself, is a clear indication 
of the government's approach to the matter.
<P>
	Even before an agreement had been reached, even before a bill 
had been introduced, the government had already started with its 
hand-outs. We have to realize also that the Micmac Indians on 
that reserve live in appalling conditions, as practically none of 
them have jobs. Their environment is heavily polluted and, after 
30 years, they are sick and tired of negotiating or trying to 
negotiate with the government. They have to set money aside to 
set up a fund to pursue their case against the government. It is in 
such a context that they are presented with a nice cheque for 
$2,000 and told: This is a first instalment, you will get more, 
probably as much, but first of all you must relinquish your right 
to sue. You sign away that right and the federal government will 
give you $2,000.
<P>
	We can see why these people would jump at this offer, it is a 
ray of hope, a chance to improve their situation. Not only were 
they given a cheque for $2,000, but individuals were promised 
an additional amount of $1,500 upon signing the agreement in 
principle. Except that the parliamentary process was 
conveniently forgotten. This was done without us, we were 
informed only when the bill was tabled and, today, we are asked 
to approve a bill implementing this agreement. I find this 
approach questionable.
<P>
	This is an approach that we consider paternalistic. It is like 
saying: We have been negligent, but we are going to make up for 
it, we are going to give you some money and you forget about the 
whole thing. With this money you will be able to move 
elsewhere. We, as a government, are not going to restore the 
environment, but neither are we going to launch any lawsuit 
against you. People who sign and take the money must sign an 
undertaking not to sue the government of Canada or of Nova 
Scotia or the company. Everybody involved in that mess is 
getting off scotfree. They did not act responsibly and now 
people have to take the money because they are in dire straits.
<P>
	This is a paternalistic approach. We find this kind of approach 
questionable, at best. In short, band members had already 
received money, $2,000 in December 1991, and $1,500 in 
December 1992, before the agreement was signed, and now the 
government confronts them with a fait accompli.
<P>
	Before I became a parliamentarian I was, among others 
things, a negotiator for twenty years or so. This is a well known 
fact in negotiating circles: when one of the parties to the 
negotiations is in a very weakened position-negotiating being 
basically a power struggle-it is easy to promise things, give 
them systematically and then say to this party: Now, all you have 
to do is to sign this form and all your problems will be solved.
<P>
	Everything was done very quickly, in a paternalistic manner, 
and the environmental issue has not been settled. The whole 
process is highly questionable.
<P>
	The agreement provides for a period of prescription; that is to 
say that individuals have up to two years after the signing of the 
agreement to decide whether to give up their rights and be 
entitled to this famous compensation fund, or not to give them 
up. According to the interpretation given by officials, these 
individuals are going to be caught between a rock and a hard 
place, because it will be extremely difficult to challenge the 
legislation on account of section 13 which creates a further 
impediment, with respect to individual rights, for people 
wanting to appeal to the courts. As I said before, it is this 
particular point we find extremely questionable.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	Thus, this prescription period will come into effect in July of 
this year. Then, not only will the people have not taken 
advantage of this find it difficult to start legal proceedings but 
they 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9704"> 9704 </A></B>
<P>
will no longer have access to the compensation fund. They will 
be left with nothing at all.
<P>
	Other sections as well are a little disturbing. The federal 
government is getting out from under any future fiduciary duties 
or obligations towards the community with regard to the risks 
associated with the facilities. It not only said that you are 
released of responsibilities, of prosecutions concerning the 
environment, but that, in the future, if the company decides to 
pollute even more, the government will assume these 
responsibilities and thus release individuals from them.
<P>
	We see that the environment has been greatly deteriorating for 
almost 30 years and we recognize that this could continue in the 
future and that the federal government is released of all future 
responsibilities. I think that this is prejudicial enough to the 
environment to be mentioned.
<P>
	Section 7 stipulates the responsibilities of the chief and his or 
her council with regard to the management of the money 
received. I agree that the $35 million received are not native 
moneys but one has to realize that the band and the chief must 
meet certain requirements. This money is not given 
unconditionally, to be spent however they wish.
<P>
	In section 8, the government recognizes that Canada's current 
position is that it is not at all sure that Boat Harbour will be 
brought back to its natural condition, that is, the condition it was 
in before 1965. The government itself admits that it is not sure 
this can be done. But the government of Canada is committed to 
exploring possible ways of dealing with the environmental 
problem.
<P>
	We have to take a good look at the words that are used. The 
government will explore possible ways of dealing with the 
problem. There are other words to which I would like to draw 
your attention. The government of Canada may undertake, at its 
sole discretion, reasonable action that it deems necessary. As a 
negotiator, I could not accept that such vague words as ``at its 
sole discretion'' and ``reasonable action'' be included in an 
agreement, especially since it is the government itself which 
must decide what constitutes reasonable action.
<P>
	There are some flaws in the agreement and we feel that it is 
important for us to inform you of these flaws and to tell you that, 
unfortunately, it is a done deal and that this agreement must now 
be justified. We will not keep our mouths shut. We will 
denounce all these flaws. I hope the government will take my 
comments into account so that things are done differently in the 
future.
<P>
	Section 9 deals with the creation of a committee on 
environmental issues composed of three members from the 
Micmac community and three members appointed by the 
government of Canada. It says further on that the number could 
increase with the agreement of both parties. What does that 
mean? It means that, eventually, the government of Nova Scotia 
could be represented on this committee and so could the main 
pulp and paper company, thereby diluting native participation. 
It is  something to be cautious about. Fortunately, both parties 
concerned have to agree to this.
<P>
	I have no advice to give. I think that people are mature 
enough, but personally, if I were on the aboriginal side, I would 
maintain my participation on the committee at 50 per cent and 
would not agree to the addition of other members, who would 
reduce my impact. Just a warning in passing, but a necessary 
one.
<P>
	Section 12 provides that all members that have received 
moneys must automatically renounce completely any present or 
future claims. Thus, anyone accepting money, who has recourse 
to the compensation account, agrees not to take any action 
regarding past or future events. The danger is that the Scott 
Paper company will feel it is off the hook, that it will continue to 
pollute-I know that jobs are involved-but the difficulty, 
however, is that none of the compensation money has been set 
aside for the environment.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	After all, this is a company that is providing employment, 
even if it hardly gets full marks for its environmental 
performance. In my view, this company does not even get a 
passing mark. So, in exchange for an amount of money, the 
members of the community must forever agree not to take any 
action against the federal government, Nova Scotia, or the 
company.
<P>
	In fact, all rights to take legal action are transferred to the 
federal government, in the terms I mentioned earlier, at the 
discretion of the government, reasonable action, as decided by 
the federal government. One is left to wonder if the federal 
government is going to take its environmental responsibilities 
seriously, and I must admit that I have not yet ruled out the 
possibility of pointing out to my colleague from Laurentides, 
the environment critic, that there is a major environmental issue 
at stake here of which she should be aware. As I was saying, if 
the company decides to step up production, thereby increasing 
pollution, it is a great pity, but there is almost no conceivable 
way of stopping it at the present time.
<P>
	As for section 13, I probably raised the question with officials 
and was told that my question was perhaps not clear the first 
time. After reading the committee blues once again, I realize 
that the question was clear enough and that the official probably 
changed his mind in the meantime. But section 13 only refers to 
the compensation account. Those who relinquished their rights 
have already dipped into the compensation account. Those who 
do not give up their rights by the July 1995 deadline I mentioned 
earlier can access the compensation account but, according to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9705"> 9705 </A></B>
<P>
lawyers, the department and, after checking with the band, the 
Indians themselves, no one can get around this account.
<P>
	Therefore, band members who have decided not to give up 
their rights will be forced eventually to use the compensation 
account, with little or no recourse against the different levels of 
government or the company. The purpose of the compensation 
account is to settle past and future bills, but it will be the only 
money offered by the government.
<P>
	The federal government must have thought: ``I will pay $35 
million to settle past and future debts, and that is how I will 
discharge my fiduciary responsibility toward the Pictou 
Landing Indians.'' In a nutshell, I think that is what the 
government attempted to do. No one, I think, could circumvent 
the provisions in this bill and say, ``I will go further by 
launching a personal lawsuit for, say, $10 million''. People will 
always be brought back to the compensation account, which is a 
major obstacle to taking individual legal action. If I were in the 
shoes of someone who did not give up his rights, I would see if I 
could sue under the constitution.
<P>
	I know that this would be an additional obstacle, but I think 
that individuals can probably still sue. However, the clause I 
have just read to you will certainly be used by crown attorneys to 
bring people back to the compensation fund.
<P>
	In conclusion, there are positive elements in the agreement. 
This money will be exempt from the Indian Act. However, this 
approach is highly questionable from a regulatory and 
parliamentary standpoint. On one hand, the federal government 
and the province of Nova Scotia have let the situation 
deteriorate for 30 years. The federal government has neglected 
its fiduciary role for 30 years. It takes action only when the 
damage is done and almost irreversible.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	It entices the natives knowing full well that they are living in 
miserable conditions. It waves this $2,000 cheque at them and 
promises another $1,500 will be paid if the agreement is signed. 
It tells the band: ``You will have a compensation account. You 
will have up to $35 million to relocate and start up new 
projects.'' Given their living conditions, this offer is so 
tempting that I can see why they jump at it. The approach is 
paternalistic. Any right to sue is taken away in a context where 
the scope is so broad and the words used so vague that nothing 
stops the government from doing absolutely nothing and letting 
the situation deteriorate if it so pleases. Finally, the government 
comes up with this bill when all is settled.
<P>
	When I say that all is settled, I mean that the agreement was 
signed and money paid. The band already committed itself. It is 
all done. The only thing left to do is for us to put our seal of 
approval on the whole thing.
<P>
	Regarding the settlement process and the parliamentary 
process, we express serious concerns. Sadly, we have been put in 
front of a fait accompli. We will go along with the referendum 
decision whereby a 95 per cent majority approved the agreement 
as is, but I would like to make a suggestion to the government. It 
would be interesting if any new claim settlement-and I am 
convinced there will be more, given the number of reserves in 
Canada-be subjected to a regulatory process and a slightly 
more democratic parliamentary process, so that we are not put in 
front of a fait accompli again. You just cannot come and tell us: 
``See, it is all settled; all you have to do is to pass the bill''.
<P>
	As I said, this bill looks quite innocuous with just four 
clauses, but it has impacts and effects on Pictou Landing. Let me 
wrap up. Based on the background I gave you earlier, we can 
assume that people who have probably lived by that this stretch 
of water now have to relocate on land that-I hope, with $35 
million-will allow them to maintain their traditions and 
culture. These people depend on fishing for their livelihood and 
survival.
<P>
	While deploring the regulatory and parliamentary process, 
the Bloc Quebecois will support the bill in consideration of the 
decision made by Pictou Landing and the aboriginal people who 
live there to approve the agreement as it stands.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I enjoyed listening to the member for Central 
Nova in whose riding is the Pictou Landing band. I also enjoyed 
the speech of the Bloc member for Saint-Jean. However, if it 
had not been for the opening and closing statements, I would not 
know which way he would be voting.
<P>
	It is a pleasure to have an opportunity to say a few words at 
third reading of Bill C-60, the Pictou Landing Indian Band 
Agreement Act. The legislation has received due consideration 
at second reading and careful review in committee. I thank the 
departmental officials who have provided us with a cogent and 
detailed explanation.
<P>
	While my party and I had some concerns, particularly over 
ratification of an agreement after payment of $28 million of the 
$35 million package has already been made, we support the 
intent of the legislation.
<P>
	I will give a quick background. In 1966 the crown failed to 
provide or to obtain the band's informed consent to transfer to 
the province of Nova Scotia its riparian rights on the Boat 
Harbour tidal estuary. This transfer permitted the province to 
operate Boat Harbour as a facility to treat effluent from the kraft 
mill owned by Scott Industries Maritime Limited.
<P>
	In July 1992 the government approved a mandate to negotiate 
an out of court settlement of the lawsuit. It was ratified by vote 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9706"> 9706 </A></B>
<P>
on July 5, 1993. The final agreement was signed on July 20, 
1993. That was under the previous administration.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	The final agreement provides that the band gives Canada a 
release from responsibility and liability for past, present and 
future effects related to the Boat Harbour effluent treatment 
system in exchange for compensation to the Pictou Landing 
band. As I mentioned previously, the total compensation was 
$35 million of which the band received $28 million at the end of 
April 1994 and will receive the remainder in April 1995.
<P>
	The one outstanding question in my mind is: What has taken 
so long to bring the bill forward? I have asked the question and I 
have yet to receive a satisfactory answer.
<P>
	There are two critical issues addressed in the legislation. First 
it will ensure that all future claims by members of the First 
Nations in that area will be directed to an established fund that 
the bill provides. This means that no further claims can be made 
against the crown in this instance. This is critical to me and my 
party. We therefore are satisfied with that arrangement.
<P>
	Second, Bill C-60 provides that the Pictou Landing Micmac 
band is responsible for managing and disseminating the 
settlement money provided, a total of $35 million, $20 million 
of which will go to pay out claims to the band and to individual 
members. The remainder, $15 million, shall be used to pay band 
members to relocate should it become necessary. Once the 
allotment has been used, the band has no further recourse 
against the crown for further financial compensation.
<P>
	Having addressed the two operative principles of the bill, I 
want to add that it is my hope the $20 million will help deliver 
the band to self-sufficiency. We feel that every agreement the 
government signs should ultimately bring more self-sufficiency 
to the band.
<P>
	The Reform Party supports the conclusion of outstanding 
claims. The Pictou claim is a consequence of the non-fulfilment 
by the government of an obligation arising from the improper 
administration of reserve lands by the department. This breach 
of fiduciary responsibility and duty has now been settled.
<P>
	I am confident members of the Pictou band will manage this 
settlement responsibly and I wish them well.

	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-68, an act 
respecting firearms and other weapons, be read the second time 
and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, may I say that I consider it a 
privilege to lead off debate at second reading on this important 
piece of legislation and to urge the House to adopt the legislation 
in principle before sending it to the standing committee for 
detailed consideration.
<P>
	If I may, I would propose to begin my treatment of the 
legislation today by speaking about matters of principle that 
motivate the government in preparing and presenting this 
legislation: objectives, ideals and values.
<P>
	The government suggests that the object of the regulation of 
firearms should be the preservation of the safe, civilized and 
peaceful nature of Canada.
<P>
	While there are many reasons we respect and admire our 
neighbours to the south and value our unique relationship with 
them, there are also aspects of the American way of life that we 
see as very different from what we want for ourselves. Perhaps 
chief among them is the way in which firearms are regulated and 
used.
<P>
	It is said that there are over 200 million firearms in private 
ownership in the United States of America, including tens of 
millions of handguns, with varying levels of regulation, but 
generally in a context in which the private use of firearms is 
acknowledged, recognized and even in some places encouraged 
including for self-protection.
<P>
	It seems to me and to the government that we do not want that 
for ourselves. We do not want to live in a country in which 
people feel they want or need to possess a firearm for protection. 
That is the first principle we take as a guiding principle for the 
preparation of legislation in terms of the regulation of firearms.
<P>
	A second principle is that if we are to retain our safe and 
peaceful character as a country we should signal in every 
possible way that we will not tolerate and we will severely 
punish the use of firearms in the commission of crime. Those 
who take up a firearm to threaten others, to rob or to assault must 
know that by choosing to use a firearm they are making an 
important decision about a large part of the rest of their lives. 
The punishment must be certain and must be significant.
<P>
	Those who smuggle guns, those who traffic in illegal 
firearms, those who profit by putting guns into the hands of 
criminals must know that the penalties for such misconduct will 
be swift and will be certain. That is the second principle we take 
as governing or guiding the preparation of legislation as it 
relates to firearms.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9707"> 9707 </A></B>
<P>
	A third principle is that we must acknowledge and respect 
the legitimate uses of firearms. We should acknowledge and 
respect the history and tradition of hunting, not only as a 
favourite pastime in many parts of Canada but as a very 
important economic activity contributing directly to the 
prosperity of a number of regions throughout Canada. We must 
acknowledge and respect the use of firearms for ranching or 
hunting purposes where firearms are a tool, an implement used 
by the proprietor of business to get by. We must allow for that. 
We must not interfere with that unduly.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	May I say as well that we must acknowledge that some people 
enjoy collecting firearms. Some people enjoy the shooting 
sports. Indeed, Canada has achieved distinction internationally 
through the skill of those athletes who train and excel at sport 
shooting. We must acknowledge and respect that interest and 
that skill. But those legitimate interests, while they are 
acknowledged and respected, must be carried on in a context 
that is consistent with public safety.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Consequently, Canadians firmly intend to safeguard and to 
reinforce the exceptional civility which has always been theirs. 
The legislative and political program entitled ``Safe Home Safe 
Street'' is testimony of this government's commitment.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	These are the elements of the legislation that we bring 
forward today as Bill C-68: First, tough measures to deal with 
the criminal misuse of firearms; second, specific penalties to 
punish those who would smuggle illegal firearms; and third, 
measures overall to provide a context in which the legitimate 
use of firearms can be carried on in a manner consistent with 
public safety. In all of that, the universal registration of firearms 
is a fundamental strategy, a fundamental support system to 
allow us to achieve the objectives I have described.
<P>
	I know that for many members and for many Canadians the 
prospect of universal registration is the aspect of this legislation 
which is the most controversial. In the months I have spent 
travelling the country and speaking with those who own, use and 
enjoy firearms lawfully, I have been told by many that they see 
registration as a point on which they are going to differ with this 
government.
<P>
	May I deal directly with the issue of registration and how it is 
going to enable us to achieve the objectives of a safe and 
peaceful society, a more effective response to the criminal 
misuse of firearms and enhanced public safety.
<P>
	I will begin with the proposition that we live in a society in 
which all manner of property is licensed, registered or regulated 
in some way. All manner of activities are regulated either by 
legislation or administrative action to achieve a level of 
orderliness  which is desirable in a civilized society. In that 
context, where cars, pets, and property of all description are 
registered or recorded for purposes of tracing ownership or 
reflecting transfers, surely the prospect of registering firearms 
is rationally justified by a society that wants to achieve a level of 
order.
<P>
	What is the connection between registration on the one hand 
and the efforts of police to fight crime on the other, or trying to 
achieve a safer society? From my inquiries, from everything I 
have read and all the discussions I have had, both with law 
enforcement officers and with members of the firearms 
community themselves, it seems to me that criminals derive 
their firearms from the underground market. They do not 
register their firearms. They do not buy them at a local 
dealership, fill out the forms, apply for the firearms acquisition 
certificate, take the courses or pay the fees. Criminals acquire 
their firearms in the underground market illegally.
<P>
	Those who engage in street crime tap into a market that is fed 
from one of two sources: guns that are smuggled into Canada 
and therefore are here illegally, or guns that are stolen from 
lawful owners and then traded in the underground.
<P>
<B>(1220 ) </B>
<P>
	Suppose you are inclined to use a gun in a holdup or an 
assault. You can go to one of Canada's major cities and, out of 
the trunk of a car, behind an after hours club, or on the second 
floor of a certain downtown hotel, or at a suburban house, if you 
know someone who knows someone, you can by one of these 
guns illegally and put it to a criminal use.
<P>
	Surely we must choke off the sources of supply for that 
underground market. Surely we must reduce the number of 
firearms smuggled into the country. Surely we must cut down on 
the number of firearms stolen and traded in the underground. 
How do we achieve that? Through registration.
<P>
	The registration of all firearms will enable us to do a better 
job at the borders. We will never stop the smuggling of firearms 
entirely. There are 130 million border crossings a year. We 
cannot stop every vehicle and check every trunk and glove 
compartment. But we can do a better job than we have done in 
the past and registration will enable us to do it.
<P>
	Last year approximately 375,000 firearms came into Canada. 
Almost all guns sold here are imported. We do not know where 
they are or how they got here. There is no control once they 
arrive. We know that guns leak from shipments that come in 
lawfully. Just last week in Toronto there was an arrest of 
someone who had been illegally selling guns that were legally 
imported.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9708"> 9708 </A></B>
<P>
	Registration will enable us to record what arrives and track 
it to the point of sale into the hands of a lawful owner. 
Registration will enable us to stop the kind of leakage that now 
occurs, to reduce the incidence of people illegally selling that 
which is legally imported.
<P>
	Along with other measures that the government proposes in 
relation to border controls, including enhanced inspection and 
enforcement, registration will enable us to address one of the 
two principal sources of guns for the criminal market in the 
underground.
<P>
	As to the second source of guns, those stolen from lawful 
owners, last year approximately 3,800 firearms were lost or 
stolen by those who lawfully own them in Canada. In the years 
since 1974 a cumulative total of 65,000 firearms have been 
stolen or lost and not recovered.
<P>
	What does this have to do with registration? The police 
contend, and I accept it as a matter of logic, that registration 
which obligates each of us to record the fact of our ownership of 
firearms will imbue the owners with a heightened sense of 
responsibility to comply with laws already on the books 
mandating safe storage. These might involve locking the 
triggers, keeping the ammunition separate, or keeping the 
firearms themselves in a locked case.
<P>
	With compliance with those safe storage requirements the 
incidence of firearms being stolen, of someone breaking and 
entering into a person's house and finding a shotgun leaning 
against the closet wall or a handgun in the bedside table will 
diminish. A second important source for criminals and guns will 
be addressed.
<P>
	There is more. Registration will reduce crime and better equip 
the police to deal with crime in Canadian society by providing 
them with information they often need to do their job. Let me 
provide a practical example for my colleagues in the House.
<P>
	Two weeks ago in Victoria when I met with provincial and 
territorial ministers of justice, we talked about a number of 
amendments to the Criminal Code that might make it more 
effective. One of them had to do with criminal harassment or 
so-called stalking.
<P>
	It was suggested an improvement might be to add to the 
panoply of penalties the court can impose when convicting a 
person of criminal harassment, an order prohibiting them from 
possessing firearms because we would be dealing now with 
someone who had been convicted of a crime which too often 
leads to violence.
<P>
	That suggestion was made in the context of ministers, not all 
of whom agreed with universal registration. But when the 
question was asked: Assuming that we have an order against 
someone made by the court forbidding them from possessing 
firearms because they have been convicted of criminal 
harassment, how will we enforce that order? How will we know 
that all of the person's firearms have been surrendered? How 
will the police know what firearms to look for when they arrive 
to enforce the order?
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	Mandatory registration will provide a basis upon which the 
police can enforce that kind of order, which is commonly made 
in the courts when people have been convicted of such offences.
<P>
	I have said in the House in the past and rely heavily upon the 
fact that preponderantly the police are in favour of universal 
registration. We can quibble about individual officers. I know it 
is not unanimous. However, the chiefs have been vigorously 
pressing for this legislation for many years.
<P>
	The Canadian Police Association, through its executive, is 
supportive of these measures. Police forces and boards across 
the country are encouraging us to proceed with this legislation. I 
know there are police officers who see it differently, but 
preponderantly the police forces are in favour of these 
measures.
<P>
	Victims groups, including CAVEAT, urge us to have universal 
registration. Priscilla de Villiers, the president of CAVEAT, lost 
a daughter in a dreadful tragedy. She was murdered by a man in 
respect of whom the police had investigations concerning 
firearms.
<P>
	In the Jonathon Yeo case there was an inquest into Nina de 
Villiers' death. After spending months looking at the facts of 
that case, the jury at that inquest recommended universal 
registration of all firearms. Priscilla de Villiers has spoken out 
strongly in favour of that measure, explaining her conviction 
that it will help the police to deal with crime.
<P>
	The point is broader still. Registration will assist us to deal 
with the scourge of domestic violence. Statistics demonstrate 
that every six days a woman is shot to death in Canada, almost 
always in her home, almost always by someone she knows, 
almost always with a legally owned rifle or shotgun. This is not a 
street criminal with a smuggled handgun at the corner store. 
This is an acquaintance, a spouse or a friend in the home.
<P>
	What does this have to do with registration? Domestic 
violence by its very nature is episodic and incremental. 
Typically, somewhere along the line the court has made an order 
barring the aggressor from possessing firearms. When the police 
try to enforce that order, just as in the case of stalking, they do 
not know whether they have been successful or not. They do not 
know what firearms are there.
<P>
	When firearms are registered, if it is necessary for a person to 
register and show proof of registration to buy ammunition, as it 
will be, the police will know what firearms are there. The police 
will be able to enforce those orders and lives will be saved.
<P>
	Suicides and accidents provide another example. Last year, of 
the 1,400 people who died by firearms in Canada, 1,100 were 
suicides. I know there are those who say that suicide by its 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9709"> 9709 </A></B>
<P>
nature will result in death no matter what controls are in place if 
the person is determined to take his or her life. No doubt that 
point  has some force. However, too many of those suicides were 
by young people acting in a moment of anguish, acting 
impulsively because of a failed relationship, difficulty in the 
home, or problems at school.
<P>
	If a firearm is not readily available, lives can be saved. If 
registration, as the police believe, will encourage owners to 
store firearms safely so those impulsive acts are less likely, the 
result may be different.
<P>
	In the years since 1970, some 470 children have died in 
Canada as a result of accidents with firearms. If we can achieve 
safer storage through registration, if registration will provide us 
with a tool by which we can identify firearms owners, educate 
them about their obligations for safe storage and encourage 
them to comply, children's lives could be saved. Against this 
background what are the objections to registration? It is said that 
it will be unduly costly, both to the government and to the 
firearms' owners. Let us examine that contention, first, with 
respect to the government.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	We have provided our estimate of the cost of implementing 
universal registration over the next five years. We say that it will 
cost $85 million. We have also said that we will put before the 
parliamentary committee, on which all parties sit, details of 
those calculations showing our assumptions and how we arrived 
at those figures. We encourage the members opposite to 
examine our estimates. We are confident we will demonstrate 
that the figures are realistic and accurate.
<P>
	In so far as the cost to firearms' owners is concerned, the 
system of registration that we envisage if this legislation is 
enacted would commence next year with the registration of 
owners. Those who own firearms would be asked within five 
years to pick up a card, conveniently available in their 
communities, to identify themselves by name and address and to 
return it. They would then be sent a permit or a licence to own a 
firearm. In the first year of the five-year implementation period 
we expect that the cost to the firearms owner would be zero. If it 
is not zero, it would be a nominal amount in the range of $10.
<P>
	The second phase of registration, the registration of the 
firearms themselves, would commence two years later in 
January 1998. Again firearms owners would be asked to fill out 
a card, which they would pick up in their communities, identify 
their firearms by make, model and serial number, to return it and 
we will send them a registration certificate for their firearms. 
Once again, this would be phased in over five years from 1998. 
Once again, in the first year of implementation, the cost would 
be zero, or if not zero a nominal amount in the range of $10 to 
register up to 10 firearms.
<P>
	If we contrast the relative convenience of such a system-all 
we are asking of firearms owners is to fill out two cards and mail 
them in-with the advantages that responsible people say we 
will achieve through such a system, it seems that on any 
cost-benefit analysis registration is justified.
<P>
	It is said that such a system will be complex and bureaucratic. 
Surely it is evident from the description which I have given that 
it will be just the opposite. We can take the opportunity of 
designing and implementing such a system in collaboration with 
provincial authorities, with the input of the firearms groups to 
eliminate irritants, to overcome paperwork burden, to simplify 
and streamline the system so that all of our objectives can be 
achieved at the same time.
<P>
	It is crucially important, in my judgment, that as we debate 
this question of registration, in respect of which there are 
strongly held views on both sides, that we do so on the real facts. 
Let us confine ourselves to the reality of the situation. Let us not 
hear that the registration system will cost $100 per firearm. Let 
us not hear that it is a prelude to the confiscation by the 
government of hunting rifles and shotguns. Let us not contend 
that it will cost $1.5 billion to put in place.
<P>
	That is the way to distort the discussion. That is the way to 
frighten people. Surely this debate must be carried out on the 
real facts. When the real facts are addressed it seems clear that 
the objectives of which I spoke at the outset can be achieved 
while respecting the legitimate uses of firearms. This can surely 
be done without imposing unduly on firearms owners through 
the introduction of universal registration for the reasons I have 
described.
<P>
	So far as crime is concerned, the House will know from 
statements made earlier that the legislation contemplates a 
toughening of the penalties of the criminal misuse of firearms. It 
contemplates a change in the structure of the code to overcome 
the plea bargaining of charges relating to the use of firearms so 
that the penalties will be woven directly into the sections which 
provide for the offences themselves.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	I have discussed with my provincial and territorial 
counterparts their collaboration in an effort to ensure that the 
laws we write in the Criminal Code will be enforced as such in 
the courts and that the attorneys general of the provinces will 
instruct crown attorneys, in any case in which the facts justify 
them, to seek the penalties that are included in this legislation as 
deterrents to the criminal misuse of firearms.
<P>
	In the course of the work that I did in response to the Prime 
Minister's request that I prepare this legislation, I met with over 
150 national and regional organizations of firearms owners and 
users. I met with hunters, farmers, target shooters, collectors, 
skeet shooters and athletes who achieved distinction for Canada 
in the Commonwealth and Olympic Games. I met with the  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9710"> 9710 </A></B>
<P>
Shooting Federation of Canada. I met with all manner of local 
hunting and outdoors and wilderness clubs.
<P>
	I want the House to know that I listened and I learned from 
that process. Elements of this package were changed 
substantially, moulded specifically, on what I heard from 
firearms owners.
<P>
	For one thing, the House will see in Bill C-68 that we not only 
intend changes to the Criminal Code to toughen the sanctions 
but we also contemplate a separate statute called the Firearms 
Act to deal with the regulatory aspects in relation to firearms 
acquisition, use and ownership.
<P>
	This is intended to meet the longstanding complaint from 
firearms owners that they were offended by having to consult the 
Criminal Code to determine the manner in which their private 
ownership of firearms was to be regulated.
<P>
	I was asked why it was necessary to combine the regulation of 
private ownership of firearms with the criminal law. I responded 
by removing those elements from the code and embodying them 
in a separate statute called the Firearms Act.
<P>
	There were also suggestions early on calling for the central 
storage of firearms or urban gun free zones. From my 
consultation with the firearms community I learned that such 
proposals were impractical and they were not pursued.
<P>
	At the outset the government was urged to ban all handguns. 
We were told that three-quarters of Canadians, and indeed the 
majority of firearms owners, believed that all handguns in 
private ownership should be banned. We did not do that.
<P>
	In the course of my meetings with the firearms groups, I was 
very much impressed with the ardour with which many 
Canadians approach the target shooting sports. They are highly 
skilled people, very law-abiding, conscientious in their 
pastimes and their hobbies. These Canadians want to continue in 
those sports.
<P>
	Therefore this legislation acknowledges and allows those 
sports to continue. What we have done is remove from 
circulation over time, and to ban immediately after the 
enactment of the legislation, the importation and sale of those 
handguns inappropriate for target or sport shooting, the 
so-called Saturday night specials. These handguns are by their 
design and characteristics suitable for concealment, 
inexpensive to buy, easy to trade in the underground and not 
appropriate for target shooting because of their lack of accuracy.
<P>
	We have also made it clear that for those who own handguns in 
the banned or prohibited categories, such owners will be able to 
use them in accordance with the requalification requirements in 
the statute and trade them to and from others in the same class. 
Consequently complaints that we were affecting the property 
value of owners' investments have been addressed.
<P>
	May I also emphasize that as this bill goes to committee 
following second reading debate, it will go with my request that 
the committee look at specific changes in the law. First of all, to 
ensure that we are accommodating all of those sporting 
competitions with handguns, we have already made it clear that 
the .22-.32 calibre Walther used by Linda Thom at the 1984 
Olympics will not be covered by the ban. We want the 
committee to take the advice of the International Shooting 
Union to determine whether there are other handguns that 
should be exempted so that legitimate sporting activities will 
not be threatened.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	Second, I will ask the committee to examine the question 
whether there are black powder shooting events that might be 
affected by this legislation. It is not our intention in any way to 
limit historical re-enactments with the use of reproductions. We 
do not believe we have done that but we will ask the committee 
to look specifically at that question and to let us know whether 
additional technical amendments are required to make the 
meaning clear.
<P>
	Third, we will ask the committee to look at the question of 
relics and heirlooms, recognizing that there are families and 
individuals who want to pass on to the next generation firearms 
that they have acquired and that have a specific sentimental or 
historical value to the family. That should be respected. We will 
ask the committee to fashion a way to allow it to happen 
consistently with the imperatives of public safety.
<P>
	May I also observe that the introduction of universal 
registration will allow a rational way to control access to 
ammunition so that those who wish to buy ammunition will have 
to establish that they are properly registered to have and use a 
firearm.
<P>
	Last, may I refer to the aboriginal communities who during 
the period of consultation were insistent that we respect, first, 
their treaty rights and second, their traditional and community 
way of life.
<P>
	The firearms legislation will apply to aboriginal communities 
in exactly the same way as it applies to everyone else. The 
principles are identical. However, we have undertaken to respect 
treaty rights. We believe that this legislation is consistent with 
treaty rights because it is no more than the regulation by the 
federal government of hunting and other activities.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Two classes of Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Not two classes. Furthermore, we believe that this 
legislation can be implemented in a way that is sensitive to the 
traditional way of life of aboriginal people, that its 
administration can be decentralized to the community. We are 
committed 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9711"> 9711 </A></B>
<P>
to working with the aboriginal communities across Canada to 
ensure that happens.
<P>
	From time to time issues and questions arise which permit the 
legislature of a country to define what kind of future it wants for 
the country. It seems to me that on the subject of the regulation 
of firearms we have just such an issue. We have an opportunity 
for Parliament to make a statement about the kind of Canada that 
we want for ourselves and for our children, about the efforts we 
are prepared to make to ensure the peaceful and civilized nation 
that we have and enjoy and to demonstrate just who is in control 
of firearms in Canada. Is it the gun lobby or is it the people of 
this country?
<P>
	Much reference is made in the House on the subject of polls. It 
was not polls that inspired this legislation. This legislation is 
based on the principles and objectives that I described at the 
outset. However, polls are useful from time to time to remind us 
just where the people stand on these issues. There is no doubt 
that these proposals enjoy the support of the vast majority of 
Canadians, rural and urban, in every region of the country. They 
see this legislation as an opportunity for us to make exactly the 
kind of statement I referred to about the kind of country we 
want, the kind of future we want and just how firearms should be 
acquired and used in Canada.
<P>
	I commend this legislation to the House. I invite its attention 
to the principles of which we speak and I ask for the support of 
the House for those principles.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
at last we have a bill on gun control, and we are very pleased. It 
was high time the Minister of Justice tabled his plan of action in 
the form of a bill. We are delighted to proceed with the real 
debate. No more delays, no more conferences and consultations. 
Now the debate can start on Bill C-68, which is supposed to be 
an innovative piece of legislation.
<P>
	We in the official opposition are aware of the concerns of a 
public that is disturbed, and rightly so, about the proliferation of 
firearms and the shocking number of deaths caused by these 
weapons.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	We do not criticize just for the sake of criticizing, although 
the Minister of Justice does not seem to agree. Our criticism is 
constructive. Basically, we support legislation that will tighten 
gun control.
<P>
	Right from the start, I would like to stress the attitude of the 
Minister of Justice during the debate on gun control. It is always 
a pleasure to watch a politician who sticks to his guns.
<P>
	That being said, although the Minister of Justice is to be 
commended, Bill C-68 is not a panacea. It will not deal with all 
the problems out there. In fact, I am not so much worried about 
what the bill contains as about what it does not contain. I will 
expand on this in a few minutes.
<P>
	I can hardly ignore the behaviour of the minority pro-gun 
lobby, a minority that managed to give the impression that its 
extreme position is widely shared. The pro-gun lobby and their 
Reform Party friends have been piling on the speeches. They 
would have us believe that more is better. The warm welcome 
they gave the Minister of Justice when he visited Calgary says a 
lot about their allegiance and their cynical attitudes. Threats of 
civil disobedience, the sacrosanct right to own firearms and 
individual and collective rights are all part of their rallying cry.
<P>
	They want the public to believe that a bill on gun control is 
worthy of a dictator like Stalin, Hitler or Pol Pot. I even received 
a communication in my office in Ottawa, with a list attached of 
countries where genocide had been practised and the dates on 
which gun control legislation had come into effect in those 
countries.
<P>
	These fervent supporters of the right to bear arms were trying 
to establish a link between gun control and the genocides that 
have tarnished the history of mankind. This is pretty sad. I never 
saw such a total lack of intellectual honesty. These people 
should be ashamed of spreading such monstrous lies. To claim 
that the Armenian genocide was a direct consequence of gun 
control legislation that came into effect 40 years earlier is not 
only absurd but insane.
<P>
	I agree that these individuals are not representative of the 
majority of those who object to all forms of gun control. Reform 
Party members should check their ranks and flush out the 
extremists. Some spring cleaning would be in order.
<P>
	I come back to the bill before us today. In the fall we criticized 
it and, again today, we decry the minister's hesitation. Since the 
minister has been promising us legislation on arms control for 
such a long time, we were expecting something more complete, I 
can assure you.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice wanted to win everyone over by 
giving something to each of them. Reformers, the gun lobby, and 
a number of colleagues of the Minister of Justice are delighted 
with the increase in the minimum sentences for crimes 
committed with guns and the fact that current firearms owners 
have almost eight years' grace to comply with the requirements 
of the national registration system the government is proposing 
today.
<P>
	Let us have a closer look at who should be celebrating: the gun 
lobby or those in favour of stricter arms.
<P>
	First, the bill proposes major changes to the Criminal Code. In 
terms of sentences, the bill increases from one year to four years 
the minimum sentence an individual must serve for committing 
a crime with a firearm. The present section 85 of the Criminal 
Code provides for a minimum sentence of one year for anyone 
using a firearm to commit a criminal act.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9712"> 9712 </A></B>
<P>
	The problem with section 85 is that only a third of the charges 
made under this section result in convictions. Lawyers on a case 
will use this section most of the time for plea bargaining. The 
Crown is satisfied with the few convictions, because, in return, 
it obtains a guilty plea for the principal offence, such as robbery 
or sexual assault.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	The bill does not resolve this de facto situation. Minimum 
sentences are increased, but there is no mechanism to force 
lawyers to stop bargaining for guilty pleas. In addition, judges, 
generally, tend to follow a principle of combining the number of 
years a defendant has to serve. Nothing in the bill will change 
this practice.
<P>
	I would even bet that they will continue to do it and in this way 
reduce the length of the sentence for major offences. In real 
terms, there may be no significant increase in the actual number 
of years that the person will have to serve. However, if judges 
stop giving concurrent jail sentences, the increase in the jail 
population could become another problem area. I will come 
back to this later.
<P>
	Finally, section 85 is modified by the addition of a list of 10 
violent offences which will be covered by the provision. We 
wonder whether the government really was serious when it drew 
up this list. Manslaughter, an unpremeditated crime, is on the 
list. However, armed assault is not. Does that mean that the 
punishment will be the same, whether or not the victim survives 
the assault? Forcible confinement is not on the list, but 
kidnapping and hostage are.
<P>
	I also really have doubts about whether the increase in the 
minimum sentence provided for in section 85 will be a deterrent. 
I would like to point out that a working paper on section 85, in 
particular, and on minimum sentences, in general, prepared by 
the department of justice concluded that for the most part, the 
public does not know which offences have a mandatory 
minimum sentence.
<P>
	In addition, the same document, which the Minister of Justice 
should have analyzed more thoroughly, also concludes that 
mandatory minimum sentences are very weak deterrents and 
have little impact on the incidence of major crimes. Robbery is 
an excellent example. Even worse, apparently juries are less 
inclined to render a guilty verdict if they know that the accused 
will have to serve a mandatory sentence for the offence.
<P>
	Assuming that judges will not apply the principle of adding up 
the total number of years for multiple offences, prison 
populations will increase substantially as a result. Indeed, the 
minimum sentence of four years would be served after any other 
sentence imposed by the judge.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice seems to believe, naively, that 
detention centres could accommodate this increase in the 
number of prisoners. He claims that the deterrence effect of his 
bill would lower the number of firearms  offences. There is no 
way of knowing the impact of his reform bill on the number of 
future convictions.
<P>
	We must bear in mind that a chain is only as strong as its 
weakest link. If the minister wishes to increase minimum 
sentences stipulated under section 85 of the Criminal Code, he 
must realize that prison populations will increase thereby and 
that we do not have the necessary infrastructure to accommodate 
these new prisoners.
<P>
	Let us turn our attention to the warning issued by Professor 
Pierre Landreville of the UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al. In an article 
published in <I>Le Devoir</I> of December 23, Mr. Landreville 
explains the danger of such legislation, and I quote: ``Some 
1,500 persons are convicted each year in Quebec and could 
possibly be given a minimum sentence of four years in addition 
to the sentence for the major offence. The population of Quebec 
penitentiaries, currently about 4,000 prisoners, would nearly 
double in the first four years after implementation of this 
measure''.
<P>
	If prison populations increase, so too will the related costs.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	Will the minister honestly tell taxpayers how much his reform 
will cost us, knowing that, just to keep a prisoner in jail, it cost 
on average, in 1992-93, $56,000 in a maximum security facility 
and $36,000 in a medium security one? Can the pro-gun lobby 
still say it is satisfied with the increase in the minimum sentence 
stipulated in section 85?
<P>
	Moreover, for those of us in favour of gun control, can we 
claim this as a victory? Certainly not. The bill establishes a 
separate piece of legislation providing for a licensing system 
regarding the possession and use of firearms, and a national 
system for the registration of all firearms. Non-compliance with 
the provisions dealing with licensing and registration will be an 
offence under the Criminal Code. Going against the wishes of 
several of his Liberal colleagues, the justice minister decided to 
maintain sanctions in the bill.
<P>
	Moreover, Bill C-68 provides for new offences and hefty 
penalties for the illegal importing of firearms and gun 
trafficking. In addition to the compulsory minimum sentence, 
individuals convicted of one of the ten designated violent 
offences will be prohibited for life from possessing a restricted 
or prohibited weapon. Up to now, everything is fine and these 
provisions are the direct result of our representations.
<P>
	Also, under bill C-68, from now on, importing or selling .25 
and .32 calibre handguns and handguns that have a barrel 105 
mm in length or less will be prohibited. This ban affects roughly 
58 per cent of all handguns in Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9713"> 9713 </A></B>
<P>
	Concurrently with Bill C-68, the justice minister has banned 
several types of military and paramilitary weapons by an order 
in council taking effect on January 1st, 1995. A total of 21 types 
of military and paramilitary firearms will now be prohibited, 
and they include more than 200 models. However, as the 
Minister of Justice said, the cornerstone of his bill is the 
registration system, a computerized record of names and 
particulars of all gun owners, along with a description of all 
the firearms they own.
<P>
	On the eve of the new budget of the Liberal government, the 
proposals of the Minister of Justice raise a number of questions 
on the cost of implementing such a system at the national level. 
The minister was saying, on December 6, in Alberta, that it 
would cost at least $85 million to implement. He said that the 
cost would be spread over five years and that, afterwards, the 
system would generate revenues. The day before yesterday, 
during a press conference, he went back on his word and said 
that the cost would actually be spread over seven years. He 
demonstrated to the people that he has no idea of the possible 
cost of such a system and who should bear it.
<P>
	Unfortunately, we can no longer rely on the minister's 
estimates since, in two months, he added two years to the 
amortization period. In a few months, will come before the 
Standing Committee on Justice to tell us that the costs will never 
be recovered?
<P>
	We always asked for a self-financing system. How is the 
Minister of Justice going to finance his system? He said that gun 
owners would not have to pay a cent to get their new registration 
certificates. Current owners will simply have to pay renewal 
fees of $60 in five years.
<P>
	He also states that new certificate holders will only have to 
pay a small fee of around $10. How can the minister claim that 
system costs will be paid off over five or seven years? Why not 
10 years?
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	In the meantime, he is asking the provinces to loosen their 
purse strings to help him pay the bill. He is asking the provinces 
to help him administer a system whose costs are unknown. This 
means that not only gun buyers and owners but all taxpayers will 
pay.
<P>
	As I said earlier, to the costs associated with the system we 
must add those associated with a possible increase in prison 
population. The Minister of Justice can manipulate numbers as 
much as he likes, but the fact remains that the costs of his bill 
will be supported by the entire population.
<P>
	Another flagrant example of the lack of rigour in calculating 
costs is a January 19 memorandum from the office of the justice 
minister stating that the government hopes but cannot confirm 
that current gun owners will not have to pay fees to obtain 
certificates of ownership.
<P>
	The memorandum goes on to explain that fees will go up over 
time to encourage early registration and that the government is 
hoping that fees will not be charged during the first year.
<P>
	Terms like ``hoping'' and ``cannot confirm'' suggest that the 
minister does not know the first thing about arithmetic. He has 
no idea of how much ordinary taxpayers will have to pay. He 
does not have any idea of the costs associated with Bill C-68 and 
how much gun owners will have to pay. We are basically 
demanding that the Minister of Justice's mathematics be 
clarified.
<P>
	Finally, can we really talk about a victory, as suggested by the 
minister, when we know that all this great system will not 
become operational until the next century? I doubt it.
<P>
	On the subject of regulations, the justice minister has missed 
a golden opportunity to practice what he preaches. Regulations 
respecting the storage, display, handling and transportation of 
certain firearms is a legal jumble that his department would 
have trouble sorting out. These regulations have been in force 
since January 1, 1993, but a great many people are still not 
aware of their existence, let alone their requirements. Even the 
police, who are responsible for enforcing them, says they are 
unfamiliar with these regulations.
<P>
	When I questioned him in the House on November 15, the 
Minister of Justice answered, and I quote: ``I well understand 
that the challenge we face is to make Canadians understand and 
comply with safe storage requirements.''
<P>
	I reviewed his action plan and his bill inside out, but nowhere 
is any revision of these regulations to be found. Yet, the Minister 
of Justice claims universal registration of firearms is necessary 
to make owners more responsible vis-Ã -vis storage and 
transportation. How can gun owners be asked to be more 
responsible and comply with regulations that they do not know 
about or do not understand?
<P>
	The danger with inadequate regulations is that improperly 
stored firearms and ammunition are readily available to an 
individual who yields to a suicidal or violent impulsion. On the 
other hand, if firearms and ammunition are not readily 
available, chances are the person will calm down. Statistics on 
deaths caused by firearms are alarming. In 1991, suicides 
accounted for 77 per cent of the 1,445 deaths caused by firearms. 
In 1992, out of 732 registered homicides in Canada, 246, or 34 
per cent, were committed with a firearm.
<P>
	In the last ten years, most homicides were committed with 
shotguns or hunting rifles. Three times out of four, a spouse is 
killed by a rifle or a shotgun.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	In Quebec, from 1990 to 1992, there were 1,293 deaths caused 
by firearms, which represents an annual average of 425. In that 
same province, suicides account for three out of four deaths 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9714"> 9714 </A></B>
<P>
caused by firearms, for a total of about  300 suicides per year. 
These statistics cannot be overlooked.
<P>
	The inquest conducted in Montreal, last November, by 
coroner Anne-Marie David shed some light on the deficiencies, 
and the resulting dangers, related to inadequate regulations. 
Coroner David's report was released on January 26.
<P>
	Throughout the hearings, the most frequent criticisms were 
related to the inconsistency of the current regulations. 
Lieutenant Guy Asselin of the Quebec provincial police testified 
and said: ``The regulations are not necessarily clear, which does 
not help those who have to enforce them, nor those who want to 
comply with them''.
<P>
	The spokesperson for the Quebec police and fire chiefs' 
association, Mr. Richard CÃ´tÃ©, made essentially the same 
comment when he said: ``Police officers do not know how to 
interpret the law. You almost have to be a legal expert''. Mr. 
CÃ´tÃ© added that these regulations were included in the program 
of only two of the nine CEGEPs offering the police technology 
course, and that the related training lasted only a few hours.
<P>
	If police officers themselves cannot understand the 
regulations, how can the Minister of Justice claim that his bill 
will increase safety at home? Police officers are not the only 
ones who do not know the regulations. Those who are directly 
concerned, and I am referring to the owners of firearms, hardly 
know there is such a thing as regulations on the safe storage of 
firearms.
<P>
	A LÃ©ger &amp; LÃ©ger poll has confirmed these disturbing facts. 
The poll was conducted from September 1 to September 13, 
1994, among 515 owners of firearms residing in Quebec. When 
asked whether they knew about these regulations, only 53 per 
cent of respondents thought there was a law on storage, 31.8 per 
cent said no and 15.1 per cent were undecided. It is clear that, in 
addition to a national registration system, a thorough review and 
targeted advertising are necessary.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice forgets that sometimes simple 
solutions are the most effective. If the government made it 
compulsory for businesses to supply individual locking systems 
for every firearm sold in this country, the problem would be 
practically solved.
<P>
	The minister keeps repeating that registration of owners and 
firearms is just like getting a driver's licence or a licence for 
your car. If the minister had pursued his analogy, he would have 
realized that cars are sold with locking systems. I may have a 
driver's licence, but that does not mean I can start my 
neighbour's car without an ignition key.
<P>
	My point is that every firearm sold in this country would have 
a device that would make it totally harmless. The owner would 
then be under the obligation to keep the firearm locked at all 
times, failing which he would be breaking the law. In this way, 
gun collectors would be able to exhibit their pieces, and in 
season, hunters would be able to practise their favourite sport.
<P>
	I support the recommendations of coroner David, in which she 
urged the Minister of Justice to amend the wording of the 
regulations for storage, display and safe transportation of 
firearms, to make them more consistent and ensure they are 
more readily understood by the general public.
<P>
	Similarly, the Minister of Justice should pay particular 
attention to the recommendation that the regulations be changed 
to oblige people selling guns to lock or disarm all weapons 
intended for sale and to prevent them from storing restricted 
firearms anywhere but in a vault and prevent the delivery to a 
customer of a firearm not equipped with a safety catch.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	In conclusion, I believe that setting up a national registration 
system is a positive step, subject to my earlier comments. I 
must, however, say again that I find it most regrettable that the 
Minister of Justice bowed to pressure from the gun lobby. By 
spreading owner and weapon registration over eight years, the 
minister is stating very clearly that he does not want the system 
implemented during his term of office. Furthermore, I believe 
the minister backed off significantly from his original plan of 
action by permitting the purchase and sale of handguns between 
owners of the same type of weapons.
<P>
	Finally, it appears that the minister has not yet completed his 
consultations and that he is now leaving it up to the Standing 
Committee on Justice. He wants the committee to look at the 
following questions: Should we allow the owners of prohibited 
firearms to bequeath these weapons to their children? Are there 
handguns that may be used for target practice? Will the use of 
replicas of powder fired guns be allowed at celebrations?
<P>
	The minister should have assumed the consequences of his 
choices himself rather than force the parliamentary committee 
to make some of the unpleasant decisions.
<P>
	In closing, we hope the minister still has sufficient leeway to 
take our recommendations into consideration.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to begin this debate before I get into the text of my 
intervention by touching on a couple of comments the justice 
minister made.
<P>
	This is the most confusing time for the justice minister to 
bring new legislation on gun control into the picture. The reason 
is that we have court decisions, one in Alberta, clearly 
indicating the orders in council passed by Kim Campbell are 
invalid.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9715"> 9715 </A></B>
<P>
	Until such time as that decision is overturned, the orders in 
council passed by Kim Campbell and the orders in council 
passed by this minister, becoming effective January 1, are 
considered to be invalid and are not being enforced. I also 
understand that B.C. has taken the same position on these 
orders in council. A court of Queen's Bench decision renders 
those orders in council invalid.
<P>
	We have asked the justice minister in this House if he would 
not consider waiting until that particular case moves through the 
appeal courts and a final determination is made. The justice 
minister has refused to accept that advice and is now heaping 
orders in council upon orders in council that the courts in this 
land are saying are invalid.
<P>
	It also means that all the actions taken by the police and the 
court under the authority of the orders in council passed by Kim 
Campbell's government have been illegal. All of the seizures, 
confiscations and destruction of weapons without compensation 
are considered illegal.
<P>
	Unless the judge's decision is overturned they will remain in 
that state. We have asked the justice minister to please wait until 
such time as this confusion within the courts has been cleared 
up. He has failed to do so.
<P>
	I would like to touch on the point the justice minister raised 
about registration of rifles and shotguns where an individual 
will simply have to go to the appropriate place within his 
community, pick up a card and fill in the make, model and serial 
number.
<P>
	I was talking to a firearms inspector in Alberta. I suggested 
this was the method that would be introduced. He said it is utter 
nonsense. I asked why and he said you cannot register what you 
do not inspect, otherwise you are going to have a system that is 
absolutely unreliable. I asked: ``What do you mean?'' He said: 
``Unless you inspect the identifying features on a firearm and 
the firearm inspector records that within the system they cannot 
be sure of the accuracy of that information''.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	The justice minister knows as well that there are many 
firearms with the same serial number, the same identifying 
features. The suggestion by the justice minister that this is going 
to be easy and inexpensive is simply nonsense. It is just not 
accurate.
<P>
	I cannot support this gun control legislation because the 
centrepiece of it, the registration of all rifles and shotguns, will 
not reduce the criminal use of firearms.
<P>
	The justice minister has not told us how these measures will 
reduce the criminal use of rifles and shotguns. The police chiefs 
have not told us. The Coalition for Gun Control has not told us 
how the registration of rifles and shotguns will reduce their 
criminal use. No one who supports the registration of rifles and 
shotguns has told us, told the House or told anyone how it will 
reduce the criminal use of these firearms. They have not because 
they cannot.
<P>
	Handguns have been registered in the country and their use 
strictly controlled for 60 years. Yet we see an increase in the 
criminal use of handguns in Canada today. If handgun 
registration does not reduce the criminal use of these particular 
firearms, will the justice minister please tell Canadians how the 
registration of rifles and shotguns will have a different effect?
<P>
	Death from shotgun wounds occurs in four primary areas: in 
criminal activity, in domestic disputes, in suicides and in 
accidental use of firearms. The imposition of a firearms 
registration system will do nothing to reduce deaths in any of 
these areas. The gun control bill does not address or reduce the 
cause of domestic disputes or suicides. Certainly registration is 
not the answer.
<P>
	The justice minister has stated in the House, as he did today, 
that every six days a woman is shot to death in the country. This 
is a horrific statistic. Unless the causes of domestic dispute that 
produce these statistics are addressed nothing will change. The 
registration of firearms will not change this statistic and nothing 
within the minister's bill will address the cause of domestic 
disputes.
<P>
	Safe storage of firearms may reduce suicides and accidental 
shooting. However these regulations are already in force. I have 
heard no one to whom I have spoken who is opposed to those 
regulations. They are common sense and they support them.
<P>
	Over 80 per cent of the people in my riding of Crowfoot, 
Alberta, who responded to a survey indicated they did not 
believe the banning of handguns or the registration of rifles and 
shotguns would reduce the criminal use of firearms. The 
question that was asked directly was: ``Do you believe that the 
registration of rifles and shotguns will reduce the criminal use 
of these firearms?'' Over 80 per cent said no.
<P>
	The other question was: ``Do you believe an outright ban of 
handguns will reduce the criminal use of these firearms?'' Over 
80 per cent said no, but 94 per cent said that they were in favour 
of imposing harsher penalties upon the criminal users of 
firearms.
<P>
	I believe during the period of review and debate on Bill C-68 
as more Canadians become apprised of the details of the 
legislation and as people recognize the ineffectiveness of these 
gun controls in reducing crime and the enormous cost to the 
taxpayer, opposition will mount. I am reminded of the support 
for the Charlottetown accord when it first came out. Over 70 per 
cent of western Canadians were willing to support it but the 
more they learned about it, the more support for that accord 
plummeted like a stone.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9716"> 9716 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	Canadians have repeatedly urged the government to do 
something about crime, to strengthen the Young Offenders Act, 
to reform sentencing procedures and the parole system that 
continues the early release of violent offenders into society. 
These people have witnessed innocent victims being murdered, 
raped and viciously assaulted by offenders released into society 
by a system of justice that is preoccupied with the rights of the 
criminal, not the protection of the law-abiding citizen.
<P>
	I might add that the registration of rifles and shotguns is 
aimed at the law-abiding citizen. I will touch upon this point 
later in my speech. If they should deliberately neglect to register 
their shotgun or firearm they are subject to 10 years in jail, 
which is draconian, absolutely absurd.
<P>
	The sentencing provisions of the bill suggest the justice 
minister and the Liberal government are getting tough on crime. 
This is nothing more than a pretence. The bill contains 
provisions for a minimum of four years imprisonment for the 
criminal use of a firearm. However section 85 of the Criminal 
Code already allows for an additional sentence from one to 
fourteen years for the use of a firearm in the commission of a 
crime. This law has not been enforced rigorously at all in some 
areas of the country.
<P>
	Crown prosecutors have used their discretion either to ignore 
this law or to plea bargain it away. The justice minister admitted 
shortly after he submitted the proposals in the legislation that 
his new bill would not eliminate the discretion of the 
prosecutors to continue to ignore or plea bargain away the new 
four-year minimum sentence. There is no assurance of that.
<P>
	We look upon this portion of the bill as a step in the right 
direction. However it would not be needed if section 85 were 
enforced and it will be useless if the crown continues to plea 
bargain away the new four-year minimum sentence.
<P>
	In addition to the lack of enforcement of section 85, lenient 
sentences and early parole are contributing to a violent society. 
Who is responsible for this? I ask this question of the House: Are 
the parliamentarians who created the laws that now spew violent 
offenders on to the street before they have served their full 
sentences not responsible for the death of the Melanie 
Carpenters of the country? Are those same parliamentarians not 
responsible for creating a situation where the rights of the 
criminal supersede the rights of the victim and the victim's 
family? Are they not responsible for the growing fear of 
violence experienced throughout the country?
<P>
	I want the people of Canada to know that when the justice 
minister had the opportunity to vote for a safer society or the 
early release of murderers into society, he voted for the violent 
criminal instead of a safer society. The Minister of Justice voted 
against eliminating section 745 from the Criminal Code which 
grants first degree murderers the right to apply for early parole. 
The justice  minister in effect voted for the criminal and against 
eliminating violence and against the Melanie Carpenters of the 
country. So did the entire caucus, except for the Minister of 
Transport.
<P>
	The Minister of Transport stood with 24 of his Liberal 
colleagues and voted with the Reform Party to eliminate section 
745 which allows for the early release of convicted murderers 
into society. I might add that during that vote when I looked over 
at Bloc members I did not see one of them standing against the 
early release of violent criminals back into society.
<P>
	If the minister is sincere about fighting crime we recommend 
that he do the following: increase the maximum jail terms for all 
violent crimes including firearms crimes, implement a zero 
tolerance policy for criminal offences involving firearms, 
ensure that charges are laid in all firearm crimes and that plea 
bargains are not permitted, provide judges with sentencing 
options including no parole for all violent crime and provide for 
progressively more severe penalties for repeat violent offenders 
and firearms offenders.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	Until the Minister of Justice implements these get tough 
measures he is only pretending to get tough on crime. Until the 
minister can demonstrate to us that the sentencing provisions of 
the bill will deter criminals from using a firearm during the 
commission of a crime we cannot support the bill because that 
we understand is what the bill ought to be doing. It is not going 
to do that.
<P>
	Until the minister can assure Canadians unequivocally that 
the registration of rifles and shotguns and the banning of 58 per 
cent of the handguns currently sold in Canada will reduce the 
criminal use of firearms we will work to defeat this convoluted 
and expensive piece of legislation.
<P>
	Reform members, like many Canadians, support gun control 
legislation based upon common sense. We fully support any and 
all gun regulations that will enhance public safety by reducing 
the criminal use of firearms. We say that present firearms 
legislation is adequate.
<P>
	What the government ought to be doing is focusing its 
attention on the criminal use of firearms, giving Bill C-17 an 
honest chance and evaluating the impact it has upon these 
problems. It was recommended by the Auditor General in his 
1993 report that before the government moves forward with any 
further gun control legislation a careful and thorough analysis of 
Bill C-17 and its impact upon the whole issue should be made. 
This we submit has not been done and it should be done.
<P>
	The expensive and ineffective system of licensing and 
registration rifles and shotguns described within Bill C-68 
simply does not make sense. It will not reduce the criminal use 
of these 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9717"> 9717 </A></B>
<P>
firearms. It will not reduce domestic violence and it will not 
prevent suicide.
<P>
	The minister has not provided us with any statistical 
justification for the registration of rifles and shotguns. How can 
Canadians, in the absence of such information, be confident that 
universal registration will reduce the criminal use of firearms 
and thereby make society safer?
<P>
	The minister defends the bill by claiming that the chiefs of 
police support him and have requested the registration of all 
rifles and shotguns. We ask this question: Why does the minister 
not also embrace the chiefs' position on capital punishment and 
on the elimination of section 745 of the Criminal Code which 
grants murderers the opportunity for early parole?
<P>
	It is clear to me that he does not really believe that when we 
have a law enforcement problem we go to the chiefs of police. It 
seems the justice minister is only going to the chiefs of police 
when he needs them to support a particular bill.
<P>
	We cannot afford ineffective legislation particularly in the 
area of criminal justice. We must have sound and proven 
controls in place that ensure public safety.
<P>
	The minister states that the cost of the legislation will be only 
$85 million. However the cost of registering a single handgun is 
estimated today to be $82 and over $100 in Quebec. It is 
estimated that there are approximately six million rifles and 
shotguns to be registered in Canada.
<P>
	Taking the lowest of these two fees, the cost for registration 
alone comes to $492 million. If the minister is suggesting that 
the registration of a rifle or a shotgun will be substantially less 
than the present cost to register a handgun, has the government 
been wasting taxpayers' money on the handgun registration 
system? Does this imply that the registration of long guns will 
not be as rigorous and thorough and therefore less effective than 
the handgun registration system?
<P>
	I might add that the Terence Wade report clearly demonstrates 
that the expensive handgun registration system is defective and 
almost useless as a crime fighting tool. This is a report that we 
had to wring out of the justice department.
<P>
	Let us deal with the banning of handguns and the hand held 
crossbow.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	Where is the information and where are the statistics that the 
Minister of Justice used to justify such a draconian measure? 
That is what we ask for. Certainly anyone who responds to 
common sense will respond to those kinds of statistics that 
justify such measures. We have not seen them. We have not seen 
any of the statistics upon which much of this legislation is 
based.
<P>
	The minister's original proposals banned the handguns used 
by our World Cup competitors. When asked in the House of 
Commons to exempt the .32 calibre handgun which is used in 
those competitions he said he most certainly would not. 
However, Bill C-68 does provide an  exemption for these 
handguns and I compliment the minister for taking a second 
look at that issue.
<P>
	It is clear, though, the minister's consultative process was 
badly flawed in spite of his presence that he was taking expert 
and technical advice from all interested groups. In connection 
with that, in the back of one of the pamphlets which was put out 
with the proposals, was a list of all the organizations and groups 
which the Minister of Justice met with on firearms. They are 
listed by way of province. There are eight listed for Alberta.
<P>
	However, I have been advised that the Nosehills Gun Club and 
the Provost and District Fish and Game Association never met 
with the justice minister; yet that is what the document claims. 
Further inquiries indicated that they sent a letter to the justice 
minister expressing their concerns about the gun control 
proposals. They did it by way of someone else who was coming 
to Ottawa to meet with the justice minister. They had not 
received a reply to their letter, which was sent by courier, as of 
the date on which I spoke with them.
<P>
	I submit that the registration of rifles and shotguns does not 
and will not protect Canadians. If the registration of firearms did 
we would have no problem with handguns and the criminal use 
of handguns. Every firearms control aimed at law-abiding gun 
owners such as the banning of handguns and the registration of 
firearms is an assurance to criminals that their victims and their 
potential victims are becoming more and more defenceless and 
helpless.
<P>
	It has been proven by various sources that banning a product, 
including firearms, does not prevent criminals from getting 
these items from the black market. Repeatedly governments in 
this country have learned that prohibitive or restrictive 
measures lead to an underground market where people thrive on 
the challenge of obtaining something illegally and where 
ruthless entrepreneurs profit tremendously.
<P>
	This bill clearly indicates that those Canadians who so 
adamantly oppose registration and may defy the minister and his 
law will not go unpunished. Under Bill C-68 these people will 
be subjected to a maximum ten-year penalty, a penalty which is 
equivalent to those imposed on some murderers in this country. 
What comes to mind is Mr. Lortie who went into the Quebec 
legislature and murdered three people and wounded 13 others. 
Now he is out after serving 10 years. The justice minister wishes 
to equate anyone who deliberately neglects to register their 
shotgun or rifle with that kind of prison term. That is absurd. It is 
wrong. It is unconscionable. It ought to be deleted from the bill 
before it goes any further and I would ask the minister to do that.
<P>
	In addition, this bill creates one penalty for those who in 
ignorance of the law fail to register their firearms and another 
much more serious penalty for those who deliberately neglect to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9718"> 9718 </A></B>
<P>
register their rifle or shotgun. The Reform Party believes that 
existing controls on gun ownership are more than enough and 
that no further  controls of this type are necessary to ensure 
public safety. We also believe that no amount of gun control on 
firearm ownership can stop criminals from acquiring guns by 
illegal means.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	In conjunction with the regulations we recommend these 
following features: decriminalize minor violations respecting 
storage, display, handling and transportation of firearms; 
decriminalize those offences that are more of an administrative 
matter than any criminal attempt to violate a law; make all 
firearm regulations, including orders in council, subject to 
review and approval by Parliament, and let us have no more of 
these orders in council that are not viewed by the elected 
representatives of the people being passed into law; simplify the 
firearms acquisition certificate renewal process.
<P>
	I would like to end my speech today using the words not of 
members on this side of the House but those of members from 
across the way. On November 5, 1991 the Liberal member for 
Kenora-Rainy River said when the House was debating Bill 
C-17: ``What we are debating is just what it means to the 
law-abiding citizen, the individual who feels that this piece of 
legislation does absolutely nothing to the criminal element that 
we as members of Parliament are supposed to be dealing with. 
We are not supposed to be restricting severely law-abiding 
citizens who are not the problem at all. We have suggested to 
law-abiding citizens of this country that we cannot trust them to 
do the right thing''.
<P>
	On the same date the Liberal member for Willowdale said: 
``There has been almost no suggestion and certainly no evidence 
that it is legitimate gun owners and members of gun clubs who 
have created the problem of gun related deaths in Canada. It 
seems to me that this bill as it now reads is dealing not with the 
fundamental issue of controlling the criminal use of guns, it is 
penalizing people who have proven in the past that they are part 
of the solution and not part of the problem of gun related deaths 
in Canada. This bill is very deficient in that it is not fair. People 
have over the years acquired a number of guns. Many of these 
guns are going to be taken away from them by this bill without 
compensation''. It certainly applies to this bill.
<P>
	The member further stated: ``It is expropriation without 
compensation. You cannot do that in terms of people's homes 
and cars. Surely this is not fair. Let us not pretend that we are 
dealing with the root cause of gun related deaths in Canada and 
the harm that guns can cause Canadians. It does not address the 
real problems so that we as a Parliament will have to come back 
to deal with those issues not too many years from now''.
<P>
	I have news for the member for Willowdale. You are back, 
your party is back and, like the previous government, is still not 
dealing with the problem, certainly not the cause of the problem.
<P>
	Finally, we have the words of the member for 
Haldimand-Norfolk: ``I believe this is nothing but a bill to 
hoodwink the Canadian people into believing that the 
government is concerned about trying to do something about 
gun control when it clearly does not. This bill addresses none of 
these uses of a firearm except by placing more stringent 
conditions on the acquisition of an FAC. It fails to address the 
real problems in society. It gives Canadians a false sense of 
security that the government is actually doing something to stop 
crimes when it is not. This bill seems designed to disarm, 
overregulate and financially devastate the honest Canadian 
citizen. It will redefine Canadians as criminals and punish them 
severely for things like paperwork. I suggest that in this bill the 
government is encouraging an underground network of illegal 
guns''.
<P>
	These members were all speaking against Kim Campbell's 
Bill C-17 which did not restrict and confiscate law-abiding 
citizens' guns to the same extent as the current bill before us will 
or threatens to.
<P>
	I am glad that so many members on the other side of the House 
share the same common sense opinions expressed on this side. I 
sincerely hope that these members continue to express these 
views despite the pressure from within their caucus to do 
otherwise.
<P>
	I would like to tell this House and make a commitment to all 
Canadians that a Reform government will repeal any 
ineffective, costly legislation such as Bill C-68.

	At the last biennial convention of the Liberal Party in May 
1994 the women's commission of the Liberal Party presented a 
resolution asking for tighter gun control laws in Canada. I felt 
very privileged to be asked to second that motion which was 
adopted by unanimous vote of our party then. That same day the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9719"> 9719 </A></B>
<P>
Prime Minister in his address at the end of the convention made 
a very strong commitment to gun control legislation.
<P>
	I would like to quote his words: ``I would like to thank the 
women's commission in particular for having tabled an 
excellent resolution and strengthening firearms legislation. I 
believe that there is no place for firearms on our streets or 
playgrounds and I believe that the time has come to put even 
stricter measures in place to achieve this goal. I will be asking 
my Minister of Justice to examine your resolution very closely 
and to draft tough gun control legislation. I hope we have the 
support of all parties for this tough gun control. I know the Bloc 
Quebecois supports gun control and Preston Manning and the 
Reform Party are certainly talking a lot about crimes. I hope 
they will support these restrictions because tough talk is easy. 
What Canadians want and what we must provide is tough 
action''.
<P>
	At this point I would like to pay special tribute to the Minister 
of Justice. He has been patient in an exemplary fashion. He has 
heard. He has listened. He has crossed Canada to hear groups 
that were for gun control legislation and those violently opposed 
to gun control legislation.
<P>
	He has heard not only from police chiefs but from community 
groups, from sports and gun clubs and any number of citizens of 
Canada who felt one way or another about this legislation. 
Eventually the time comes when decisions have to be made.
<P>
	I thank him for his courage, his tenacity, his perseverance in 
bringing forward Bill C-68. What is more important is that he 
has told us time and time again that this is only part of a much 
broader picture, that crime prevention is not ensured by gun 
control legislation alone, that several measures must be taken 
together so that there is a reversal of attitudes in our society so 
that crime does not continue to be the menace it is today in our 
streets, in our villages and in our towns.
<P>
	The whole crime prevention package is far broader than gun 
control legislation. It includes sentencing reform. It includes 
corrections and parole reform. It includes, as we have done, 
amendments to the Young Offenders Act. It included a Canadian 
crime prevention council which was launched last year.
<P>
	More important, it includes broad social reform. In our red 
book we have tried to portray a holistic approach to society, to 
social reform, because unless we prevent the social causes that 
are the very root of crime in our society we will never eradicate 
crime no matter what legislation we put forward, no matter how 
tough the legislation, no matter how tough the jail sentences.
<P>
	We have to reverse attitudes, create a new type of society in 
which we eradicate the root causes of crime: poverty, lack of 
education, lack of opportunity. This is what we are doing to 
approach social questions in a holistic fashion so that there is 
not only the tough legislation on gun control and crime but also 
the addressing of the root causes that lead to crime.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	The intention of Bill C-68 is not to penalize or hinder 
legitimate gun owners. Not at all. In fact it recognizes the 
legitimate right of gun owners to use them for sport or for their 
livelihood. It recognizes the treaty rights for aboriginal people 
in Canada. At the same time it does recognize a profound reality. 
That reality is very simple. Guns are lethal weapons and they 
kill.
<P>
	In fact, some of the opponents of gun control have tried to 
portray this as an urban versus rural debate. I suggest it is not. In 
fact, statistics accumulated for the period between 1980 and 
1989 showed that in those 10 years there were 63 per cent more 
deaths by guns in towns with a population of under 5,000 than in 
towns with a population of over 500,000. Therefore it is not a big 
city versus small city problem. It is a problem of the safe 
handling of guns.
<P>
	Guns impact especially on the lives of women. In the case of 
violence against women 42 per cent of all acts of murder 
committed on women have been done with guns. Of those guns 
80 per cent of them are rifles used by their owners to batter and 
murder their wives.
<P>
	We have to do something about this. We have to attack the 
problem, certainly the long term problem, by looking at the root 
causes of the social evils of society. At the same time we have to 
take short term measures to ensure that crime does not pay and 
that guns will not kill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would like now to pay a special tribute to two young women I 
know well-especially one of them-, Heidi Rathjen and Wendy 
Cukier, two young women who quit lucrative jobs. Heidi 
Rathjen is an engineer. She is now working almost on a 
volunteer basis to achieve stronger legislation on gun control. 
Heidi Rathjen said recently in an interview: Had we had stricter 
legislation, Marc LÃ©pine and Valery Fabrikant might not have 
been able to do what they did. Were there even a slight chance 
that stronger legislation would have prevented Marc LÃ©pine and 
Valery Fabrikant and all the others who committed senseless, 
horrible crimes from doing so, then that legislation would have 
been worthwhile, a thousand, a hundred thousand times over.
<P>
	Michael Hogben was one of the four individuals killed by 
Valery Fabrikant. Michael was one of my friends. I worked very 
closely with him at Concordia University. We worked together 
on the Esther Goldenberg lectures, and it was on the eve of these 
lectures, which Michael was to organize, as he always had in the 
past, that he was killed. I remember being at the Hogben 
apartment with Esther Goldenberg after his funeral. I remember 
seeing Mrs. Hobgen there, whom I had not met before, and the 
two young Hobgen girls, and thinking that a scholarly person, a 
person with so much to give to society, not only erudite but a 
person of character, exceptionally high-minded, well-liked by 
everyone, his students and colleagues, was killed in the prime of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9720"> 9720 </A></B>
<P>
his life, senselessly,  by someone who had managed, under 
existing legislation, to obtain not one but two firearms.
<P>
	We must recognize that the legitimate use of firearms is 
acceptable, but when used maliciously, firearms can cause 
irreparable, irreversible damage.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	How can one measure the damage of a ruined life, the 
nightmare experienced by the surviving family, who relive the 
event every day and every night, because they can never forget? 
This is not death due to illness, it is violent death brought about 
by the use of a firearm. And that is a price no society can afford.
<P>
	I know the debate on firearms is heated. I know the whole 
question of registration is especially controversial.
<P>
[English] 
<P>
	Yesterday in question period and again today our friends from 
Reform were questioning the cost of $85 million. They saw that 
as being too much. One Reform member said yesterday that we 
should send that money to cancer research or not spend it.
<P>
	I wonder if the Reform members have calculated the cost to 
society of a simple trial, of putting people in jail, of police 
control for people who have used guns. The cost is far greater 
not only in terms of money, but certainly in terms of life lost.
<P>
	What is the value of a life? Is it $1 million, $2 million, $80 
million, $85 million? I wonder how much the lives of the 14 
young women killed at the polytechnique were worth. I wonder 
how much Michael Hogben's life was worth. They are not 
statistics. We do not measure their lives, their souls, their beings 
in monetary terms.
<P>
	It seems to me that society has not only the right but a duty to 
make sure we take every possible step we can as legislators to 
try to eradicate the ills caused by guns. If registration helps, 
even if it is not watertight, even if there are loopholes and even if 
we cannot prove statistically that it will work 100 per cent of the 
time, if it makes committing crime more difficult, then it would 
be worth it and would be money spent well.
<P>
	Registration will certainly improve the control of the flow of 
firearms across borders. It will help the police trace firearms 
used in crime. Moreover, it will place the responsibility on the 
individual himself or herself. When someone has to go through a 
registration process, be it for a car, a boat, or any possession, it 
ties a special responsibility to that person to care for that 
possession.
<P>
	Registration will be an immense deterrent. In fact, it is no 
accident that a great number of community organizations, police 
organizations and all anti-crime community organizations and 
institutions are heavily in favour of registration. That includes 
the great majority of people in the province of Alberta where 
most Reform members are from. British Columbians should be 
proud because it is the case in B.C. as well.
<P>
	If registration and gun control legislation were only to save 
one life, I suggest it is worth it. I know the Bloc members share 
our view on this and I thank them for it. On this side we hope, 
and are convinced, that if it saves many lives, then Bill C-68 
will be a major piece of legislation. Not only will it be because it 
is Liberal legislation, the work of this government and this 
Minister of Justice, but because it is a piece of legislation that 
society at large needs and wants.
<P>
	Today we are in the process of getting it. Once again, I pay 
tribute to, thank and am very grateful to the Minister of Justice 
for having brought this bill forward.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	I hope the great majority of us here will reflect the majority 
view of Canadians at large, and 95 per cent of those in Quebec, 
who believe that gun control legislation is not only needed but it 
was needed yesterday. It is a great piece of legislation. It is a 
forward piece of legislation and I will support it with great 
conviction.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I get the impression 
from the rhetoric over there, the violence of it and the great 
emotion I heard that this is exactly the type of approach to gun 
control that makes people in this country frightened. The 
reasoned arguments which were expressed by the justice 
minister, although I emphatically disagree with them, do not 
carry the same connotations as what came across the aisle from 
the hon. member for Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis.
<P>
	If one is to take seriously what he was saying, I am quite 
convinced that this is the type of thinking, this rabble rousing, 
this fanning the emotions of people which will ultimately lead to 
the confiscation of private arms in this country. That is why 
people are so concerned.
<P>
	The hon. member refuses to deal with real numbers. He says 
that he thinks registration will be a deterrent. Those were his 
words. We do not pass legislation of this magnitude simply 
because we think something.
<P>
	He quoted the chiefs of police, as did the Minister of Justice. I 
would remind both members that when gun control was being 
discussed in this House in 1976, the police chiefs presented a 
brief to the Standing Committee on Justice. In that brief they 
emphatically stated that registration would serve no useful 
purpose in the control of crime. Whether the organization had-

	<B>Mrs. Anna Terrana (Vancouver East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the budget is quickly approaching. Canadians are not prepared 
to pay more taxes. They are in fact letting all of us in 
government know that they are prepared to react very negatively 
should taxes be increased.
<P>
	However, Canadians are prepared to do with less services. 
They are asking us to cut services and programs and to ensure a 
fair taxation system so the middle class does not bear an undue 
burden of taxes.
<P>
	Being a Liberal is not easy in these times. While we know we 
must bring down the deficit, we also know that our party has 
shown compassion over the years and has taken care of 
individuals in need.
<P>
	We must and will continue to ensure that we are able to care 
for all Canadians, both now and in the future. I am committed to 
working toward these fundamental values. We recognize that 
difficult choices must be made if we are to ensure Canada's 
well-being and prosperity.
<P>
	We are listening to Canadians. We hear that a fair taxation 
system should be introduced, cuts to services should be 
implemented, that duplication should be avoided and most 
important, that those in need should not suffer through this 
exercise but rather be strengthened by it.

	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, even though the reason interest rates have gone up is 
that the Minister of Finance has not taken any deficit-fighting 
action for a year now, he is bragging that he will be able to reach 
the gigantic deficit goal of $39.7 billion.
<P>
	The minister's strategy is extremely obvious. To reach the 
enormous deficit goal of $39.7 billion, he plays with numbers at 
the expense of the unemployed. In fact, he is using the surplus in 
the unemployment insurance fund to reduce the government's 
deficit.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance not only is using this surplus to 
reduce this year's deficit, but now that 11 months have passed 
by, we can see that he also overestimated the 1993-94 deficit by 
close to $4 billion in his last budget. All that to make people 
believe that the situation is improving. In reality, the minister is 
playing all kinds of  games to mask his lack of action in the fight 
against the deficit.

shows this has improved 18 per cent of 20-year old Canadians 
not completing high school.

Okanagan-Simikameen-Merritt to remind my colleagues that 
Bill C-263, which I introduced in the House, will be debated 
today.
<P>
	Bill C-263 is an act to amend the Financial Administration 
Act and will bring five crown corporations under part X of the 
act. The five corporations are the Canada Council, the Canadian 
Film Development Corporation, the Canadian Wheat Board, the 
International Development Research Centre and the National 
Arts Centre Corporation.
<P>
	The bill intends to bring accountability to these five 
corporations through allowing the Auditor General to conduct 
special examinations, a value for money audit every five years, 
as the Auditor General's office does regularly with other 
departments in the public service.
<P>
	This matter concerns accountability. It works toward 
reducing waste, improving requirements for planning, 
improving strategy and cost systems. In short, the bill will 
ensure that five crown corporations are following good 
management practices.

says he wants to get rid of the Canadian National Railway.
<P>
	Since the present value of the Crow benefit obligation is 
somewhere between $7 billion and $9 billion, sums which the

partial payment of the Crow obligation?

obligation, it could be a start toward providing a means of 
connecting farm fields with sea ports in a way that satisfies both 
Canadian needs and international obligations under the GATT.
<P>
	Such a proposal leaves farm people with some control over 
export costs since it allows them real choices in striking a 
balance between viable railways and viable farms, something 
the minister has not considered so far.

	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Halifax, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on February 
4 the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> reported that some hunters savagely killed 
their hunting dogs by slashing their throats or shooting them at 
point blank range because the dogs were no longer useful at the 
end of the hunting season.
<P>
	Recently the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters 
responded to this article saying that the federation has 
advocated mandatory identification of hunting dogs for many 
years. The federation takes this position so that hunters would 
be discouraged from abandoning their responsibilities as dog 
owners and to ensure that lost dogs are returned to the owners.
<P>
	As we begin the debate on gun control in the House of 
Commons, I call on the hunters who oppose any firearm 
registration to help us create a safer Canada and not only support 
registration of dogs but the registration of guns because, like 
dog owners, gun owners sometimes abandon their 
responsibilities, resulting in the loss of life. It is our 
responsibility as lawmakers to discourage this.

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
February 6, the Minister of Finance boasted that more than 
438,000 jobs had been created in Canada and that this was the 
best performance in a decade. Unfortunately for Canadians and 
Quebecers, Statistics Canada's annual figures are nowhere near 
this level. In fact, 261,000 jobs were created in 1994.
<P>
	If we compare these figures with those recorded at the end of 
the early 1980s recession, last year's 261,000 jobs should be 
compared with an average of 347,000 jobs created annually 
between 1985 and 1988. The minister has nothing to brag about.	
<P>
	Especially since, with the increase in population, 825,000 
jobs would have to be created to return to prerecession 
employment levels.

	It is a disturbing fact that nearly three million Canadians are

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="FEDERALISM">FEDERALISM</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister. In a prereferendum speech to 
the Metropolitan Quebec Chamber of Commerce, the Minister 
of Foreign Affairs said, and I quote: ``-no one in Canada is 
going to discuss the status quo. There will be no more status quo. 
There will be major changes-''.
<P>
	Does this statement by the Minister of Foreign Affairs mean 
that the Prime Minister has changed his mind and that his 
government will now support major changes in the way 
federalism operates, this after doggedly defending the status 
quo?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean ChrÃ©tien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Human Resources Development is 
introducing major changes in the way unemployment insurance 
and social programs operate. Who is opposed to these changes? 
Who wants to keep the status quo?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> The Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	<B>Mr. ChrÃ©tien (Saint-Maurice):</B> The Bloc Quebecois, 
exactly.
<P>
	When the Minister of Finance suggests ways to improve our 
society, who wants to keep the status quo? Always the Bloc 
Quebecois.
<P>
	Our federalism is flexible. We will make some adjustments, 
but we do not have to change the constitution to make those 
adjustments. We must be practical and tackle one problem at a 
time, in the best interests of all Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
seriously. The Prime Minister should take this seriously.
<P>
	If it is so easy to transform Canada by signing administrative 
agreements and if the Prime Minister is sincere about this, could 
he explain why, fifteen months after his party came to power, he 
has yet to recognize the unanimous demands for full jurisdiction 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9725"> 9725 </A></B>
<P>
over manpower training from all stakeholders in Quebec? All 
stakeholders in Quebec are asking him to withdraw from this 
area of jurisdiction. If it is so easy and if he is so serious about it, 
why has nothing been done? Why?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean ChrÃ©tien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have made several offers to the Government of 
Quebec. We have offered to simplify the system, as the Minister 
of Intergovernmental Affairs said. We could not offer 
everything they wanted, but we offered half a loaf.
<P>
	Since these people want to maintain the status quo, they will 
not consider accepting anything else. Right now we are signing 
harmonization agreements with Canada's nine other provinces, 
except the Government of Quebec that wants to keep the status 
quo. We are not maintaining the status quo. They are.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, may I 
remind the Prime Minister that the Quebec Premier who turned 
down the agreement with the Liberal government was the former 
Liberal Premier of Quebec, the Prime Minister's partner on the 
no committee for the Quebec referendum?
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister admit that this manoeuvring by his 
Minister of Foreign Affairs was an attempted rerun of the 
referendum speech by Pierre Elliott Trudeau in 1980?
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean ChrÃ©tien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Quebecers must have liked Mr. Trudeau's speech, 
because they voted 60 per cent in favour of staying in Canada, 
and this year, Quebecers will again listen to the people in 
Quebec who want to stay in Canada. Apparently, on the evening 
news tonight, we will be told that it is even better than last time. 
Two or three months away from the referendum, they are at least 
15 points behind where they were in February 1980.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, what has stuck in the mind of Quebecers about Pierre 
Elliot Trudeau's 1980 speech is that promises were not kept.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> And unilateral patriation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> In his speech, the Minister of Foreign Affairs 
announced that, from now on, the federal government would 
concentrate on areas of federal jurisdiction, recognizing 
implicitly that duplication and overlap had become common 
practice in Ottawa, when he said: ``We will review this matter 
and focus on areas of federal jurisdiction.''
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Now that his Minister 
of Foreign Affairs has announced that the federal government 
will no longer encroach on areas of provincial responsibility, 
will the Prime Minister indicate from which areas Ottawa plans 
to withdraw?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean ChrÃ©tien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have offered on several occasions to withdraw from 
forestry agreements for example, but Bloc members would rise 
in this House and ask that we go on providing funds for Quebec 
forests. Questions were put to us on this subject.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. ChrÃ©tien (Saint-Maurice):</B> It is always the same thing. 
They want us to withdraw, but at the same time they want us to 
continue paying. If we withdraw, we withdraw. The problem is 
they want to have their cake and eat it too. They want us to 
collect taxes for Quebec to spend as it pleases. Well, from now 
on, we will spend our own money and they can spend theirs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if the Prime Minister wants his remarks to be taken 
seriously, could he clearly identify the areas from which he 
intends to withdraw, as well as the federal departments and 
agencies that will be abolished to eliminate the costly 
duplication referred to by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, who 
is incidentally the minister responsible for Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean ChrÃ©tien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are working day in and day out with the other 
provinces to try and eliminate duplication. In many areas, there 
is no duplication. Take income tax for example. In every other 
province, there is only one level of government collecting.
<P>
	Duplication comes from Quebec deciding to have its own 
ministry of revenue collect personal income tax, unlike the other 
provinces. You know, it does not cost Ontario anything to collect 
its provincial income tax, because a line was added to our tax 
form for that purpose, while in Quebec a separate report has to 
be filed. Hundreds of millions are spent unnecessarily because 
of this. Duplication often comes from the other side.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, just a few hours ago Moody's bond rating service 
announced it will review Canada's foreign debt rating and also 
Canada's AAA domestic rating. Moody's is not only sending the 
government a wake-up call, it is ringing the alarm bell.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Finance finally acknowledge that the 
markets are rejecting his deficit reduction targets as inadequate 
and that Canada's debt and deficit situation is much more 
serious than he or the Prime Minister has led us to believe?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Moody's certainly 
could have waited until the government brought down its 
budget.

<B><A NAME="9726"> 9726 </A></B>
<P>
When the government brings down that  budget the financial 
markets will see very clearly this government has kept faith with 
what it said in its pre-election campaign and in the last budget.
<P>
	We have repeatedly said that we will fulfil our obligations, we 
will live up to our commitments, we will hit our targets. In terms 
of this year's deficit, I am here to tell you we have done a hell of 
a lot better.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister and the members opposite just do not get 
it. When one of the world's largest bond rating agencies will not 
wait two weeks to get the minister's budget, it is telling him that 
his targets are not only unbelievable, they are unacceptable to 
the money markets. That is the message they are trying to send 
to the minister.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	Will the minister simply accept the fact that his deficit 
reduction targets are inadequate and commit to eliminating the 
deficit within the life of this Parliament, which is what the 
money markets are asking?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last year in the 
months that followed the budget the leader of the third party 
kept standing up and saying that we would never hit our targets, 
that they were too tough, that we would never get there, that the 
sky was about to fall, that Chicken Little had a lot of trouble.
<P>
	Why at least does the leader of the Reform Party not have the 
decency to stand up today and congratulate the government for 
having done what he said we never could do?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, to congratulate the minister on hitting that target would 
be like congratulating a high jumper for getting over the bar 
when it is at three feet.
<P>
	We are wondering whether the minister and the government 
ever learn anything from the experiences of others. The 
government and this minister are going down exactly the same 
fiscal path as the NDP Government of Ontario. First it denies the 
situation is serious, then a half-hearted attempt at tax increases 
to deal with it, then in the final analysis come to cut spending 
after it is too late.
<P>
	Is it really the minister's ambition to become known as the 
Bob Rae of federal politics?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last October the 
government provided a very accurate analysis of this country's 
financial situation. It was an analysis praised by the financial 
markets. It was an analysis praised by the great majority of 
economists. It was an analysis praised by those of the Reform 
Party who understand economics, who basically said it was an 
accurate analysis. Is he about to now deny that which his 
colleagues said?
<P>
	Let me tell the House something. I know it is hard for this 
member to accept some good news. This country is leading the 
G-7 in growth, leading the G-7 in employment, leading the G-7 
in controlling inflation.
<P>
	For the love of heaven let me say today, manufacturing 
shipments in this country were up 1.6 per cent in December and

	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The government's pre-budget public relations exercise, 
including the speech made by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, is 
an attempt to convince Quebecers that the government is about 
to decentralize the federal regime.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister agree that true decentralization 
requires a transfer of tax resources, including tax points, so that 
the provinces can take over from the federal government?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean ChrÃ©tien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to be in a position where someone else 
would collect taxes on my behalf, so that I would not have to do 
it myself. Tax collection is a part of political responsibility. If 
they want us to decentralize, fine. However, they were happy to 
let us collect taxes, and take the blame for it, and then get the 
money from us. In the context of responsible government, it 
would be better if everyone collected his own taxes. The 
situation would be clearer for everyone.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, that is precisely what we are asking, namely that the 
federal government withdraw from these tax fields. We will do 
the job ourselves.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister agree that this renewed Canada, 
which he is predicting, is nothing more than an attempt to hide 
the fact that the federal government continues to dump the costs 
of social programs on the provinces?
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean ChrÃ©tien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I can see that the Bloc members are in disarray because 
they realize that our flexible federalism approach is working 
very well. If they knew a bit about history, they would know 
that, a few years ago, the federal government collected over 60 
per cent of the taxes in this country, while incurring close to 60 
per cent of the expenditures.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9727"> 9727 </A></B>
<P>
	Now, the figures are reversed. Indeed, the provinces, which 
used to collect 40 per cent of all taxes, now spend and collect 
60 per cent of the money. The federal government is currently 
collecting 40 per cent, a proportion which is diminishing. Thus, 
the situation changed considerably over the last ten years, even 
without any constitutional amendment.

	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the age old problem of patronage under the former Tory 
government is well known. Now it is coming back to haunt the 
new masters of patronage, the Liberal government.
<P>
	Most recently Canada Ports Corporation chairman Arnold 
Masters has reportedly abused his expense account, billed an 
unreasonable amount of work and doctored the minutes of the 
corporation's board of directors.
<P>
	Now it has been revealed that nearly 50 top executives of 
shipping companies from Vancouver to Halifax have written to 
the Minister of Transport calling for Masters' immediate 
resignation.
<P>
	When will the Minister of Transport take action on these 
abuses, take the advice of the Canadian shipping industry and 
demand the resignation of Arnold Masters?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there is no doubt that this is a serious matter.
<P>
	Because we try to pay attention to the advice that is given by 
members of the third party in the House, in situations such as 
this one where serious allegations have been made and there is a 
call for drastic action we want to take some time to make sure we 
do the right thing.
<P>
	The hon. member would know, as many of his colleagues have 
said on another matter that has been the subject of a great deal of 
discussion in the House, a person does not want to act rashly in 
these matters.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister has already claimed to be waiting on a 
report from the transport committee's study of marine policy 
before he takes any action.
<P>
	The purpose of that study is to consult with users to determine 
how they want their port system changed to make it more viable. 
Those users have spoken and they have spoken loudly against 
Arnold Masters.
<P>
	With this kind of unified opposition, when is the Minister of 
Transport going to act?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as the hon. member indicated, the appointment of the 
gentleman in question was made by the previous government. 
He has been in office for several years and had acted as a director 
prior to that. We understand the importance of making sure that 
the operations of Canada Ports are done efficiently.
<P>
	There have been questions raised by the hon. member and 
others at hearings of the Standing Committee on Transport. We 
are going to review the matter very seriously, but I want to 
emphasize that the Standing Committee on Transport, mandated 
by the House to look into the whole area of the operation of 
Canada Ports, is meeting across the country right now and will 
have an opportunity to hear from these people who signed their 
names to a letter. They can make their allegations directly 
before the committee.

question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Pointing to the massiveness of the system, the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs said that Ottawa would work to eliminate 
overlap and duplication. It would therefore be devoting its 
efforts to areas under its jurisdiction. Under the constitution, 
health is a provincial matter.
<P>
	To demonstrate his good faith, does the Prime Minister 
intend, as logic would dictate, to abolish the national forum on 
health that he chairs?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean ChrÃ©tien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, health is a complex issue, and we have a responsibility 
in this area. We set up a national health service in Canada, which 
all Canadians and a large majority of Quebecers continue to 
support. It guarantees free health services to all Canadians and 
ensures that there will not be two categories of hospitals in 
Canada and Quebec-one for the rich, and one for the poor.
<P>
	We wanted to ensure dignity, in Canada, for all who are sick. 
This is why the federal government stepped in. Canada's health 
system has set an example for the world, and the Americans 
would like to have it right now.

<B>(1435) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, are we 
to understand from the Prime Minister that his ``new'' Canada in 
health matters simply means that Ottawa will force the 
provinces to meet ever more stringent national standards while 
cutting transfer payments to them and leaving them with the 
financial burden?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean ChrÃ©tien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr.

saying earlier, we have succeeded in signing agreements with all 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9728"> 9728 </A></B>

the provinces to eliminate duplication. The only government 
that does not want to sign an agreement with us in an attempt to 
identify areas of duplication which could be eliminated is the 
government of Quebec, because it wants to use the status quo for

very same workforce adjustment directive the minister is

<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board

different programs and services are curtailed or completely 
removed from what we provide to Canadians. That is part of 
getting our deficit reduction targets met.
<P>
	In the course of doing that it will be necessary to downsize the

in his speech to the Chambre of Commerce of Metropolitan 
Quebec, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and minister 
responsible for Quebec stated that the government must 
concentrate less on regional development and focus instead on 
helping small business.
<P>
	Can the Minister of Finance, minister responsible for regional 
development in Quebec, confirm his government's intention to 
withdraw from regional development and focus exclusively on 
helping small business?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is quite obvious 
that the best way to go about regional development is to help 
small business. That is truly where most new jobs are created. I 
am not the only one to say so, so do local authorities in Quebec, 
as well as the provincial government, the parent company.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> I have a 
supplementary question, Mr. Speaker. If it is clear, given that 
Quebec has adopted a general strategy for regional 
development, including assistance to businesses, would the 
minister not agree that, in the interest of avoiding all duplication 
and overlap, as the Prime Minister has said, he must recognize 
Quebec as the sole authority in terms of regional development, 
including assistance to businesses?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, not only do I 
disagree with the hon. member's hypothesis, but I say that, 
having discussed the matter with the current Government of 
Quebec, the current government does not agree with the hon. 
member's hypothesis.

	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on September 24 of last year in my constituency, 
Catherine Evenson, a beautiful young lady who was confined to 
a wheelchair, was raped in her home. The man facing rape 
charges is a refugee and is now trying to cement his stay in 
Canada by applying for permanent resident status.
<P>
	Will the minister of immigration intervene in this case and 
ensure that no permanent status in Canada is considered until the 
case is heard and the verdict is handed down?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
</B><B>Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have no specific details of 
the case. I appreciate the hon. member raising it. I will give her 
my word that certainly I will have officials look into the case.
<P>
	It is also a good reason, rather than simply dealing with 
individual cases, to have had Bill C-44 approved at third 
reading. It attempts to make the system better so that we 
minimize any such horrible cases we hear about.
<P>
	I was somewhat distraught that the Reform Party, which 
relishes bringing case after case to the floor of the House of 
Commons, did not see fit to support Bill C-44.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I assure the minister that I have been in constant 
contact with his office on the matter as well as with the Solicitor 
General's office. I also stress that I am assured Bill C-44 will do 
nothing to help this case at all.
<P>
	I thank the minister for his response. I assure him that today 
this young woman and her family are listening to and watching 
these proceedings. Would the minister please notify me as soon 
as a decision is made?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I said in my first answer, I 
would be happy to look into the file. I can appreciate that the 
hon. member has been in touch with officials of my department, 
but as any member can appreciate no minister can be on top of 
the thousands of cases across the country.
<P>
	The hon. member, with all due respect, is absolutely wrong if 
she and her colleagues believe that Bill C-44 will not improve 
the system's capacity to keep those individuals from getting 
protection and allowing those legitimate cases to be accepted in 
our system. I ask her and her colleagues to change their minds 
about Bill C-44 because it would help Canadians and the 
system.

	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the President of the Treasury Board. The Official 
Languages Commissioner published a study this morning on 
services in the minority official language offered to the public in 
designated federal offices. Among other things, the study found 
that in Quebec, service in English is available 98.8 per cent of 
the time, while in the rest of Canada, 28 per cent of all 
designated offices still do not provide service in French.
<P>
	How can the President of the Treasury Board justify that, 
more than two years after a regulation was passed on the issue, 
over one in four francophones outside of Quebec are unable to 
obtain federal services in their language?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, even while the official languages commissioner was 
undertaking his survey the Treasury Board was consulting with 
managers in offices across the country to help ensure that they 
were carrying out their obligations under the Official Languages 
Act.
<P>
	Furthermore, we have assembled information that we have 
provided to Canadians through minority language newspapers 
across the country so that they know where to find the offices 
and who to contact to be able to get services in the language of 
their choice.
<P>
<B>(1445) </B>
<P>
	Finally, let me say that this government is solidly committed 
to quality services in the official language of choice by 
Canadians and in meeting its obligations under the Official 
Languages Act.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, given 
the alarming increase in the assimilation rate of francophone 
and Acadian communities in Canada, how can the minister 
justify the slow pace with which the government has made its

	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board

	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley,

or would not answer how a national gun registry program would 
reduce crime. If the minister could show this evidence to 
support registration, most Canadians would probably support it.
<P>
	Will the minister provide this House with evidence that shows 
how a national gun registry will save lives and reduce the 
criminal use of firearms in our communities?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if anyone has questions 
to answer about their position on gun registration surely it is the 
Reform Party of Canada. The very party that styles itself as the 
party of law and order opposes a measure that the police want in 
this country. The very party that styles itself as the party of the 
people is against a measure that poll after poll shows is 
supported by the vast majority of Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, for Canadians who are concerned about the 
cost of firearms registration and for Canadians who are 
concerned about crime on the streets using firearms, would the 
minister give them the statistics that confirm a national firearms 
registration program will save lives and will reduce the criminal 
use of firearms?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, time and again the 
police chiefs of this country tell us that a registry system will 
help us stop the traffic in illegal arms at the border. It will help 
us ensure that the number of firearms lost and stolen every year 
and end up in the hands of criminals is reduced. Time and again 
they tell us they need registration to enforce court orders that 
prohibit people convicted of crimes of violence from possessing 
firearms. I will take the word of the chiefs of police on that 
question.

my question is for the Minister responsible for Public Service 
Renewal.
<P>
	The minister announced today that hundreds of governor in 
council and ministerial appointments will be eliminated as a 
result of the agency review. I agree that this overhaul of boards 
and commissions is long overdue, but is it all just window 
dressing or will this initiative bring real savings for Canadian 
taxpayers and help put an end to political patronage?
<P>
	<B>Mr. John English (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I must thank 
the hon. member for his question. It allows me to comment on 
the agency review report which was released today. The report 
looked at 400 commissions, boards and agencies and 120 were 
affected, 73 were wound up, 47 were restructured and no less 
than 665 governor in council positions were abolished.
<P>
	To give members an idea of the scope of this review, since this 
government was elected, it has appointed approximately 700 
persons to governor in council positions, 100 of which were 
reappointments. In short, the government has abolished more 
governor in council positions than it has appointed new persons 
to such positions.

question is for the Minister of Transport. Forty maritime 
organizations and businesses have asked the Minister of 
Transport to dismiss the chairman of Ports Canada's board of 
directors, Arnold Masters, from his duties. Just a few minutes 
ago, the minister said that he had to wait for a report from the 
transport committee before he could take action.
<P>
	How can the minister wait for the report from the transport 
committee before taking action in this matter, since the 
committee has no mandate to review Mr. Masters' case?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, what a revelation: the hon. member will now wait for a 
mandate before raising such issues. When I appeared before the 
transport committee, the hon. member, instead of dealing with 
the problems affecting the transportation system across the 
country and proposing solutions, went on and on about Mr. 
Masters. With or without a mandate, the hon. member always 
knows where to dig.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-OrlÃ©ans, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
since Mr. Masters is completely discredited in the eyes of the 
Canadian maritime industry, why does the minister not suspend 
him immediately now that the allegations are out in the open?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I indeed received a letter signed by several 
stakeholders in the industry asking me to replace the gentleman 
in question. However, as far as I know, the allegations are based 
on 
<P>

<P>
comments which so far are not supported by any evidence of 
criminal or fraudulent activities.
<P>
	I wish to emphasize that we are, of course, reviewing the 
situation because it is important. Unless the hon. member has 
specific evidence to submit to us which would point to 
unacceptable behaviour on the part of Mr. Masters involving

	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	The minister is well aware that virtually all of the OECD 
countries now have an inheritance tax for people who inherit, 
say, sums of money over $1 million. This would generate 
hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue at a time when 
revenue is much in need.
<P>
	Can the minister tell us, is there some reason Canada does not 
have an inheritance tax like virtually every other OECD 
country?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will answer the 
question as asked concerning the reasons for not having one. I 
interpret this question to be not related to the budget, but simply 
seeking information.
<P>
	The reason is that we in Canada, unlike other countries, have 
deemed capital gains disposition on death, which roughly 
equates to an inheritance tax. Another reason is that we have 
much higher property taxes than do many other countries. It is 
felt that does the case. Also, the principal interest most 
Canadians have is their main residence, which as the hon. 
member knows, is not subject to capital gains tax and would not 
be subject to any kind of a wealth tax.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, that is why 
I suggested a ceiling of $1 million would be a useful guideline. It 
would get around the matter of one's principal residence.
<P>
	The minister has said that not many poor people use tax 
loopholes. I suggest that not many poor families use family 
trusts. Can the minister explain to the House of Commons and 
the people of Canada why a country like Canada would continue 
to have in its tax system a provision that caters virtually 
exclusively to the wealthiest families in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the hon. 
member knows, family trusts are also used by many small 
businesses in order to make sure the business can pass from one 
generation to the other. Where objections have been raised to 
family trusts is where it really does entail undue tax advantage 
for those who are using it. This was a position that many on this 
side of the House took when in opposition and it is a position 
that is certainly supportable in debate.

Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of privilege and I appreciate the 
opportunity to be recognized today.
<P>
	I take the point of privilege very seriously. After six years and 
some months in this Chamber I have never risen on a point of 
privilege, recognizing that to do so would mean that my rights as 
a member of Parliament were abused or the ability to do my job 
was somehow impeded by rules of this House or by actions that 
may have taken place elsewhere.
<P>
	I rise today on a point of privilege to express my concern that 
my ability to do my job as a member of Parliament has been 
impeded by rules and regulations that exist in this place.
<P>
	A bill before the House at the present time, Bill C-68, the 
firearms legislation, is a bill that in my constituency and 
elsewhere across Canada is of great interest. The bill has elicited 
a tremendous amount of letters and telephone calls over the last 
few months. The proposals that were brought forward by the 
government have been out in front of Canadians for several 
months.
<P>
	As a result of those proposals being put forward to Canadians 
I have had a great many telephone calls and letters from my 
constituents asking to be kept informed of the progress of this 
bill and when the bill was printed and available in the House to 
supply those constituents with copies of that bill.

us to provide me with their comments and backgrounds so that I 
can properly represent them and to communicate an intelligent 
review of the bill to the minister and the government.

available to me. Only after all members are done getting their 
limited supply will I be able to have access to the few copies that 
would be left over.
<P>
	Finally I took the bill along with a letter and some newspaper 
clippings to printing this morning to ask if it could produce 
some copies so that I could keep my constituents informed as 
they requested about the contents of this important bill.
<P>
	I am told by printing that it cannot do it because the rules of 
the House of Commons specify that if the bill is available 
elsewhere, it cannot print it.

	A number of my own colleagues have approached me in my 
position as whip on the same issue. Perhaps more appropriately 
it would be a matter for the Board of Internal Economy to 
consider. If either that member or another member can make a 
formal request that we do that you, Mr. Speaker, and I and others 
who sit on that board could look at this issue and how to 
accommodate it.
<P>
	For this to be a question of privilege, I suppose a member 
would have to be denied access to the information which of 
course he is not. There is a fee, quite a hefty one, for obtaining 
copies of the bill. I am informed that it is in the area of $10 a 
copy.
<P>
	It is more appropriately a matter to be discussed by our board 
as an expenditure of the House. Perhaps in so doing we could see 
what we could do to accommodate at least some of the members 
or accommodate all members with a quantity of some sort to 
satisfy the demand that is expressed by this member and others 
who have brought it to my attention as well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the words of my hon. friend but recognizing that, it 
might be some time before the Board of Internal Economy 
would have an opportunity to address this. The matter is rather 
urgent. The legislation is before the House now.

<P>
	Our constituents want to find out immediately what this bill 
involves. Perhaps, Mr. Speaker, you can assure members that 
this is not some item that might be put off indefinitely or for 
a few days even.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> To the extent that I can give that assurance to 
all hon. members, I will surely give it. This would be a point that 
would be put on the agenda. I do not know whether I can talk to 
the Board of Internal Economy. I will defer to that and go back to 
the hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell for an 
answer to that question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I guess I am really responding as 
the spokesperson for the Board of Internal Economy. I can 
assure my hon. colleague that he has my undertaking to bring it 
to the attention of the board as early as the meeting on Tuesday.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> With agreement from hon. members we will 
proceed this way. If there is not agreement at the end of it all I 
will take this up again and I will get back to the House.

	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, during question period the hon. member for Kootenay 
West-Revelstoke rose and put a question.
<P>
<B>(1510 ) </B>
<P>
	I am informed, although I did not see it as I could not see it 
from my seat, that on the television cameras it was quite obvious 
that he was holding a prop. The prop was in the nature of a sign 
posted on the back of the document or portfolio that he was 
holding. The document was clearly visible on television and 
contained a slogan that related to recent meetings on taxes in 
Canada.
<P>
	The person who told me this saw it on television in the lobby. I 
was not in the lobby, I was in the House and could not see it from 
where I was sitting.
<P>
	I refer to Beauchesne's sixth edition, citation 501:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Speakers have consistently ruled that it is improper to produce exhibits of 
any sort in the Chamber. Thus during the flag debate of 1964, the display of 
competing designs was prohibited. At other times boxes of cereal, detergent and 
milk powder have been ruled out of order.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Citation 502 states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When a member produced samples of grain in the House, the Speaker 
deprecated the practice, saying, `If we allowed hon. members to produce such 
exhibits, we would get ourselves involved in a position where perhaps all too 
often hon. members would want to table dead fish, herrings, or red herrings, 
damp grain or wild oats'.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This quotation from previous Speakers indicates the grave 
nature of this offence against the rules of the House and I ask the 
Chair to apply the proper discipline to the hon. member for 
Kootenay West-Revelstoke.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Perhaps there is a simple explanation. The hon. 
member is here now and perhaps he can explain it in a few 
words.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is my understanding that a prop is something that 
relates to the subject at hand. I held up my speech and I used a 
piece of stiff cardboard in order to keep the pages from falling 
over, as they will.
<P>
	I will not display it now and further incur the wrath of the hon. 
member, but as it happens there was a label on the back, which 
we have on briefcases and everything else, which said ``No more 
taxes. No more debt''.
<P>
	I can understand the hon. member's sensitivity to that. It was 
not my intention-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am glad we do not have the lash in our arsenal.
<P>
	I would encourage all hon. members not to use props. The 
hon. member has explained that it was done inadvertently. I 
accept the hon. member's word.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="COMMENTSINQUESTIONPERIOD-SPEAKER'SRULING">COMMENTS IN QUESTION PERIOD-SPEAKER'S RULING</A></H4>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am now ready to rule on a question of 
privilege by the hon. member for 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, which he raised first on 
November 2, 1994 and then again on February 8, 1995.
<P>
	On November 2 the member rose to complain that during 
question period the previous day the Deputy Prime Minister had 
breached confidentiality by quoting from a letter which the 
member had written on behalf of a constituent to the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage. He contended that by revealing the contents 
of this letter without his permission the Deputy Prime Minister 
had interfered with his ability to carry out his duties. He argued 
that his constituents would now wonder whether or not matters 
on which they sought his assistance could be kept confidential.
<P>
	The Deputy Prime Minister responded that the letter was part 
of the public record of the Canadian Radio-Television and 
Telecommunications Commission.
<P>
	On February 8, 1995 the hon. member again rose on a question 
of privilege to state that new information had come to light on 
the same matter. He explained that the constituent on whose 
behalf he had written had received a letter from the manager of 
correspondence and complaints at the CRTC. In that letter the 
constituent was advised that under the terms of the Privacy Act, 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9735"> 9735 </A></B>
<P>
unless she requested otherwise, the hon. member's letter, sent 
on her behalf, and any other correspondence related  to her 
complaint would become part of the licensee's publicly 
accessible file in early January.
<P>
	The hon. member now argues that contrary to the statement of 
the Deputy Prime Minister his letter was not in fact a public 
document when the Deputy Prime Minister quoted from it last 
November and again requested that I review the matter.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The chief government whip then intervened and argued that 
what was at issue was a question of law and that the Speaker 
does not rule on such matters. He also added that if the hon. 
Member had a complaint with the CRTC, there were other 
avenues by which he could pursue it.
<P>
	Let me first address the matter of whether or not the member's 
letter to the Minister of Canadian Heritage was a public 
document and therefore able to be quoted from in debate. 
Beauchesne's Sixth Edition, page 151, citation 495(7) states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When a letter, even though it may have been written originally as a private 
letter, becomes part of a record of a department, it becomes a public document, 
and if quoted by a Minister in debate, must be tabled on request.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	From this, I must conclude that the letter from the hon. 
member to the minister was in fact a public document and 
therefore could be quoted from in the House.
<P>
	It is not for me to decide whether or not, as the Deputy Prime 
Minister stated, the letter was part of the public record of the 
CRTC. The application of the Privacy Act and the laws and 
policies governing CRTC dossiers are beyond my purview. As 
my predecessors have repeatedly ruled, it is not now, nor has it 
ever been, the role of the Speaker to rule on questions of law. 
This has been a longstanding practice and I draw members' 
attention to Bourinot's <I>Parliamentary Procedure and Practice 
in the Dominion of Canada</I>, Fourth Edition, 1916 at page 180 
which reads that the Speaker:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-will not give a decision upon a constitutional question nor decide a 
question of law, though the same be raised on a point of order or privilege.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is also repeated in citation 168(5) of Beauchesne's sixth 
edition, 1989.
<P>
	On matters of privilege, it is up to the House to decide whether 
or not a member's privileges have been breached. The Speaker 
must be persuaded that there is some evidence that a member has 
been hindered in the performance of his or her parliamentary 
duties, before putting the question to the whole House for 
determination.
<P>
	Having carefully reviewed the procedural authorities and the 
interventions of hon. members, I must conclude that in the case 
before us there is no prima facie question of privilege.
<P>
	I thank all hon. members for their contribution to this 
decision.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-68, an act respecting firearms and other weapons, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I understand there was 
some time left in the question and comment period for the hon. 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of the Environment. I 
believe the member for Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia had the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I had digressed to the 
question of the political flip-flop of the Association of Police 
Chiefs on the question of the registration of guns. However, I 
would like to pursue my original debate with the hon. member 
for Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis.
<P>
	He has at rather great length discussed the causes of domestic 
violence and suicide in the home as it relates to the registration 
of firearms. I fail to see, and I have tried very hard to 
understand, how a registered gun is any less lethal than an 
unregistered gun. If we want to solve the problem of domestic 
violence leading to death or of suicide with firearms, there is 
only one way it can be done. That is by totally disarming the 
civilian population.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	I would ask the hon. member if that is his vision of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was really interested in hearing 
the hon. member before question period when he contrasted the 
styles of the Minister of Justice who spoke in calm tones and 
mine with very passionate, emotional tones.
<P>
	In this party we are individuals. We have different styles, 
different ways of expressing ourselves, different points of view 
sometimes. That is what makes a democratic party. I do not see 
why we should not speak with passion. I feel very passionately 
about this issue. I feel passionately about it because guns kill. 
They cause death and injury. We should do whatever we can to 
be on the side of caution. That is what Bill C-68 is all about.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9736"> 9736 </A></B>
<P>
	I would remind the hon. member that there are an estimated 
five million rifles and shotguns in Canada. Nobody knows who 
owns them. Over the past 20 years 62,000 guns have been stolen 
and not recovered. Over 3,000 a year are lost and nobody knows 
where they are.
<P>
	A registration system makes it easier for police control, for 
people in charge of legal control to trace possessions. This is 
why we register cars and boats. When they get stolen or 
burglarized people can trace them.
<P>
	Today the Reform Party is challenging us to prove without any 
fear of contradiction, with 100 per cent certainty, that 
registration will be watertight or statistically proven. We have 
suggested that there is a whole body of opinion relating to crime. 
The police chiefs association, the Canadian Association of 
Police, the Canadian Bar Association, the Canadian Crime 
Association all tell us that registration will have an impact on at 
least controlling the guns that flow across the borders 
unregistered, unknown.
<P>
	Surely it is worse, the precautionary principle. Where is 
common sense? Where is the fact that we should use caution 
when it comes to lives? The onus should be on us to show we 
have taken every possible action to ensure life is protected.
<P>
	If registration would save one life-according to all the 
experts it will save many lives-then of course registration is 
possible. We have a duty as a government to do it. Bill C-68 is 
awaited by a great majority of Canadians. Eighty-eight per cent 
of Canadians in the Angus Reid poll say they are for registration, 
including a majority all across Canada. In some provinces it is 
up to 95 per cent, in another, 69 per cent. Every western province 
is for it.
<P>
	Therefore, Bill C-68 is a big step forward. It is a reflection of 
what the majority of Canadians want. I am very pleased it is 
here. I will support it with great conviction.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is very interesting to listen to the rhetoric flow, 
having it interfaced with an appeal to common sense. That is 
what we ask for, to see some common sense in the gun 
legislation in this country. The hon. member mentioned there 
are estimates which range from five million to as high as 12 
million firearms and long guns unregistered in the country.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	The registration of handguns has been in effect since 1934. 
We have had 60 years of registration and it has done nothing to 
prevent criminals from acquiring and using handguns for 
criminal purposes.
<P>
	I ask the hon. member for a succinct answer, if possible, 
because I know his time is up. How will registration of long guns 
be more successful than the registration of handguns has been?
<P>
	He also mentioned experts who say that registration will work 
and that ``it will save countless numbers of lives'' I believe was 
the term. Name the experts. We would love to know who the 
experts are who claim that registration will save lives.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lincoln:</B> Mr. Speaker, I said it would save lives. If it 
saves just one life it would be worth it. They never talk about life 
over there. They talk about guns. They do not talk about human 
life. That is really what this bill is about.
<P>
	The member makes the point that the registration of handguns 
has been in place since 1934 and it still permits criminals to use 
handguns. What would happen if there was no registration of 
handguns? Would there not be more crime?
<P>
	If the registration system needs improving, then let us 
improve it. Today we have computers, all kinds of technical 
means to ensure that a registration system is far better than the 
one that was set up many years ago. This is the opportunity to do 
it. We have the technological means to set up a proper 
registration system. It will take time but the minister has 
allowed for that in the bill. Once it is set up it will be a modern, 
up to date registration system which may filter into the 
communities and which hopefully will involve the community 
at large, the grassroots. It will be far better than the system we 
now have, which is no system.
<P>
	If the handgun registration system is not perfect, then let us 
perfect it. But at least it is a step toward caution, toward saving 
lives.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to participate in the debate at second reading of Bill 
C-68, An Act respecting firearms and other weapons, which was 
tabled on February 14, 1995, by the Minister of Justice and 
Attorney General of Canada.
<P>
	That legislation, which was promised a long time ago by the 
Liberal government, and the tabling of which was postponed on 
several occasions, amends the Criminal Code and includes a 
new Firearms Act. It provides harsh sanctions for crimes 
committed with a firearm, as well as a system of registration 
certificates and a national firearms registration system.
<P>
	This dense, complex and technical piece of legislation of 132 
pages, with no explanatory notes, will give effect to the 
measures announced on November 30 by the minister. The delay 
in the tabling of that bill can only be explained by the 
considerable opposition it has stirred in the ranks of the Liberal 
Party. Over 30 Liberal members will vote against that bill, 
including the member for Timiskaming-French River, the 
member for Kenora-Rainy River. Some ministers are also said 
to have strong reservations about the new legislation.
<P>
	I hope that these dissenting members will have an opportunity 
to express their views in this House, so that we get an idea of just 
how divided the Liberals are on this  issue. The hon. member for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9737"> 9737 </A></B>
<P>
Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis, who just made a good speech, 
should use his persuasiveness to convince his colleagues to 
support this legislation.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	Bill C-68 proposes several measures, including: the 
establishment of a national firearms registration system; a 
minimum jail sentence of four years for violent crimes 
committed with a firearm, as well as a prohibition to ever own a 
restricted or prohibited weapon; the inclusion of new Criminal 
Code offences with harsh penalties for the illegal importation 
and traffic of firearms; measures to tighten controls at the 
Canadian border-this morning, the minister mentioned that a 
very large number of firearms are imported into Canada each 
year-, and a prohibition to import and sell .25 and .32 calibre 
handguns, as well as handguns equipped with a barrel of 105mm 
or less.
<P>
	Individuals who do not acquire a licence or a certificate 
within the time prescribed could be sentenced, under the 
Criminal Code, to a maximum of six months in jail, or to a fine 
of up to $2,000. The weapons license is renewable every five 
years at a cost of $60. The registration certificate will be valid 
for life, unless the weapon is sold or transferred. Once the 
system is in place, the license will be mandatory for the 
purchase of ammunition.
<P>
	Control of firearms has caused and continues to cause heated 
debate. Those in favour of control are demanding, among other 
things, more stringent regulation, that all weapons be registered, 
and that certain types of firearms be prohibited.
<P>
	On the other hand, the weapons industry is angry at having to 
submit to new restrictions. It will therefore intensify its pressure 
in strongly opposing this bill. We of the Bloc Quebecois have 
always held that there must be legislation in this area in order to 
better control firearms.
<P>
	In my opinion, it will also help resolve the crime problem. I 
also realize that more restrictive gun control alone cannot 
resolve the crime problem. We must reconcile the right of 
individuals to protect themselves against violence with the 
legitimate interests of weapons' owners, including hunters.
<P>
	It must be pointed out that the minister resisted the pressure of 
the powerful gun lobby. Universal registration of firearms is a 
positive measure. It will encourage owners to find ways to store 
them safely.
<P>
	Reactions to the bill in Canada and in Quebec are divided. 
However, I think most of the country, including the people in my 
riding of Bourassa, in Montreal North, support the broad lines of 
the bill. Therefore, I believe this bill, despite many gaps and 
shortcomings, is a step in the right direction.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	Among the measures contained in this bill, the registration of 
all firearms is the most seriously disputed. Under the 
administrative control of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 
this measure should be implemented in conjunction with the 
provinces and territories. We will keep an eye on co-operation 
between the RCMP and the Government of Quebec. In Quebec, 
where at least one firearm offence is committed daily, the police 
must use stronger measures to effectively counter the criminal 
use of firearms.
<P>
	In my province, 400 to 450 deaths are caused by firearms 
every year, about 300 of which are suicides. This is why the 
health care community, in particular, has been calling for 
registration of all firearms for a long time. We must remember 
that in Quebec firearms have been registered since 1972, but the 
registration system must be improved.
<P>
	I have serious reservations about several measures in the bill, 
especially in regard to registration procedures and costs. The 
national registration system is not self-financed, something 
which the Bloc Quebecois has been demanding for a long time. 
The justice minister has merely mentioned that implementing 
this system will cost $85 million over seven years. But he has 
not said where he got these figures, how he arrived at this 
amount. In addition, I believe the cost will be much higher than 
what the minister has calculated.
<P>
	Moreover, we believe the minister and his government have 
given in to the powerful progun lobby by allowing a period of 
eight years for the registration of gun owners and their weapons.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, as you know, I am Chilean by birth. I came here 
following the military coup in 1973. Chile was a peaceful 
country; Pinochet's dictature brought total insecurity. When my 
wife, my children and I came to Montreal in 1974, we most 
cherished the safety of this country's cities and streets.
<P>
	However, I was shaken by the tragedy of December 6, 1989, 
when 14 young women lost their lives at l'Ãcole polytechnique 
de MontrÃ©al, at the hand of a misogynist murderer. Marc LÃ©pine 
used a Luger rifle. The incident spurred a major movement in 
Quebec and Canada in favour of increasing firearm controls and 
it heightened awareness of the daily violence that women are 
subjected to in our society.
<P>
	I was personally affected by the tragic incident five years ago 
because one of my goddaughters was studying at l'Ãcole 
polytechnique during the incident but, fortunately, did not get 
shot.
<P>
	The bill outlaws the sale of all weapons like the one used by 
Marc LÃ©pine. At the time, close to three out of four Canadians 
felt that the massacre of the 14 students at l'Ãcole polytechnique 
demonstrated the need for tighter gun controls.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9738"> 9738 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	Women, seniors and Quebecers in general were and are the 
three groups most in favour of legislative action to restrict the 
sale of weapons. According to figures from Statistics Canada, 
between 1978 and 1982, 37 per cent of all murders were 
committed with firearms. Of the 6,465 crimes committed 
between 1978 and 1987, 33 per cent were committed using a 
firearm.
<P>
	The minister said that on the average, every six days a woman 
dies from a gunshot wound in Canada. The situation is therefore 
very serious. However, in my opinion, the minister is afraid to 
really get to the heart of it. He should have tabled a tougher bill. 
He extends until the 21st century the time limit for those who 
currently owner firearms to get a certificate in compliance with 
the minister's action plan.
<P>
	He has committed the sin of omission on many points in his 
bill. The Minister of Justice did not pay enough attention to 
coroner Anne-Marie David's inquest, held in Montreal in the 
latter part of 1994. Twenty or so witnesses representing various 
organizations testified about how inconsistent and unclear the 
regulations were and how the minister's new proposals did not 
address the problem as a whole.
<P>
	Government must protect citizens against any fraudulent and 
dangerous use of firearms. Public safety must be improved by 
limiting the use of firearms for criminal purposes. I think that all 
immigrants in Quebec and Canada wish to live in a safe and 
law-abiding society. I also think that the people do not want 
Quebec and Canada to become like the United States as far as 
firearms are concerned.
<P>
	But at the same time, I would like to see this bill take into 
consideration the legitimate interests of hunters and farmers. 
Hunting is a long-standing traditional activity. It is a major 
leisure and economic activity for many Quebecers and 
Canadians. Sports shooters have gained international 
recognition. Many aboriginal people hunt to feed their families. 
I have nothing against people using weapons for good reasons.
<P>
	I do not think that in Canada, unlike other countries, we need 
to be armed to protect ourselves. At least, this is not the kind of 
society I would like to live in.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member for Bourassa 
mentioned that about 30 members on the government side will 
be voting against the bill. I would suggest that he redo his 
research because many of the concerns that our members had 
have been addressed in the latest changes to this bill.
<P>
	I was pleased to hear from him that he personally will be 
supporting this bill because, as he said, it was a long time 
coming. He did comment, though, that the bill did not go quite 
far enough.
<P>
<B>(1545 ) </B>
<P>
	The minister of the environment and wildlife for Quebec 
stressed that the bill goes too far. I am wondering if he can give 
us some clarification if this is the same split within his party. He 
makes a very strong statement that the bill does not go far 
enough and yet we are hearing another message from that 
province that the bill has gone too far.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunez:</B> I hope that the dissent within the Liberal caucus 
with respect to Bill C-68 is not deep-seated. I accept your 
explanations, but I still think there are some serious problems 
about this bill within your caucus.
<P>
	As I said before, we agree with the general principles of the 
bill. We are in favour of tighter gun controls, especially in 
Quebec, where we had the tragic killings at l'Ãcole 
polytechnique in Montreal and where other occurrences have 
made us very much aware of the problem.
<P>
	I hope that during consideration of the bill in the Justice 
Committee, we will be able to take a closer look at this 
legislation and propose amendments that will make it more 
effective and give it more teeth, and that will also ensure it will 
come into force as soon as possible. As the hon. member for 
Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis said earlier with such passionate 
conviction, I think society in Canada and Quebec absolutely 
needs this legislation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to ask the hon. member for Bourassa two questions.

	The hon. member indicated that he supported the idea of 
prohibiting the Mini Ruger which was used in the polytechnique 
massacre. I can support that and understand that assault 
weapons are off the list. My constituents support that as well. 
However, someone who is deranged will find a weapon in some 
way, whether it is registered or not under this current program. 
He could have used a sawed off shotgun, for example.
<P>
	The first question is how would registration have stopped that 
circumstance from actually happening?
<P>
	The second question is with regard to a remark the hon. 
member made concerning universal registration. He said it is a 
good idea because it will encourage owners to store their guns 
and ammunition safely. The last House of Commons passed Bill 
C-17 and put into place legislation that required all people in 
Canada to store their guns and ammunition safely. It has not 
lowered the crime rate or the illegal use or misuse of firearms in 
crimes in any way. How can the hon. member say that universal 
registration is going to make a difference with regard to this?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunez:</B> Mr. Speaker, of course there are limits to what we 
can do. There are mentally disturbed individuals in every 
society. However, I believe that our goal and the public's goal is 
to minimize the risk of crimes being committed with firearms.
<P>
	I do not know whether the weapon used by Marc LÃ©pine was 
registered, but I think firearms registration will be helpful 
because we will know who the owner is. In the case of people 
who are mentally disturbed, I trust they will be denied the right 
to have a firearms licence.
<P>
	I think registration is essential to gun control. Of course, if we 
have a national registration system, we can also ensure safer 
storage of these firearms. I hope that this bill will help us 
achieve some of these goals, despite, I repeat, some 
considerable deficiencies in Bill C-68.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I remember one time being stopped by a policeman for 
a routine check in my car and in the back seat was a baseball bat. 
He asked why I had a baseball bat in my car. I said that along 
with the ball and the glove on the floor of the car, I used it to play 
with my children. This was a few years ago. He said that was 
fine, but that if I were carrying it to use as protection or to use 
against someone it would be a crime to have it in the car.
<P>
	It seems to me that the intention of the use of a firearm or a 
hatpin or a hammer or a kitchen knife or a pair of fists is the 
thrust of what we should be talking about. It is the intention of a 
person to harm, the deformed will of a person that we should be 
addressing ourselves to. We cannot stop every threat. When we 
are told that if we can save even one life, if it were true I would 
accept that.
<P>
	If we are so concerned about saving lives, why is the 
government and why are the people of Canada not more 
concerned about the technical standards of appliances, of 
automobiles, of so many of the things we use? Why do we allow 
smoking? Why are the restrictions on drunken driving not more 
stringent? This is a red herring.
<P>
	How will the registration of guns, how will further 
restrictions on guns and how will this bill on gun control affect 
the misuse of guns by someone who is determined to cause 
someone else harm?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunez:</B> Mr. Speaker, as I said earlier, I believe the 
national firearms registration system will provide tighter 
controls over who owns these firearms and where they are 
stored. I am not alone in this respect.
<P>
	In my own riding of Bourassa, in Montreal North, 15 per cent 
of my constituents are senior citizens. I discussed this with 
them. We had a number of meetings, and I asked them: What do 
you think about gun control and the bill announced by the 
Minister of Justice? All senior citizens are in favour of tighter 
controls because they want to be able to go out, and walk in the 
park, without fear of being attacked by some crazy person with a 
gun. And many people would agree.
<P>
	I spoke to the labour movement, the Canadian Labour 
Congress, which represents more than two million members in 
this country, and especially in Quebec, they agree with the broad 
principles of this bill. I spoke to physicians and health care 
workers. They also want tighter gun controls in Canada. I think 
the majority of the people in Canada and Quebec, and in my 
riding, support the broad principles of this bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Parliamentary Secretary 
to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I feel 
that it is a great opportunity for me to speak on the topic of gun 
control. I hope to talk about some of the concerns expressed by 
the Reform Party and go through a whole series of situations in 
terms of support, some of the statistics that support strong gun 
control.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	Let me start with a basic premise on why gun control is good 
for Canada. Gun control is not simply about controlling guns. It 
is about public safety. It is about crime prevention.
<P>
	Do members think-I have asked this question to people 
often-if we have more guns on the street we will have more 
crime? Consistently the answer is yes, the more guns we have on 
the street, the more crime we will have. If you can go out and buy 
a gun in a local store, do you think we will have more crime? The 
answer consistently is yes.
<P>
	Is that not logical? If there are fewer guns on the street and if 
the government makes it more difficult for people to get more 
guns, will we not have less crime? My basic premise is if we 
have fewer guns on the street and those that are there are 
restricted and managed, we will have a safer society and safer 
communities.
<P>
	The other part of it is just the psychological effect, the fact 
that we know as a society we do not tolerate people having guns, 
and the fact people know it is illegal to have guns on the street 
and that we do have restrictions. That will also help in 
determining that psychologically there is less fear in our 
society. That is very important as well.
<P>
	Let me look at the support that this bill has right across this 
country, whether it be in Alberta, British Columbia or anywhere 
else. There is tremendous support for this bill. For example, 
from October 5 to October 25, 1994 Environics Research Group 
Limited conducted a national survey of Canadian public attitude 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9740"> 9740 </A></B>
<P>
toward  various gun control measures. The survey reported that 
90 per cent supported a law requiring all firearms to be 
registered.
<P>
	In British Columbia 88 per cent of the people support strong 
gun control. In Alberta 83 per cent of the people support gun 
control. Virtually all Canadians, 96 per cent, support increased 
penalties for the use of a firearm during the commission of a 
crime. Part of that bill also increases the crime whenever a 
firearm is used in the commission of a crime.
<P>
	Seventy-five per cent wanted restricted access to 
ammunition. Sixty-seven per cent supported a law preventing 
civilians from owning handguns.
<P>
	There is a whole list of the polls done. It goes on and on. I 
could probably go on. There was a survey done in Alberta 
recently which said that 64 per cent of Albertans support a 
national firearms registry.
<P>
	This was a poll done by Alberta's minister of justice, Mr. 
Evans, who said that he was surprised by the results of this poll. 
An Angus Reid poll was done in the fall of 1994 in which 70 per 
cent of Canadians favoured tougher gun controls.
<P>
	I can go on and on and cite more polls but it is pretty evident 
that Canadians support strong gun control. If one looks at the 
groups that are supporting gun control, there are incredible 
groups that are saying they want gun control.
<P>
	For example, on August 25, 1994 at its 89th annual 
conference the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police passed 
six resolutions that support strengthened firearms control 
measures. Mayors of B.C., mayors of some of the people in the 
Reform Party, said they want stricter gun control. Eighteen 
mayors throughout British Columbia representing 1.7 million 
people said they want stronger gun control. This is coming from 
the mayors of municipalities.
<P>
	It is quite evident that groups right across Canada, whether it 
is the mayors, the Canadian police chiefs or other groups 
including community groups, have said they want stricter gun 
control. As the Reform Party always says, we are listening to 
those Canadians. We are listening and we are responding. We 
believe we need to listen. The difficulty for Reform Party 
members is that if they do not support this bill, they will be 
against the majority in their own ridings that wants stricter gun 
controls.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	I know we have to be careful in using statistics because they 
can be used in misleading ways. I want to share some statistics 
with the Canadian public. A recent survey showed that guns 
were used in 42 per cent of murders of women by their spouses. 
One woman in Canada is killed with a gun every six days. Most 
often she is killed in her own home and almost always she is 
killed by someone she knows. That is quite a revealing statistic.
<P>
	There is another statistic that we should look at closely. Over 
80 per cent of the rifles and shotguns were legally owned at the 
time of the shooting. Is that not an incredible statistic? The 
members of the third party say: ``It is the criminals that are 
committing the crimes''. It shows that over 80 per cent of the 
rifles and shotguns were legally owned by those people at the 
time of the shooting. What does that tell us? It sends a very 
strong message when 80 per cent of the rifles and shotguns were 
legally owned at the time of the shooting. We have to take 
action.
<P>
	In 1991 there were a total of 1,445 deaths involving firearms. 
Of those, 19 per cent were homicides, 4 per cent were accidental 
deaths and 77 per cent were suicides. In 1992, 26 per cent of all 
robberies involved firearms. This represents a gradual decline 
since 1977 when it was 39 per cent, the year before stricter gun 
control measures were passed by Parliament.
<P>
	As the result of stricter gun controls we have cut robberies 
down from 39 per cent to 26 per cent. We heard the same 
arguments in 1977 when the Liberal government, proposed by 
Minister Ron Basford, passed legislation on stricter gun control. 
The same arguments are coming out. In looking back the 
statistics show we did the right thing. In 15 or 20 years we will 
look back and say we did the right thing now as well.
<P>
	In 1992 there were 732 homicides. Of those 732, 34 per cent 
were committed with firearms. That is a serious problem.
<P>
	We can compare our gun laws with those in other countries. 
Unfortunately we do not have a comprehensive study that 
compares countries that have stricter gun controls and those that 
have less restrictions.
<P>
	We do have one very comprehensive study that took the 
example of two cities which were within a 100 to 150 mile 
radius. The study looked at what happens in crime in those two 
cities. The two cities were Seattle and Vancouver, the city which 
I am from and represent, Vancouver South. It looked at these two 
cities because there were a lot of similarities in geography, 
climate, make-up and population. It was a study done between 
1980 through 1986 in order to investigate the associations 
among handgun regulations, assaults and other crimes, as well 
as homicides.
<P>
	The two cities are similar in many ways. They share common 
geography, as I said, climate history and both cities have a 
comparable level of schooling and have almost identical rates of 
unemployment and ethnic diversity.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9741"> 9741 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1605 ) </B>
<P>
	Although similar to Seattle in many ways, Vancouver has 
adopted a much more restrictive approach to the regulation of 
handguns. During the study period, it is quite relevant that both 
cities had similar rates of burglary and robbery.
<P>
	In Seattle, the annual rate of assault was modestly higher than 
that in Vancouver. However, the rate of assaults involving 
firearms was seven times higher in Seattle than in Vancouver. 
That sends a very good message. Despite similar overall rates of 
assault the relative risk of death from homicide was 
significantly higher in Seattle than in Vancouver. Virtually all of 
this excess risk was explained by a 4.8 fold higher risk of being 
murdered with a gun in Seattle as compared with Vancouver. 
That is very revealing.
<P>
	The conclusion of this study was that restricting access to 
handguns will reduce the rate of homicide in a community. That 
is the basic premise I started from. It is logical that if we have 
more guns on the street, we will have more crime. If we have 
fewer guns on the street, it is logical that we will have less 
crime.
<P>
	That is a very simple way to look at it. Unfortunately the 
members of the Reform Party still do not see that. It is very 
simple. The average person should understand that. If we let 
people buy a gun whenever they want with no restrictions or 
rules, we will have higher crime. If we restrict firearms, we will 
reduce the crime.
<P>
	Another example is Indianapolis. Its police wanted to stop 
vehicles to have a real, active approach on gun control, like our 
drinking program. They said they would stop cars in a certain 
area where they had problems; they would search cars, looking 
for guns. They set up a proactive approach to this.
<P>
	The police actively sought out and confiscated illegal 
firearms in high crime neighbourhoods. The result was that gun 
related crimes were reduced by almost 50 per cent in the 
relevant areas. Homicides and drive-by shootings also went 
down significantly. This is a very good message.
<P>
	Even with this information, the Americans have been unable 
to put forward stricter gun controls because of the national 
riflemen's lobby association. Strangely enough, we hear 
members of the Reform Party talking about lobby groups. They 
say their favourite subject is lobby groups and how they are 
against lobbyists and lobby groups. However, when the lobby 
groups support their position, they are holding hands. They do 
not mind going to bed with the lobby groups that support their 
position, as they have done with the gun lobby group.
<P>
	We always get the argument that we should punish those 
people who cause the crime. Here is another statistic that will 
interest people. Eighty per cent of all homicides in Canada occur 
between people who know each other. Most homicides occur as 
a result of assaults during arguments or altercations. A small 
minority occur during the commission of a robbery or other 
felony.
<P>
	If there are more guns in the homes, there will be more 
homicides. If there are fewer guns in the home, there will be 
fewer homicides. It is very simple.
<P>
<B>(1610 ) </B>
<P>
	What is the cost of this program? Prove that it will reduce 
crime. If everything we did to prevent crime had to be proven 
first, we would not have very many crime prevention programs.
<P>
	We have heard from major groups that have said that this bill 
will reduce crime. Common sense tells us that it will reduce 
crime. However, members of the Reform Party want evidence, 
proof now, on crime prevention programs. The proof is already 
there if we look at past legislation and at the gun control bill of 
1977. It shows that stricter gun control reduces crime. We do not 
need any more proof. The government will take action whenever 
a crime prevention program shows it reduces crime and helps 
public safety.
<P>
	Once a crime is committed there are incredible costs. I know 
members of the Reform Party have mentioned costs. But what 
does it cost once a crime is committed? What is the cost to a 
family? What is the cost to society? What is the cost of losing a 
family member? There are huge financial costs, for the courts, 
for the legal system, for the pleas. To keep someone in jail costs 
$60,000 a year.
<P>
	Yes, the program will cost something. The registry system 
will cost approximately $85 million. But it is not a cost, it is an 
investment because it is going to reduce crime. It is an 
investment because it will ensure there are fewer tragedies, 
whether it be a suicide or a murder. Hopefully as 
parliamentarians we can attempt to reduce those kinds 
tragedies. That is why I am supporting this bill.
<P>
	The Reform Party strongly opposes any preventive gun 
control measures. Its arguments are primarily based on 
defending the interests of gun owners, not in public safety. 
Reformers ignore the facts about the use of firearms in domestic 
violence, suicides and accidental deaths. Although Reform 
claims to put a high priority on crime prevention, the only action 
it advocates is to deal with criminals after lives have been lost. 
We want to prevent the loss of lives. That is our goal.
<P>
	The costs of registration have been exaggerated by the 
Reform Party with allegations that the registration system will 
cost hundreds of millions of dollars. Concerns about the design 
and the cost of the system are being dealt with by taking time to 
develop it carefully.
<P>
	I have to congratulate the Minister of Justice who had the 
courage to tackle this issue and to make sure that it is done right. 
Too often politicians do not want to tackle tough issues. They do 
not want to tackle issues where there is some resistance. The 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9742"> 9742 </A></B>
<P>
minister saw resistance to gun control. It took a lot of courage 
for him to bring in this legislation.
<P>
	With today's technology it will also be cheaper than it would 
have been 15 or 20 years ago. We think those figures are correct.
<P>
	I know that I am running out of time. My colleague from 
Edmonton Southwest said his survey showed that 69 per cent of 
the people in his riding support stricter gun control. In a lot of 
ways Canadians are ahead of politicians on this one. However, 
as a government we recognize that we must do this. The 
Canadian public wants us to do it. The police forces want us to 
do it. Let us do it for our children. Let us do it for the youth so 
they will face less crime.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	I have three children and I want them to live in a safe society, 
where they do not feel threatened by someone having a gun. I 
want them to build a stronger society. We do not want to be 
Americanized as do some Reform Party members. We want to 
have a safe country. We do not need guns.
<P>
	If there is any message I can send today it is that everyone, 
including the Reform members, should support this bill and give 
support to the minister. If anything, it should be a tougher bill 
than what it is now. I hope in the future we can make it more 
tough because the fewer guns out there, the less crime. It is only 
logical.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to ask the hon. member a couple of questions.
<P>
	I too have spent the last seven or eight weeks touring the 
country far and wide talking to people at many public meetings. 
I have also received polls. I received one yesterday regarding 
registration from the constituents of 
Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, which had 2,807 respondents. 
Of those respondents, 111 said yes and 2,696 said no.
<P>
	That is what came from that riding. The member of 
Parliament has received that poll from those constituents. Is that 
member of Parliament going to be allowed to represent his 
people? After all, the polls he is getting certainly do not indicate 
what the minister and other members are claiming.
<P>
	Are we aware that the Prime Minister received 200 
resolutions from municipalities in the province of Manitoba 
opposing the minister's gun law? We have not heard anything 
about that, but I know they were delivered to the Prime Minister 
of Canada from the province of Manitoba.
<P>
	Tons and tons of petitions are being tabled. I have managed to 
put in over several thousand names from all over the country 
because some members evidently do not want to table these 
petitions. They have come from all parts of the country. The 
latest one was from Manitoba and was signed by somewhere in 
the neighbourhood of 1,400 individuals, including 400 or 500 
women who signed it on special pink paper so it would be 
recognized. They are opposing this bill.
<P>
	The hon. member for Burlington was with me at a meeting in 
Kamloops. The place was packed full. There might have been 
300 or 350 people there. They asked that member to send a 
message to the minister. They called for a vote and they all stood 
opposing the gun proposals.
<P>
	For heaven's sake, when you see these kinds of things-and 
everywhere I go I see them-and you get them from your own 
members' ridings, where it says that 96 per cent oppose gun 
registration, where in the world are you dreaming up these 
figures that you keep talking about?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. The Chair 
recognizes that this is very controversial and that there are very 
strongly held views on both sides of the debate. However I 
would remind members on both sides of the House to always 
direct their interventions through the Chair, through the 
Speaker, and avoid referring directly to one another as ``you''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I apologize for that. I forgot for 
a moment that you were there. I will not do that again. But as you 
say, it is very easy to get worked up.
<P>
	I have attended over 19 public meetings. I have personally 
interviewed thousands of people and I have listened to them. I 
did not encourage them in any way, fashion or form. I asked: Are 
you familiar with the proposals? They said yes. I asked: Are you 
in favour? There was an overwhelming no. This is mostly 
grassroots. I do not have time for a lot of the elite, as do some of 
the ministers. I am talking to grassroots individuals throughout 
the country. They do not want it. It is loud and clear from every 
indication.
<P>
	Check the petitions that are tabled and tell me how many 
petitions are in favour of this and how many are against. Mr. 
Speaker, you will be pleasantly surprised.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dhaliwal:</B> Mr. Speaker, on any given day on any issue I 
could probably get 1,000 people out in my riding. If a Reformer 
comes to speak in my riding, I can get 1,000 people to protest 
against them because of their stance. It is not hard to get 300 
people up against it.
<P>
<B>(1620 ) </B>
<P>
	However, that is not the issue here. The issue is that overall, 
the polls coming in show again and again that the majority of 
Canadians are supporting this. There are going to be some 
people who oppose it because it will be in their interests to do so. 
These are the hunters and the people who sell guns. It is in their 
interests to oppose this.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9743"> 9743 </A></B>
<P>
	Some of them have legitimate reasons. I give the minister 
credit because he has met with people right across the country 
from coast to coast to talk to them about their legitimate 
concerns. Some of them are hunters up in the north whose 
livelihoods depend on guns.
<P>
	When the polls show that 15 per cent of the people are against 
this bill, they are going to sign petitions, but 85 per cent of the 
people want gun control. It is an overwhelming fact that people 
want gun control.
<P>
	The Reform Party will pay a very high price for not listening 
to the Canadian public in the next election. A recent poll has 
shown how marginalized it is and it will be more marginalized 
after the next election. It will have less than the two seats the 
Conservatives got.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have heard the hon. member from the other side state 
many facts and figures.
<P>
	It has been mandatory to register handguns since 1934. I 
would like to know how much and how far crime has depleted 
with the use of handguns. I also heard the member mention 
crime control at border crossings. I would like the hon. member 
just to remember that this is the same government that could not 
stop the smuggling of cigarettes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dhaliwal:</B> Mr. Speaker, this government has done a very 
good job in stopping the smuggling of cigarettes. All one has to 
do is look at the facts.
<P>
	The hon. member was not listening when I gave an example. I 
said that in 1977, 39 per cent of the people were using a firearm 
in robberies. Now it is only 26 per cent. The evidence is there 
and it is overwhelming. If some people want to ignore the 
evidence, so be it. Some people do not want the truth and choose 
to ignore the evidence, as some of the Reform members have 
done.
<P>
	However, we are not going to ignore the truth or the facts. We 
are going to look at this in 20 years and know that we did the 
right thing in this Parliament. We will have passed strong gun 
control legislation which I think should be even stronger than it 
is now. Canadians across this country have shown support for us. 
In the recent byelections it was three seats out of three for the 
Liberals. Why? It is because we are doing the right thing, we are 
listening to Canadians.
<P>
	It is surprising that whenever we have done consultations the 
Reform Party has called them a sham. It is not interested in 
consultation and it is the party that wants consultation.
<P>
	There are some legitimate concerns out there on gun control 
and the minister has dealt with those concerns. This is an 
excellent piece of legislation. I hope the members will strongly 
endorse and support it because when they look back at it 20 years 
from now, they will know they did the right thing.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before resuming debate, 
it is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform the House 
that the question to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment 
is as follows: the hon. member for Kamloops-Taxation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. member for MÃ©gantic-Compton-Stanstead has 
given me written notice that he will be unable to be present to 
move his motion under Private Members' Business on Friday, 
February 17, 1995.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It has not been possible to arrange an exchange of positions in 
the order of precedence pursuant to Standing Order 94(2)(<I>a</I>). 
Accordingly, I am directing the table officers to drop that item 
of business to the bottom of the order of precedence.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Pursuant to Standing Order 94(2)(<I>b</I>), private members' hour 
will be deferred and the House will continue with the business 
then before it.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wish I could stand today to say it is a pleasure for me 
to speak on Bill C-68 but I am afraid I cannot. I had hoped that 
the hon. minister would have listened to the concerns of literally 
hundreds of thousands, millions of Canadians across the country 
who have deep concerns about gun registration. Obviously he 
has not and has chosen to forge ahead.
<P>
	I personally have received thousands of letters from people 
who are concerned that the Minister of Justice has confused gun 
control with crime control. I am sure that every other member of 
Parliament in the House has as well.
<P>
	There is a growing perception that our justice system is not 
working. The justice minister and the anti-gun lobby are trying 
to convince everyone that if we just make it tougher to own and 
use a gun legally, somehow it will be harder for criminals to use 
them illegally. Somehow I have my doubts about that.
<P>
	Our justice system was built on the principle that one is 
innocent until proven guilty. We must work hard to maintain the 
integrity of that system to ensure that innocent people are not 
deprived of their rights for the wrong reasons.
<P>
	When any program is put into place, it should be clear what 
the objectives are. There should be a means of evaluating its 
effectiveness. In this case, I feel the government has clearly 
failed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9744"> 9744 </A></B>
<P>
	What does imposing more restrictions on law-abiding 
citizens have to do with crime control? To use the minister's 
own words, how does registration make Canada a safer, more 
civilized place to live? In 1993 the Auditor General said that 
we do not have statistics indicating whether previous gun 
control legislation has had any effect on the misuse of firearms.
<P>
	The results of just one short term evaluation done in 1983 
were used as a basis for the even stricter gun control legislation 
introduced by Kim Campbell, Bill C-17 in 1991. When Bill 
C-17 was passed, there was no real proof that the new laws or 
regulations would meet the government's crime control 
objectives.
<P>
	This justice minister has introduced legislation with some 
very clear crime control measures, such as stiffer penalties for 
using a gun in the commission of a crime or for weapons 
trafficking. However, in the same bill he has included 
restrictions on honest citizens who he cannot demonstrate have 
anything to do with the problem.
<P>
	I object to the minister lumping measures against criminals in 
with measures against law-abiding citizens. I object to the 
implication that responsible gun owners are somehow guilty of a 
moral deficiency or harbouring criminal intentions simply 
because they own a gun. I am referring to such measures as 
mandatory registration and powers of search and seizure 
without a warrant.
<P>
	In parts of my riding, every household has at least one gun. 
The police have been handed the power to search businesses and 
premises other than dwellings, without a warrant. The minister 
has created a new category of criminals in this country.
<P>
	Where I grew up in northern B.C., someone is a criminal if 
they do something illegal, if they actively go out and break the 
law. This bill makes honest Canadian citizens criminals subject 
to a 10 year prison term if they do not do something. If they fail 
to register their .22 they can be thrown in prison for up to 10 
years.
<P>
	Ten years was the penalty Denis Lortie got for murdering 
three people and wounding 13 others in the Quebec National 
Assembly. Ten years is the maximum penalty this minister is 
seeking for a young offender who commits premeditated first 
degree murder. Is this minister saying that because someone 
fails to register their gun they must be going to commit murder 
or rob a bank?
<P>
	This legislation is a slap in the face to every law-abiding gun 
owner in Canada. This government tells us that we need tougher 
gun laws against legal gun owners because stolen guns are used 
by criminals. Where is the proof that registration will prevent 
even one death? The government does not have any.
<P>
	If crime prevention is not the objective of registration, then 
what is? Murder rates in Canada have remained relatively stable 
over the last 15 years. Yet in April, the justice minister reacted 
to two high profile murders in Ottawa and Toronto by floating a 
proposal for a total ban  on guns within city limits. Who did he 
think would be affected by such a ban, the criminals?
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	Tougher gun control legislation in many states has had no 
discernible impact on gun violence. In the United States 93 per 
cent of the guns used in homicides were apparently acquired 
illegally. New Zealand and Australia found registration did not 
help the police. It did not seem to have any tangible aim and did 
not help at the scene of a crime when the offender stole, 
borrowed or found a firearm.
<P>
	What about in Canada? Here the government does not keep 
statistics on the use of illegally versus legally owned guns in the 
commission of crimes. Why not? Would they not support the 
government's position?
<P>
	Last June I asked the Minister of Justice to prove to 
law-abiding gun owners that they are part of the crime problem 
before he enacts even tougher laws. We want proof that tighter 
restrictions for people who respect the law will prevent the 
criminals who do not respect the law from getting their hands on 
guns. Eight months later we are still waiting for an answer.
<P>
	Restricted and prohibited firearms are already registered. 
What has their registration done to prevent crime? In most cases 
where restricted and presumably registered guns are used in 
crimes the government does not even know if the criminal 
bought the firearm legally. It does not keep records. There are 
already 1.2 million registered firearms in the country and this 
government does not have a clue how many of them were used in 
crimes because it does not ask. It knows guns used in crime were 
smuggled into the country and I fully support tougher measures 
against gun smuggling.
<P>
	Why is the minister taking rights away from people who are 
not criminals? The hypocrisy of selling universal registration as 
crime control is readily apparent to everyone.
<P>
	We know that thousands of guns are smuggled into the 
country all the time. What is the point of borders and laws if we 
cannot or will not enforce them? If we cannot close our borders 
to cigarette smuggling how much more difficult is it going to be 
when the government finally gets serious about gun smuggling? 
When will the government take a stand and give the police or the 
army the mandate to stop international trade in arms?
<P>
	I visited with police in the Cornwall area. The minister and 
other members opposite like to talk about how they have the 
support of the police forces. Everyone knows gun smuggling is 
going on down there but they have not been able to stop it. When 
I questioned the police as to why they have not been able to stop 
the smuggling they said to me: ``Why should we risk ourselves 
with a small revolver against automatic weapons? When we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9745"> 9745 </A></B>
<P>
apprehend these people, we make an arrest, we get them into 
court and they get off with a slap on the wrist''.
<P>
	Their message to me was to get tough with the people who are 
misusing and abusing firearms rather than legislate a useless 
registration system.
<P>
	I hope this government's anti-smuggling legislation works 
better than its anti-cigarette campaign. I understand cigarette 
use has increased dramatically since this government lowered 
the taxes a year ago. I hope the plan is not to lower the taxes on 
guns to combat smuggling.
<P>
	Bill C-68 has some tough laws on trafficking. Under sections 
99 and 100 of part III of the Criminal Code a weapons trafficker 
will get up to 10 years. I also notice that tucked away in section 
110(v) of the Firearms Act the governor in council can pass 
regulations ``respecting the manner in which any provision of 
this act or the regulation applies to any of the aboriginal peoples 
of Canada and adapting any such provision for the purposes of 
that application''.
<P>
	The question has been asked and will repeatedly be asked 
whether this legislation will apply equally to all Canadians. The 
minister's reply throws more confusion when he says yes, but 
with flexibility toward the aboriginal people. What does this 
mean? Canadians need to know.
<P>
	The justice minister maintains that the government is not 
effectively destroying the value of the prohibited handguns 
because Bill C-68 creates a class of gun owners they can trade 
with. This class is defined as any current gun owner who legally 
owned one of the newly prohibited guns on or before Tuesday, 
February 14. Considering that date I wonder if Bill C-68 is not 
just a Valentine's present by the minister to Wendy Cukler of the 
Coalition for Gun Control.
<P>
<B>(1635 ) </B>
<P>
	Does that really protect their investment in these guns? Over 
time the class of owners will dwindle through attrition. Fewer 
and fewer people will be allowed to buy these guns and 
eventually there would be only one avid collector in possession 
of half a million guns. When he or she dies all those guns will be 
confiscated by the crown. Will they get fair compensation for 
those firearms if he or she tries to sell them before they die? 
There will only be a few collectors allowed to buy them. Do not 
tell me that fair compensation will be offered. Do not tell me or 
the country that their market will be stable.
<P>
	Last year a young Edmonton mother, Barb Danelesko, was 
savagely murdered in a home invasion. Do you think she could 
have convinced a firearms officer that she needed to protect 
herself or her children? Recently one young offender found 
guilty for that crime was handed a three-year sentence.
<P>
	Under Bill C-68, if Mrs. Danelesko had had an unregistered 
firearm at her disposal for her defence and had survived, she 
would have had to face up to 10 years for non-compliance. 
Where is the balance? Where is the justice?
<P>
	Proven criminals receive fewer years than this minister wants 
to give responsible hunters who have done nothing wrong but 
failed to register their shotgun.
<P>
	Many people, especially those living in cities, do not believe 
the ability to protect your home and family is a legitimate reason 
to own a gun. The justice minister certainly does not believe it.
<P>
	Less than a year ago he said he came to Ottawa with the firm 
belief that the only people in this country who should have guns 
are police officers and soldiers. This is a sobering thought for 
millions of responsible gun owners in Canada. With the 
introduction of Bill C-68 he is one step closer to fulfilling his 
goal.
<P>
	He also said he did not want Canadians to think they needed to 
protect themselves. I have news for him. With our over burdened 
police forces and court system, most Canadians already know 
they need to protect themselves.
<P>
	Guns are a necessary part of life for many people in northern 
B.C. Farmers need them for predator control. Trappers and 
guides use them every day in their work. Hunters use them to 
help stock their freezers. Many of us also believe that we should 
be able to use guns for personal protection, to defend our homes, 
our families and our property.
<P>
	The criminals laugh while the rest of us become their victims 
and have our civil liberties taken away. This is how the Liberal 
government deals with gun related violence. People need to be 
able to defend themselves in situations in which the police, as 
much as they would like to, cannot.
<P>
	In Edmonton a man shot at intruders in his yard and he is the 
one facing charges. The papers called the thwarted robber the 
victim. If we are to have true justice the rights of the innocent 
defending their homes must supersede the rights of the guilty 
who are trying to rob them.
<P>
	Today the criminals are called the victims and society 
apologizes for their behaviour. Meanwhile responsible citizens 
have more of their rights infringed upon because the police and 
the courts cannot keep up.
<P>
	This government is trying to convince Canadians that gun 
control is the same thing as crime control. Maybe it is easier to 
go after law-abiding gun owners than after hardened criminals. 
I do not believe it is going to solve the crime problem and I do 
not think most Canadians do either.
<P>
	I do recognize, however, that there are positive aspects to this 
legislation. If the hon. members opposite would listen, I will list 
the positive aspects.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9746"> 9746 </A></B>
<P>
	For example, I applaud the changes to section 85 for the use 
of a gun in the commission of a crime. It has been beefed up 
to include imitation firearms and use during flight or the 
attempted commission of a crime. Although the first offence 
only gets 1 to 14 years, subsequent offences will net a criminal 
3 to 14 to be served consecutively to any other sentence related 
to the same event.
<P>
	However, these changes are meaningless if the charge is plea 
bargained away in our overcrowded courts. On the first offence a 
criminal would also be prohibited from owning a gun for 10 
years. If he or she violates this prohibition order, they are 
subject to a maximum 10-year sentence. It does not say if it is 
consecutive.
<P>
<B>(1640 ) </B>
<P>
	I have some questions about whether the 10-year maximum 
for violation of the prohibition could ever get tacked on to a 
maximum 14-year sentence for using a gun in another crime. I 
think a potential 24-year sentence for using a firearm again 
would certainly make some criminals think twice before 
acquiring yet another gun for illegal purposes.
<P>
	Making sentences tougher on the books will not mean 
anything to criminals if our judges will not impose sentences 
consistently or if gun charges are plea bargained away. Imposing 
a mandatory minimum sentence for armed crimes has no 
deterrent effect if criminals do not get a consistent message.
<P>
	The minister has given law enforcement officers greater 
powers under this bill for search and seizure. The police need to 
be able to go into a domestic violence situation with the ability 
to remove firearms while the situation is still out of control.
<P>
	However, this minister has given police far greater powers. 
Under section 117.02 police officers can enter any premises, 
except dwellings, without a warrant if they suspect someone has 
not registered their shotgun. Why does this justice minister 
believe people sign away their rights to privacy simply because 
they choose to own a gun?
<P>
	I would like to draw the attention of the House to section 112 
which says many regulations made by the governor in council do 
not have to be laid before the House. I find it very disturbing that 
further regulations can be made with respect to the Firearms Act 
or part III of the Criminal Code without coming before 
Parliament.
<P>
	A small handful of people can make regulations affecting 
millions of gun owners and there is no public accountability or 
scrutiny before going into effect. I do not believe it is right that a 
handful of bureaucrats should be able to make regulations that 
can land Canadian citizens in prison.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice believes Canadians widely support all 
of his gun control initiatives as we have heard countless times in 
the past and again today. Why does he not have the courage to 
place all orders in council related  to his Firearms Act before the 
House? Why does Bill C-68 make it so explicit that regulations 
can be passed without parliamentary approval?
<P>
	More important, why does he not separate his new Firearms 
Act pertaining to legal gun owners from his amendments to part 
III of the Criminal Code dealing with criminals? He has said in 
the House today that the reason he has drafted the Firearms Act 
is to address the concerns expressed by legitimate firearms 
owners, that they feel certain violations pertaining to them 
should not fall under the Criminal Code.
<P>
	If he is convinced this has widespread support, he should have 
the courage to separate these two issues and defend each on its 
own merits.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am frankly sick of listening to the flagrant 
misrepresentations the hon. member is indulging in with his 
efforts to mislead the Canadian public as to what is going on in 
this bill. He knows perfectly well he is doing it and he should be 
ashamed of himself.
<P>
	I refer him for the purpose of clearing up the error-perhaps 
he will admit his deliberate error-to section 92(1) of the 
proposed new bill currently before the House. Page 68:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Subject to subsection (4) and section 98, every person commits an offence 
who possesses a firearm knowing that the person is not the holder of</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) a licence under which the person may possess it; and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) a registration certificate for the firearm.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Subsection 3 says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Every person who commits an offence under subsection (1) or (2) is guilty of 
an indictable offence and liable-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	-to the 10 year imprisonment to which he referred. This is a 
person who committed an offence possessing a firearm knowing 
the person was not the holder of a licence and that the gun was 
unregistered. In other words, it is the criminal misuse of 
firearms.
<P>
	Let us go back to section 91(1) of the bill:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Subject to subsection (4) and section 98, every person commits an offence 
who possesses a firearm, unless the person is the holder of</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) a licence under which the person may possess it; and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) a registration certificate for the firearm.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Then it says in subsection (3):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Every person who commits an offence under subsection (1) or (2)</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not 
exceeding five years; or</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9747"> 9747 </A></B>
<P>
He knows that an offence punishable on summary conviction 
carries a maximum sentence of six months or a $2,000 fine. It 
also carries the possibility of an absolute or conditional 
discharge. He knows that the innocent gun owner who fails to 
register will be charged under that section, not someone who 
is committing an offence which is the section he is referring 
to when he talks about 10 years. He is misleading the Canadian 
public. He should apologize for his deceit.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased that we are able to excite the opposition across the 
way.
<P>
	What I was referring to-and I stand by my earlier 
statements-is that there are two classes of people when it 
comes to registering firearms. There are those who will be 
covered by section 91 who will for some reason not hear about it. 
I cannot imagine who they will be because everyone, before we 
get done, is going to know about this. I do not think the 
government can keep it a secret much longer. The word is 
getting out.
<P>
	For those who inadvertently do not register their firearms, the 
hon. member is quite correct, under section 91 they will either 
be facing a jail term of up to five years or an offence punishable 
by summary conviction which could be as little as a fine.
<P>
	However, section 92 pertains to people who willingly disobey 
and do not register their firearms. For this crime, the 
government has decided that 10 years imprisonment is a 
justifiable sentence. I have talked to hundreds and hundreds of 
gun owners throughout my riding.
<P>
	In January I took a tour throughout my riding which covers the 
whole northeastern corner of British Columbia. I tried to talk to 
as many people as possible. We held meetings on this. As one of 
my hon. colleagues said, I did not try to drum up the anti-gun 
control sentiment. I merely went to these meetings and asked the 
individuals how they felt about it. I did not have to ask very 
loudly because they were very forthcoming with their 
sentiments about more gun control and certainly about 
registration, not only on restricted firearms but on long guns as 
well.
<P>
	I asked them in confidence, without revealing names, how 
many of them were going to be registering their firearms. I did 
not find one individual in my travels who said he or she would 
willingly and voluntarily register his or her firearms.
<P>
	Under section 92 those individuals, if they have willingly not 
registered their firearms, will be subject to 10 years of 
imprisonment. That is how I read this, but I admit that I am not a 
lawyer, and thank goodness I am not a lawyer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to my hon. colleague give his speech and I 
have a couple of questions I would like to ask him.
<P>
	Regarding the numbers and stats, how far did you go in trying 
to find this information? Were you able to get this information 
from the Minister of Justice or his department? Also, with you 
living in a rural area how long would it take for the police to 
respond?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> We use the word ``you'' 
so often that somehow there is sort of a dialogue going on 
between the two of you while the rest of us are attentively 
waiting to get involved. I certainly do not want to be forgotten or 
left out. Please, through the Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I certainly do not want to forget 
about you either.
<P>
	Through you, Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the hon. 
member how long it would take the police force to respond to his 
home in case of an emergency if he was to dial 911 like we 
normally can in most cities?
<P>
<B>(1650 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my hon. colleague for his questions.
<P>
	As I indicated in my speech, it is simply not possible for our 
police to get there on time. If we talk to the policemen one on 
one they readily admit this.
<P>
	Statistics clearly indicate, unfortunately, that the vast 
majority of times when police are responding to a crime, by the 
time they get there the crime has already taken place. Their job 
is to try to investigate and hopefully apprehend the criminal. 
That is the job and the duty of the police in most cases. On rare 
occasions they can intervene in time to save someone from 
assault, rape or murder, but it does not happen very often.
<P>
	In my case, because I live outside of town, I suggest it would 
probably take in the neighbourhood of half an hour for the police 
to get there if someone was breaking into my home. We see 
increasing evidence across the country that citizens are 
concerned. There is increasing evidence of home invasions, 
where young hoodlums break into homes, often targeting the 
elderly. They break into these homes for no apparent reason. 
Many times the people are at home and they have no means to 
defend themselves.
<P>
	I guess the answer to my hon. friend's question is that it would 
probably take about half an hour before the police could respond 
to a break-in in my home.
<P>
	As to how much effort I have made to try to get statistics from 
the government, I referred in my speech to the fact that last June 
I asked a question during question period of the minister 
requesting the statistical evidence to prove how even the 
existing gun controls under Bill C-17, without registration, 
were working to prevent crime, to bring down the levels of 
violent crime and the criminal misuse of firearms. Nothing was 
forthcoming.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9748"> 9748 </A></B>
<P>
	On October 28, 1994 I placed a question on the Order Paper. 
I could read it but it is quite lengthy. It consists of seven 
specific questions that ask the government to provide proof to 
us, and to the Canadian people, how legal firearms pertain to 
crime in the country.
<P>
	I will refer to one of the questions, which is part (c) of 
Question No. 96. In that question I was referring to section 85 of 
the Criminal Code, which is already in force. The question is as 
follows: ``How many of those charged with this offence were the 
legally registered owner of the firearm used in the commission 
or attempted commission of the crime?'' It is a very simple, 
straightforward question asking for statistical evidence.
<P>
	What was provided after three months, not 45 days, was the 
following answer:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Uniform Crime Reporting Survey-</BLOCKQUOTE>
which comes from StatsCan:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-does not collect information which can distinguish the number of criminal 
offences which have been committed with the use of legal firearms. Prior to 1992 
the Homicide Survey collected data on registered and non-registered firearms, 
but because this information was grossly under-reported (90 per cent unknown) 
the data are no longer collected.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is the best the government could provide to me in the way 
of statistics to show that legally owned firearms have anything 
to do with curbing crime.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Raymond Bonin (Nickel Belt, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
people of northern Ontario have a culture that is unique, and part 
of our culture is hunting and fishing. My riding of Nickel Belt is 
a rural riding. I probably have more hunters and fisherpersons 
than most of the Reform members.
<P>
	I support this legislation and I have supported registration 
since we began to speak about it. As a matter of fact, during the 
campaign we had 12 debates and I made it very clear that our 
policy was to fight crime. We have presented legislation which 
will fight crime.
<P>
	Part of this bill deals with the smuggling, the importing, of 
arms. It is a very important part of this legislation.
<P>
<B>(1655 ) </B>
<P>
	The next package that will be coming is sentencing. The 
Reform Party would like to throw everybody in jail and throw 
away the key. That is not the way we want to run the country. 
Probation is a very important issue for the government. The 
Young Offenders Act is very important as is the gun bill or the 
gun and rifle registration.
<P>
	How can a government that is serious about fighting crime, a 
government that is responding to requests from Canadians from 
all over to combat crime, a government that wants credibility 
say: ``We will look at importation and smuggling. We will look 
at sentencing. We will look at probation. We will look at family 
violence. We will look at the Young Offenders Act but we will 
not talk about guns or rifles. We will not talk about this''.
<P>
	How can any politician have credibility and say, we will fight 
crime but we will not talk about the weapons that kill people?
<P>
	I intentionally prepared this speech not wanting to use 
statistics. The reason I am not using statistics is that I do not 
have to stand in the House to convince my colleagues from the 
Bloc Quebecois. Very seldom can I stand and say that I agree 
with what they are doing. They agree with this bill.
<P>
	Even though its members want to leave our country-they 
will not leave-they have the good sense, they have the wisdom 
and they care enough to want to leave behind a country that is 
safe, a country that continues to be the envy of the world. In the 
end that is why they will not leave. They will stay with us and 
feel good about having supported this legislation.
<P>
	I will not spend too much time referring to the Reform Party 
because it is very clear that its view of Canada and my view of 
Canada differs immensely. I would not spend valuable time in 
the House trying to compare the views of these individuals who 
do not care who has guns, who do not care how many guns there 
are, who do not care what kind of guns they are, who want to 
throw everybody in jail, who say: ``Hang them. Bring back 
capital punishment if you want to eliminate crime''.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Good idea.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bonin:</B> ``Good idea'', he says. Do all these things. One 
thing we never hear is ``do it with compassion''. Talk about the 
individuals. Talk about the families of criminals, because they 
are victims also. If we do not deal with people everything is so 
simple.
<P>
	When I have a discussion with a group it really scares me 
when one individual in the group has all the answers, when one 
individual for any problem that one can present has a solution. It 
is usually a very simplistic solution. I get my share of hearing 
simplistic solutions when I listen to the Reform Party address 
the House.
<P>
	The people representing Canadians on all sides of the House 
have worked for years to make Canada a safe country, a safe 
society, a place where people want to emigrate to and contribute 
to and create wealth.
<P>
	My two sons are married and I am very proud of that. They 
married last summer. The next step will be grandchildren. I look 
forward to it. I spoke so proudly a few minutes ago about 
northern Ontario and Nickel Belt but there are things that I am 
concerned about for my grandchildren.
<P>
	I have brought a newspaper article. I have them by the dozen 
in my riding. ``Former boyfriend shoots single mom then 
commits suicide in apartment''. That was in my riding and there 
are a number of them.

individuals who do not care about people. They ask whether the 
gun was registered. If it was registered, would it make it okay? 
No, that is not the issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> That is the question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bonin:</B> That is not the issue. The issue is that for a 
number of years in Ontario and elsewhere in Canada you could 
buy guns if you owned an FAC. If you did not own an FAC you 
could not buy guns. That is fine.
<P>
	What has been happening is that people are starting to think 
differently about guns. I come from a culture where there was a 
gun on the wall. It came from dad, a beautiful short .22, a 
masterpiece. We all wanted to inherit it.
<P>
	The issue is that people are tired of guns. People who do not 
use them say that it is too cumbersome and too much trouble to 
own rifles. They want to get rid of them, have them taken off 
their hands. Someone with an FAC could take it off the owner's 
hands for 20 bucks. The person with the FAC bought it, 
legitimately and legally. The result of that is there are people in 
my riding who own 250 and 300 rifles legitimately and they are 
not registered.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> So what?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bonin:</B> The so what is that come June, junior boy or girl 
graduates from high school and throws a party. There are 300 
people in that house and a fight breaks loose. Members are 
laughing. We are talking about possible victims and they are 
laughing. When the fight breaks out and the police are called 
they say: ``Give us a break. Give us a chance. Before we knock 
on that door we want to know if there are 300 guns downstairs''. 
And these members laugh.
<P>
	This legislation is just a small piece of a large puzzle. All 
members of Parliament take their jobs seriously, even my 
colleagues from the Reform Party. I know they take their jobs 
seriously. I do not think their motives are correct, but I think 
they believe in them so they are doing the best they can.
<P>
	I take this very seriously. Gun control is very serious. Guns 
are serious. However it is not the most pressing problem in my 
life. I want to deal with this, I want to pass it and I want to get it 
done.
<P>
	Then I want to move on to senior citizens who are losing their 
ability to support themselves, some of whom are lonely and 
addicts dying alone. I want to deal with people who cannot find 
jobs. I want to deal with children who go to school in the 
morning with cramps in their bellies because they do not have 
food. I want to move on. When we deal with these issues I hope 
my colleagues will  have the same vigour they have when they 
take so much pleasure in talking about guns. What a fun thing to 
talk about.
<P>
	I want to deal with family violence. I want to deal with the 
deficit. I want to deal with the debt. For Canadians to be part of a 
democracy, if the price they have to pay is to register their guns 
and their long arms then I am prepared to do it. I will be the first 
to line up to register mine.
<P>
	Reform members say that registration will not eliminate all 
serious crimes so we should not do anything about it. They do 
not worry about how many guns people have. They do not worry 
about the kinds.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	The Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police say that we 
need gun registration. The police association says: ``We support 
registration. Help us do our job''. The Reform Party says: ``They 
do not know what they are talking about''. The police officers 
want it. Their associations do too.
<P>
	The Reform Party spoke of motions that were presented by 
towns and municipalities. The FCM represents all 
municipalities in this country and it supports this. But the 
Reform Party says: ``They do not know what the heck they are 
talking about''. The list goes on. I will not name them all 
because it will take up my 20 minutes.
<P>
	Nobody knows anything about anything, only the few 
members of Parliament here on the Reform side who do not even 
agree with the majority of people in their own ridings.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> What about the 12,000 people who marched 
on Ottawa?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bonin:</B> Last summer was when the debate first started 
and I remember full well. It has been a good debate. We have 
served our constituents well. We have met with them. Many 
times my constituents were misinformed and they disagreed 
with me. I met with them anyway and I took my bumps.
<P>
	Last summer when we met for the first rally, here is what was 
distributed. It is very interesting that many of the lines that are 
used in the presentations by the Reform members are lines that 
are used in the documents of propaganda. It may be a 
coincidence.
<P>
	This is how the debate started: ``To all firearms owners, the 
federal Minister of Justice wants to ban all firearms in Canada. 
Contact your member of Parliament immediately and tell him or 
her the following: This is unacceptable. Firearm owners are 
tired of being punished for the acts of criminals. Members of 
Parliament who advocate gun control or the banning of firearms 
and ammunition banning are attempting to deceive Canadians 
into thinking that gun control will prevent or reduce crime. 
Banning of firearms and gun control will not prevent or reduce 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9750"> 9750 </A></B>
<P>
crime. Criminals do not obey  laws'', and it goes on to talk about 
polls. When I heard these things at the beginning I said no.
<P>
	The media called me and asked whether I supported the 
banning of all guns, arms and long rifles. I said that I did not 
support that as it is part of our culture. I still have guns. Every 
year my brothers phone me and ask: ``Are you coming hunting 
with us this year? You have not been hunting with us for a 
number of years. You are so involved with your politics you 
never have time to come hunting''. But I will go back. Someday 
I will retire and I will go hunting. I am a legitimate gun owner 
and I will be the first one lined up to register my guns.
<P>
	But then there was a debate. People call it a rally. There we 
were, as we usually say, two against a thousand. But it was two 
against about 250. It was amazing. The information that came 
out of that room was scary. When it was over I moved through 
the hall talking to individuals. I asked one individual: ``What is 
the problem for you?'' The answer was: ``It is going to cost a lot 
and it is not going to work''. I asked: ``If it does not cost a lot and 
it is an efficient and effective system, can you live with that?'' 
The answer was yes.
<P>
	Do you know what? One of the organizers stepped in and said: 
``Do not say that. That is what Hitler did. He registered all guns 
and then he confiscated them all''. That is the fear that was put 
into them. Some of these people were senior citizens. The reason 
they were concerned about the cost is because it is difficult for 
them to make ends meet. These organizers put that fear into their 
minds. They said: ``That is what Hitler did''. I heard Hitler's 
name so many times it was scary.
<P>
	My answer to them is that in Canada we have more boy scouts 
and girl guides than we have soldiers, so we cannot go in and 
confiscate all those guns. We have no intention of doing it and 
we do not have the capacity to do it.
<P>
<B>(1710 ) </B>
<P>
	We kept getting the calls. Getting the calls is very difficult 
because everyone agrees that we work long hours and it takes 
time. However, that is the best way to deal with the issue. I 
would rather get 100 phone calls than meet 100 people in one 
hall because I know I can give the correct information and mail 
out documents.
<P>
	Canadians are reasonable when we pull the individuals away 
from the people who try to influence their way of thinking. They 
understand common sense. They tell me that if it is cheap and 
reasonable, there is no problem and they will register them. That 
is what is happening and it will be cheap.
<P>
	We continued the debate and the fear mongering kept 
happening. Now we are here with a document. We had a 
document before Christmas which I mailed out to many people. 
Some people will never agree with anything that is said. Maybe 
they were former Reform Party candidates, I do not know, but 
they will never agree. It is impossible to discuss common sense 
with them. Now we have a document so I am calling them.
<P>
	If I have a few minutes I call them and say for example: ``You 
are a target shooter and you are the first group I went to see. I 
went to see you at the range on a Sunday morning''. Like the 
minister, I was impressed at the seriousness of these people and 
how they are careful to check their members. I remember being 
asked for a letter of reference for a person who wanted to 
become a member. They go through the whole thing. It 
impressed me. That was at the time when it was being said that 
we would confiscate all these things. The media was saying it 
and the Reform Party was saying it.
<P>
	I said to them then: ``No. The Liberal Party does not do it to 
the people; we do it for the people. We are being asked to do it 
and we will do it for Canadians''. Now I call them and I say: 
``Tell me what the problem is with the bill in the way we have 
presented it. Does it prevent you from practising your sport?'' 
One of them said: ``Well, the .32''. I said to him: ``No, in the 
legislation you will find that all guns and rifles that are used in 
legitimate competitions will be permitted''. They had no 
problem with that.
<P>
	Some will have a problem. When I go back they will have 
heard this and they will say: ``Ray, you said I would have no 
problem and I have a problem''. I agree that some people will 
have problems.
<P>
	Before talking about the collectors, just before I left home I 
saw a sad thing on TV. I cannot even begin to tell you how many 
rifles, guns, grenades, rounds of ammunition, launchers and 
machine guns that someone turned over. The discussion was 
bringing people out of the woodwork. This was in a private 
home. It scared the heck out of me. We do not know who the 
individual is. For all I know, it could be my neighbour. I do not 
think so but it is somebody's neighbour.
<P>
	I called the legitimate collectors and asked them if they had a 
problem. They do not have a problem any more. They have 
intelligently and reasonably brought their comments to the 
Minister of Justice either directly or through us and their 
concerns have been addressed. Their investment can now be 
sold to other collectors of the same nature and the estate can sell 
them. Brokers eventually will sell them outside the country, the 
illegal ones. Eventually they will be gone and I will be glad 
when they are.
<P>
	Some people said: ``Well this gun came from my 
great-grandfather''. When they told me that I brought it to the 
attention of the Minister of Justice because I had to agree with 
them. It is not a gun that will be used even for target shooting. It 
is just great-grandpa's gun or rifle. It is something that you do 
not sell, there is no value in that. Now we are going to find a way 
for people to pass them on.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9751"> 9751 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	We are left with registration, the only other problem we can 
have now. The minister has repeatedly told us today that it will 
be cheap. It may be free. I am talking about registration. It may 
be free and will be very reasonable. I am talking about people. I 
am talking about the gun owners.
<P>
	It is difficult for the Reform Party to relate that I am talking 
about individuals. It is talking about the 85 million, because it 
does not know how to associate an issue with individuals. That is 
what we are talking about here today. The cost will be very 
reasonable. It will be efficient.
<P>
	After we had our discussions, our rallies, the pro-gun groups 
were still not satisfied. I understand it was because there was so 
much wrong information going around. On their behalf I asked 
the justice minister to come to our region to talk to the people 
who are against him.
<P>
	As backbenchers they say we do not count in this House and 
cannot do a thing. We, the backbenchers, were able to ask our 
Minister of Justice to come to our communities to talk to the 
people who are working against him. Tell me another country 
where that happens. That does not even happen in the United 
States, a democracy. However, in Canada it does because we 
have a Minister of Justice who cares about people, individuals. 
He covered six ridings.
<P>
	It was suggested that we invite four individuals in each riding. 
I invited the president of the local gun club. I did not try to dodge 
the issue, did I? I invited the president of the local gun club who 
was against the legislation and probably still is. I will have to 
phone him when I get back home.
<P>
	I invited the president of the fish and game association, who is 
adamantly against it. He bought a membership in my riding and 
he was going to the annual meeting in Toronto, and we did not 
try to stop him or railroad the meeting. We welcomed him. To 
balance the load, I invited the crown attorney because they meet 
the victims.
<P>
	My fourth candidate was Dr. Bota who works in emergency at 
Sudbury General Hospital. This is the individual who meets the 
victims, sometimes teenagers who try to commit suicide with 
these long rifles lying around uncontrolled in their homes. They 
blow off half their face. He works on them for hours and hours. 
He saves them and tries to rebuild their features. These young 
people are still alive. They are discouraged individuals. If we 
can save one of them, it is worth it. One in a hundred years is 
worth it.
<P>
	Let one go. It is just an individual. That is what I am 
hearing-embarrassing. The hard core individuals said the 
figures were all wrong in Dr. Bota's study, who had just marked 
real cases, a real scientific poll.
<P>
	Canadians have asked us to do something for them. They have 
asked us to make Canada safe. The women of Sudbury who are 
walking one night a year to take back the streets that are too 
dangerous are saying do it.
<P>
	I say to the minister let us do it fast, in spite of the members 
from the Reform, because we know the people they represent 
want us to do it too.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I really do 
not know what to say about this. Most of what I heard was 
absolute nonsense.
<P>
	Not all of what he said was nonsense. He talked about saving 
one life. An individual told me of this actual account where an 
elderly couple was driving through the United States. Somehow 
they got off the turnpike and down two or three miles on to a 
narrow road. When they ran out of gas, he took a container and 
tried to get back to the highway. He got lost in the woods and 
they never saw him again but his wife had some supplies in the 
motorhome and she was able to live for two weeks. She was 
saved by a hunter who found her. He saved one life. I agree with 
my hon. colleague.
<P>
	There are both sides to this argument and we should recognize 
both sides. He has certainly taken a shot at the Reformers but he 
should take a look and save some of his energy in terms of 
discussing what we stand for and why we are against this bill. He 
should talk to his own backbench. He should perhaps clean up 
his own House if he thinks that this bill is absolutely waterproof 
and bulletproof. Start there.
<P>
	He told the story about selling his guns to a person who had a 
FAC. He has over 200 guns. He told about a party and problems 
arising and the police being called in. It sounded to me as if 
everyone was going to run for a rifle.
<P>
	I spent 14 years as a peace officer and I have never heard such 
nonsense in all my life. Even if that did happen, what difference 
would it make to the police or anyone else if those firearms were 
registered? What difference would it make? This is the essential 
question that we ask.
<P>
	For those who commit suicide, what difference does it make if 
the weapons are registered? For women who are shot every six 
days in this country, what difference does it make? This bill does 
not attack the cause, domestic disputes. It does not attack the 
cause of suicides. That is what we are saying ought to be done.
<P>
	Certainly if registration is going to reduce that, please tell us 
how because we do not know how. We have as much concern 
about these matters as anyone in the House. We have sons and 
daughters, brothers and sisters and aunts and uncles. They are 
not immune to these social problems. We have as much concern 
about that as anyone across the way.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9752"> 9752 </A></B>
<P>
	We ask very simply how will the registration of these 200 
firearms have any impact at all? Reduce the suicides. Reduce 
the domestic occurrences. How will it do that? I did not hear 
a thing. I never heard a thing that the hon. member said that 
went anywhere near answering that question.
<P>
	That is what the common sense people are asking for. I have 
told the people all across the country where I have met with them 
that I would be willing to give up my right to own the old weapon 
that I have locked away if it would reduce the criminal use of 
firearms.
<P>
	It is not going to reduce the criminal use of firearms. It is 
simply not because we know where they are getting them from. 
He has given evidence of that. The haul that the police made in 
Vancouver on all of these weapons being smuggled in is 
evidence.
<P>
	As a peace officer I know we get about 10 per cent of the 
infractions that occur. One can multiply that haul by about 90 
per cent for the day. We have some understanding of the number 
of firearms being smuggled into our country.
<P>
	If statistics and evidence can be submitted to suggest that this 
will save lives, we have not seen it yet and that is what we are 
asking for.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	Before the hon. member comments on what I have had to say, I 
would like to point out one glaring error in the statistics which 
have been given to the House in this debate. In 1977 the Auditor 
General's report indicated clearly that the reduction in violent 
crime through the use of firearms was beginning before the 
legislation came in. The Auditor General said that it was wrong 
to assume that the total responsibility for the dip which had been 
reported in the House after the 1977 legislation was brought in 
was the only cause for the decline because there were causative 
factors which came to bear prior to that.
<P>
	I leave that information for the hon. member. I have been in 
northern Ontario, by invitation, and I welcome him on the 
campaign trail during the next election if he continues his stand 
on this issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bonin:</B> Mr. Speaker, the challenge is accepted. I will be 
running in the next election and I will support this bill.
<P>
	I am here to do a job. I am here to do what is good for 
Canadians. Unlike my colleagues on the other side, everything 
that I do in politics is not measured by the number of votes that I 
will be getting. I am here to do an honest job. I swore an oath. I 
told people about the way that I do my politics and my politics 
are done for the good of the people I represent, not to be 
re-elected.
<P>
	It is fascinating that people who question every simple 
statistic presented by reputable companies, who have disputed 
every poll done by credible, reputable companies are saying 
show them statistics. We know already they will say they are all 
wrong, only their statistics apply.
<P>
	My hon. colleague who asked the question said that he was a 
police officer and that he had never heard of such hogwash. 
When I said there were 250 to 300 rifles in some of my 
constituents' basements, it is because a crime was committed in 
one of those homes, the wife was killed and suicide occurred. I 
do not make up these stories. They break us up when we think 
about them, when we think of their children and their 
neighbours. It is not hogwash. If that is the type of police 
officers in his community, I am very pleased he was not a police 
officer in northern Ontario. I will leave it at that.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> We have very little time 
before we move to the next order of business at 5:30. I will take a 
question from the hon. member for Red Deer, but wanting to 
give an equal amount of time to the hon. member for Nickel Belt 
to respond, I hope that the intervention will be brief in order that 
he may give a brief response.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will make my 
question very brief. I will not try to answer or discuss any of the 
claims which have been made. However, what I would like to 
do-and you know the facility that I am talking about in central 
Alberta, between Edmonton and Calgary-is challenge the 
minister to stand in front of the thousands of people who would 
come out to hear the facts about this whole gun control 
legislation and tell them why they should vote for it. That is an 
open challenge to the minister to come to tell the people the 
facts. There will be thousands.
<P>
	I just brought down a petition which had 5,000 signatures. 
That gives us an idea of the interest which exists. These people 
want to hear answers, they want the truth and they want the facts.
<P>
	I challenge the minister to take me up on that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bonin:</B> Mr. Speaker, the justice minister travelled to 
Alberta on at least five occasions. Possibly the hon. member 
opposite was misled when I said that, as a back-bencher, I had 
asked the minister to come and visit my riding. I think he heard 
somehow that I was the Minister of Justice. He heard wrong. Mr. 
Rock is the Minister of Justice and I am the back-bencher.
<P>
	I would like to address the first question, as I am told it was 
not answered. How will registration help reduce crime? 
Already, I have widows phoning me to say: ``I have rifles here 
and I do not know what to do. Can you help?'' Already, people in 
my riding are starting to say: ``We have rifles at home and we 
want to get rid of them.''
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="9753"> 9753 </A></B>
<P>
	People who own between 200 and 300 rifles will take them 
out, women will make sure that men get rid of rifles, and vice 
versa, and the problem will be solved.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.)</B> 
moved that Bill C-263, an act to amend the Financial 
Administration Act and other acts in consequence thereof 
(exempted crown corporations), be read the second time and 
referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, the message was loud and clear to every 
member of Parliament during the last election. Our constituents 
demanded accountability.
<P>
	All members of the House were asked by their constituents to 
come to Ottawa to work toward solutions to the debt problem 
facing our nation. I am sure all hon. members would agree that 
as elected representatives of the people we ought to work toward 
ensuring accountability in every activity of the federal 
government.
<P>
	The Canadian people want us to provide the means by which 
we can all come to trust the government. When it concerns 
government programs my constituents, and I am sure many MPs 
feel the same way, are very inquisitive. They are like 
investigative reporters. They use the five <I>w</I>s: who, what, when, 
where, why and all the time when it comes to government 
programs they ask how much it is going to cost. The people of 
Canada want to know. They want to be proud of the activities 
and the performance of the federal government.
<P>
	Bill C-263 provides all members of the House with an 
opportunity to say to their constituents that at least in some 
small way we have come together to work toward ensuring that 
the federal government is accountable to the Canadian taxpayer.
<P>
	I feel strongly that members from all sides of the House 
should rally in support of Bill C-263 so that we can honestly say 
we have tried to respond to the wishes of the people who sent us 
here.
<P>
	Bill C-263 is not all encompassing, dictatorial, unable to 
change or restrictive. Bill C-263 is flexible. I have tried to 
provide an occasion for all corners of the House to work together 
and at the end of the day five crown corporations will be more 
accountable. We will all feel as though we have done a good 
day's work and proudly report to our constituents what we have 
done. Our constituents in turn will take note of our work and 
they  will feel we are serious about doing positive and 
constructive work.
<P>
	As members know, in the 1993-94 fiscal year crown 
corporations incurred losses of $57.2 million. Their net 
borrowing from the Government of Canada amounted to $14.2 
billion and they received $4.6 billion from the government 
through budgetary appropriations.
<P>
	We say $1 billion so often it just floats by. How much is $1 
billion? It is such a massive amount. If you earned $1 per second 
you would be a millionaire in 11 days; but it would take you 33 
years to become a billionaire.
<P>
	When we are talking of billions of dollars it is very important 
that we do not just flash by it very quickly and not understand 
how large a sum of money it is. Our task is to ensure for our 
constituents that every government department and agency be 
accountable for every tax dollar spent. I dare say that everyone 
in the House wants to be able to say to the people at home that we 
are responsible to the people who ultimately pay the bills, the 
Canadian taxpayer.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	On those occasions when constituents ask us why it is that 
certain public corporations do not report their financial status, 
members have no satisfactory response. The average Canadian 
wants to know about all federal agencies and departments.
<P>
	When constituents hear about an activity financed by the 
government and they are not allowed to know about the finances 
associated with that activity, they become quite interested. They 
are concerned that maybe there is something to hide.
<P>
	The Auditor General has a key role to play in this regard. In 
many cases, which I will refer to in a moment, the Auditor 
General has not only made available publicly the exact facts and 
figures concerning the activities and performance of the federal 
government, but the Auditor General has been able to improve 
such activities and performance levels by dissecting and 
evaluating agencies and departments.
<P>
	There is no shame involved in the work performed by the 
Auditor General. The auditor's detection of poor performance 
and recommendations is seen by Canadians as routine and 
expected. Canadian firms, large and small, perform audits on 
their own activities and performance. Often the audits show that 
they are right on track with their objectives. And sometimes 
they must swallow tough medicine to cure ailments detected in 
their business audits. This is a fact of life. Canadians expect 
their government to follow good business practices as well.
<P>
	No one can deny the performance of the Auditor General in 
recent history. Progress has been made. The Auditor General has 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9754"> 9754 </A></B>
<P>
the power to follow up on recommendations. The result has been 
that in many cases Canadians are realizing better value for their 
tax dollars because of the efforts of the Office of the Auditor 
General.
<P>
	In May 1994 the members of this place took a step closer to 
greater accountability by freeing the Office of the Auditor 
General to report on matters which the auditor deems pressing. 
Members of the House have already moved in the direction of 
Bill C-263, by endowing the Auditor General with a measure of 
discretion. In fact, there was a great deal of agreement on all 
sides of the House. We saw this as a good thing, a chance that 
would enhance the Auditor General's ability to do the job 
expected of the office.
<P>
	Canadians want their watchdog to have a long enough leash. 
We all wanted to further empower the watchdog last spring, and 
I am sure I speak for all of us when I say we were proud to do so.
<P>
	With reforms instituted in 1984, most crown corporations 
have operated within the accountability framework established 
under part X of the Financial Administration Act. Part X of the 
act requires each crown corporation to do three things:
<P>
	There must be an annual report. The annual report in addition 
to its financial statements in the auditor's report also presents 
information on how well the objectives of corporations were 
achieved during the reporting period. Crown corporations must 
submit a corporate plan. They must submit budget summaries 
for tabling in Parliament.
<P>
	In my view, these requirements are basic and simple. They are 
not unreasonable. Yet we have a system where all crown 
corporations are not required to do these basics.
<P>
	Canadians expect that their tax dollars are spent within this 
framework of accountability. Again, when Canadians hear of 
moneys being spent by the government without the above 
criteria, they become suspicious. There is good reason for 
Canadians to feel this way. The Financial Administration Act 
could be easily made applicable to the crown corporations listed 
in Bill C-263.
<P>
	There are 49 crown corporations, seven of which are 
exempted from the Financial Administration Act. They are the 
Bank of Canada, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the 
Canada Council, the Canadian Film Development Corporation, 
also known as Telefilm Canada, the Canadian Wheat Board, the 
International Development Research Centre and the National 
Arts Centre. Bill C-263 would move these crown corporations 
under the supervision of the Auditor General with the exception 
of the Bank of Canada and the CBC.
<P>
	With respect to the Bank of Canada, central banking 
independence is critical for the proper conduct of monetary 
policy. Monetary policy is ultimately the responsibility of the 
federal government, specifically the Minister of Finance and the 
executive of the Bank of Canada. There are informal avenues of 
accountability to which the governor of the Bank of Canada is 
subject.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	With respect to the CBC, provisions of the Financial 
Administration Act were incorporated into the Broadcasting Act 
in 1991. In short, the CBC is already subject to the 
accountability requirements of Bill C-263 and the Financial 
Administration Act.
<P>
	This latter point is important for all members to note. The 
CBC is the recipient of about 70 per cent of government funding 
provided to exempt crown corporations. This means that Bill 
C-263 is finishing the job already accomplished by Parliament. 
Since 1991, the CBC has adjusted to the accountability 
requirements of part X of the Financial Administration Act.
<P>
	Hon. members may agree with my observation that the CBC, 
more than any other exempt crown corporation in Bill C-263, 
was most insistent about the idea of the critical importance of an 
arm's length relationship to government. Yet the CBC has not 
had any of the difficulties that it anticipated in adapting to these 
accountability requirements. The CBC has been operating 
within this framework for the past four years.
<P>
	I can remind my colleagues that the Auditor General already 
performs financial audits on the five crown corporations in this 
bill. These audits do not permit the Auditor General to comment 
on the appropriateness of the activities of the five nor is the 
auditor able to comment on the extent to which each fulfils its 
mandate. As it stands now these are not value for money audits.
<P>
	Value for money audits are done every five years. They are 
different from the annual audits in that they comment on 
corporate management, goals and objectives. I think it is fair to 
say that the boards of the exempt corporations should welcome 
the value for money audits. It is not unthinkable that the board 
members would look on the audits as helpful to their work as 
well as a positive accountability measure.
<P>
	In the course of my work and research concerning this bill, I 
have stumbled across some very interesting things. For 
example, I have a letter from Tommy Banks, a member of the 
Canada Council audit and evaluation committee which he wrote 
to me shortly after I began working on my bill.
<P>
	In his letter, Mr. Banks heralds the benefits of special 
examinations which the Auditor General has been invited to do 
for the Canada Council every five years since 1986. Mr. Banks 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9755"> 9755 </A></B>
<P>
states that ``the glaring scrutiny by the Auditor General-is 
contemplated as an ongoing process''. Yet there is no 
formalization of this process. The problem now is that there is 
no assurance that these value for money audits will be done in a 
set time frame  with the resulting benefits of regular periodic 
audits. Clearly a legislated requirement is needed.
<P>
	It has been 10 years since the accountability framework for 
crown corporations was established. Exempt corporations have 
had a decade to review and analyse the effects of the Financial 
Administration Act on the independence of non-exempt crown 
corporations. By now it is highly likely that crown corporations 
exempted from the act would conclude that the Financial 
Administration Act poses no real threat to them. The CBC is an 
illustration of this. Provisions of the Financial Administration 
Act were incorporated into the amended Broadcasting Act of 
1991.
<P>
	The exemption of the seven crown corporations means that 
they have not been subject to certain provisions that support 
good management and accountability. As such, their exemption 
is hard to justify in these times of fiscal restraint. These exempt 
crown corporations are more than two times more dependent on 
budgetary appropriations from government as a percentage of 
total assets than non-exempt corporations and more than four 
times more dependent on a per employee basis.
<P>
	I feel it is reasonable to require the five crown corporations to 
prepare a business plan so that annual reports can allow 
Canadians to monitor and gauge the performance of the five. 
There have been some cases where a crown corporation's annual 
report objectives differ from its business plan objectives.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	An example of that is in 1991-92, Telefilm Canada spent 90 
per cent of its film funds on projects from Toronto and Montreal. 
One film of the 24 supported by Telefilm came from western 
Canada. Moreover, Telefilm spent 41 per cent of its budget that 
year on French language film and only 2 per cent on the English 
language film from the west. We know Telefilm has stringent 
linguistic targets. Having said that, I think hon. members would 
agree that the objectives of Telefilm were not fulfilled in the 
business it conducted in 1991-92.
<P>
	Even though there are provisions for exempt crown 
corporations to invite the Auditor General to conduct a special 
examination, the audit itself is only released to their board of 
directors, not to this place. The problem with making 
administrative as opposed to legislative arrangements for 
voluntary audits is that with a change in administration or 
administrative policy, these agreements may fall apart. 
Providing the corporations with an option of inviting the 
Auditor General in to do an audit is just not good enough.
<P>
	For example, because the National Arts Centre remains one of 
Canada's most secretive crown corporations, in 1990 the House 
of Commons communications and culture committee 
recommended that the Auditor General perform a special 
examination of the centre. The board's directors jumped at the 
chance. Yet the process was fudged. The board had  problems 
releasing the report, even though it initially promised to publish 
the report.
<P>
	Some 300 days after receiving the report, which the board 
originally denied receiving, it finally responded. The Ottawa 
<I>Citizen</I> called the response hilarious. The Auditor General had 
portrayed the arts centre as an institution that fails to properly 
define its objectives, plot its future, monitor its expenses and 
communicate with its board.
<P>
	In this regard, we can clearly see that inviting the Auditor 
General to do a special examination or a value for money audit is 
insufficient. If the Auditor General's office was involved with 
the corporation on a regular basis, business plan objectives 
would not deviate from objectives stated in the annual reports.
<P>
	The benefits are worth the cost of the Auditor General's audit. 
Reporting is not onerous. It is good management. Value for 
money audits pay their way.
<P>
	Another example: In 1992 the Auditor General reported that 
tax arrangements for foreign affiliates were costing Canadians 
hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenue. Following the 
report, amendments were made to the rules relating to how 
foreign affiliates were taxed. This ensured that foreign affiliates 
paid their fair share.
<P>
	In 1993 another special examination identified overpayments 
to CPP and old age security, which were between $120 million 
and $220 million per year. Following the report, an action plan 
was tabled with the public accounts committee to stop the 
problem. The government was able to act and produce an action 
plan.
<P>
	You may be wondering if the other 42 non-exempt crown 
corporations included in the Financial Administration Act have 
increased their accountability since the introduction in 1984 of 
the act. In 1993 the Auditor General reported that management 
of crown corporations has improved because of the 
requirements for planning, strategy, and cost systems, in short, 
good management practices.
<P>
	I think we can all agree that in times of restraint those who 
spend taxpayers' dollars must be more than ever aware that they 
are answerable for how they spend those dollars. Since part X of 
the Financial Administration Act has been so effective for other 
crown corporations, it seems reasonable that the crown 
corporations outlined in Bill C-263 are in line as well.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to quote a statement from the director 
of the National Arts Centre Corporation board, who is 
recognizing that improvements were needed in the corporation's 
financial management. The director said: ``Given the limited 
resources which management has at its disposal, tackling the 
institutional mentality rooted in two decades of lack of 
accountability has been a monumental task''.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is my pleasure to speak today to the bill presented by 
the hon. member for Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt.
<P>
	The bill has as its basic purpose the removal of exemption 
from application of divisions I to IV of part X of the Financial 
Administration Act for five crown corporations. These are the 
Canada Council, the Canadian Film Development Corporation, 
the Canadian Wheat Board, the International Development 
Research Centre, and the National Arts Centre Corporation.
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	These corporations, together with the Bank of Canada and the 
CBC, are exempt under section 85 of the Financial 
Administration Act. All other crown corporations, which 
number about 41, are subject to part X of the FAA.
<P>
	If we study part X, we see that the goal was to provide a more 
or less standard accountability and control system for all our 
crown corporations.
<P>
	The role of Parliament was to hold the government and the 
crown corporation accountable through the appropriate minister 
for the public funds allocated to the corporation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The government's role was seen to be to provide 
co-ordination, direction, as necessary, and control with the 
objective of protecting the public's investment and ensuring that 
public policy objectives are met.
<P>
	Part X of the Financial Administration Act represents a 
comprehensive accountability system allowing crown 
corporations to adopt private sector management systems and 
practices, while ensuring that government and Parliament 
exercise certain key approvals.
<P>
	For example, corporate plans of crown corporations subject to 
part X require approval annually by the governor in council. As 
well, the corporation's annual report must be tabled in 
Parliament. Part X requires that it contain information on how 
well the corporation has met its objectives.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	At the end of each calendar year, the President of the Treasury 
Board must submit to Parliament his annual report on crown 
corporations and other corporate interests of Canada. This 
report contains a section which is audited by the Auditor 
General and which shows to what extent activity summaries and 
annual reports are submitted in accordance with established 
criteria for every minister responsible.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It can be seen from this one example how part X is designed to 
ensure that not only government but Parliament as well is 
viewed as integral to a sound accountability and control system 
for crown corporations.
<P>
	As previously indicated, certain crown corporations are 
exempt from this part X system. The grounds for exemption, 
while not found in any written or formal criteria or regulation, 
reflect some of the special sensitivities in the relationship 
between the government and these particular corporations.
<P>
	For example, the perception of arm's length freedom from 
government direction and decision which involve awarding 
grants to juried recipients is viewed as fundamental for the 
Canada Council. The government should not be seen to be 
dictating artistic merit as a matter of the politics of the day. 
Similarly, the mandated freedom for the CBC in areas of 
programming and journalistic independence led to the provision 
that this corporation also be exempted from part X.
<P>
	The remaining exempts, five of which are named in the bill 
before us today, are subject to the elements of accountability 
found in their own enabling legislation. For example, all are 
required to provide annual reports for tabling and for those 
which are dependent upon government subsidization, they are 
subject to the annual process and procedures of parliamentary 
supply.
<P>
	Bill C-263 contains two additional elements of some concern 
to me.
<P>
	The first of these is the provision that employees of the 
National Arts Centre, the Canada Council and the International 
Development Research Centre become members of the public 
service. This is moving in the wrong direction.
<P>
	Crown corporation employees are, for the most part, not 
public servants. In fact, the legislation creating the four 
museums crown corporations specifically states that museum 
employees are not public servants. We do not want to increase 
the size of the public service for no good reason.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	The second element deals with the concept of agent of the 
crown status being introduced for these three corporations by 
the bill. This is a complex legally challenging subject that 
requires some thought.
<P>
	I believe the International Development Research Centre was 
specifically made a non-agent for compelling reasons relating 
to its mandate and the freedom to choose fields of research of 
international significance. Agencies should not be arbitrarily 
invoked under the assumption that it removes autonomy.
<P>
	Clearly, the experience we have had over the last 10 years 
indicates that generally there may be merit in bringing other 
exempts under a modified form of accountability framework 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9757"> 9757 </A></B>
<P>
similar to the regime that is  now in place for the CBC which is 
different from some of the others. I can and do support that 
general principle.
<P>
	Bill C-263 however, while moving these corporations in the 
right direction, contains certain fatal flaws which I suggest 
would preclude my support for it today. I urge hon. members not 
to support it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The most serious flaw is that the bill does not recognize the 
need for a thorough review of the mandates given to these 
corporations in order to develop an appropriate accountability 
framework, without the appearance of unjustified political 
meddling in sectors where a certain level of independence from 
the government is in the public interest.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	For example, part X contains sections which provide for a 
directive power for government to override decisions taken by 
crown corporation boards of directors. This could be construed 
as a fundamental change in the traditional approach of 
successive governments allowing cultural crown corporations 
the freedom to engage in decision making affecting artistic 
merit or research matters. This issue was thoroughly reviewed in 
the debates and committee hearings on Bill C-24 back in May 
and June of 1984.
<P>
	Looking forward, I see merit in exploring better ways to 
ensure accountability for the crown corporations named in this 
bill. Subject areas such as auditing, corporate governance, 
financial management and control, corporate planning, 
reporting to Parliament and borrowing plans have been very 
thoroughly addressed in part X of the Financial Administration 
Act and have resulted in a system which the Auditor General 
noted is working well. The hon. member acknowledged that in 
his speech.
<P>
	This system can probably be further modified to meet the 
special circumstances of the majority of exempt crown 
corporations. Whether this is best achieved through a series of 
initiatives amending existing enabling statutes for each of the 
named corporations in question requires further study.
<P>
	I am informed that discussions have already occurred with 
some of these corporations as to the best way of achieving this.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I have no doubt that additional efforts will be invested to 
improve the accountability system while giving exempt crown 
corporations the appropriate level of freedom that Canadians 
will continue to perceive as being in the public interest.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As this bill stands I cannot support it and do not recommend it 
to the House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard BÃ©lisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
purpose of Bill C-263 is to amend the Financial Administration 
Act and other acts in consequence thereof.
<P>
	As you know, these five crown corporations are now 
exempted from this act. The Financial Administration Act is a 
very broad law which deals among other things with the running 
of Treasury Board, public funds, public spending and the public 
debt.
<P>
	This act was amended 58 times between 1985 and 1994, an 
average of once every two months. I will not go as far as saying 
that there has been a lack of consistency in the Financial 
Administration Act in the last decade, but the least that can be 
said is that a flood of legislative amendments were adopted to 
adjust to a so-called changing environment.
<P>
	There are currently almost 50 crown corporations in Canada. 
The overall budget of these corporations is close to $5 billion 
and together they employ 115,000 people. Their economic 
impact is therefore considerable.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	Although relatively autonomous with regard to their 
management, these crown corporations are ultimately 
accountable to Parliament through the minister responsible. 
These crown corporations' management framework, established 
in 1984, comes under Part X of the Financial Administration 
Act.
<P>
	These crown corporations are accountable; they must submit 
an annual corporate plan to the minister responsible. They must 
also submit an operating budget approved by Treasury Board. 
They must prepare an annual report, that is, the required 
financial statements and statistical data showing to what extent 
their goals have been achieved.
<P>
	Finally, each corporation must conduct internal audits. The 
corporation's auditor also carries out a special, more 
comprehensive audit every five years. However, seven 
corporations are exempted from these legal requirements.
<P>
	Bill C-263 maintains the exemption granted to the Bank of 
Canada, which keeps its independence at the management level 
and may, for example, pursue its monetary policy whatever the 
government in power.
<P>
	Bill C-263 also maintains the exemption already enjoyed by 
the CBC. In any case, the corporation is already subject to the 
accountability principle-internal and special audits, annual 
report and corporate plan-through the Canadian Broadcasting 
Corporation Act which reflects the provisions of Part X of the 
Financial Administration Act.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9758"> 9758 </A></B>
<P>
	The ultimate purpose of Bill C-263 is to remove the 
exemption from accountability for the following five 
corporations: the International Development Research Centre, 
the Canadian Wheat Board and three other corporations 
involved in the arts: the Canada Council, the National Arts 
Centre Corporation and the Canadian Film Development 
Corporation.
<P>
	If this bill were adopted by the House, all five corporations 
would be subject to the provisions of the act. They are exempted 
mainly because of the specific nature of their relationship with 
the government. Parliament has, until now, preferred to 
maintain the arm's length relationship of these corporations.
<P>
	In 1991, the auditor general commented that many exempt 
corporations had voluntarily conformed with the provisions of 
the act. Half of the exempt corporations had asked for a value for 
money audit. Many exempt corporations had also established 
internal audit functions and audit committees within their 
organizations.
<P>
	These corporations can be allowed greater flexibility in terms 
of management control. Extending certain provisions of Part X 
of the Financial Administration Act to the five corporations 
mentioned in the bill would not necessarily mean eliminating 
arm's length position in terms of administrative control.
<P>
	According to the auditor general, there are a number of ways 
in which the rules can be standardized to make exempt 
corporations more accountable. One way would be to 
incorporate the provisions of Part X of the act in the enabling 
legislation for each exempted corporation, as in the case of the 
CBC, which remains accountable to Parliament but maintains a 
large measure of management autonomy, which means it is not 
subject to management audits by the government.
<P>
	One could also add these corporations to the schedule to the 
Financial Administration Act while exempting them from 
certain provisions of the act. Many exempt corporations already 
conform voluntarily to many of the provisions in the act, so that 
any concerns that overly vigorous management audits would be 
detrimental to the mandate of these five corporations would 
seem to be exaggerated.
<P>
	In any case, we will vote against Bill C-263 because it goes 
too far in terms of controlling the administration of these 
corporations. It would subject the five crown corporations 
identified to close supervision involving both their 
accountability and their control over their management.
<P>
	We would prefer a more flexible approach, such as the one 
advocated by the auditor general, who proposes incorporating 
the requirements selected by the legislator in the enabling act of 
each of the five exempted corporations, as is already the case for 
the CBC, as we have mentioned.
<P>
	Each corporation will have to be looked at individually, after 
analysis, to discover the best way to make it accountable and 
establish a level of control in keeping with its particular goals 
and mission. We will therefore vote against this bill, because it 
gives the same status to all government corporations, except the 
CBC and the Bank of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	We favour ensuring accountability by making these 
corporations responsible for their operations rather than by 
controlling them, as Bill C-263 would have it. We want to 
increase their accountability, make them accountable to 
Parliament and thus permit a better assessment of their 
performance. We are opposed to unbounded control over the 
management of these corporations. Three of them contribute to 
the development of the arts, the fourth, as we said earlier, 
contributes to agricultural development, and the fifth 
contributes to international development.
<P>
	We can provide a proper framework for their operations and, 
at the same time, show some flexibility in monitoring their 
management practices; this can also enhance the performance of 
these corporations and their efficiency.
<P>
	We are also opposed to the bill as presented because it gives 
the minister responsible the right to interfere in the mandate of 
cultural agencies. Such agencies must be accorded greater 
flexibility in their activities.
<P>
	Bill C-263 does not resolve the issue of the accountability of 
crown corporations since, as the auditor general himself has 
said, several non-exempt corporations do not comply with this 
principle of accountability, even if they are subject to it. They do 
not respect all of the accountability requirements prescribed by 
law.
<P>
	This bill increases only slightly the accountability required of 
crown corporations. It seems to us that other means could be 
used to hold these crown corporations accountable for their 
results to a greater extent. This does not mean passing 
legislation. The auditor general's input can be extremely helpful 
in evaluating their results. Likewise, the fact senior executives 
of such corporations must appear before standing House 
committees, such as the public accounts committee, to account 
for their management, serves as a powerful incentive to produce 
the required reports and present documents of higher quality.
<P>
	We favour this type of approach since it seems more effective 
to us than new legislation.

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9759"> 9759 </A></B>
<P>
against the motion, I am going to look to the same party as the 
mover and possibly he will speak to the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have listened with some interest to the member 
opposite representing the government and the member 
representing the Bloc who just finished speaking to the bill.
<P>
	The intent of the private member's bill is to bring more 
financial accountability to crown corporations. These are not 
public corporations; they are crown corporations. It is kind of a 
hybrid. It is not as though they are using their own money; they 
are using our money.
<P>
	How is it that a member of Parliament representing the people 
of the country, especially the member for Kingston and the 
Islands, the parliamentary secretary to the government House 
leader, could possibly say that he cannot support the bill as it is 
written? What would it take for the government to support the 
bill?
<P>
	Perhaps the answer is not to support the bill. Perhaps it would 
be to privatize it. Mr. Speaker, if this were your money or my 
money, or the money involved was not public money but 
personal money out of the pockets of Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer, 
would we be looking at our responsibilities as members of 
Parliament a bit differently?
<P>
	A crown corporation has the benefit of being supported by 
public funds. Yet it does not have the downside of having to 
worry about whether it is going to get funds to manage its daily 
affairs from the product of its work. When things go wrong in 
these crown corporations, when they are not efficiently 
managed, when they do not have a business plan, do they go to 
their shareholders who are individuals that put up the money? 
No. They come running to the Government of Canada with their 
hands out and say: ``Top it up''.
<P>
	The problem is that our country is going into the hole at the 
rate of $110 million a day. What do we have to do to get it to sink 
into the heads of members opposite that they should start by 
doing the little things right and eventually, if they do enough of 
the little things right, the big things will turn out right? A little 
thing is to support the bill which calls for more accountability in 
a mere five crown corporations.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	In order to get some unanimity in the House, the mover of the 
bill deliberately left out some of the more contentious crown 
corporations such as the CBC. If we in the House were to reduce 
the budget of the CBC by about 50 per cent tomorrow, which 
would mean that we could spend lots of money on cancer 
research, lots of money on AIDS research or not borrow money 
to put more of our children to work, I guarantee it would focus 
the attention of the CBC on what it really should be doing, what 
we can afford and what we cannot afford. However the mover of 
the motion did not include that because it is a very contentious 
issue.
<P>
	What do we have here? We have the Canada Council, the 
Canadian Film Development Corporation, the International 
Development Research Centre, the Canadian Wheat Board and 
the National Arts Centre.
<P>
	What, the National Arts Centre? How did the National Arts 
Centre creep into this? How on earth did that become a crown 
corporation? Could it be that it is located in Ottawa and it is one 
more thing for the people of Canada to subsidize?
<P>
	It would be an interesting exercise to go to the rest of the arts 
centres in the country to find out whether they are crown 
corporations and whether they have their arms in the pockets of 
Canadians from coast to coast. Somehow I doubt it.
<P>
	What is it about being in Ottawa that gives people the thought 
that money is something that sort of grows on trees or that if it is 
public money it is not accountable for?
<P>
	Anybody who has been in business knows that the discipline 
of an audit is not a negative thing or a bad thing. The discipline 
of an audit will make any company work better. That is why 
these crown corporations should be saying: ``Wait a minute. We 
want to be overseen. We recognize the fact that we are dealing 
with public money''.
<P>
	Why should they not want to be involved? Is it because they 
are not efficient? Is it because they can run like little fiefdoms 
and do whatever they want any way they want to? Is it because 
the Canadian Wheat Board is not perhaps so much a wheat board 
but a co-op? Is it because the Canada Council is a collection of 
people who are self-interested, get public money and dole 
public money out to whoever they think should have it?
<P>
	I am not suggesting for a moment that the Canada Council and 
the people involved in the Canada Council are doing so 
somehow maliciously. I am sure they are doing everything that 
they are doing with their hearts in the right place. However it is 
not their money; it is our money. Why should we not oversee 
every nickel they spend?
<P>
	The Canadian Film Development Corporation has been the 
subject of some debate in the House in past months. There are 
people who think it is doing a good job and there are people who 
think it is not doing such a good job. There are people who say 
we have to support it because it is Canadian culture. I think most 
of us like to go to a movie every once in a while to see a movie 
that speaks about us, to see something familiar. There might be 
some granting to the Canadian Film Corporation that pays off; it 
might even make some money from time to time.
<P>

<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	It would be interesting if they used their own money and had 
to compete in a world market on the quality of their product and 
rather than saying that we have this domestic market which has 
the tariff wall surrounding it, we are going to make movies that 
everybody in the world is going to clamour to see because of the 
quality of the story, the quality of the acting, the quality of the 
distribution?
<P>
	That is what we should be looking for in our Canada. We can 
compete with the best in the world in anything, in business, in 
arts, in film development. If we are going to have crown 
corporations that have the purview of doling out public money 
for private purposes, certainly to oversee over these crown 
corporations is common sense.
<P>
	I would like to conclude my few moments of discussing this 
bill, because it is a votable bill, by once again appealing to my 
hon. colleagues to reconsider the initial response not to support 
this bill.
<P>
	The hon. member for Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt 
brought this bill to the House with the express intent of ensuring 
that it was innocuous enough that it could find support on the 
Liberal benches and with the Bloc as well as a testimony to the 
fact that on some things, albeit a minor start, the members of 
Parliament in this House assembled can come together for the 
right reasons and do the right thing.
<P>
	It is a tragedy that every time a member gets up to speak, to 
move a motion or to do something in this House, it is always 
done on an adversarial position. It need not be that way. 
Common sense is common sense, whether it originates on the 
Liberal benches, on the Bloc benches or on the Reform benches.
<P>
	When we have an opportunity in this House to come together 
in unity to do the right thing for the right reasons which could 
have the effect of using taxpayers' money more efficiently, we 
should seize the opportunity, seize the moment and do the right 
thing for the right reasons.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
the opportunity to speak for a few minutes on this bill that is 
before the House, Bill C-263.
<P>
	I want to assure the member who just concluded his remarks 
that my remarks are not made in an adversarial way but just to 
simply point out how this bill would address the Canadian 
Wheat Board. I know it is a crown corporation that is of some 
interest to the Reform Party and it is of some interest to all of us 
in this House, particularly those who are involved in the 
agri-food industry.
<P>
	I want to point out in the next few minutes why this bill is 
absolutely unnecessary and actually would be doing much of 
what the Reform Party has faulted governments in Canada for in 
the past, repeating something that is already done and doing 
things twice and spending money that is not necessarily spent.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board was established in 1935 as a 
marketing agency for western grain farmers. At the time farmers 
in western Canada wanted a system that would control price 
fluctuations, distribute delivery opportunity equitably and move 
the largest volumes of grain at the best possible prices.
<P>
	That mandate is still the same. The Canadian Wheat Board 
remains the same now as it was years ago in the mandate that it 
has, to earn farmers the best possible returns for their wheat and 
barley. That is exactly what the board has been doing for that 60 
years. It has done an excellent job of selling Canadian grain at 
the best possible prices and then returning as much money as 
possible to the users of that board, those users being western 
Canadian farmers.
<P>
	Although the Canadian board is a crown corporation, its 
operations are financed by 130,000 grain farmers in Manitoba, 
Saskatchewan, Alberta and the grain growing areas of British 
Columbia.
<P>
<B>(1820 ) </B>
<P>
	This in itself makes this crown corporation unlike many of the 
others. Some crown corporations including the Canadian Wheat 
Board are exempt from the application of the Financial 
Administration Act. It is one of the member for 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt listed this afternoon as 
being exempt.
<P>
	With this bill this exemption would be removed and the crown 
corporations affected by the bill would become subject to a 
different reporting system with different requirements.
<P>
	For example, under this bill the Canadian Wheat Board would 
be required to submit a corporate plan to the Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food for approval by the governor in 
council. The board would also have to submit an operating and 
capital budget annually for approval by Treasury Board. This 
report would then be included in a review by the parliamentary 
committee.
<P>
	Finally, the wheat board would be subject to an audit by an 
outside auditor and possibly the Auditor General of Canada.
<P>
	There is no doubt in my mind that the objectives of the bill are 
well intended. I can assure everyone that the Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food and the government are in favour of 
ensuring that the accountability is there. That accountability at 
the present time is to farmers, the government and to taxpayers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9761"> 9761 </A></B>
<P>
	It is essential to remember that the board's operations are 
funded by farmers, not by government. Nor does the board 
operate with a capital base funded by the government. Although 
some accountability to the government is appropriate the 
board's first responsibility is to western Canadian wheat and 
barley producers.
<P>
	I should also emphasize that the board is already accountable 
to the government through a variety of provisions in the 
Canadian Wheat Board Act, a separate act. The safeguards 
established under that act are virtually the same as those under 
the Financial Administration Act. Again, why repeat it?
<P>
	Even though they are there they are slightly modified to take 
into account the unique nature of the wheat board's business. 
For example, the board is required to file an annual report with 
the minister by March 31. This annual report is tabled in 
Parliament.
<P>
	The wheat board act requires the board to have an external 
auditing firm conduct an audit each year and to keep proper 
books. The Canadian Wheat Board Act also grants borrowing 
powers subject to the approval of the Minister of Finance. In all 
of these examples the provisions of the Financial 
Administration Act are virtually identical.
<P>
	I could go on but the point is Bill C-263 which has been put 
before us today is not the way to enhance the accountability of 
the Canadian Wheat Board. The government's main concern for 
accountability and the reporting process that ensures it should 
stem from a need to be aware of possible government 
expenditures.
<P>
	There will only be government expenditures if there is a 
deficit in the pool accounts. A deficit in the pool accounts will 
only occur if the Canadian Wheat Board's initial payments to 
farmers are set at or raised to levels that exceed the ultimate 
levels from the sales of wheat and barley. Since the government 
must approve the level of the initial payments it already has an 
effective method of accountability in this area as well.
<P>
	Another serious concern with the bill is that the nature of the 
marketing activities of the Canadian Wheat Board requires 
extreme confidentiality. The reporting relationship between the 
Canadian Wheat Board and the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food is created under the Canadian Wheat Board Act and 
it is appropriate, given the need to ensure that confidentiality.
<P>
	We are also concerned about timing. The minister has already 
announced his intention to begin a process that will rigorously 
examine all of the facts and issues relating to western grain 
marketing and the Canadian Wheat Board. It is no secret that 
opinions on this and these issues are sharply divided on the 
subjects. There have been meetings, rallies and demonstrations 
on both sides of these issues.
<P>
	Before the government makes any decision on the future of 
the board, farmers have a right to carefully consider the 
situation and together they must decide what represents the best 
balanced solution for their industry. Bill C-263 represents a 
very important decision. Its impacts on the Canadian Wheat 
Board and on western grain growers are potentially far reaching.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	It is our duty to act fairly through a transparent forum and to 
consult farmers before we make any major decision on the 
future of the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	We know what the majority of farmers want. When we are 
convinced that the procedure to get their views has been fair, 
impartial and equitable and does represent what the majority 
wants, then and only then will this government be ready to 
approve changes to existing legislation.
<P>
	Until then I urge members of this House to respond to Bill 
C-263 with a clear and strong message that we are not yet ready 
to make major changes without understanding the consequences 
and most important without consulting with its users, the prairie 
farmers.
<P>
	There is still a lot of work to be done and there is still much 
consultation to go through before we can come to a definitive 
decision on the future of the wheat board.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would ask the members of this House not to 
support Bill C-263 as it relates to the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, basically what 
I want to talk about in Bill C-263 is the openness, accountability 
and transparency that I think these agencies should have. I want 
to talk specifically about IDRC. That organization is often 
confused with CIDA. It is wrong that this should happen.
<P>
	Throughout many of the discussions I have been involved in 
we have heard what the people of Canada are saying about 
CIDA. They are saying that there is inefficiency, that they want 
accountability there. However, they quite often mix IDRC into 
that same ball of wax. I think that is rather unfair.
<P>
	This bill asks for accountability. I think that will do nothing 
but benefit that organization because the Canadian public wants 
to know it is getting good value for its dollar.
<P>
	Under the current system IDRC is not getting audited the 
same way as other government institutions. It does not follow all 
of the provisions of the Financial Administration Act. 
Therefore, Canadians have a hard time really knowing whether 
they are getting value for money.
<P>
	In a time of serious spending cuts and serious budgetary 
constraints, we can make an awfully good case for getting some 
kind of regular, accountable audit procedure. In terms of this, I 
know this year IDRC has done a budget. I have certainly talked 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9762"> 9762 </A></B>
<P>
to the organization.  I would say it is a very well run 
organization. I know a member across who would agree with me 
on that.
<P>
	If there were support for this bill we would have to separate 
IDRC from CIDA. Going through most of my notes, in many 
cases the people in IDRC I have talked to would totally agree 
with this. In private conversation they would say that. We have 
an agency, a crown corporation, that may or may not do an audit. 
Only because of good management would it do an audit, 
becoming accountable.
<P>
	We also have the public saying this agency is the same, it 
gives out aid or it is something involved with aid, and what are 
we going to do about that, maybe we should subject it to the 
same treatment that we subject an organization like CIDA to.
<P>
	As I pointed out, that is totally wrong. For that reason I would 
strongly advise members to read the member's bill, to take a 
look at what it is trying to accomplish and the fact that it is 
allowing this organization to get its dollars and cents out on the 
table and to make them open to the public, thus achieving the 
accountability and transparency that I believe people are 
demanding.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	Obviously I had a lot of other areas I would have liked to have 
covered, but for the sake of time I will stop at this point. I ask 
members to reconsider their support of Bill C-263. When it 
comes to an area like the IDRC they would welcome that as 
much as any of us would in this House.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The time provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired. 
Pursuant to Standing Order 93, the order is dropped to the 
bottom of the order of precedence on the Order Paper.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TAXATION">TAXATION</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
obvious to anyone who is watching the various news programs 
today, or who has any sort of sensitivity to what is going on in 
the country, that there is the equivalent of a tax revolt well under 
way.
<P>
	People have literally been driven to the wall when it comes to 
the existing tax system which, to give it undue consideration, 
would be to call it unfair, unjust, unbalanced and discriminatory. 
It discriminates against the small business sector relative to the 
corporate sector. It is biased against the average working 
person, as opposed to people in the upper income or the very 
wealthy tax brackets.
<P>
	This tax revolt has occurred by the economy moving 
underground. There probably is not a Canadian citizen who is 
not participating in some way in the underground economy, with 
the exception of yourself, Mr. Speaker, and some of my 
colleagues who are presently in the House.
<P>
	Who does not participate with cash transactions or in a barter 
system? It is increasing. It is estimated that somewhere between 
$40 billion and $120 billion of business transactions each year 
take place in the underground economy. This makes it almost 
impossible to pay down the debt of the country until we get some 
confidence back in the system.
<P>
	Why is that? First of all, if we add up all of the tax 
exemptions, they come to about $36 billion a year. That was in 
the press yesterday. Thirty-six billion dollars a year is lost to the 
treasury because of tax exemptions. Many of these exemptions 
are legitimate but many must be classed as tax loopholes. I give 
my friend, the Minister of Finance, full credit for going public in 
the last few days and saying that the system is filled with tax 
loopholes that have to be closed. He also said that the poor do 
not use tax loopholes. It is clear what he means. The rich use tax 
loopholes.
<P>
	When we go down to the harbours in some of the port cities of 
Canada and see the huge yachts, they are by and large tax 
deductions. I personally know a number of people with boats 
who write off half of the cost of the boat and call it a business tax 
deduction for entertainment purposes. The boxes in the big 
sports stadiums are tax write-offs. We found out from the news 
today that even escort services can be a tax write-off if the name 
is changed to a tour guide or a bodyguard.
<P>
	I suspect a lot of submissions will be made by individuals who 
are entertaining their clients. A lot of touring will also be going 
on, or perhaps a lot of bodyguards will be put into place. That 
will be a legitimate tax write-off.
<P>
	The reports say that Revenue Canada will soon send out a 
circular clarifying this issue. As long as the escort service is also 
a tour guide or a bodyguard, it will qualify for a legitimate tax 
write-off. I could go on, but I suspect that we are all familiar 
with the various forms of tax write-offs.
<P>
	I would like to ask a couple of serious questions. Canada is 
one of the very few OECD countries that does not have an 
inheritance tax. Across the way, when my hon. friend inherits $2 
million or $3 million, it is not taxed. We are virtually the only 
country in the western world where an inheritance is not taxed.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<B><A NAME="9763"> 9763 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1835 ) </B>
<P>
	Even the United States has an inheritance tax. The United 
States also considers capital gains to be like any other income. 
In other words $1 of capital gains is taxed like $1 of regular 
income. But not in Canada. That $1 of capital gains is only 
considered to be worth 75 cents for taxation purposes.
<P>
	Once again we are one of the very few OECD countries that 
says to people: If your income is from capital gains we are 
automatically going to give you a 25 per cent tax break before 
we even start considering it.
<P>
	Again I have to ask, why the tax break for those who earn their 
income from capital gains as opposed to someone working in a 
radio station, a factory or a plant? Why do we distinguish 
between those two kinds of incomes? Why do we let those 
people who inherit vast amounts of money off, not to pay any 
income tax at all on it? Again, we are one of the very few 
countries in the world that does that.
<P>
	I could also ask about the family trust provision. Here is the 
mother of all loopholes. I believe there is now universal 
agreement that if there is a tax provision that has to go in this 
budget, it has to be this family trust business. The tax experts 
told us this provision was brought in to protect only the very 
wealthiest families of Canada. Must we have a special tax 
provision that costs us many hundreds of millions of dollars to 
make life easier for the very wealthy in Canada? I think the 
reaction to that is no.
<P>
	We will be watching very closely to see what the Minister of 
Finance does when he brings in his budget in a few days and 
whether or not he says: ``We are going to take this loophole of 
loopholes, the mother or father of all loopholes out of the 
system''. If he does that, then I think we can legitimately say 
that yes, there is some balance to the budget.
<P>
	For example, he should tax the inheritances people receive, 
let us say, over $1 million or $2 million. I am not talking about 
people who inherit the family farm or the person who inherits a 
small business or the family home or whatever. I am talking 
about people who inherit $2 million, $3 million, $5 million or 
$10 million. Why should they not pay tax on that? They would if 
they were in virtually every other western industrialized nation, 
but not in Canada.
<P>
	A whole set of questions must be asked about the loopholes in 
the system. I am very happy to see that the Minister of Finance 
has now acknowledged this. We will be watching carefully as he 
attempts to close off some of these loopholes in an effort to 
make the tax system a bit fairer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to try to respond to the very windy 
comments of the hon. member for Kamloops. With his typical 
hyperbole he went on to grossly  exaggerate the deficiencies of 
the Canadian tax system, I am sure for the benefit of his viewers 
in Kamloops.
<P>
	He sounded a little like the premier of Ontario did when he 
was in opposition, and we have all noticed how he has changed 
his tune since he came into government. Of course he has made 
the worst mess we have ever seen of any government in any 
province. I suspect the hon. member for Kamloops would agree 
with me if he lived in Ontario. He does not, so he has missed out 
on some of the worst aspects of NDP rule in our province.
<P>
	The NDP is involved in the tax system in Ontario and the 
Ontario taxpayers are complaining about high taxes. What they 
have not fully realized in every case is how many of those taxes 
are charged by their provincial government. It has really slapped 
it to Ontarians in a big, big way, in spite of having a massive 
deficit and total incompetence in its government and running the 
economy of that province.
<P>
	I agree with him that the fundamental basis of a sound tax 
system is that everyone pays his or her share. When a minority 
of taxpayers are able to avoid paying their fair share, the 
legitimacy of the whole system suffers.
<P>
	Like the hon. member for Kamloops, the Minister of Finance 
and indeed every member of this caucus is committed to trying 
to restore an element of fairness to our tax system. But the 
government in fact has already taken steps to do that. It did it in 
the last budget.
<P>
	I did not see the hon. member for Kamloops applauding the 
minister on budget day last year. I am sorry he did not, but I can 
safely tell you, Mr. Speaker, and I know you will agree, that 
none of us have ever seen the hon. member for Kamloops 
applaud a budget in this House.
<P>
	There is a good reason for that. None of them has been an NDP 
budget. If there had been one, no doubt he would applaud it. But 
as long as the budget is presented by any other party, no matter 
how fair it is, he will say it is not fair enough for him. He does 
not talk about Bob Rae's budgets. If he did, I think he would be 
complaining about the lack of fairness. I am sorry we are not 
able to hear his thoughts on that tonight.
<P>
	I want to point out examples of some of the things the 
Minister of Finance did last year in his budget.
<P>
	He eliminated the $100,000 lifetime capital gains exemption 
that had been put in by the previous government that benefited 
high income individuals almost exclusively. The deduction for 
business meals and entertainment expenses was reduced from 
80 per cent to 50 per cent, another item that benefited substantial 
taxpayers. Large Canadian controlled private corporations are 
no longer eligible for the small business deductions which 
benefit small business and which the hon. member for Kamloops 
ignored in his remarks. I think that is important.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="9764"> 9764 </A></B>
<P>
	The need for increased equity and simplicity in the tax 
system is recognized. The finance minister has made it clear 
on a number of occasions that his budget will be fair and will 
try to reduce inequities in our tax system.
<P>
	I am sure the member for Kamloops will applaud the minister 
on budget day and thank him for the great service he is doing for 
Canadians.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 38, the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to 
have been adopted.
<P>
	Accordingly, this House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 
10 a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.40 p.m.)
