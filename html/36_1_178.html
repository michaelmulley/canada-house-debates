</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe McGuire (Egmont, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to acknowledge and congratulate Premier Brian Tobin and the 
Liberal Party of Newfoundland and Labrador on their successful 
re-election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday voters in that province returned a Liberal majority 
government, a fourth consecutive Liberal majority, the second 
under Premier Tobin's leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Newfoundland and Labrador have renewed the Liberal 
government's mandate to continue its agenda of reducing 
unemployment, balancing the budget and ensuring that the province 
receives the full benefit of its present and future resources, 
including mineral exploration, energy production and a 
rejuvenated and diversified fishing industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fitting, in the year commemorating the 50th anniversary of 
Newfoundland joining the Canadian family, that the Liberal Party 
of Newfoundland and Labrador is the victor in yesterday's 
election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Joey Smallwood can rest easy.  I congratulate Brian Tobin and

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan—Coquihalla, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to inform the House that this afternoon I will be 
presenting to the Library of Parliament the history of the South 
Alberta Regiment.  The book entitled <I>The South Albertas:  A 
Canadian Regiment at War</I>, is the story of five infantry 
militia units that together formed the South Alberta Regiment and 
ended the war as Canada's finest regiment in the Canadian 
armoured corps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of the 4th Armoured Division, the South Alberta Regiment 
played a major roll in a number of significant battles, including 
the Battle of Falaise Gap where Major David Currie of C Squadron 
won the Victoria Cross.  Mrs. Currie is with us in the gallery 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Removed from the order of battle in 1954, the South Alberta 
Regiment is a sterling example of Canada's militia and a proud 
part of our military heritage.  With 316 casualties, their 
unofficial motto was “You've been through the mud and the blood 
and I hope that you reach the green fields beyond”.  Their 
record indicates that the South Alberta Regiment deserves nothing 
less.

Mr. Speaker, Manitoba welcomes the Cangene Corporation's decision 
to open its new health biotechnology research and development 
facility in Winnipeg, not England, thanks to a $3 million 
repayable loan from the western diversification program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This program illustrates the commitment of the federal 
government to advance the economic prosperity of the western and 
northern regions of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a facility like Cangene's that ensures the creation of 
jobs for Manitobans, old and young alike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Manitobans, therefore, find it difficult to understand that 
another political party has, as its policy, the dismantling of 
the western diversification program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The constituents of Winnipeg North—St. Paul salute the federal 
government for its commitment to sustain this program for 
Canada's western and northern regions, thereby strengthening our 
social union as a federation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I commend the Liberal government on reaching a social 
union agreement with the provinces.  The agreement is proof that 
the provinces and Ottawa can work together to build a stronger 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The social union will ensure that our crucial social safety net 
is preserved and enhanced for today's generation and for future 
generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health accord is a perfect example of the social union at 
work.  The accord has renewed the federal, provincial and 
territorial commitment to the five principles of the Canada 
Health Act, ensuring that Canadians everywhere will continue to 
have access to the highest quality of medicare.  Together we are 
working in the best interests of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that this agreement was reached just before Citizenship 
and Heritage Week serves as a reminder of all that we have and 
all that we should be thankful for.  After all, Canada truly is 
the best country on earth.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Monday's <I>National Post</I> reported that Health Canada is 
dragging its heels on approving the drug TPA in the treatment of 
strokes and heart attacks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is appalling since it has been proven to save thousands of 
lives in America, yet it is a gamble for those living without the 
drug in Canada.  If a person is one of the lucky few who are 
admitted to a teaching hospital in which the drug is used they 
are guaranteed a fighting chance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I myself stand here in the House of Commons as proof that TPA 
saves lives.  At midnight on October 6, 1990 I had a blood clot 
travel to the main artery of my heart.  I was declared dead for 
six minutes until TPA was administered and it brought me back to 
life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I give full credit to both my doctor and TPA.  I would really 
encourage Health Canada to make the approval of TPA a priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should be in the business of saving lives.  Here 
is an opportunity to erase its abysmal record of stripping our 
health care system dry by giving those Canadians suffering from 
strokes and heart attacks the gift of life.

</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK15"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, today 
I am pleased to tell the House about a model new partnership 
between a Saskatchewan first nations community, the Department of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development and the city of 
Saskatoon.  This initiative has resulted in jobs, training and 
improved fire protection for the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This week the Whitecap Dakota Sioux First Nation opened a new 
fire hall and training centre and signed a fire protection service 
agreement with Saskatoon.  This agreement is the first of its 
kind in Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this means is that Whitecap no longer has to rely on 
services from 30 kilometres away.  Now, with its own fire hall, 
truck, equipment and trained volunteers, the community has the 
same basic level of fire protection service that other Canadians 
have.  This is a good example of partnership as outlined in the 
federal government's aboriginal action plan “Gathering 
Strength”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the government I congratulate the chief of Whitecap 
and the mayor of Saskatoon for working together.  With the help 
of the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, 
this partnership is providing tangible improvements to the 
community.

that the Chaleurs and Restigouche regions of New Brunswick have 
been selected to host the 2003 Canada Winter Games. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This announcement was made possible by the relentless work of 
the local 2003 Canada Winter Games bid committee.  The efforts of 
the committee, chaired by Brian Theede, bore fruit last night 
with the confirmation of the 2003 Winter Games being awarded to 
our region. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The economic fallout from the Games, estimated at $30 million, 
will be most welcome in our area.  The publicity generated by an 
activity of such scope will have major long-term economic impacts 
on the region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the region will exhibit its usual hospitality, and 
that the experience will be an unforgettable one.  We look

week, there have been reports from Colombia concerning a 
murderous attack by paramilitaries, the murder of two human 
rights activists, and the kidnapping of four social workers 
affiliated with the Canadian Catholic organization Development 
and Peace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to a spokesperson for that organization, the kidnap 
victims were monitoring the actions of paramilitaries in the 
regions where land is being confiscated.  It appears that they 
were taken in order to sabotage the peace talks between the 
Colombian government and the guerrillas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Twenty-five thousand Colombians have protested in the streets of 
Medellin against the misdeeds of the paramilitary forces. 
The Bloc Quebecois joins its voice to theirs in demanding that 
the four people being held hostage by the paramilitaries be 
freed and the peace process in Colombia resumed.

social union agreement is entitled “A Framework to Improve the 
Social Union for Canadians”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Sainte-Beuve put it, “Happy lovers adapt willingly to any 
framework”.  This is the way I would describe the unhealthy 
atmosphere that led nine provinces concerned about us to sign an 
unconditional surrender, after being starved by the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreement dwelled as well on the obligation to eliminate 
barriers to Canadians' mobility.  “To eliminate” means “to 
reject“, “to remove”. 
This is a word that unfortunately goes well with the regrettable 
attitude of the nine provinces concerned about us, which dropped 
Quebec without a moment's hesitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One word, however, is missing from this agreement, inspired by 
the minister.  It is the word “to eat away” as in “to eat away 
the powers of the provinces”.

Picture this:  A young woman jetting around the world, testing 
five star hotels to make sure they are ritzy enough for her 
uncle's first class vacations.  This young woman travelled first 
class herself when she was lining up luxury suites for her uncle 
in Italy last year.  She spent more than 10,000 loonies on first 
class airfare.

are talking about young Caroline Chrétien jetting around the

long way from being the little guy from Shawinigan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe that is the real reason the Prime Minister did not go to 
King Hussein's funeral.  Bill Clinton already booked the royal

a meeting with one member.  He was willing to meet with a

process for dealing with loans authorized by the Business 
Development Bank of Canada is one that is entirely within the 
control of that organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case, because the level of the loan was such as it was, 
the decision was not made at the local level.  It was made at the

not even an order in council appointee who was involved in 
determining that process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, I want to emphasize that this money was not only 
loaned by the Business Development Bank of Canada, there were

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council

Mr. Speaker, the framework to improve the social union for 
Canadians was signed on February 4, 1999 by the Prime Minister of 
Canada, all but one of the premiers and the territorial leaders 
after more than a year of negotiations which were superbly 
co-chaired by Saskatchewan's intergovernmental affairs minister, 
the hon. Berny Wiens, and our colleague, the Minister of Justice 
and chair of the cabinet committee on the social union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased and honoured to pay tribute in the House to the 
immense service that the member for Edmonton West has rendered to 
our country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This framework agreement has been very well received across the 
country, but there is still concern about the fact that the 
Premier of Quebec did not sign the agreement.  There is a fear 
that Quebeckers may not reap the benefits of the agreement to the 
same extent as other Canadians.  This is a legitimate concern 
which I would like to address here today. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the premier of my province did not sign this framework 
agreement, the Prime Minister of Canada, the Right Hon. Jean 
Chrétien, has promised to make sure his fellow Quebeckers 
benefit from it as much as possible.  This is good news for 
Quebeckers and for other Canadians.  I will demonstrate this by 
examining a number of the major elements of this agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreement comprises seven parts.  The first sets out a 
number of principles committing governments to promoting greater 
fairness, equality and respect for diversity throughout Canada. 
The Government of Canada is naturally committed, within the 
limits of its constitutional powers and jurisdictions, to 
ensuring that Quebeckers benefit from the promotion of these 
fundamental values as much as other Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second part is about mobility.  It commits governments to 
eliminating harmful or unreasonable barriers to the free 
movement of Canadians throughout Canada.  The Government of 
Canada, as the only government elected by all Canadians, is 
determined that Canadians be considered Canadians everywhere in 
Canada.  This is an essential element of Canadian citizenship. 
The objective is obviously not to have “one size fits all” 
public policies and government practices throughout the country. 
Rather, the objective is to give all Canadians equal access to 
our country's rich diversity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada hopes that the Government of Quebec 
will participate in these negotiations on mobility in order for 
Quebeckers to benefit fully from them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third part commits governments to keeping Canadians better 
informed and to acting with greater transparency.  Each 
government will work to enhance its accountability to its 
constituents, known as public accountability.  But governments 
will not be accountable to one another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada is committed to enhancing its 
accountability to Quebeckers as it will to other Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth part of the agreement commits governments to working 
in partnership while respecting their constitutional powers and 
jurisdictions.  They will share information so as to learn 
better from one another.  They will consult one another on their 
respective priorities and opportunities for co-operation.  They 
will give one another advance notice prior to implementation of 
a major change and will work to avoid duplication while 
clarifying their roles and responsibilities.  They are committed 
to more effective co-operation with aboriginal peoples throughout 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada is committed to working in partnership 
with the Government of Quebec as it will with all other 
governments in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fifth part commits governments, specifically the federal 
government, to using the federal spending power more 
co-operatively so as to improve social programs for Canadians. 
This means that with respect to any new Canada-wide initiatives 
in health care, post-secondary education, social assistance and 
social services that are funded through intergovernmental 
transfers, whether block-funded or cost-shared, first, the 
Government of Canada will no longer decide on its own to launch 
new initiatives.  It will have to consult each province and 
territory and will consider proceeding only if it obtains the 
approval of at least a majority of provinces on objectives and 
an accountability framework. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the Government of Canada will no longer impose programs, 
but will let each province determine its own programming for 
attaining the agreed objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the Government of Canada will no longer require that the 
total transfer be devoted to a given objective.  A provincial 
government that, because of its existing programming, does not 
require the total transfer to fulfill the objective, may use the 
balance for other purposes in the same or a related priority 
area.

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to federal spending initiatives through direct 
transfers to individuals or organizations for health care, 
post-secondary education, social assistance and social services, 
the Government of Canada will no longer be able to implement new 
initiatives without first giving three months' notice and 
offering to consult the other governments. Those governments 
will have the opportunity to identify potential duplication and 
to propose alternative approaches to achieve flexible and 
effective implementation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These undertakings set down significant new constraints on the 
federal government.  They go beyond the provisions on limiting 
the federal spending power contained in the Meech and 
Charlottetown agreements.  Independent observers in Quebec 
recognize the significance of these provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada is committed to respecting these new 
requirements for co-operation and consultation and to ensuring 
that all governments benefit from this process, including the 
Government of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sixth part of the framework agreement on the social union 
commits governments to respecting a new dispute avoidance and 
resolution mechanism.  This mechanism provides for joint 
negotiations and the participation of third parties for 
fact-finding or mediation.  Even the Premier of Quebec has 
acknowledged that this new mechanism is a sign of progress.  It 
will be available to him, as it is to all governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The seventh and final part provides for a full review of the 
framework agreement on the social union by the end of the third 
year of the agreement.  Once the agreement has been put through 
its paces, it will be possible to identify its strengths and 
weaknesses and make improvements to it. 
The Government of Quebec will be invited to participate in this 
review.  Quebeckers and all other Canadians will thus have an 
opportunity to express their views. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So this is what the Government of Canada intends to do to ensure 
that Quebeckers reap the full benefits of this agreement.  To 
this end, it will offer its full co-operation to the Government 
of Quebec at every opportunity.  Quebeckers want their 
governments to work together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is understandable that the Government of Quebec may feel that 
the progress achieved through the agreement is not enough.  But 
it is reasonable to expect the Government of Quebec to accept 
the progress offered to it, even if it believes it is not 
enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebeckers, like other Canadians, must have full access to the 
immense potential of their country and to all of the 
opportunities for mutual assistance provided to them through the 
Canadian social union, one of the best in the world, which we 
will make even better through this agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would just like to point 
out to the minister, and especially to his speech writers, that 
it is the tradition in this House to not call members by name. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. The hon. member for 
Verchères—Les-Patriotes is absolutely right. Our standing orders 
provide that members not refer to one another except by riding 
name or title. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sorry the Chair did not pick up on the slip the hon. member 
is referring to. I was involved in a discussion, therefore 
missing what was said just then. Normally, the Chair would 
interrupt a member who makes this kind of slip to correct him or 
her.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think it is no surprise to the House 
that I have had deep reservations on the social union agreement 
that was struck on February 4.  I hate to rain on the minister's 
parade, but it is interesting that just six days after the fact, 
the C.D. Howe Institute has released a report by William Robson 
and Daniel Schwanen entitled “The Social Union Agreement: Too 
Flawed to Last”.  It states that while Canadians “might 
reasonably have expected to strike a deal that would have sorted 
out federal-provincial overlap, made federal-provincial transfers 
fairer and more transparent, and brought Quebec in as a more 
co-operative partner, the agreement reached on February 4 failed 
on all these counts”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government can spend money in areas of provincial 
jurisdiction with the support of six provinces.  If it is the six 
smallest provinces in Canada it could mean that as little as 15% 
of Canada's population will determine the programs.  I suggest to 
the minister that the seven provinces representing 50% of the 
population would have been much more representative and much 
fairer to Canadians.  This is the recommendation the Reform Party 
has made in the new Canada act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this arrangement the federal government will still be able 
to initiate programs like the millennium scholarship fund with 
the exception that it now only has to give the provinces three 
months notice.  It is not going to stop the interjurisdictional 
conflict that has existed in this country for the last 50 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the richer provinces will be paying the lion's share for 
any of these new programs, it is the poorer provinces which can 
dictate what programs will be activated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The C.D. Howe report also shows that residents of the three 
so-called have provinces, B.C., Alberta and Ontario, will loose 
money with the announcement of more dollars for health care 
because of the federal bias in the transfers to the provinces. It 
is not just with equalization where this happens, it is with the 
transfer of programs that the federal government has to the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For every additional dollar spent on health care the residents 
of Ontario and Alberta will have to contribute an additional 
$1.30.  To get that additional dollar British Columbians will 
have to contribute $1.10.  For the provinces of Ontario and 
Alberta for that extra $100 the federal government transfers for 
health care they will in actuality only receive about $60.  One 
has to ask how this agreement managed to find signatures on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has also been reported, the proposed tax cuts in the federal 
budget will automatically result in less tax revenue for the 
provinces with the exception of Quebec.  Where will there be 
actual dollars to put into health care? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The C.D. Howe report also mentions the concern of isolating 
Quebec.  The minister made great efforts this afternoon to assure 
the people of Quebec they will be considered the same as all 
other Canadians.  This agreement leaves two classes of Canadians, 
those in Quebec who will not be subject to the mobility and 
non-discrimination commitment, and those outside Quebec who will 
be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, Quebec is the only province to charge higher 
tuition for out of province students.  Quebec's failure to sign 
on will leave this situation as it stands.  How long will the 
people outside Quebec tolerate Quebec students being able to pay 
the same tuition as their children in their provinces, while 
their children who want to study in Quebec will have to pay more? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned last week, the Prime Minister missed a wonderful 
opportunity to sign a truly historic agreement that was all 
inclusive.  The only reason for this missed opportunity was this 
government's reluctance to give up power, control and credit.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite want to get pictures of themselves handing out 
the cheques.  What they fail to mention is that the money that is 
the basis of those cheques does not belong to the federal 
government.  It belongs to the taxpayers of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do they fail to mention that?  Why do they practice photo 
opportunity politics? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report recommends that the provinces must seek ways of 
reopening the social union contract so that Quebec can sign on. 
Since the agreement contains provisions for re-evaluation after 
three years, an opportunity to establish more extensive opting 
out provisions balanced by more stringent obligations of 
transparency, portability of programs and credentials, and 
respect for the citizenship rights of all Canadians will arise 
shortly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Preparing in advance would help to ensure that this accord's 
failings, Quebec's exclusion prominent among them, are not 
repeated.  In other words, the federal government should have 
followed the Reform Party's new Canada act which gave good 
guidance in how Quebec could have signed on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition hopes that a new spirit of 
federal-provincial co-operation has indeed occurred.  However, 
rest assured we will be prominent in pointing out any and all 
instances where this government is letting down the Canadian 
people. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK141"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on Thursday, 
February 4, 1999, nine provinces, two territories and the 
federal government signed an agreement on the social union, and 
all ten provinces and the two territories signed an agreement on 
health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time this announcement was made, some of the premiers 
apparently forgot what the Prime Minister of Canada said on 
referendum night, in November 1995. I would like to quote the 
Prime Minister, who said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have made to those Canadians who demonstrated their 
attachment to Quebec a commitment to change Canada. 
You called on Quebeckers not to let Canada down. You have been 
heard. Now I call on you not to let them down. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, nine premiers have entered into an agreement with 
the federal government without Quebec's consent. This feels 
strangely familiar in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After last Thursday's announcement, Friday's press conference by 
three ministers of this government, and a string of public 
statements over the weekend, the federal government is at it 
again today, telling us it knows what is good for us and we 
should do as it says. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the fact that none of the political parties on the 
Quebec scene—the Parti Quebecois, the Quebec Liberal Party and 
Action démocratique—would have wanted to sign such an agreement, 
the federal government, in its great wisdom and superiority, 
tells us it understood what was best for us: a framework 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the same government which has, in recent years, 
implemented a Plan B, made a reference to the Supreme Court, 
started such initiatives as the millennium scholarships, done a 
number on the provinces by cutting transfer payments for health 
care, and now it is touting itself as a great saviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is there in this agreement?  First of all, the great values 
and principles, with no reference whatsoever to the lead role 
played by the provinces in the health field. 
On the contrary, the door is being opened to the federal 
government's having a major planning role in social programs, 
health services and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nowhere in the document, moreover, is there any firm financial 
commitment, even in the principles that relate to sectors so 
crucial to the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, this government, which had promised a commitment to a 
specific, unique status for Quebec, and so on and so forth, 
thumbed its nose at all that.  Nowhere in the document, either, 
is there any recognition of Quebec's contribution to Canada as a 
society that is different, a people that is different.  Now 
there is no longer any attempt at pretence.  They do not even 
take the trouble to put this into the key principles behind this 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second element is mobility within Canada, a point that 
surely led to passionate discussions. 
In this regard, the government introduces the possibility of 
barriers to mobility where reasonable.  We know full well, and 
we heard it in a speech earlier, that outside Quebec there has 
long been criticism of the fact that there is a difference 
between tuition fees charged students from outside Quebec and 
those charged Quebec students.  What they never say, however, is 
that these students still pay less than they would in their own 
province. 
Will that be called into question by such an agreement.  That 
remains to be seen, it will depend on the reasonableness test.

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear, however, and the minister knows it for a fact, that 
at the discussion table the matter was raised by many provinces. 
It was even raised, on a few occasions, by another of the 
opposition parties here in the House.  This is one of the areas 
some provinces want to attack in connection with Quebec.  I 
could provide examples of other areas, but there is not enough 
time this afternoon to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third point is accountability.  I am extremely surprised to 
see in this agreement that they are trying to impose 
accountability criteria on the provinces. 
As if they were not already accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out that the provinces, and the case in point, 
Quebec, are democratic.  Each year, before the budget, there is a 
practice, known as budget votes, involving a parliamentary 
commission, a debate in the National Assembly and a public 
presentation by the media and the opposition parties. 
Accountability criteria already exist and they apply to 
provincial governments, which are accountable to their electors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government now wants to get involved in that and 
give itself the job of evaluating provincial accountability. 
The provinces will therefore get a report card from the federal 
government with a thinly veiled threat that funding is tied to 
the achievement of cross Canada objectives, something no 
Government of Quebec has ever supported or ever will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, to work in partnership with Canadians. In the real world 
one must also walk the talk. It was just a year ago that the 
government introduced the millennium scholarship initiative. The 
same government that promised to take a co-operative approach 
unilaterally established this program to subsidize or grant 
scholarships to students on merit and performance, arguing that 
it was fulfilling a priority in education at the expense of the 
provinces' own priorities. Would Quebec's priorities in this 
respect not been different? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now there will be no choice; $80 million will be invested in 
this area every year and priorities will be set by the federal 
government, not by the Quebec government, the one responsible 
for managing the whole education system. It is one thing to make 
grand statements of principle, it is another to put them into 
practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, and this is the crux of the problem, federal spending 
power, this constitutional plague. Every attempt to negotiate 
and come to an agreement inevitably stumbled over the issue of 
limiting federal spending power. The minister claims this goes 
much further than what was called for in the Meech Lake accord. 
He has a very biased view of reality and I will refresh his 
memory on a few points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He uses one point in the Meech Lake accord to say that, in the 
future, federal spending power will be restricted even further 
that was provided for in Meech, but he fails to mention—and I 
will remind him a thing or two about Meech—that there was nothing 
in the Meech Lake accord about the provincial responsibilities 
for mobility, accountability and transparency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Granted, in Meech the opting out provisions only applied to 
cost-shared programs. 
Everyone agrees on that. However, no provision explicitly 
recognized a legitimate federal role in health, education and 
welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was no mention of the federal government's power to spend 
through direct transfers to persons, which is a key feature of 
this agreement. This meant that Quebec could always assert that 
it did not recognize this federal power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, in the Meech Lake accord there was a safeguard clause, 
which basically stated that this provision did not extend the 
legislative authority of parliament or the provincial 
legislatures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might add also that Mr. Bourassa, then Premier of Quebec and 
not a sovereignist, specified that the new provision had been 
drafted to address the right to opt out without recognizing or 
defining the federal spending power. 
To make very certain—we can see that he was wary too—we insisted 
that an escape clause be added to the effect that the 
legislative powers of the federal parliament would not be 
increased”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are therefore several differences between this agreement 
and the Meech Lake agreement.  There is also a new rule 
requiring the federal government to have the support of a 
majority of the provinces.  The federal government will be able 
to go ahead with the support of six provinces.  What does this 
actually mean?  It means that the four maritime provinces, with 
two of the other smallest provinces, or 15% of the population, 
could impose Canada-wide standards on the social programs of 
Quebec, which represents 25% of the Canadian population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something very wrong about this.  Even advocates of the 
agreement admit that this is a major problem.  This is a new low 
with respect to the criteria the federal government must meet in 
order to flex its spending power which, it should be said, it 
has extended unilaterally on more than one occasion, relying on 
the supreme court, the Criminal Code, national interest, and a 
series of supreme court rulings.  Each time, they have 
encroached a little bit more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, with this framework agreement, the provinces have cut them 
a little more slack.

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two other points: a dispute settlement mechanism and a 
review of the agreement after three years.  In light of all 
that, it is obvious that the Government of Quebec could not 
sign.  I would like to read from an editorial that does not come 
from Quebec but rather from the <I>National Post</I>, which is hardly 
known for its sovereignist slant.  Journalist Andrew Coyne wrote 
as follows: 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Let us consider what the federal government has gained and 
what it has given up.  It has gained first and foremost 
provincial acknowledgement of the legitimacy of its own 
involvement in the social policy”. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He recognizes that there has been a very clear gain for the 
provinces in this agreement.  My time is running out, so I will 
cut to the conclusion.  Having analysed all the federal 
government gains, he says this: 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“You would think the premiers would never sign such a document. 
But with at least two and probably four facing elections this 
year, the allure of more money for health care proves 
irresistible. Money can buy happiness but it seems it can buy 
provinces”. 
<P><A NAME="LINK142"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the New Democratic Party sees the social union as a potentially 
positive development in the kind of co-operative federalism New 
Democrats have long advocated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP has long supported the principle of co-operative 
federalism.  Most recently, an NDP panel of party members 
presented a report to our federal council endorsing a social 
union based on the co-operative development and enforcement of 
standards for nationwide social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the extent that the social union framework is an attempt to 
establish such a framework of co-decision with governments 
working together in building programs that meet the needs of 
Canadians, it is a first step in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP welcomes the fact that the development of new and better 
social policy appears to be front and centre on the public 
agenda.  We hope this agreement will break the impasse that has 
blocked the introduction of urgently needed national programs 
such as the national child care program and the national home 
care program, not to mention a national pharmacare program, all 
of which have been promised at one time or another by the party 
in power at the moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe therefore that the social union is a first step in 
the right direction toward a co-operative and less conflictual 
federalism where governments work together to meet the needs of 
Canadians in a context that affirms national standards and the 
continuing relevance of the federal spending power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the biggest threats to Canada-wide social programs in 
recent years has been the federal government's unilateral 
withdrawal of funding.  For instance, the federal share of health 
costs has fallen from 50% when medicare began to less than 15% 
now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The social union framework comes with no specific offer of 
federal money nor a firm mechanism to ensure that the federal 
government will maintain its fair share of contributions to 
social programs over time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The social union will only work if the federal government comes 
through with that commitment and if at the same time the 
agreement is amended to prevent unilateral action, particularly 
when it comes to unilateral reductions in federal contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe therefore that the social union will only work if the 
federal government pays its fair share, is committed to do so in 
future years and is willing to forswear unilateral reductions in 
transfer payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New Democrats are pleased that the social union framework and 
the exchange of letters between the premiers and the Prime 
Minister have reaffirmed the principles of the Canada Health Act 
which protect publicly provided universal health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The social union framework must therefore be used to stop the 
trend in some provinces toward American style two tier health 
care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The framework agreement contains numerous references to 
transparency, public accountability and the involvement of third 
parties.  This is to be welcomed but the language is very vague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed the process of negotiating the social union was seriously 
lacking in transparency.  We would like to register our own 
criticism and the criticism of many other Canadians about the way 
this agreement was arrived at in spite of whatever virtues it may 
contain.  The process was seen by a great many Canadians, and 
rightly so, to be terribly lacking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal NDP will therefore be watchful to see if governments 
follow through on these promises with effective measures on 
transparency and accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the important issue of having a watchdog to allow Canadians 
to assess whether both levels of government are meeting their 
obligations under the social union, the framework agreement is 
incomplete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The accountability framework for new social initiatives has not 
yet been agreed on.  The agreement provides for individuals to be 
able to “appeal unfair administrative practices” but the 
mechanism is to be provided by the government providing the 
service itself, not an independent agency as proposed by the NDP 
panel report to our federal council a couple of weeks ago.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want to have a say about how well their social 
programs like health care are serving them.  New Democrats will 
be watching carefully to make sure the social union develops in a 
way that allows them that kind of input. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a signatory to the United Nations Covenant on Social, 
Economic and Cultural Rights and other international covenants 
that set out Canadian social rights.  The social union framework 
makes no reference to Canadian social rights, nor does it 
establish any mechanism to ensure that both levels of government 
are respecting them.  In our view this is a serious shortcoming 
and something that perhaps could be remedied in future amendments 
or changes to the social union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New Democrats want to see a social union that recognizes the 
social rights of Canadians and we will work toward this goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The framework agreement does declare with respect to aboriginal 
peoples that nothing in the agreement will take away from 
aboriginal rights and the signatory governments do commit 
themselves to work with aboriginal peoples “to find practical 
solutions to address their pressing needs”.  We will insist that 
these consultations are meaningful and that they result in 
concrete action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the Government of Quebec has not agreed to this social 
union framework and the social union will not be complete until 
all the provinces agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do see in the social union a form of asymmetrical federalism 
by default.  We do not find this to be as disturbing as others in 
the sense that we have always seen a form of asymmetrical 
federalism as that which is needed in order to address Canada's 
national unity problems.  We have shared the concern of others in 
the past about having to decentralize at the level of 10 
provinces in order to meet this distinctive special needs of one 
province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see in the social union more by default that by design an 
aspect of asymmetrical federalism which at the same time creates 
a situation in which the needs of Quebecers as citizens of Canada 
will be met and they will not be left out of the benefits of the 
social union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps federalism is working in mysterious ways.  We see here 
the seeds of a new beginning.  We hope they will come to 
fruition.

<P><A NAME="LINK143"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand (Richmond—Arthabaska, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want 
to make a few comments before dealing directly with the social 
union framework. I listened to members from the other parties 
and I want to take a minute to comment on their remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, let me say that it is strange to hear Reformers say there 
are small and big provinces, and that the small provinces could 
not tell the big ones what to do. The Reformers are once again 
changing their mind. The provinces are all equal when Quebec or 
other issues are concerned, but when the issue is social union, 
the small provinces must not control the big ones. 
Such is Reform politics. It can change at any time, depending on 
which way the wind blows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also strange to hear comments about Quebec being isolated. 
During the last federal election campaign, no other party 
isolated Quebeckers more than the Reform Party did. People are 
becoming increasingly aware of this, on the eve of a weekend of 
activities that seems to be lacking on the organization side, on 
February 19, 20 and 21. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for my Bloc Quebecois friends, they perpetuate historical 
fears. They often talk about traditional demands. Our 
sovereignist friends have a historical fear, that of Quebec 
getting along with Ottawa. 
They talk about Quebec's traditional demands, but this also has 
to do with traditional fears in Quebec because if ever Quebec 
gets along with Ottawa, they can kiss sovereignty goodbye. I 
think it is imperative that we get rid of this more extreme view 
as soon as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coming back to the framework agreement on social union signed 
last week, it was odd to have the minister talk about 
discussions over the past year. He knows very well that 
negotiations, often sectoral negotiations, on health, for 
instance, and even negotiations between the finance ministers, 
have been under way since 1995. That said, we can say that the 
federal government has been on board for the past year and the 
provincial government, Quebec in particular, for a few months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one player missing in this social union deal today, but 
earlier on, there were actually two players missing, both Quebec 
and the federal government. 
Closer scrutiny may reveal that this deal was doomed to fail 
from the start, to a certain extent.

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the agreement per se, I would have one request. 
This is very important to us. Shortcomings aside, no province, 
especially not Quebec, should have to pay a penalty. The fear in 
Quebec at present is that Quebeckers would have to foot the bill 
after any confrontation between Quebec and the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that the minister, the Prime Minister and the 
government, and hopefully the Premier of Quebec, can give us the 
assurance that there will be no such penalty. The people of 
Quebec and Canada should not be penalized because it was not 
their fault if a few people became stubborn at the last minute. 
I trust there will be far clearer commitments and that they will 
quit telling Quebec that it has to fall into step, and that, if 
it will not accept the carrot, then it will get the stick 
instead.  That is not the right attitude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This agreement can be readily summarized.  We all know what an 
excellent writer the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs is, 
but this document could be put in just a few lines.  There is an 
awful lot of stuff in here.  There was much talk of mechanisms 
for settling disputes between the federal and provincial 
governments.  It is high time we had a mechanism for settling 
such disputes, as they just keep on coming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Point six refers to dispute avoidance and resolution.  I am 
ready to bet anything, Mr. Speaker, that you cannot tell me what 
is going to bind the provincial and federal levels together in a 
solid, efficient, effective and credible process for resolving 
disputes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is said that this must be simple and timely.  The government 
is left with maximum flexibility.  The sectors must design 
processes appropriate to their needs, and provide for 
appropriate use of third parties.  This could perhaps be used as 
a guideline.  There is no dispute resolution mechanism.  That is 
all we will have for the next three years.  There will be talk, 
but no mechanisms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our 1997 electoral platform, we very humbly suggested a far 
firmer mechanism on which all provinces and the federal 
government agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose this was written because they had to have a document. 
They wanted more than just two sheets of paper.  They said 
“Social union is something important.  There must be a bit of 
meat to it”.  But when one turns the pages, it does not amount 
to much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the hair on the necks of our Bloc colleagues rising 
at the suggestion of accountability, but what does it mean?  Not 
much.  What is there in the departments' reports that cannot be 
found there.  Perhaps they are referring to certain national 
standards, because there will have to be a comparison among 
provinces.  That is not all right.  When things go well in 
Quebec, a comparison is often made with Ontario.  They say, “We 
are better than Ontario this month in job creation”.  But, when 
Ontario is better the following month, then it is different.  It 
is the fault of the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps there is a fear of saying certain things, but we must 
keep Canadians informed and be transparent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They mention a better partnership for Canadians.  They talk 
about federal spending.  The government will not let go its 
direct spending power. 
It does not even want jurisdictional problems.  It wants nothing 
to do with the matter.  It wants to keep it all for itself. 
What we are saying is that this could increase the fear some 
provinces or all the provinces feel in connection with federal 
spending power, the direct spending power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is new in the agreement, is that now, for new programs, 
there is a new rule based on a majority of provinces. There will 
be jointly funded and managed programs. But who will pay what? 
No one is saying the federal government will pay 50% or 30%.  No 
one is saying the provinces will pay 30% or 50% or 75%. 
Agreement will be reached at the request of six provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I return to the remark by the party that will be doing group 
therapy in two weeks, to the effect that it is not true the 
little provinces are telling the big ones what to do. 
To the people of Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick, 
Newfoundland, Nova Scotia and Manitoba, I say, the Reform Party 
is not for you.  The same applies to Alberta.  British Columbia 
is smaller than Ontario, and it will not tell Ontario what to 
do.  That is a lot of hot air.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, there is nothing much in that document. However, 
there is one element that I do want to point out, namely 
providing a framework for cost-shared programs. We will certainly 
support the federal government in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anybody who looks at our party's 1997 platform will see that 
this is what we want. Providing a framework does not mean to 
restrict or to smother, but rather to put in place mechanisms 
for joint management, joint decision-making and, of course, joint 
financing. If a minor problem occurs, there should be a dispute 
settlement mechanism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not afraid to do it with the United States and with the 
World Trade Organization, so why not do it among ourselves. We 
must have an efficient and credible dispute settlement mechanism 
that respects every government's jurisdictions.  At some point, 
we may have one or two decision levels, which will allow the 
provinces and the federal government to act accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this subject, we applaud the initiative taken by the federal 
government to consult with the provinces. It is a good thing. We 
are also pleased with the fact that the provinces will be able 
to discuss new cost-shared programs with the federal government 
so an agreement can be reached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is still much to be done, but it may be a baby step in the 
right direction. We agree on that point, but for the rest, it 
was worth a photo op with all the first ministers in their dark 
suits except one, the premier of Quebec. 
Again, Quebec shows its distinct character. I hope that the next 
photo op will be for something positive rather than negative.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca for seconding the motions.  I am pleased 
to debate at report stage the amendments to Bill C-55, the 
magazine bill as everyone knows it.  The bill is really not about 
culture; it is about trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-55 has created a life of its own and is about to put 
Canadian jobs at risk.  In some ways the bill has got out of hand 
over the past several months because of numerous statements made 
by many parties which have not helped matters.  It has the 
potential to threaten many Canadian jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the heritage minister indicated that she will amend the 
bill, but she could do a lot better.  She could withdraw the bill 
at this time.  The heritage minister's amendment is redundant. It 
does nothing.  Bill C-55 is still government legislation.  It is 
still onstream. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the reality of the amendment:  Once Bill C-55 passes 
through both houses of parliament it will qualify as an action 
under article 2005 of the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement. Under 
subarticle 2005(2) the United States “may take measures of 
equivalent commercial effect in response to actions”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My main message is that the minister's amendment is legally 
meaningless.  With or without it— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  The hon. member knows 
that we are debating Motions Nos. 1 to 21 which he has moved and 
not Motion No. 22 which is in Group No. 2 and which will be 
debated later this day or whenever we complete the debate on the 
first group of amendments.  I suggest that he confine his remarks 
to the group we are discussing at the moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will certainly do that. 
Regardless her amendment is still redundant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Trade is really the issue in Bill C-55.  Our countries share a 
common boundary, the longest unguarded boundary in the world.  We 
share a common continent.  We move freely about across borders. 
Our friendship is a model for others in the world to follow.  Yet 
at times we tend to forget all of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will try to make my remarks brief.  I will do a quick recap on 
why I believe this ill founded magazine bill needs to be deleted 
in its entirety.  The bill needs to be taken back to the drawing 
board.  It was ill-conceived and very one sided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill represents the views of publishers.  When the bill was 
drawn up the advertisers were not even consulted.  One-half of 
the equation was not even consulted.  That omission is enough to 
withdraw the bill.  It is so unfortunate that an industry is 
divided by the bill.  The magazine industry is divided into two 
camps: advertisers versus publishers.  Everyone knows that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who did the government consult?  It was people like François de 
Beaubien and Ted Rogers. 
Do these people need help to defend Canadian culture?  I do not 
think so.  What we have today is that publishers support Bill 
C-55 and advertisers oppose it vehemently.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is a thinly veiled attempt to circumvent two 
unfavourable rulings Canada received at the World Trade 
Organization tribunal.  How can a government bring on good 
legislation without consulting all the stakeholders in the 
industry?  I believe this magazine bill is a good example of bad 
legislation.  It was poorly researched and poorly put together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have always been told that Canadians tend not to read 
Canadian magazines.  The fact is that Canadians do buy Canadian. 
Canadians buy magazines that are published in Canada.  Statistics 
have proven that 75% of all magazines read are received by 
control circulation and 94% of these are Canadian owned.  In 
other words they are owned and published in Canada.  This proves 
one thing, that Canadian readers prefer and buy Canadian 
magazines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us put this debate in perspective.  Let us take a closer 
look at our trade with our closest ally and trading partner. Over 
$1 billion of trade takes place daily across our borders. Canada 
is the western world's most trade dependent nation.   Some 40% of 
Canada's gross domestic product is derived from trade and 83.5% 
of all our goods and services are exported to the United States. 
Our economic health is directly related to our U.S. partner.  Can 
we imagine the value of our loonie without our trade with the 
United States?  Our United States exports rose 10% in 1997. 
Meanwhile our Asian market shrank by one-third. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to Nesbitt Burns the reality is that we are more 
reliant than ever on the United States.  We really have only one 
trading partner, the United States of America.  Our Japanese 
market is number two but it is currently on its knees.  The 
reality check is that Canada's total trade with the United States 
is 83.5%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we need a trade war?  Do we want a trade war with our best 
trading partner?  No.  Do the steelworkers of Hamilton want a 
trade war?  Do the textile workers of Montreal want a trade war? 
I am sure the millworkers of B.C. and the maritimes do not want a 
trade war.  Do farmers of Canada want a trade war?  Who wants a 
trade war?  Perhaps the heritage minister does, especially when 
she puts her culture protection bill ahead of the steelworkers in 
her home town. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps we need to look at how much money we are talking about 
in the bill in terms of advertising dollars.  I am told a measly 
$250 million of advertising is at stake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at what is really at stake for the country.  As I 
said earlier, $1 billion is exchanged daily between our two 
countries.  This tells me that on an annual basis the total is 
about $350 billion.  Can we put our country at risk for $250 
million?  As François de Beaubien said, that is several hours out 
of a day's worth of trade.  There are $350 billion at stake. Only 
a fool would gamble on these types of numbers.  We would think 
that the international trade minister would do a risk assessment 
before echoing his full support for Bill C-55. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to law professor Jamie Cameron of Osgoode Hall Law 
School, irrespective of any trade issue Bill C-55 should be 
opposed because it is an unreasonable limit on free speech and 
press freedom.  Furthermore it impinges on property rights and 
freedom of contract as guaranteed by the Canadian bill of rights.

</I></B></P><P align=left>How real is this threat of retaliation?  Let us listen to the 
people of Hamilton.  They know what it will be like if the steel 
industry is hit.  One industry towns like Hamilton take this 
threat seriously. Dofasco steel is telling the Hamilton MP to 
drop Bill C-55. Stelco has made the same plea.  Steelworkers of 
Hamilton are sending the heritage minister the same message, to 
drop Bill C-55. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the heritage minister willing to sacrifice the 
steelworkers of her home town?  It is to protect the big magazine 
publishers like Télémédia and Rogers Communications.  How many 
steel jobs would be put at risk in Hamilton? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many other ways to promote Canadian culture.  The 
heritage minister needs to take a lesson from the defence 
minister who said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps in the new digital world policies of cultural promotion 
make more sense than traditional policies of protection.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
given the number of amendments to Bill C-55 tabled by the Reform 
Party I thought it would be useful to highlight their substantive 
character. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member who just spoke made an interesting commentary, but I 
think the most interesting part of his intervention was that in 
his view and the view of his party more consultation should take 
place between, as he put it, all the stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That statement says to me that there is a number of issues which 
have to be worked out in the bill and there are some issues to 
which they take exception.  As a result of this need for 
Canadians to continue to consult with the stakeholders on all 
sides, obviously there are some issues that are of importance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are those issues?  The issues of importance which reflect 
the need for additional consultation are highlighted and exposed 
for all Canadians to see in the 21 amendments proposed by the 
Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 1 would eliminate clause 1.  It is a very well 
crafted, effective motion to delete the first clause of the bill 
without explanation and without being addressed by the member in 
his comments, which is the purpose of the debate that is going on 
right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand that it is okay for members to sometimes 
demonstrate a point.  I was hopeful and listened to the Speaker 
read the motions.  We came across the Reform Party's important, 
constructive and insightful Motion No. 2 which would delete 
clause 2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has a lot of parallel to the first important motion that the 
Reform Party tabled on Bill C-55.  It provides important insight 
into why it wanted additional consultations with all 
stakeholders, as the the hon. member so eloquently put it, 
advertisers, publishers, Canadians and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we go forward with the bill, according to the Reform Party 
there will be a trade war and we will lose $1 billion a day in 
trade.  Suddenly all ties with the United States will be totally 
severed and Canada will risk losing $350 billion of estimated 
trade in a year when the impact of the bill on Canada is about 
$250 million. 
With that I think I could understand the concern and the 
justification for Motion No. 2 in Group No. 1 of this report 
stage.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was hopeful we would get a bit more insight as to the specific 
concerns and why we would have these consultations when we got to 
Motion No. 3, tabled by the Reform Party for Bill C-55. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 3 was somewhat different in that it referred to 
clause 3 of the bill rather than the previous two clauses and the 
amendment tabled by the Reform Party to improve this bill was to 
delete clause 3.  A pattern was developing.  I had heard the 
member clearly state on behalf of the Reform Party that more 
consultations were needed on this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-55 obtained first reading in the House on October 8 and 
second reading on November 3, 1998.  The committee report was 
presented to the House on December 2, 1998.  There has been quite 
substantial dialogue and opportunity to deal with Bill C-55 by 
all hon. members, whether it be at the different stages of this 
bill or indeed at committee which dealt with it. As a result of 
all those consultations, as a result of all the discussions with 
all these so-called stakeholders from all parties, we came up 
with Motion No. 4, which was delightfully refreshing.  It was to 
delete clause 4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was really hoping that as a result of the member's serious 
concern the trade position with the United States would evaporate 
in a moment should Bill C-55 proceed because it only involved 
$250 million and that this was outrageous and a serious risk.  It 
was so important to the member that we not take this terrible 
risk of moving forward with Bill C-55 that we came up with Motion 
No. 5, which is the parallel and by now I have caught on totally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 5 said that clause 5 of the bill should be deleted. 
Even the Speaker at the time was becoming a little concerned that 
this pattern would extend to a point in which the House's time 
might be possibly frustrated, perhaps even wasted with frivolous 
discussions of which amendment was deleting which clause.  I 
suppose we should be thankful that there are at least rules in 
the House that allow us to deem things to have been done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we had proceeded the way the Reform Party wanted on this 
extremely important bill which was to evaporate all trade, over 
$350 billion of annual trade with the United States, we would 
have had to stand in our places and listen to 21 motions, each 
saying delete a different clause of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the substantive contribution of the Reform Party to a 
bill it suggests will somehow eliminate all trade with the United 
States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to abuse the opportunity or the privilege to bring 
these items up but I want as a backbench member of parliament 
simply to express my disappointment that the time of the House 
would somehow be taken up by such a frivolous approach to an 
important bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have important amendments that are going to be considered by 
this place.  They are not going to be considered until we deal 
with 21 amendments on behalf of the Reform Party which simply say 
delete a clause without explanation, without members prepared to 
speak on those motions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is contemptuous of the House.  It is an insult to members 
of parliament who are here to deal with the important legislation 
of the day.  This is an important bill. This bill has to do with 
the cultural sovereignty of Canada.  It has to do with important 
issues within the magazine industry.  It affects some groups 
differently from others and we must understand that.  We have to 
make decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is having a conference very soon.  Something it 
will have to deal with is a report done by one of its own members 
from Edmonton who basically said the problem with the Reform 
Party is that this philosophy of populism does not work in 
Canada.  Populism says let the people tell you where you want to 
go and the Reform Party will lead you there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have risen to speak in favour of Bill C-55 at report stage of 
the first grouping because I support the bill.  I am insulted and 
disappointed that the Reform Party would not give respect to the 
House by introducing 21 frivolous motions.

advertising services supplied by foreign periodical publishers, 
as reported (with amendments) from a committee, and Motions Nos. 
1 to 21. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to participate in this debate today on Bill C-55, an act 
respecting advertising services supplied by foreign periodical 
publishers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage having reviewed this 
bill clause by clause, we are now proceeding to consideration of 
the bill at report stage. My hon. colleague from Dauphin—Swan 
River has introduced 21 motions in amendment designed to delete 
clauses 1 through 21 of Bill C-55. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To ensure greater efficiency in the House, the Chair has grouped 
these 21 motions together. I will therefore use the time 
allotted to me to discuss the Bloc Quebecois' position on this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, the Bloc Quebecois is against the 21 Reform 
motions as they boil down to withdrawing the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has supported this bill from the outset 
because it acknowledges as legal and legitimate the right of any 
people to protect its culture against an overly aggresive 
invader. It is therefore no wonder that the Bloc Quebecois is 
working toward Quebec's sovereignty, since the Canadian 
government will not recognize the people of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The battle waged at this time in Canada goes far beyond the 
periodical publishing industry. Two major principles are at 
stake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we must assert the rights provided for in the trade 
agreements we have signed. Otherwise, it would be like saying 
that all these rights, including the cultural exemption in 
NAFTA, have no true value without the United States' approval. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1625"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, if Canada does not defend its rights, it would be 
tantamount to letting Washington dictate our country's economic 
and cultural policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is nothing new. In all the trade negotiations in which 
Canada took part, successive Canadian governments stated 
clearly, without beating around the bush, that Canadian culture 
was not negotiable. Yesterday, in a statement to the media, 
François de Gaspé Beaubien said, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have obtained a cultural exemption under the free trade 
agreement and under NAFTA, and we have not assumed any 
obligation under the WTO agreements that would restrict Canada's 
right and ability to implement these policies. In the magazine 
industry, the United States have not obtained the right to have 
access to our advertising services market, and we are under no 
obligation to grant them that access. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the purpose of this bill? Essentially, this bill is to 
prevent American advertising from being replaced with Canadian 
advertising in split run editions of American magazines sold on 
the Canadian market. This policy has been in place for more than 
30 years, and split run editions of American magazines such as 
<I>Time</I> and <I>Reader's Digest</I> are protected under the bill's 
grandfather clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not about prohibiting imports of foreign magazines into 
Canada. 
After this bill is passed, nothing will be changed.  Foreign 
periodicals will still be imported and will still take up 80% of 
shelf space in English Canada, and account for 50% of magazine 
sales in English Canada. This bill is aimed at preventing unfair 
competition by dumping advertising charges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois understands the concerns expressed by many 
Quebec and Canadian businessmen, who do not want to get caught 
in the crossfire when they are not directly involved in the 
periodicals industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois believes that the United States is using 
these businesses to encroach upon states' rights to pass 
measures favourable to their economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These industries deserve to be given information by the federal 
government on the mechanisms governing international trade so 
that their fear of reprisal will be replaced by informed 
knowledge of the mechanisms for handling international trade 
disputes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois also believes that the rules of international 
trade apply to the US as much as they do to any other country on 
this planet.  The Bloc Quebecois therefore calls upon the 
federal government to continue its negotiations with the US 
representatives, in order to reach a negotiated agreement to 
protect the magazine industry.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I want to 
assure all members of the House that the NDP's lukewarm support 
of Bill C-55 still holds.  It is possibly now stronger due to the 
bullying noises coming from Washington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We still believe the bill is too weak because it does not 
contain provisions to improve the situation for Canadian 
magazines.  We still believe the main premise of the bill is 
false, that the cultural protections offered under NAFTA or by 
the WTO are inadequate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The WTO does not protect culture and the FTA and NAFTA continue 
to remain untested with fatally flawed exemptions for culture. We 
know that half a loaf is better at this time than no loaf and 
therefore we support the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot seems to have happened on the volume front concerning Bill 
C-55 since the heritage committee heard witnesses on the bill. 
The Reform Party has decried this bill, saying we have no need to 
protect culture, that we should simply promote it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are debating today the 21 amendments proposed by the Reform 
Party, amendments that tersely delete ever section of the bill 
until nothing is left.  The amendments to methodically delete 
every trace of the bill seems to reflect its approach to Canadian 
culture, methodically and clinically delete, delete, delete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The irony of this position is that Reform then puts forward 
budget plans which would inevitably decimate the Department of 
Canadian Heritage, the only mechanism in place to promote our 
culture. 
The Reform Party position smacks of hypocrisy and of an 
opportunism that I believe comes painfully close to being 
anti-Canadian.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Americans have turned up the volume by threatening, albeit 
verbally, to countervail steel, plastics, lumber, textiles and 
God knows whatever else if we pass this law.  This kind of 
bullying is not unique.  The committee heard similar threats 
coming from the New York based president of <I>Time</I> magazine 
at the hearings.  He suggested that we were preparing to 
confiscate his property without compensation and compared the 
Canadian government to some old-style communist regime.  I must 
admit that this is the first time I have ever heard this 
particular criticism levelled at this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Reform Party and the Americans believe is that this is 
not about culture but that it is about money.  They think that 
magazines, and music, and books, and videos, and films, and 
paintings, and fragile artifacts are not to be valued as culture, 
they are goods to be priced for sale.  They do not believe that 
writers are creators, but are potential profit centres only if 
marketed properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can categorically say that Canadian culture is not a 
commodity.  Margaret Atwood is not a soap pad.  The Group of 
Seven is not an international trading cartel.  The Canadian book 
publishing industry, a group of visionary business people who 
have made our great writers a possibility, should not be allowed 
to be shipped south as if it were a roll of newsprint. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that only 2% of Canadian film screens show Canadian 
films is not a reflection of the quality of our films, because 
they are excellent.  Instead it is the reflection of the fact 
that Hollywood spends more money promoting a single film than 
most Canadian filmmakers will ever have to produce their films in 
their lifetimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly, this government and the official opposition continue to 
bow at the altar of Jack Valenti and his Hollywood version of 
reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our culture is constantly under attack from south of the border. 
We as parliamentarians have a duty to stand in our places and say 
that we are different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a government which will stand up for our creators, not 
reluctantly pick and choose cultural winners and losers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can see the talk around the current cabinet table:  “This 
time we will hold the line on magazines but we will let books go. 
This time we will have the CRTC promote Canadian content through 
the CBC but we will kill the mother corp with underfunding.  We 
will promote access to Canadian national museums, but we will 
abandon the regional and local museums. We will talk tough on 
trade but do nothing to fix the problems which exist in our 
current trade agreements.  In other words, we will play both 
sides of every cultural issue”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This may be the Liberal way of politics, but our cultural legacy 
deserves the full support of the Canadian government, not half a 
loaf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Culture is something which Canadians have a right of access to, 
not simply because some American conglomerate has decided that it 
may be marketable, but because it has intrinsic value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should promote, but we also have a responsibility to protect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call upon this government not only to draw the line at 
magazines, but also to get active protecting our culture across 
the board.  Do not continue to stand idly by while our book 
publishers are sent offshore with the obligatory nod from the 
Minister of Industry.  Do not further gut the CBC and the NFB to 
shuffle funds to Canadian film producers.  Take action on 
allowing Canadians to see their own product by bringing Canadian 
content to our screens. Do not listen to voices who believe there 
is a price for culture but ignore the value of culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do not believe that the Minister of Canadian Heritage is the 
great protector of culture until the title is earned.  I would 
say that the jury is still out on this minister's legacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, Bill C-55 is something that we will support in the House, 
but we continue to hold our praise for the minister and her 
efforts on Canadian culture.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is a 
pleasure for me to rise before the House to once again speak in 
favour of Bill C-55, the foreign publishers advertising services 
act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-55 is a very important piece of legislation. 
Besides providing much needed support to our Canadian magazine 
publishers, it also sends a clear message to all Canadians that 
we are intent on protecting and maintaining our cultural 
sovereignty in the midst of ever increasing pressure from foreign 
influences.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A desire to protect our cultural integrity has always been a 
major Canadian priority in all business discussions. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The former Progressive Conservative government was always very 
concerned with the protection of our Canadian cultural industries 
which is why during the free trade negotiations we ensured that 
all cultural industries were exempt from the final free trade 
agreement. This exemption was also included in the North American 
free trade agreement. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past three decades, successive Canadian governments 
have brought in legislation aimed at ensuring that Canadian 
publishers have sufficient advertising to maintain their 
competitive edge in the Canadian market. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian publishing industry has prospered during this 
period specifically because of these initiatives.  According to 
Statistics Canada, in 1996-97 there were 1,166 publishers 
producing some 1,552 periodicals with a total circulation of 539 
million copies. The result is that we have revenues reaching the 
billion dollar mark plus 7,000 full time and part time employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian publishers rely on advertising revenue for anywhere 
from 65% to 100% of their income.  Therefore, it is easy to see 
why it is imperative that we intervene to protect them against 
the potential of any unfair competition by our U.S. competitors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government introduced Bill C-55 to help protect our Canadian 
magazine industry following last October's World Trade 
Organization ruling against Canadian imposed excise tax and 
customs tariffs on split-run magazines entering from the U.S. It 
is very important to note that in its decision, the WTO was not 
questioning Canada's right to protect its cultural industries; it 
objected to a policy that directly targeted U.S. magazines. 
Rather than target U.S. magazines directly, Bill C-55 will focus 
its attention on advertising services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially, Bill C-55 will restrict the sale of advertising 
directed at the Canadian market to Canadian publications. It 
should be noted that U.S. magazines can still sell Canadian 
advertising in their magazines so long as these advertisements 
appear throughout their North American publications.  They cannot 
be solely targeted toward the Canadian market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people might be wondering why we should impose measures to 
protect our Canadian magazine industry.  There are a number of 
very important reasons, notwithstanding the fact that each year 
the Canadian magazine industry pumps millions of dollars into our 
economy creating employment opportunities for thousands of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For one thing, many of Canada's most distinguished writers have 
graced our magazines with thoughtful and entertaining stories 
about people, places and things that have helped make our 
Canadian culture unique. More specifically however, Canada's 
magazine industry plays an important cultural role in helping us 
to define who we are as a people and what we stand for as a 
nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A culture defines one's beliefs and values.  We are not 
automatically born with a culture.  We might be born in a culture 
but culture is something we learn.  We need Canada's magazine 
industry to prosper so that future generations of young Canadians 
have the opportunity to learn and appreciate the value of our own 
distinct culture, one that is envied throughout the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the very beginning, the Reform Party has opposed any kind 
of legislation that would call for the protection of Canada's 
unique culture.  Obviously it does not believe we have a culture 
worth protecting.  Well I believe and the Progressive 
Conservative Party believes that Canadian culture is worth 
protecting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Canada was rallying together to show the people of Quebec 
that we very much wanted them to remain part of this great 
country, where was the Reform Party?  Its leader was busy in 
private discussions with the former American ambassador. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More recently, the Reform Party went to the U.S. to hire a kind 
of guru to help cultivate MPs' minds.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party's heritage critic has introduced 21 motions on 
Bill C-55, none of which contains any constructive improvements. 
All the Reform Party wants is the total cancellation of the bill. 
Is the Reform Party blindly following our American friends while 
overlooking our own cultural needs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For months Canadians have been hearing stories about possible 
U.S. retaliation directed toward such Canadian industries as 
lumber and steel if Bill C-55 is allowed to become law. Naturally 
we take these threats very seriously.  Canadians are naturally 
concerned, as I am, of any possible sanctions that might be 
imposed against any Canadian company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why as the Progressive Conservative heritage critic I 
made a point of asking on a number of occasions questions in 
committee, precisely to get assurances from the representatives 
of the Department of Canadian Heritage and the Department of 
Justice that Canada's industries would be protected if indeed the 
U.S. brought challenges before the WTO or NAFTA. I received these 
assurances from departmental staff, as well as from the minister 
herself during yesterday's question period.  As the minister 
stated, Bill C-55 respects every one of our national and 
international obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has one of the most open markets in the world for 
imported magazines.  Imports account for 50% of magazine sales in 
Canada and over 80% of newsstand space according to the Magazine 
Publishers Association. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is not going to close the door on imported magazines. 
It is going to allow our Canadian publications an opportunity to 
continue to compete with other foreign magazines in a very 
competitive industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In April 1993 the first Canadian edition of <I>Sports 
Illustrated</I> successfully circumvented import prohibitions by 
electronically transmitting its magazine to a printer in Canada. 
Essentially this opened the door for unfair competition from U.S. 
publishers who began producing split-run advertising editions of 
their magazines, thus reaping the benefits of repackaging the 
editorial content of their U.S. editions with Canadian 
advertising which they could sell for considerably less than 
their Canadian competitors. This essentially is dumping of U.S. 
magazines in the Canadian market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Advertising has changed more in the last 10 years than it had in 
the previous 60.  This is mostly because of new technology and 
changing markets.  That is why any threat derived through unfair 
predatory practices must be challenged.  Canadian publishers 
need our support to maintain their competitive edge in this new 
global economy. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-55 may not be perfect, but it is my belief that we must be 
strong as a nation and protect our Canadian culture.  That is 
why I will be supporting this bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK191"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak to these 
amendments today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is always a pleasure to remind the ruling party that the 
government's primary duty to the citizens of Canada is to defend 
their fundamental and natural rights and not to strip them of 
these rights by misguided legislation such as Bill C-55. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a little aside before I go any further.  The same 
government that pretends to protect Canadian culture would not 
allow Canadians to indicate on their census forms that they were 
Canadian.  Figure that one out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-55 violates fundamental and natural rights including 
freedom of expression, freedom of contract and property rights. 
Bill C-55 also violates the charter of rights and freedoms and 
the Canadian bill of rights.  Additionally, Bill C-55 has 
violated at least two international treaties including the 
50-year old Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the North 
American free trade agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why were amendments not introduced to deal with these colossal 
oversights?  It is because of politics.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government can run roughshod over individual rights and 
freedoms on the false premise of protecting our culture there is 
something sick with our system of government.  I have said more 
than a dozen times in this House that if we do not change the 
system we will not change much else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-55 should be scrapped, which is what the amendments of my 
colleague intend to do.  It should not be just amended, it should 
be completely done away with.  Bill C-55 makes it unlawful for 
Canadians and Canadian businesses, small and large, to advertise 
in foreign magazines sold in Canada, especially those magazines 
published in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is this legislative sledgehammer supposed to protect 
Canadian culture?  By prohibiting Canadians from advertising in 
American magazines.  The bill actually guarantees that Canadians 
will only see American ads in American magazines, not Canadian 
ads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even a foreign magazine that has published only articles about 
Canada could not sell ads to Canadians.  That is a long leap of 
Liberal logic that is bound to make everyone shake their heads in 
amazement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers cannot sell the grain they have grown with their own 
hands on their own land because of a government enforced 
monopoly.  Now the government is taking away the freedom of 
Canadians to advertise where they think it will do the most good 
for them, for their companies, their employees and their 
shareholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 2 of the charter of rights and freedoms states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone has the following fundamental freedoms: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression, 
including freedom of the press and other media of communication; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Professor Jamie Cameron of Osgoode Hall Law School says that 
this fundamental freedom includes advertising.  The charter 
states that everyone has these fundamental freedoms; everyone it 
seems but Canadians who want to advertise in the magazines of 
their choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through Bill C-55 the government takes away these fundamental 
freedoms for Canadian citizens.  This will undoubtedly be the 
subject of a charter challenge.  Has the government factored this 
into its cost of implementation for this bill?  Has it considered 
what will happen when this unconstitutional law is struck down? 
How much will it cost us? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Violation of the freedom of expression is the first reason this 
bill should be scrapped rather than amended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last December 10 was the 50th anniversary of the adoption of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the United Nations, 
which included ratification by the Government of Canada.  Article 
19 of the universal declaration states:  “Everyone has the right 
to freedom of opinion and expression.  This right includes 
freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, 
receive and impart information and ideas through any media and 
regardless of frontiers”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-55 prohibits the imparting of information and ideas 
through any media.  There it is for the world to see.  Canada 
chastises other countries for violating fundamental human rights 
but it is prepared to violate article 19 of this international 
treaty which it signed 50 years ago.  Violating such a fundamental 
freedom guaranteed in an international agreement will diminish 
respect for Canada and Canadians, and this is the second reason 
that Bill C-55 should be withdrawn rather than amended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-55 violates another international agreement, namely the 
NAFTA.  I would think that the minister of heritage and her 
cabinet colleagues would have learned their lesson when they lost 
the fight and millions of dollars when they arbitrarily tried to 
ban MMT in 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the House will recall that the Ethyl Corporation of 
the United States took the government to court because Canada had 
breached its obligations under the NAFTA.  The NAFTA established 
a compensation process for investors harmed by a government 
failure to meet its NAFTA obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just like Ethyl Corporation, American magazine publishers will 
claim compensation for the advertising dollars they will lose as 
a direct result of the Canadian government's arbitrary 
prohibition of advertising from their Canadian customers.  It is 
estimated that the loss to American magazine publishers will be 
in the neighbourhood of $250 million.  This is money that the 
Canadian taxpayer cannot afford and that the government should 
not put at risk.  That is the third reason Bill C-55 should be 
abolished and not amended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Property rights protect the freedom of individuals because they 
allow people to make their own decisions about how to make the 
best use of their existing possessions, including their labour 
and the fruits of their labour.  In the long run the right to 
make one's own decisions about one's life, one's work and one's 
business is the foundation of dignity and freedom.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to have property rights individuals must have freedom 
of contract, or economic liberty as it is called.  Bill C-55 
takes away Canadians' freedom to enter into contracts with 
whomever they choose.  Bill C-55 takes away everyone's 
fundamental freedom of contract and, as a consequence, violates 
the property rights guaranteed in the Canadian bill of rights. 
That is the fourth reason Bill C-55 should be killed rather than 
amended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>None of these four reasons have been addressed by the government 
or any of the other parties that are criticizing us for our stand 
on this.  I wish they would address these four concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me summarize why Bill C-55 should be killed, scrapped and 
abolished.  First, it violates the charter of rights and 
freedoms.  Second, it violates the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights.  Third, it violates the North American Free Trade 
Agreement.  Fourth, it violates the Canadian bill of rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout Canadian history it has been taken for granted that 
we have freedom of speech and property rights, including freedom 
of contract.  In fact people have come to this country because 
Canada is known for protecting these fundamental freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These freedoms have provided a foundation for the culture that 
has developed on this continent, especially in Canada.  Canadians 
value their property rights and their freedom of speech.  They 
see them as being part of their heritage.  For the government to 
use protection of culture as an excuse for this bill is 
ridiculous.  Any thinking person would realize that this bill 
does the very opposite.  This bill flies in the face of what 
Canadians value most.  It does not protect their culture, it 
undermines it.  The speech I have just given makes that 
absolutely clear. 
<P><A NAME="LINK192"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I am speaking in support of the amendments put forward by our 
heritage critic today for a number of reasons.  Before taking a 
look at the issue on a clause by clause by basis, I will give a 
broad overview, probably best contained most recently in an 
article by Peter Cook in the Wednesday, February 3, 1999 edition 
of the <I>Globe and Mail</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In part he writes: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as the Canadian government thinks its needs a new weapon, 
Bill C-55, to safeguard a threatened cultural sector, the 
magazine industry, so Europeans are taking an increasingly 
nationalistic line with U.S. cultural “imperialism” as it 
applies to them. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this article he is speaking about something the French were 
doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The article continues: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current big transatlantic trade fight is not over culture, 
but bananas.  Still, it is worth noting that the tactics pursued 
by the United States against Canada on magazines and Europe on 
bananas are the same—threatening massive retaliation against 
many unrelated products.  And the Europeans have had culture 
clashes with the Americans before and expect them in future.  At 
one stage, the French held up the Uruguay Round of trade talks in 
an attempt to limit the activities of U.S. entertainment 
companies.  So there is keen interest in what Canada is proposing 
to do on magazines and whether, by restricting advertising, it 
can succeed in making Bill C-55 compatible with world trade 
rules.  Where Ottawa leads on cultural sovereignty, Europe may 
follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The larger question, however, is whether erecting cultural 
barriers works. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course that is the question the Reform Party poses.  In 
answering the question, our answer is no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Cook continues: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it may satisfy those who worry about the powerlessness of 
the nation state, Europe's experience, and Canada's too, is that 
publication bans, audio-visual quotas and content rules raise 
costs and deter quality.  Subsidies to European films cost $600 
million a year; increasingly, they help film makers make films 
that win awards at festivals before going on to bomb at the box 
office. 
Meanwhile, far from encouraging local talent, television quotas 
have led to a profusion of European soap operas and game shows 
that are instantly recognizable as cheap U.S. look-alikes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue for Canadian magazines or French films or Irish music 
is whether competition, and the public interest, is best served 
by this.  And that, to judge by the European record, is doubtful.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill congers up a number of spectres.  I take a look at 
clause 4.  Subclause 4(1) states that the minister may cause any 
investigation that the minister considers necessary to be made 
into an alleged supply of advertising services in contravention 
of section 3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we are going to have magazine cops going around making sure 
that those ads are just exactly what the minister wants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subclause 4(2) states that the minister may designate any person 
to carry out an investigation under this section and shall 
furnish them with a certificate of that designation in the form 
that the minister may specify, and that the investigator shall, 
upon request, produce this certificate to any person in charge of 
a place under investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subclause 5(1) states that an investigator may, under a warrant 
issued under section 487 of the Criminal Code, with any 
modifications that the circumstances require, enter any place and 
make any investigation that the investigator considers necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not being a lawyer, I went to a lawyer and I said “What is 
section 487 of the Criminal Code?  What does it cover?”  Section 
487 of the Criminal Code covers things like going in and looking 
for people who may be in the possession of child pornography.  Of 
course this is available anywhere except in British Columbia, 
thanks to our justice minister.  They can go in and do 
investigations on murder.  They can go in and search for illegal 
weapons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While they are there, under this clause, it was pointed out to 
me that they can also go into computers and take apart any data 
contained in the computer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very broad ranging section of the Criminal Code that the 
heritage minister may choose to enforce this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We then go on to take a look at the whole issue of who the 
minister may choose to go after.  Subclause 7(1), which again we 
have asked be deleted, states that the minister may send a demand 
to a foreign publisher if the minister believes that a foreign 
publisher (a) has supplied advertising services in contravention 
of clause 3 or (b) has entered into a transaction or an 
arrangement that if carried into effect would likely lead to a 
contravention of this act.  Subclause 7(2) states that the 
minister may in the demand require the foreign publisher, without 
delay or within a period specified in the demand, to stop 
supplying the services, and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this is basically saying is that the heritage minister may 
choose to jump all over a foreign publisher.  But by definition a 
foreign publisher would be exactly that, a foreign publisher; 
somebody outside of the immediate jurisdictional constraint of 
this House or of the laws of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the minister may jump on a foreign publisher, the reality 
is that under this bill the government is going to go after 
Canadians who have the temerity to advertise, to use their 
freedom of speech, association and expression in a particular 
publication.  This bill will allow the minister to go after those 
awful Canadians who may choose to advertise in an unsubscribed 
publication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that this bill, although it is under serious 
constraint and is of concern to our trading friends across the 
border, is a far larger threat to the freedom of expression that 
Canadians assume they have under the charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the Reform member who spoke before me.  There can 
be absolutely no question that this bill, if it were to be 
passed, would definitely lead to charter challenges.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There can be absolutely no other way.  The Liberals are famous 
for setting things up for the charter industry, for all the high 
priced lawyers to go after them.  It is just a wonderful way for 
any of the people in the charter industry to make money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reading through this bill is a very scary proposition when one 
realizes that there is little or no problem.  If we take a look 
at <I>Maclean's</I> this week, I dare say that better than 50% of 
the advertising revenue in <I>Maclean's</I> will have come to 
<I>Maclean's</I> from American advertisers.  My friend, our 
international trade critic, will be able to provide us with 
precise numbers on that.  The reality is this is simply a 
constraint in the ordinary process of doing business in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, although the Canadian Magazine Publishers 
Association loves to drag out that 80% of the magazines on the 
stand are foreign magazines, the reality is that there are many 
Canadian magazines that are very successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the <I>Alberta Report</I> and <I>B.C. Report</I> are 
two examples where the majority of their revenue is derived from 
subscription.  There are many ways for magazine companies to 
compete on an level playing field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this government would just get out of its smother love we

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to take part in the debate today at report stage of 
Bill C-55, although I admit I am a little dismayed that we should 
be debating such a bill to begin with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my capacity as the critic for international trade for our 
party, I understand all too well the importance of trade to 
Canada.  Forty per cent of our GDP is derived from exports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada recognized a long time ago, and I suggest that even the 
Liberal government of the past recognized a long time ago, as 
early as 1947, the need for some rules to surround the trade 
issue.  Canada has a relatively small population base and we need 
trade to survive.  It is as simple as that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A third of all the jobs provided in this country are related to 
exports.  That is a simple fact of life.  There is not anybody 
here who is not affected by that fact of life.  Of that, 83% of 
those exports go to United States.  We have this great big trade 
relationship, $1.4 billion a day crossing the Canada-U.S. border 
in a healthy, goodwill relationship.  I submit we need to make 
sure that stays. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that trade relationship, yes, we have some problems with the 
Americans in terms of agriculture from time to time. 
Problems with softwood lumber and other issues present 
themselves.  This is a pretty small problem overall in terms of 
our total trade relationship but to those industries the problem 
is big. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Add to that the steel industry.  It is subject to a lot of 
anti-dumping charges by the U.S. and I do not think they are 
really substantiated.  They have to go through quite a process to 
comply.  The compliance factor is very expensive.  They are 
always on notice that there will be problems with the U.S. on the 
steel industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have come a long way with trade liberalization.  It has been 
recognized worldwide for the last 50 years, largely as a result 
of the second world war.  A number of institutions were built to 
make sure we did not get back into those situations again, the 
World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and of course the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the United Nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
was put in was so that we would not have Balkanization where 
there was no access to markets from other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already made the case why we need that access.  In 
addition, under the free trade agreement with United States and 
the subsequent NAFTA, trade between our two countries has grown 
by over 50% in 10 years. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1705"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That speaks volumes about the need for and the benefit of trade 
liberalization and yet we have a government that as far back as 
1988 fought the free trade agreement.  The minister responsible 
for Canadian heritage was one of the leading proponents of 
fighting the free trade agreement with the United States.  She 
even fought it right up until NAFTA was signed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the Liberal government all of a sudden was elected in 
1993 it said at the time it would not sign NAFTA unless a number 
of important problems were addressed.  It did not do that.  It 
did sign NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if some of the Liberals who fought this so hard are 
really committed to trade and trade liberalization.  It seems to 
me we are seeing today that some of them are not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we need protectionism in our cultural industries?  A number 
of our speakers have already suggested we do not.  I would 
subscribe to that theory.  Our cultural industries need promotion 
just like any other industry.  It needs to be promoted at our 
embassies overseas and through trade missions.  I have no problem 
with that aspect at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a number of areas in culture that stand up very well but 
what we do not want is to have other countries take this same 
type of venue, protectionism, especially the United States.  What 
would happen if the United States told Canada our artists no 
longer had access to Hollywood or Nashville? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at the number of Canadian artists who have developed their 
abilities by having access to that huge American market.  We 
absolutely have to make sure that stays.  This kind of 
legislation is the type we have come to expect from the minister, 
stick your finger in the eye of the United States and give it a 
good gouge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we have from this minister so far?  We have the MMT 
legislation, Ethyl Corporation. We were to ban the sale of MMT. 
It came from the minister.  Of course we had to back down.  The 
American Ethyl Corporation was paid $16 million as a result of 
the heritage minister's misguided policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had the split run legislation on taxation, on duties, that 
went to the World Trade Organization that we lost.  We had the 
endangered species legislation that had to be pulled as an 
embarrassing piece of legislation because the minister was not 
going to take into account the very users in the areas involved, 
forest companies, farmers and ranchers.  We have of course the 
toxic waste situation where S.D. Myers in the United States is 
probably going to sue Canada under the investment chapter of 
NAFTA because the minister decided that toxic waste should not be 
exported to the United States, it should go to northern Alberta 
so we could burn it up there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what we have come to expect but it is not what we should 
expect from a minister of the crown who should be introducing 
responsible legislation.  This issue will come back to haunt us. 
I know the minister has introduced an amendment today, 
essentially backing down, saying this will not be put into effect 
for some time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I noticed the tone of her remarks in question period during the 
last while has really come down a lot.  She is trying to put this 
issue at a lower level, and rightly so.  It should be scrapped 
altogether. The legislation should be scrapped because it is not 
in Canada's best interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I happened to catch a CBC program the other night where a number 
of the minister's own constituents in Hamilton were interviewed. 
The big issue for them is jobs and not whether split runs 
continue to enjoy Canadian advertisers.  It is the fact that 
their jobs may be threatened. The Hamilton steel industry has 
enough problems with the Americans.  We do not have to invent 
phoney ego trip problems by the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the chemical industry, the plastics industry out of 
Toronto and other parts of the country which has had tremendous 
growth into United States, taking advantage of niche 
opportunities in that big American market?  Are we going to kill 
those opportunities now because we risk retaliation from the 
United States? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that if there are any jobs to be lost on this issue 
it should only be one, that of the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
for irresponsible legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does Canada have the right to introduce the legislation? Of 
course we do.  But is it the responsible thing to do?  That is 
the question.  Is it responsible to risk our big trade 
relationship with the United States? 
NAFTA, brought in 1993 and endorsed by the Liberals, says 
Canadians have the right to protect our culture.  It also says as 
part of that agreement that if the Americans are not happy with 
that they have the right to retaliate to an equivalent effect.

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people have estimated that equivalent effect to be $350 
million of Canadian businesses that may be subject to tariffs and 
duties.  Can our steel industry support having duties applied to 
it? We know what has happened to our softwood lumber industries 
in the past when that happened.  It has had a very dampening 
effect on jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems this is sending entirely the wrong message to 
Canadians, that one minister on an ego trip is willing to 
sacrifice the jobs of Canadian farmers, the jobs of Canadian 
steelworkers, Peerless Suits in Montreal which has actually had a 
tremendous niche opportunity and developed a business in the 
United States.  It has developed this because the United States 
took a misguided view of things and put a tariff on wool coming 
into the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have the same tariff.  We have seen the light.  It has 
given Canadian companies in Montreal a tremendous opportunity in 
manufacture in wool suits.  They captured a tremendous amount of 
the American market.  We were not there 10 or 20 years ago but we 
have several billion dollars worth of sales of wool suits in the 
United States.  That shows what can happen when we a view in 
terms of liberalization, in terms of duties and tariffs.  This 
bill should be sunk.  It should have the deep six.  It should go 
to the bottom of Lake Ontario, the same place the minister 
referred to with some of the ships from the war of 1812.  She put 
it in the same category as the American-Canadian battle of 1812 
when American ships were sunk.  That is where this should go, to 
the bottom of Lake Ontario. 
<P><A NAME="LINK194"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, as 
I sat listening to the speeches it really struck me what a menace 
this minister is.  She truly is a menace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we think about the history of the bills and acts she has 
introduced and the actions she has taken in parliament she truly 
is a menace.  Just a short time ago I remember seeing a news item 
on television where she was taking a swim in a polluted part of 
Lake Ontario.  It had been approved safe to swim there. 
Obviously it was not cleaned up enough and corrupted her thinking 
in terms of sensible legislation. I do not know why her cabinet 
colleagues continue to humour her this much, to allow her to 
introduce this type of legislation, especially when we consider 
her history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the minister who introduced a ban on the transportation 
of MMT.  When she could not get the health department to prove to 
her that MMT was harmful she introduced a ban on transportation. 
What could be more ridiculous than that?  No wonder we ended up 
in a fight with the United States over that. It cost us close to 
$100 million by the time the dust settled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we had the flag fiasco. Remember that nonsense the minister 
ran for about a year and a half where she gave away flags, 
putting Canadian businesses out of work.  I had people in my 
riding who make their living selling Canadiana who were begging 
with me to stop this minister from being in competition with 
them, giving away Canadian flags. How much did that cost us in 
the end?  It cost $14 million for a complete fiasco which 
actually put people out of business. There was loss taxation and 
lost jobs on top of the actual cost to the treasury. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The heritage department was reported by the auditor general a 
month ago to be in complete disarray.  It has no idea what it is 
spending the money on or why.  The auditor general gave examples 
of programs that should be in completely different departments. 
For example, the minister's department produced a brochure on 
alternatives to physically disciplining children published in 16 
languages, including French and English.  It is unimaginable the 
waste that goes on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard recently the minister's department gave $80,000 to a 
Montreal publisher to produce a book on blonde jokes.  Another 
example is a conference to discuss promoting science and 
technology programs in schools for a specific racial group.  A 
further program she funded was a conference for aboriginals on 
adolescent issues.

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to ask ourselves, with this sort of history, the actions 
of her department and the bills that are coming in, how we can 
tolerate anything at all that the minister brings before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the example of the previous magazine bill that she 
brought before the last parliament.  What a fiasco that was. 
Although we did not end up with the compensations we had to pay 
for the MMT fiasco, I will bet there were tens of millions of 
dollars in legal fees, human capital, resources, use of copiers 
and travel, all the things that went into that appeal and the 
challenge that took place under NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It appears that everything the minister touches turns to poop. I 
hope you do not mind me saying that, Madam Speaker, but that is 
to put it mildly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It makes me think of the complaints I receive in my riding about 
the CRTC which tries to impose through the minister culture upon 
the people of Canada.  When a new Canadian station starts up, 
whether or not it is even commercially viable, whether it is 
mediocre or excellent, cable users are forced to pay for it and 
it is forced into an unimpaired part of the channel spectrum on 
cable.  Some other channel people were getting before goes into 
the nether regions of space where they have to pay for an 
additional package to get it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know these sorts of complaints come to every member of the 
House.  This is a misguided attempt to force upon people 
something on which they should be able to have free choice.  All 
the things the minister is doing should be based on choice.  The 
people producing them should have to produce excellence instead 
of mediocrity if they want to be accepted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My original home country, New Zealand, went through quite an 
upheaval in the early nineties.  It cut the size of government 
from something like 80,000 federal employees down to about 45,000 
people today.  That does not sound like much by Canadian 
standards but it is for New Zealand, a small country.  Almost 10 
years later it is running with half the people it had in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of the program system it had involved cultural controls, 
subsidies to protect New Zealand culture.  It was exactly the 
same nonsense we have here.  TV and radio stations had to have a 
certain amount of New Zealand content.  With the upheaval in the 
New Zealand economy and the restructuring there was the 
abandonment of that approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After an initial faltering the culture industry in New Zealand 
took off because it offered opportunities for entrepreneurs and 
private people to put money into the system.  It started to 
become excellent instead of mediocre.  It managed to produce 
films like <I>The Piano</I> which was sold worldwide and appeared 
on screens all over the world, something that had never happened 
from New Zealand before.  <I>Mutiny on the Bounty</I> was made 
there as a result of encouragement of culture.  People were 
encouraged to come from the outside and use New Zealand talent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point that I am illustrating is that every attempt the 
minister makes to compel Canadians to go along with her plans to 
absorb more Canadian content is a disaster.  They are a complete 
and utter failure.  They cost us hundreds of millions of dollars 
and achieve absolutely nothing except to make Canadians irritated 
and angry about what the minister is trying to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister should be telling the people making their livings 
off the grants and subsidies she hands out that they are on their 
own.  They should prove to Canadians that they can produce 
excellent quality material and the viewers and readers will come 
and they will be successful.  She is not doing these cultural 
groups any favours at all by giving them constant subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of my colleagues have mentioned that we are threatening the 
billion dollars a day in the trade we do with our biggest trading 
partner all over a few arguments about advertising in magazines. 
It is quite clear, from the way the bill is constructed, that we 
would not just have the Americans challenging us.  We will have 
Canadians taking us to court if the bill is enacted. 
People will ask what right the Minister of Canadian Heritage has 
to stop them from advertising where they want to advertise. There 
will be challenges.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you always enjoy it when I make speech when you are 
on duty.  I am pleased you have taken the chair.  It is a shame 
you were not here before because you missed the best part about 
the minister being a menace and how everything she introduces 
turns to poop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national publicity the bill has received over the last week 
has finally brought some sense to the minister.  She realizes, 
with the uprising in her own riding, that this attempt to protect 
Canadian culture at the expense of everything else is a silly 
fiasco.  If the magazines are worth reading they will be 
purchased by Canadians and there will be advertisers in them. Let 
us get that out of the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to remember as well that only about 5% of all magazines 
sold in Canada are sold off magazine racks.  Yet we hear all this 
weeping and wailing about how 80% of the magazines on the racks 
are from foreigners.  Most of the magazines in Canada are 
delivered through subscriptions or through delivery along with 
the local newspapers or by free drop off at the door. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is plenty of opportunity in magazines for advertisers and 
Canadian content.  In committee representatives of the Canadian 
industry admitted that their biggest competition was from 
Canadian industry, not from across the border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What have we done here?  We have used a great big sledgehammer 
in an attempt to take care of a tiny, little problem that should 
be resolved by people in the industry sitting down with their 
counterparts across the border and seeing if they can work out 
natural trade relationships where they share advertising and 
editorial space.  Let us use creative thinking at the commercial 
level instead of the nonsense that the minister keeps 
introducing.  I urge all members to vote against the bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK195"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will use my time to explain to the government that the 
bill is a time bomb.  The bill is ticking. Even though we have 
temporarily put it on the shelf by order in council the bill will 
explode. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the bill explodes every Canadian will be affected by it, 
not just the people in Hamilton or the people in my constituency. 
The bill will hurt Canadians everywhere, from ocean to ocean to 
ocean.  We are bound to suffer severely from the bill even though 
it has been put on hold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One might ask if it is a heritage bill.  No.  What is the bill? 
Is it a finance bill?  No.  Is it an industry bill?  The minister 
is seeking to control an industry.  Is it a justice bill since it 
is applying the Criminal Code to those people who wish to 
exercise their right of free speech?  Or, is it a foreign affairs 
and international trade bill?  As this time bomb sits there and 
as the bill sits on the shelf there will be severe repercussions 
for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two words cannot be found in the bill.  They are the words 
culture and heritage.  These words do not even occur in the bill.

order.  Will the member opposite be kind enough to indicate to 
which of the motions in Group No. 1 he is referring? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am referring to Motions 
Nos. 1 to 22. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will have trade retaliation.  The government knows it.  The 
Minister of Canadian Heritage knows it.  Backbenchers know it. 
This why the bill will come into force to be fixed by order in 
council.  That is how much they trust their own minister's bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are nine ports of entry into the United States in my 
constituency.  They are all legal.  If an American magazine 
published in Minard was dedicated solely to Canadian geography 
and sold advertising to Canadian advertisers, it would face 
criminal charges.  Can we believe this?  It is true.  The 
magazine would face criminal charges, and I have that happening 
in my own area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know whether the government has clearly thought the 
bill through.  On the other hand, if a magazine owned by a 
Canadian in Estevan writes about vacation spots in the United 
States, it can get advertising from whomever it wishes. This is 
bound to have severe effects on international trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take the western perspective.  A group of people just 
south of the 49th parallel are waiting for some little excuse to 
retaliate.  The first truckload or caravan of cattle turned back 
because of retaliations for this bill will fall right smack in 
the government's lap, particularly in the lap of the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage.  They do not seem to care.  That will happen. 
The time bomb is ticking away on the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me put it in a different perspective.  The bill is more 
restrictive than the Canadian Wheat Board bill.  It is a fact. 
Why is it more restrictive?  The Canadian Wheat Board bill only 
affects the property rights in the west of those who grow wheat, 
but this bill will affect all Canadians everywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the government opposite think for one moment that it should 
restrict American advertising on Canadian TV?  Does it think for 
one moment that a little FM station in Scobey, Montana, should 
not be able to take Canadian advertising or, better still, that 
we should not be able to take from Estevan and advertise in the 
States? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is sheer nonsense.  If we want to see culture grow and 
prosper we should let it compete.  Canadians can compete in any 
area they wish.  They can compete in manufacturing.  They can 
compete in agriculture.  We do not need this international 
squabble looking us in the face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Weyburn and Estevan in my constituency have some very unique 
projects which are running short of funds. They look after people 
who cannot look after themselves. They are both short of about 
$20,000.  We could not get it from here.  Yet, as the hon. member 
mentioned, we find a Montreal publishing firm was given $98,000 
to publish a bunch of dumb blonde jokes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do members think the people out there think?  They ask if 
that is the government's priority?  The answer is yes, that is 
the government's priority.  And, it is all in the name of what? 
Oh, culture.

Bismarck will be subject to prosecution.  It is unbelievable but 
it is true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will not be passed for some time.  There will be 
terrible ramifications.  It will cost us hundreds of millions of 
dollars to get ourselves out of the legal suits.  I would ask the 
government members opposite and the ministers to take this back 
to caucus and do the sensible thing and pull this rotten bill 
right off the list.  Pull it right away.  Get it out of here.  It 
has failed in the past several times. It will fail again but they 
are quite willing to blow a hundred million dollars to try to 
defend it in international courts and they will say that they 
were standing up for Canadian culture. Nobody believes that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us honour the Canadian's right to compete.  Let us not try 
to protect something that can compete. The minister in charge of 
the wheat board would tell us right away that Canadian wheat can 
compete anywhere in the world but this bill says that Canadians 
cannot compete.  I believe they can and I think this government 
is terribly wrong in trying to say they cannot. 
<P><A NAME="LINK196"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I re-emphasize that Motions Nos. 1 to 21 in Group No. 1 
point out that the bill is poorly crafted.  It is a thinly veiled 
attempt to circumvent two unfavourable rulings that Canada 
received at the World Trade Organization tribunals.  It is 
provoking very real trade retaliation from U.S. trade 
representatives and it is offensive to fundamental freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some very practical reasons why I oppose Bill C-55 on 
behalf of the constituents of Selkirk—Interlake. This foreign 
publishers advertising services act will have a large negative 
impact on my riding and on all Canadians.  The minister has said 
words to the effect that this bill is about promoting Canadian 
culture.  I think the minister referred to ensuring that her 
daughter has magazines to read that have Canadian content. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say this bill is really about promoting the heritage minister. 
It is not about Canadian culture at all.  Let us look at this 
promotion.  The protection of what appears to be two major 
publishers in this country is what this whole bill seems to be 
about.  The two that have come to the attention of this House are 
Maclean Hunter and Télémédia Incorporated, two very large 
companies that really have no problem standing on their own or 
competing with others.  I think they would agree this has nothing 
to do with their not being able to compete.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As soon as any country starts to go into protectionism and 
reduce trade the population of that country soon becomes much 
poorer.  Throughout history look at the greatest nations in the 
world like Rome.  We find that the rich nations were those that 
had open and free trade.  They became wealthy. Their citizenry 
became wealthy.  That is what is under attack in Bill C-55.  We 
want to close in among ourselves.  Deal inside Canada.  Keep the 
evil foreigners away, in this case the Americans.  Tomorrow it 
will be the Europeans. The day after that it will be the 
Japanese.  That is what this bill is about.  It is about dollars 
and cents as to its repercussions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Gary Leech, one of the chief executive officers of Manitoba 
Rolling Mills, a steel rolling plant in Selkirk and a subsidiary 
of Gerdau, was so concerned with the possibility of trade 
problems in steel exports from Canada to the United States that 
he sent me a letter outlining the problems he sees will come up. 
Bill C-55 and protectionism is exactly what he does not want.  He 
wants to see the exports that earn large amounts of money for 
Canada continue to flow to the states.  It is a good customer. 
It wants to make these purchases.  There is an example of a 
direct impact on my riding. It is one of the industry items that 
we are exporting that we do not want to see shut down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality check is the harm in trade between Canada and the 
U.S.. It is our biggest customer and we are its biggest customer. 
It would enter into the hundreds of millions.  When we get into 
a tit for tat trade dispute, which is what the heritage minister 
seems to be trying to get us into, it soon turns into billions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At best, the intent of trying to protect a couple of our 
publishers to the tune of a few million dollars is not worth the 
trade costs and problems we will have if this bill gets passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am the chief agriculture critic.  Agriculture is another 
gigantic industry in western Canada, in my riding in particular. 
At present Canadian agriculture and agri-food trade is over $28 
billion a year.  We are not talking a few million for the 
publishing trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I pointed out that Motions Nos. 1 through 21 have very much to do 
with the World Trade Organization talks.  We are coming up to 
those talks.  What we are going to find out is that the trade 
representatives from other countries are going to look at Canada 
and say “Are you putting out bills like Bill C-55 and going into 
a protectionism type mentality?  Our economies are about 10 or 15 
times bigger than yours.  You are going to be the loser”.  We 
will not see that in published print but I guarantee that is 
exactly what we are talking about in the debate today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cost to agriculture could be gigantic.  We are talking about 
an industry of $28 billion in exports a year.  In agriculture we 
depend on trade for our survival.  Right now we see the problems 
of agriculture with reduced exports to other countries and low 
commodity prices.  They are low because the dollars we are able 
earn from trade and the lower exports are hitting families on 
Canadian farms in the pocket book. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not talking about some hypothetical bill, that is really 
does not matter or that it matters to only a few Canadians. 
This matters to everyone.

</I></B></P><P align=left>At present commodity prices have collapsed and in Saskatchewan 
the estimates earlier on this fall were that the drop in income 
could be as high as 70%, Manitoba as high as 45%, Prince Edward 
Island as low as 41% off from past years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of introducing legislation that would ensure a viable 
agricultural sector, this government seems to spend its time on 
Bill C-55.  Bill C-55 will erode our farm markets and will deepen 
the income crisis we are in already. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out that our exports to the United States have been hurt 
by South Dakota and North Dakota which feel that we are 
subsidized, that we are exporting products which are not in 
keeping with their pesticide regulations or other chemical 
regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe Bill C-55 will just add to the frustration of American 
trade negotiators. They will not necessarily say they are 
restricting the movement of grain, cattle or hogs into the states 
because of Bill C-55 but in the back of their minds they will see 
Canadians as unfair traders, people trying to restrict trade and 
put up barriers to the United States and other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the fall the agriculture minister was real big on this.  He 
said don't worry about trade, it is just to do with the elections 
in the United States. When that is over we won't have any more 
problems.  The elections in the United States were over in the 
fall and the trade disputes and the trade irritants got worse. It 
was false that the elections were the cause of the trade 
disputes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On top of all that now we see Bill C-55 which could be looked on 
as the straw that broke the camel's back if passed. I urge all 
members to vote against this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to rise today, not necessarily to have to speak to 
a bill like this, but still to exercise my democratic right as an 
elected representative of the people of Nanaimo—Cowichan to 
continue the debate on Bill C-55 and the amendments proposed by 
my hon. colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to share why I believe those amendments should be passed 
and through the passage of those amendments the bill should be 
entirely wiped out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill has drawn a great deal of controversy and political 
rhetoric over the past several months.  As we all know, what we 
read and hear from the spin doctors and the political posturing 
from the government does not tell the whole story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of the government's and magazine industry's story has been 
that without this bill Canadian culture will be hurt.  I have 
eight children and I do not for a minute think that the passage 
of this bill will protect the kind of culture with which they 
grow up.  I have a little daughter who is going to be eight 
tomorrow.  I wish her a happy birthday.  As a member of 
parliament I may not be there for her birthday.  But I do not 
expect that she is going to ever have her cultural sensitivities 
hurt because this bill passes into law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government said that not to endorse this bill is somehow 
unpatriotic and anti-Canadian.  This is absolute nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe, moreover, that this bill has the potential to do far 
more harm than good for Canada.  If this bill is approved and 
given royal assent the heritage minister is willing to put vast 
portions of the Canadian economy at risk.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister may be willing to risk it all but I wonder, are the 
people who she is affecting willing to risk it all?  I dare say 
that if we asked the logger, the sawyer, the pulp and paper 
worker in the British Columbia forest industry, we would find 
that they are not willing to take this risk. They have already 
paid dearly in the downtrodden economy of British Columbia.  They 
have already paid with layoffs and downturns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding of Nanaimo—Cowichan has traditionally been a large 
producer of forest products with many people employed in that 
industry.  I can guarantee that they are not willing to put any 
more of those people at risk through a bill like this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the minister of heritage is willing to ask the 
farmers across the prairies who have already seen a price drop in 
grain whether they are willing to risk their livelihood further. 
Farmers are already facing many natural calamities from drought, 
frost and hail without built-in disasters that are imposed by 
their own federal government. Many farmers are already facing a 
disaster from this federal government by hearing that the cheque 
is in the mail when in fact it is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the minister would be willing to listen to the response 
of the many people who depend upon work in the steel, textiles or 
plastics industries which stretch across southern Ontario and 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of these businesses have carved their place in the market 
in spite of major international competition.  Are they willing to 
risk it all based upon the false premises of this bill?  I 
suggest that they are not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the heritage minister asks the House to pass this 
legislation, there are major risks and very real consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States has clearly stated its own position on this 
matter.  I do not want to be misunderstood here; I believe in 
Canadian sovereignty and I strongly believe in national unity. 
But there are many issues and times that I feel this government 
has acquiesced to the sabre rattling and scare tactics of our 
neighbours south of the border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overall our U.S. neighbours are good neighbours and I agree they 
cannot dictate Canadian policy.  However, our ambassador to the 
United States met with me and a group of parliamentarians which 
incidentally included members of the government in Washington 
last week. The government members should listen to this.  Among 
other things, we discussed this bill and its consequences to 
Canadian-U.S. relationships. The ambassador warned us not to get 
into a situation where a trade war would erupt because when all 
is said and done, we know who the losers would be. Here is a man 
who has his ear to the ground in Washington.  I really wonder 
whether our government has been listening to him. I do not think 
so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other instances.  I believe that the minister of 
fisheries has a lot to account for in the handling of our west 
coast fish stocks.  Where was the nationalism of this government 
when our west coast fishermen were being stopped from reaping 
their livelihood and were forced to watch from the sidelines as 
Alaskan fishermen ran their nets and lines down to pull up our 
Canadian salmon?  It was not found anywhere on the west coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where was the strength of the government when the British 
Columbia forest industry was facing sanctions and tariffs by the 
lumber industry of the United States?  It was nothing but 
weak-kneed action that I would see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has a lot of very mixed up priorities. On the 
issues when the government could have made a difference and truly 
stood up for national sovereignty, the Liberals were nowhere to 
be found. On the issues that involve the jobs and livelihoods of 
thousands of individuals and businesses alike, they are prepared 
to take enormous risks.  This seems to be out of step with what 
Canadians really desire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that Canadians want to have opportunities to work, 
opportunities to move ahead in their lives and to not be faced 
with regressive and hidden taxes every time they try to make a 
step forward.  This bill does not meet those kinds of objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In doing some rough calculations, the total trade that Canada 
currently does with the United States is approximately $365 
billion, a billion dollars a day.  That is a huge number. The 
annual advertising market that Bill C-55 is designed to address 
totals about $400 million.  This is just over one-tenth of one 
per cent.  In comparison, the value of the goods for wheat, 
metals, alloys, chemicals, plastics, fertilizers and forest 
products that Canada exports to the United States totals $76.98 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The heritage minister is willing to risk 21% of our trade with 
the United States for the sake of this bill. 
This is a far greater risk than I believe the stakeholders in 
these industries are willing to take. This bill is fraught with 
misconceptions and bureaucratic doublespeak.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On Tuesday, February 9 the heritage minister was asked if Bill 
C-55 was an ironclad piece of legislation that could survive any 
possible U.S. challenge to the WTO or the NAFTA and to confirm 
that it conforms with Canada's charter of rights.  The minister's 
reply was that it is the position of the government that this 
bill respects every one of our national and international 
obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the WTO handed down two rulings last year which found 
the provisions under previous magazine advertising legislation to 
offend the GATT.  We were not receiving a straight bill of goods 
on these most important questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill also has possible ramifications for our charter of 
rights and freedoms.  Through the enactment of this bill, 
Canadian advertisers will be banned from selling their goods and 
services in foreign magazines.  Is the minister telling Canadian 
advertisers that when it comes to freedom of speech, something we 
all hold in high favour, that these people are second class 
citizens?  I certainly hope this is not what it will come to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been told this bill is to protect our Canadian culture. 
My read of this bill does not show the word culture anywhere in 
its writings.  What this bill has is the workings and markings of 
protectionism and will likely fail when challenged at the World 
Trade Organization through the GATT. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been told that this bill is intended to protect Canadian 
advertisers from cheap American advertising dollars creeping into 
split-run magazines.  In fact, Mr. John Tory of Rogers 
Communications, which owns Maclean Hunter and publishes 
<I>Maclean's</I> magazine, recently appeared before the heritage 
committee.  At the heritage committee he admitted that magazine 
publishers' biggest competition for advertising dollars is from 
Canadians.  It does not make sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the item that causes me the most concern in this bill is 
the addition of the magazine police.  Are we going to have them 
all over the place?  I suspect so if this bill goes through.  I 
believe this legislation is wrong.  I do not believe that the 
Canadian public is supportive of this legislation and I certainly 
am not.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know that 
unlike my colleagues across the way, you have been waiting for 
some time for my intervention and I hope I do not disappoint. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first thing I have to say and which is patently obvious to 
most of us in the House and most Canadians at this point in time 
is that the heritage minister's ego and arrogance know no bounds. 
It is becoming clearer to Canadians all the time.  She has 
demonstrated this over and over again. Let me give this House 
some examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alongside this bill, what has the minister got for a track 
record?  She has the GST promise.  She has the— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  It is my understanding that members on either side of the 
House have to address the motions that are on the floor.  Would 
you please invite the member to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am sure that the hon. member for 
Skeena is going to address the 21 amendments that are before the 
House at this time.  I am sure he was just warming to a theme. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is indeed the case.  I 
am amazed.  My friend across the way must be blessed with ESP to 
know what I was going to say as I just rose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to relate this bill to other things the minister has done 
to show the arrogance and the egotistical approach she has to her 
job.  I can talk about the MMT, the GST, the flag giveaway, and 
as my colleague mentioned the $98,000 for a book on dumb blond 
jokes, which incidentally was just before she had her hair dyed. 
She demonstrates little concern for the economic wreckage she 
leaves behind her with all of these initiatives.  This bill is a 
case in point.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister professes to care about national unity.  She 
professes to care about keeping Canada together.  Then she 
introduces a piece of legislation such as Bill C-48 which I 
suggest is going to do more to divide and anger Canadians than 
anything the minister has done before.  We will see the fruits of 
her labour not too far down the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is amazing is that the Prime Minister continues to let the 
heritage minister prance around without a leash leaving 
unpleasant little surprises for us all over the place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger:</B>  Mr. Speaker, on a point of 
privilege.  This is probably the toughest afternoon I have ever 
had in my life listening to the nonsense from across the way, but 
when it degenerates to personal insults directed at members of 
the House I am amazed that the Chair tolerates that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The Chair is mindful that members do 
sometimes make personal comments.  While some may regard them as 
in poor taste, I do not think that intervention by the Chair is 
required unless the comments are unparliamentary.  I have not 
heard comments that under the rules appear to be unparliamentary. 
A matter of taste is a matter of taste and I leave members to 
exercise their own restraint. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Reform members seem to be the main ones who are trying to shed 
some light on the problems of the bill. We are continually being 
interrupted.  Could I suggest that perhaps it might be in order 
if the hon. member across the way has so much to say that he take 
a place on the speaking rotation instead of interrupting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I think the comments on both sides 
are indicative of the fact that perhaps there is not complete 
agreement on all the terms of the bill.  The Chair is not in a 
position to adjudicate on what I regard as perhaps not well taken 
points of order or questions of privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it would be easier for us on 
this side and certainly easier for me to proceed with my 
intervention and to keep the personal comments to a minimum if my 
colleagues on the other side were not engaging in this kind of 
heckling in debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The case before us is really important.  Canada's trade with the 
United States is huge.  Eighty per cent of our trade is with the 
United States.  We need them and they need us.  It is a very 
important trade relationship.  We need them very badly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The magazine issue as an economic matter does not even register 
on the scales in terms of economic importance.  It is not 
important in terms of our economy.  Issues like steel, softwood 
lumber and other trade relationships that we have are vital to 
the future of the country and vital for the province I come from 
and vital for the constituents I represent.  We have a huge trade 
in softwood lumber with the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By introducing this bill, the minister is indicating that she is 
willing to put at risk those jobs and those industries and that 
trade relationship for the sake of her ego.  It is irresponsible 
in the extreme. She is willing to put our entire trade 
relationship with the United States at risk over an issue that 
does not even register on the scales economically.  Someone 
should run out and buy the minister a calculator.  She should 
become acquainted with the numbers and maybe then she would pause 
and change her mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister and the government show so much concern for 
magazines.  If the Liberals are that concerned about the trade 
relationship with the United States and protecting Canadian 
businesses, why do they not do something about fish? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people in my riding particularly from the Prince Rupert and 
the Queen Charlotte Island areas are in deep trouble because of 
our trade relationship and because of the fact that the 
government has been totally ineffective at negotiating any kind 
of an agreement with the Americans on the Pacific salmon dispute. 
It was totally ineffective in even bringing up the issue, and 
totally ineffective in even trying to make this a priority 
because the Liberals do not consider it to be a priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to magazines, oh yes it is a national issue but 
when it is Pacific salmon, that is a regional issue, a B.C. 
issue.  It does not matter.  It does not register on their 
scales, or the minister's scales.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the concern for the sports fisherman, the aboriginal 
fisherman and the commercial fishermen who have lost their 
livelihoods?  That is a heritage issue.  These people, 
particularly in the commercial industry, have lost and are in the 
process of losing a way of life because of government inaction 
and inability or unwillingness to deal with that very crucial 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province I come from does a tremendous amount of trade with 
the Americans on softwood lumber.  I cannot begin to say how many 
communities in my riding, never mind businesses, depend on trade 
in softwood lumber for their sustenance, for their livelihoods. 
Families depend on a paycheque so they can make their mortgage 
payments, buy groceries, put their kids through school and have 
some kind of future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is willing to put that at risk over an issue that 
does not even register on the economic scale.  The minister is 
willing to put at risk thousands of jobs in the steel industry in 
Ontario over an issue that does not even register on the economic 
scale.  The minister is willing to put her ego and agenda ahead 
of the best interest of Canadians.  I am frankly appalled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at my colleagues across the way.  They just do not 
understand that real lives and futures are on the line.  If they 
would choose to venture out of Ontario and come to my riding in 
northern British Columbia they would see for themselves the 
economic devastation that northern communities in British 
Columbia have faced over the last couple of years.  Then maybe 
they would not be so quick to criticize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see window dressing action on the part of the minister that 
is designed to try to persuade Canadians she is concerned about 
our country and out there doing something.  She is really out 
there attempting to exacerbate the problems my constituents 
already have in the industries in which they are employed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the heritage minister being this way because she 
has demonstrated a track record in this regard for a long time. 
What I cannot understand is how her caucus, her fellow cabinet 
and the Prime Minister will let her continue with putting at risk 
hundreds of millions of dollars of trade with the United States 
every year over an issue which basically does not even register 
on the economic scale and is not important to most Canadians.  I 
frankly do not think most Canadians are concerned about the issue 
the minister is trying to address. I am appalled that the 
minister is willing to put everything else on the line over this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the heritage minister and the government were really serious 
about standing up for Canada's interest, they would get off this 
issue which for most Canadians does not even register and address 
some other issues like softwood lumber and Pacific salmon which 
they have done absolutely nothing meaningful about for five years 
now, ever since I have been in this place.

Speaker, I note once again that Liberal members across the way 
have the opportunity to officially join in this debate at any 
time but would rather snipe from the sidelines.  Of course, that 
is understandable.  They have nothing concrete to add.  They have 
nothing substantive to say so all they can do is hurl little 
insults or stand there and nod like drinking birds.  It is kind 
of interesting.  If they had something to say I am sure the 
Canadian public would listen, but as it is they have already 
declared the merit of the bill by their silence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at what is really happening with the bill.  I have 
just completed a round of town hall meetings in my riding.  I 
have talked about how legislation works in the House.  I have 
explained that only the government writes legislation and that 
sometimes it writes good legislation which we support. 
In fact we work with them to get it through the House as quickly 
as possible because it might be long overdue.

bad, and we say we will fight it unless the government agrees to 
fix it up.  Every now and again it comes out with some 
legislation that is so bad it is absolutely unfixable.   We are 
close to that with this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is actually one more category.  Every now and again it 
comes out with legislation that just does not make sense.  We 
fight it if it is bad.  We may not agree with it but at least we

why it might come out with such legislation?  Let us look at the 
legislation before us.  We are only talking about two big 
corporations that stand to have any possible benefit.  The rest 
of the publishers in the country are asking what it is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would the government do that?  It was not overly rich back 
in pre-1993 but it got all kinds of contributions from big 
corporations.  I wonder if there will be a marker out there after 
its slides this piece of garbage through the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Do you think so? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk:</B>  It is entirely possible that is what this 
is about.  I certainly cannot think of any other reason for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sole speaker, I think it was, on this debate from the 
Conservative Party raised the issue of dumping.  It was an 
interesting point.  That is what the government is claiming.  In 
essence that is what it is claiming the American companies are 
doing, that they are dumping product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not need legislation for that.  We already have it.  If 
that is what it thinks is occurring it should follow the rules 
that are already in place.  If it is not really dumping then it 
cannot very well follow those rules.  There goes another excuse 
for the Liberal Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals talk in terms of what the Americans are doing in 
Canada, that they are running Canadian ads in their magazines. 
Did it ever occur to them that Canadians want to be able to run 
those ads?  That is how they sell to their market.  Have they 
ever thought of the impact on Canadian producers?  God forbid, 
they have enough trouble nowadays with Liberal taxation policies. 
Now they cannot even advertise their overpriced products, 
overpriced because they have had to pay so much in taxes and 
wages trying to keep their employees above the starvation level 
as the Minister of Finance takes their paycheque away from them. 
Now they want to take away their ability to advertise in the 
magazines and publications of their choice.  It is absolutely 
crazy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at some of the other potential impacts of the bill. 
If one walks up to somebody and punches him in the nose he tends 
to try to defend himself. If the little giant walks up and tries 
to do something to the United States, guess what it will do?  It 
will defend itself.  It will say that we are being unfair to its 
companies.  There are rules in place.  If the government thinks 
they are dumping it should follow them.   If it does not have the 
temerity to follow that route then it is wrong and retaliations 
start. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kinds of things will the Americans retaliate on?  We have 
talked about how it might be dumping.  The government thinks this 
is dumping and it needs this action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the western part of my riding in the Okanagan Valley lot of 
orchardists, particularly those growing apples, are going 
bankrupt.  One of the problems they have is real dumping by the 
American market into the Canadian market.  American orchard 
farmers, apple farmers, have a completely different set of 
policies to follow and different levels of subsidization so they 
dump into Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the government concerned about that?  No.  They are little 
apple orchardists who do not contribute enough to the Liberal 
Party to merit concern about that kind of dumping. However, a 
couple of big publications might affect the Liberal coffers so it 
had better do something.  It creates a bogeyman and goes out to 
save them even though nobody else thinks they are in danger in 
the first place.  It is interesting.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the softwood lumber industry it has been suggested the 
Americans may look for some form of retaliation.  I come from a 
forest reliant riding.  That is our major employer.  We had 
agreements with the United States and it tried doing the very 
thing the Canadian government is now talking of doing in the case 
of this magazine situation.  What did we do?  We just acquiesced. 
Maybe that is why they thought the Americans would do that in 
this case, but they did not acquiesce.  They came out with an 
insane softwood lumber quota system and the government said “Hot 
damn, where do we sign?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All kinds of people in my riding have had problems.  I have 
talked to people in the softwood lumber industry about how this 
started and how they tracked it.  When this started they admitted 
they had no idea of how it was going to work but they just had to 
do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding has been hurt by the softwood lumber quota. As if it 
were not bad enough the way it started, they said here is the 
quota and here is how it will work.  A lot of people were really 
opposed to it.  Some said the government is too weak-kneed to 
support them in any other way.  At least if they got a little 
stability, even though they would be cut way back, they would 
know what they could count on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every year for the last three years a lot of the big lumber 
producers in my riding have been cut back further on the softwood 
lumber quota.  They are hanging by their fingernails right now on 
the verge of shutting down.  They are very close to it.  We are 
waiting to see what happens with the quotas coming out in the 
spring.  If there is another cut, it will wreak havoc on the 
west. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course the Liberal Party does not care.  That is Reform 
country so why should it do anything for western companies.  Then 
it has a western tour to try to determine why it does not get any 
support in the west.  We do not have to look very far for the 
reasons for that.

producers, it might be the straw that breaks the camel's back and

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-401, an 
act to amend the Holidays Act (Flag Day) and to make 
consequential amendments to other acts, be read the second time 
and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise today 
to discuss Bill C-401.  This is not the first time I have 
introduced this legislation.  It is not even the first time that 
similar legislation has been presented before the Chamber. I had 
an identical bill in the previous parliament that was votable but 
unfortunately it died on the order paper when the election was 
called. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For members here and for those watching us tonight, some may 
immediately jump to the obvious conclusion that there is such a 
thing as a flag day.  Flag day is the third Monday of February or 
February 15.  My legislation talks about making it the third 
Monday. Flag day is recognized on the February 15, which is the 
very day the flag rose over our nation in 1965 for the first 
time.  Indeed the current Prime Minister proclaimed a day called 
flag day. 
The difference between that and my bill is that my bill seeks to 
make flag day a national holiday.  That is to say that people 
would have the day off work to celebrate this event.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The background of this has a lot of history in this Chamber.  It 
goes back as far as 1980 when my colleague in a previous session, 
Warren Allmand, presented a bill much the same as this.  Back in 
those days they called this heritage day and indeed we have a 
heritage day as well which falls on the third Monday of February. 
This of course causes some confusion among people.  I look at 
flag day as being a culmination of heritage day to recognize the 
heritage of all cultural groups in Canada under one flag. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is a string of similar suggestions by the New 
Democratic Party.  Stanley Knowles presented this legislation at 
one time, as did Ian Deans.  A special consideration for my 
former professor.  I have a bachelor of commerce degree but I 
always took political science just down the road here at Carleton 
University and in those days my political science professor for 
about three of those years was Dr. Pauline Jewett, which I know 
rings a happy note with some of my colleagues across the way.  I 
can say that Dr. Jewett was somewhat responsible for leading me 
into the area of politics.  It took a long time for me to 
remember some of her words and come back to this place, but it is 
in somewhat of her honour that I am able to stand in my place and 
present her very bill, although I now call it flag day as opposed 
to heritage day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, sitting on either side of you is the Canadian flag. 
I have been very happy, every day I have been in the House, to 
wear this lapel pin, the Canadian flag.  I have been very proud 
of my country and its symbols. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The flag is more than a simple piece of coloured cloth. It is 
the epitome of who we are as a country.  It is a symbol.  Canada 
is very much a young country.  For some of us 1867 may seem like 
a long time ago but in reality, when we compare it to countries 
like Greece or European countries, our history is quite young. 
It is very important that a country, as it is evolving, evolves 
symbols of its unity as symbols of its people.  I do not think 
there is any stronger symbol in Canada than our flag. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know all of us have travelled to foreign countries and there 
is no question of the identity, when one is wearing that flag, of 
who one is, where one is from. Most important, it is not about 
geography, it is about what kind of people that represents, 
caring people who created this incredible country on the north 
half of the North American continent, the second largest 
geographical country in the world with tremendous democratic 
traditions over a short period of time. It has become the envy of 
the world.  The Prime Minister often refers to the United Nations 
accreditation that Canada is deemed the best country in the world 
for its social services and so forth.  This is really about 
agreements that we make with one another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was talking to some Cape Bretoners last night. Taxation came 
up.  I said people like to talk about Ottawa, about money coming 
from Ottawa and going to Ottawa, but in reality what is really 
happening is that these are all agreements we make among 
ourselves.  We agree in this place to share money with other 
citizens of this country for a variety of reasons.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think these are the great things that Canada is about and why 
this symbol is so important to me and the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The flag debate has had a great tradition.  I was a little 
younger but I can remember the flag debate in the House.  I can 
remember the very day the flag went up the flagpole on this 
Chamber.  Governor General Georges Vanier, Lester Pearson and 
hundreds of thousands of Canadians watched that momentous event. 
I also remember at that time the leader of the official 
opposition, Mr. Diefenbaker, with a tear in his eye watching the 
red ensign come down.  It was a traumatic event in our history. 
It was a recognition of how we had changed.  It was not about 
throwing out our old traditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of people get involved in the monarchy thing. They always 
think we are tearing something apart.  We are throwing something 
in the garbage.  Our history cannot be stolen.  Nobody can steal 
our traditions.  What we can do is build on the strength of those 
traditions and move forward.  I believe that is what the flag 
does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not argued why I feel this should be a national holiday 
which is significantly different from what the Prime Minister did 
only a short few years ago.  It should be a national holiday 
because it is a time that Canadians can reflect on their 
heritage, their culture and the things that make this a great 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know some people will suggest what is Canada Day if not that. 
I agree.  Canada Day is another similar day on which we recognize 
our country.  But flag day is unique in that it marks the 
evolution of our country in 1965.  An argument a lot of people 
will bring is that we cannot afford flag day.  That is another 
day off.  People will not be working.  Employers will have to pay 
for it.  That is a lot of the argument brought up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To give a comparison, Australia has 11 statutory holidays; 
Austria, 12; Finland, 12; France 11; our chief trading partner 
the United States, 11; Canada, only 10.  In the scheme of things 
we can see there is room for another national holiday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will touch very briefly on the cost of that.  It is a fair 
question and people are going to raise that issue.  I have made a 
basic estimate of the labour costs for that national holiday of 
$1.5 billion.  People will say that is a lot of money in lost 
productivity.  It represents .16% of our economic activity.  More 
important, it does not attempt to analyse what economic benefits 
would be gained by a national holiday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members may ask what benefits could there possibly be. Everybody 
will be sitting at home or hopefully going to flag day 
celebrations.  How is that going to have an economic impact?  I 
do not have to tell the House that we have Winterlude going on 
right now in Ottawa.  People would use this to promote tourism 
and events and celebrate the flag. When people do that they have 
a tendency to go out and spend some money and so forth.  So there 
is a direct economic benefit to Canadians to have this national 
holiday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very timely that we are having this debate because Monday, 
February 15 is flag day. The time between New Year's Day and the 
next holiday, Good Friday, is about 91 days.  In other words, it 
is over three months without a holiday. 
Many of my constituents and other people have said we need a 
break in the middle of winter. Winters are long and the days are 
short.  It would be nice to celebrate our country and make 
something very important about that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have mentioned Canada Day.  One problem I have with Canada Day 
is that it is in the middle of the summer.  Invariably the very 
people we want to interest in this cultural evolution are our 
youth.  Unfortunately they are out of school at the cottage or 
wherever and Canada Day kind of works but it does not work as 
well as I think it could. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why in my own riding I have been promoting flag day.  It 
started off with one school the first year that the Prime 
Minister proclaimed that day.  We went to the school and had a 
ceremony.  We raised the flag and we talked about the great and 
wonderful things in this country.  It was a wonderful thing to 
watch all these students with their Canadian flags singing O 
Canada.  They were very proud of their nation and about who they 
are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a teacher retiring.  He was 55. He said “That is the 
culmination of my career.  I have never been so proud to be a 
teacher at this school as this day”. That tells something about 
the emotion people feel about this event. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have attempted with the help of the people on the school board 
to promote this because it is such a wonderful thing.  Now it is 
at the point where I cannot go to all the flag day ceremonies in 
my riding.  My whip is annoyed with me and other members as well 
because I will be away on Monday.  I have three ceremonies that I 
am going to. Our biggest problem is supplies. We have to find 
hundreds and hundreds of paper Canadian flags. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a great event because we talk to those young people about 
the importance of Canada because it is their country. Clearly 
they are going to be the inheritors of this great nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all getting a little older and one of these days we are 
not going to be here.  It is these young people who will step 
forward in our place and advance the cause of Canada. It is to 
these people that we are trying to promote the importance of this 
great nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We just had a debate on Bill C-55.  I do not really want to get 
involved in that, but that is the whole issue that we are talking 
about, Canadian culture and our identity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think I have touched on most of the points that I wanted to 
raise.  I wish this were a votable motion.  I think it is a very 
important issue for all Canadians to identify the symbols which 
unite them as a nation and to honour them and make them even more 
important in their lives.  If all of us did that on a day to day 
basis this would be a greater country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see some of my colleagues from the Bloc looking at me very 
auspiciously. It is a great experiment that we are all involved 
in here.  We cannot unite under monarchial flags.  It is time to 
realize we have a central purpose in this country and that is our 
flag.  Our flag identifies that purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close on that and I hope we have a very nourished debate 
about what I consider a very important issue. 
<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
delighted to stand in the House today to speak about what it 
means to be a Canadian and to speak about the Canadian flag. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no small touch of history in this place with respect to 
the flag.  I suppose therefore it was rather natural when this 
bill came forward that I was the one selected from our party to 
respond to it in this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am really curious about this bill because of the fact that I 
am probably known both among my friends and among my colleagues 
here in this place as being a very proud and a very grateful 
Canadian. It never leaves my mind.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Often I think how grateful I am that way back in the early 1920s 
both my grandfathers, although they did not know each other at 
the time, and my parents, who also did not know each other at the 
time, made the decision to flee Russia and make Canada their 
home.  We sometimes complain about the rate of taxation here, but 
over in Russia they paid 100%.  They left everything they had and 
fled to preserve their lives.  They chose to make Canada their 
home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My grandparents have been gone for some 30 years, but I remember 
going to my grandparents' place.  My grandmother, in particular, 
many times, both in speech and in her prayers, expressed 
gratitude for the wonderful country in which we lived.  She, my 
grandfather, my uncles and aunts shared many of their experiences 
in the old country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is quite remarkable because growing up on a farm in 
Saskatchewan in the 1940s and 1950s we were actually quite poor. 
We had very little of what we would call worldly goods. Yet here 
we were in this wonderful country.  I suppose the feature they 
liked the most was the freedom which we enjoy here, the 
opportunity to work and provide not only for ourselves as a 
family but also to share with others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a value that has been deeply ingrained into my thinking 
over all of these years and one which hopefully I have 
transmitted to my children.  Hopefully they will transmit it to 
their children, since I now have three grandchildren.  I shall 
take the opportunity, when they are old enough to understand, to 
explain some of our family history and to bring them to the place 
where they are not only proud Canadians but also, as I am, a 
deeply grateful Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are discussing the issue of having a flag day, a special day 
to honour our flag.  I too am old enough to remember quite 
clearly the time when the Canadian flag was brought in.  As a 
matter of fact, on Monday, February 15, 1965 I happened to have 
been a grade 11 student in a small town in Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also remember the great degree of opposition there was to the 
flag, especially in that part of the country in which I live. 
The opposition was primarily from people who had fought under the 
old Union Jack, people who were involved in our great wars, as 
they are called, in which Canadians participated, many giving 
their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember one of our neighbours, a person by the name of Mr. 
Payne.  He had a permanent limp as a result of an injury he 
suffered in the war.  I do not remember him specifically, but it 
was that kind of person who had some considerable objection to 
the changing of Canada's symbol because of what the old symbol 
meant to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our Canadian flag is not without its history.  The flag that we 
have now, the Maple Leaf, is a flag of which I believe we are all 
proud.  We have made that transition.  I am grateful to say that 
my family is now totally accepting of the Canadian flag.  We are 
very happy that we have a symbol such as this to unite us as a 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not long ago I thought about the Canadian flag as being one of 
the very few things that universally ties us together.  There are 
some who say it is our health care system.  Yet the trouble with 
which our people are viewing the health care system now is such 
that it is hardly a great unifying force in our country.  The 
health care system is in deep trouble, primarily because of the 
fact that the commitments made by the federal government at the 
time when it was brought in have greatly eroded. 
Consequently, while the Liberals particularly love bragging about 
the health care system, and we all wish we had a good one, due to 
their change in fiscal priorities over the years it is in great 
trouble.  Therefore, I do not think our health care system can be 
said to tie us together.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have other symbols.  For example, the governing party of 
Canada.  Does it unify us?  As I recall, it got about 39% of the 
popular vote in the last election.  That means that approximately 
60% of Canadians probably would not view the present Liberal 
government as being a unifying force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have other symbols, such as our governor general.  Yet when 
we realize that the governor general is but a token appointment, 
a patronage appointment of a current prime minister, then that as 
a unifying force is substantially diminished.  I do not want to 
in any way denigrate the position or the person.  However, it is 
not a huge unifying force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then I think of Her Majesty the Queen.  I have spoken to a 
number of people in the last couple of years and, very frankly, a 
lot of people have shown genuine regret over some of the problems 
that have beset the royal family in England.  There is a genuine 
concern and a compassion for some of the things they have gone 
through.  Yet if we ask whether we are unified around our 
allegiance to the Queen, that too falls short. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose we could come to the conclusion that the Canadian flag 
is probably the strongest unifying symbol in the country today. 
There may be some others that I have not thought of.  However, I 
went through a small list of different unifying symbols or forces 
and probably the Canadian flag is the strongest one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question at hand is:  Should we have a day once a year 
proclaimed as flag day?  Should we have a statutory holiday in 
which everybody would make a special effort to celebrate Canada 
and that national symbol, the Canadian flag? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have great problems with a motion of this nature for one very 
simple reason.  To explain it I want to give a little analogy. 
There was a young fellow who was asked in church to sit down by 
his father, but he kept standing.  His father put his hand on his 
shoulder and said “Sit down” and the boy stood again.  Finally 
the father, very firmly, said “Sit down”.  At that point the 
young lad turned to his dad and said “I may be sitting on the 
outside, but I am standing on the inside”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that is a rather good illustration of what it means to 
fly the Canadian flag.  If we bring in legislation that says “On 
this day you will fly the flag and you will do this”, it almost 
smacks of political or government manipulation of a desired 
behaviour.  I think it is meaningless unless it comes from deep 
within. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I think of the stories my grandfather told.  They were 
legislated into allegiance to their country.  At the first 
opportunity they left because it just went on and on until they 
lost all their personal freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I in no way suggest that this bill takes away any freedom.  I am 
saying that the idea of legislating a day to promote the flag 
leaves a hollow ring, at least with me.  I think the much better 
way is to have people fly the flag with pride and with honour 
because of the fact that deep within, hopefully like me, they are 
proud and grateful to be Canadian.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Mitis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I also 
have the opportunity to rise in the House to speak to the bill 
before us, which aims at adding a holiday to celebrate the flag. 
We already have a flag day.

<A HREF="#LINKT56"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in fact a sad day in Canada's history, because the first 
day we celebrated this flag day, we recalled that the Prime 
Minister had shaken up a demonstrator by grabbing him by the 
throat.  And the Minister of Canadian Heritage, without knowing 
who the person was, called him a sovereignist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So flag day has a bit of a blot on it in our history.  Memory 
being what it is, I hope one day that we will have happier 
memories in this regard about Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard some rather unconvincing arguments on the subject 
of making this day a holiday, first, because the third Monday in 
February would make a fine holiday.  If people are tired, 
collective agreements provide for sick days so they can take a 
day off if they need to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reading week happens about the same time, a week later.  So 
there are holidays the following week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some have said that other countries mentioned have 10, 11 or 12 
holidays.  They probably have much more important events to 
celebrate than flag day.  I for my part know of no country that 
gives everyone a day off just to celebrate the flag. 
When the argument is made that this might cost $1.5 billion in 
work time, we say that it is meaningless, that the amount 
involved is negligible in relation to the revenue generated by 
all these workdays. I think these kinds of arguments are not 
very serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard another argument, saying “There is Canada Day, but it is 
in the middle of the summer. It is hard to celebrate in the 
middle of the summer. If kids were in school, we could have a 
flag celebration for them, which would be more like an 
indoctrination or propaganda day than a day of celebration. We 
would like kids to be back in school, so that the celebration 
could take place at school”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it seems to me that the argument put forward by the 
hon. member from the Reform Party could have some merit. 
That is always the problem with days like women's day, child 
day, mother's day, a day for this and another for that. I think 
that the flag should be honoured 365 days a year in all 
circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personally, I am old enough to remember how the Canadian flag 
came to be. As hon. members will remember, under the leadership 
of Réal Caouette and his Social Credit Party, the French-speaking 
members of this Parliament argued vigorously in favour of Canada 
adopting its own flag, as we Quebeckers had a hard time relating 
to the Queen's flag, a flag that looked like the British flag 
and did not mean much to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec has its flag, and I think Quebeckers venerate the flag of 
Quebec first and foremost, the flag that belongs to us, and 
tells who we are, because Canada was such a long time adopting 
its own.  Personally, I have a great deal of difficulty 
believing that those two bands on either side of the maple leaf 
represent the Atlantic on the one side and the Pacific on the 
other.  Oceans sure ain't what they used to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can perhaps understand Canada's wanting to have a flag day, 
but I cannot see why it should be a statutory holiday.  We in 
Quebec have a journée du drapeau, I know, but I would also be 
opposed to its becoming a statutory holiday in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that a flag day needs to be celebrated at work, for it 
is important in my mind to associate it with work and with the 
pride of living and working under the flag.  We Quebeckers have 
our journée du drapeau and it is a day when we celebrate.  But I 
do not see why it should be made a statutory holiday.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has given itself many opportunities to promote its flag. 
The Canadian flag became very popular following the campaigns 
led by the Minister of Canadian Heritage. The minister 
distributed flags all over the country. Since one had to phone 
to order them, Quebec only accounted for 10% of total demand. I 
believe that, for Canada Day, spending was increased by 400% in 
recent years, with the result that Quebec finally got more than 
its fair share, since 63% of the budget for last year's Canada 
Day was spent in our province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The flag is, of course, a symbol for a country. 
It is very difficult for me to tell Canada what it should do 
with its flag, but I do not think it should be used as a tool 
for propaganda or indoctrination. It must be something that 
people are proud of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was very young, we used to sing the national anthem every 
Friday afternoon in school. We would salute the flag, but it was 
the Quebec flag. We sang <I>O Canada</I>, which was sung in Quebec long 
before it became Canada's national anthem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is how I was raised. I have always respected the flag. 
I will respect the Canadian flag as long as Quebec will be part 
of Canada. However, my allegiance is first and foremost to the 
Quebec flag, which I learned to love. I hope Canadians will 
learn to love their flag the way we learned to love ours, but 
without having to designate a legal holiday when no one goes to 
work.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to speak today to Bill C-401 which would establish a 
flag day on the third Monday of February as a national holiday to 
be observed throughout Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the genesis of the hon. member's bill and his 
studies with Pauline Jewett.  I also appreciate his faithfulness 
to the idea of heritage and I share that with him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was interested in the fact that the original concept was to 
have a heritage day and then it moved to a flag day.  I must say 
that I have some concerns with the name. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not going to dwell on anybody's devotion to the flag as a 
national symbol, but I recall an uproar which occupied the 
attention of some in this place some time ago and it was all for 
the sake of a flag.  That rancorous debate did not feed one 
child, improve our health care system, create a job, cut a tax or 
in any way benefit a Canadian.  Therefore, I am reluctant to 
dwell too much on the flag, given the fact that it causes a great 
deal of problems for some people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate allows for the dream of a well earned holiday for 
hardworking Canadian workers in the dead of winter, and I 
appreciate that.  However, do we need a day to commemorate the 
flag?  I think not.  I appreciate the sense of inspiration which 
my hon. colleague gets from the flag and I respect that, but I do 
not think a day should be named after it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree that Canadians should recognize their roots and their 
symbolic heritage.  It is very important for us to draw strength 
from our roots.  We need to find inspiration and guidance from 
the people who came before us.  But I think that each of us looks 
to different people for inspiration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have found inspiration in an early suffragette named Francis 
Beynon.  She was a journalist in Winnipeg in the 1910s.  She 
worked for a newspaper called <I>Women Grain Growers</I>.  For 
many years she spread information and communicated with isolated 
women on the prairies who lived on mile-wide farms and had no 
contact with anyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Francis Beynon taught women a lot about their rights.  She was 
very involved in the struggle to get the first vote for women. 
When the first war came along she fought very hard to get the 
vote for immigrant women.  That was not an easy battle because 
unfortunately there were a lot of women, even in this country, 
who were unwilling to allow foreign women to vote during the war.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Francis Beynon showed her patriotism not in her flag, but in her 
actions.  She took this very important democratic stand.  I 
respect her for that.  It was not a popular stand.  She also 
fought against conscription.  I believe that she passed out of 
history because she did not take a popular stand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I respect and find inspiration in people like Francis Beynon.  I 
wonder whether I should suggest a Francis Beynon day.  Instead, I 
think I would look at the concept of an ancestor day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other people might look to someone like Agnes MacPhail for 
inspiration.  As we walk in the door every day we see the statue 
of Agnes MacPhail.  She was the first woman member of parliament. 
She served in the House from 1921 until 1940.  In 1943 she was 
one of two women to be elected to the Ontario legislature.  She 
was also the first woman appointed to the Canadian delegation of 
the League of Nations, where she insisted on serving on the 
disarmament committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She is another important ancestor for many of us in terms of our 
political beliefs.  She was a very important woman in Canadian 
history.  She was a peacemaker and an inspiration to many women. 
Maybe we should have an Agnes MacPhail day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently I had the privilege of being part of the unveiling of a 
plaque for Portia White in Preston, Nova Scotia.  She was a very 
famous and inspirational black Canadian woman from my community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Portia White was the first African Canadian woman to win 
international acclaim as an opera singer.  She was a famous 
musician in our country.  She was born into a musical family and 
taught choir in her church.  She was a teacher and a community 
person who is remembered by thousands of people scattered all 
over the country.  She has become well known as an inspiration 
for thousands of young black Nova Scotians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we should all celebrate our roots and our ancestors. 
They are the root to our patriotism.  We should be helping young 
Canadians to find inspiration wherever they can.  Instead of 
having a day that represents one inspiration, a piece of fabric 
with some red and white on it, it may be more appropriate to have 
an ancestor day.  We accept the fact that we all have ancestors 
who we gain strength from.  We should try to recognize them in a 
public way.  That would go a long way in encouraging us to gain 
strength from our roots and in helping us to understand our roots 
better, and perhaps one another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not agree at this time that we need a flag day.  I do not 
think that is a wise option.  Instead, I suggest that we have an 
ancestor day. 
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to rise before the House to debate Bill C-401, an act to amend 
the Holidays Act to have a flag day and to make consequential 
amendments to other acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First I would like to commend the sponsor of this private 
member's bill, the hon. member for Durham, for his obvious sense 
of pride and patriotism in both our country and our Canadian 
flag.  Most Canadians would agree with these sentiments. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look up and see the Canadian flag flying high, I proudly 
recall all those who, throughout our history, fought to make 
Canada the best country in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of the Fathers of Confederation, with their vision of a 
great country, I think of our war heroes who fought courageously 
to defend our freedom, and I think of the millions of Canadians 
who struggle daily to improve not just their own lives but the 
lives of their fellow citizens. 
They are what Canada is all about and they are what make this 
the world's most respected and wonderful country in which to 
live. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian flag represents the tremendous efforts of all 
Canadians who have worked so tirelessly to make this such a great 
country.  It is the embodiment of what we have achieved together 
as a nation.  I love our Canadian flag and I am tremendously 
proud of our country and our achievements, but I do not believe 
the flag should somehow overshadow the celebration and 
recognition we already offer to our great country.  Obviously I 
am referring to July 1, Canada Day.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every July 1, millions of Canadians participate in Canada Day 
celebrations across the country.  Whether they are joined 
together across the country by means of satellite or whether they 
proudly fly the Canadian flag at home, whatever the case the 
results are the same.  Canadians want to show their pride in 
their country.  It is not solely pride in the Canadian flag but 
what it represents. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian flag was first unveiled on February 15, 1965, at an 
official ceremony in Ottawa. Many of our fellow citizens will 
remember that the decision to adopt our flag was not reached 
without heated debate on both sides of the House, and without 
input from many Canadians. The intensity of the debate is a 
testimony to the significance of the flag as a symbol 
representing us as individuals. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the government too often forgets just how important a 
symbol the Canadian flag is to our identity.  The Canadian 
heritage minister believes that handing out hundreds of thousands 
of free Canadian flags at a cost of millions of dollars is enough 
to qualify anyone as a proud Canadian.  Although most of those 
who receives these free flags were likely proud Canadians, I am 
certain that they would have been even prouder had the minister 
and her government invested the money into much needed programs 
such as education and health care. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like many of our fellow citizens, I have had the opportunity to 
travel abroad. I met people who talked to me just because I was 
wearing a Canadian pin. I must say I find it heart-warning to 
hear people say nice things about our great country. Canada is 
highly regarded abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Canadian pin is a symbol of what Canada and Canadians are in 
people's mind. When they see the Canadian flag, they see a 
caring and generous country, where free citizens live in a 
democratic society. It bears repeating, the flag represents 
Canadians, and it is to them we must continue to pay tribute. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a number of questions we should be asking ourselves 
regarding Bill C-401.  Should Canada create a specific holiday 
with the sole purpose of recognizing an important symbol of who 
we are as a people and what we stand for as a nation?  Or, should 
we not focus greater attention on promoting ourselves through an 
existing holiday, Canada Day, in such a manner whereby we could 
focus greater attention on educating Canadians about our history 
and the importance our flag has played in it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On November 11 we celebrate Remembrance Day.  For days leading 
up to it and including Remembrance Day we hear countless stories 
of the exploits of brave Canadians during both World War I and 
World War II, along with those who fought in the Korean War and 
our various peacekeeping missions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These individuals fought and in many instances died so that we 
could enjoy the freedom we have today.  It is because of them 
that we can fly our Canadian flag.  Although in most instances 
their exploits were done prior to the adoption of our official 
Canadian flag, it does not diminish the significance of the 
Canadian flag being flown during these ceremonies.  The Canadian 
flag is the embodiment of their struggle and sacrifice for the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do Canadians across the country want another national holiday? 
Have the proponents of the bill actually held comprehensive 
discussions with representatives of Canadian industry or boards 
of trade to see just how another national holiday would affect 
the Canadian economy?  Can the Canadian economy support another 
holiday?  Canadian taxpayers may already believe there are too 
many holidays.  I am certain when approached they would likely 
say that politicians already have too many days off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our fragile economy continues to struggle from the effects of 
high taxes and high unemployment.  The Liberal government 
continues to refuse to reduce taxes which would help stimulate 
growth in the economy.  It is intent on continuing to gouge 
Canadian workers for refusing to significantly reduce EI premiums 
even though reports show that a greater reduction is possible and 
necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are serious problems that Canadian taxpayers are facing on 
a daily basis.  Can they legitimately afford to sponsor another 
holiday no matter how good or how just it might be?

draw attention to the importance of our great flag.  I commend 
him for that.  However, at the present time we can work within 
the framework of already existing holidays to accomplish the same 
goal.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister

Durham for bringing this issue to the floor of the House of 
Commons for debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As he may be aware, in the past I presented a private member's 
bill proposing the adoption of an oath of allegiance to the flag. 
I share his passion and his love for our country and its symbols 
which is why I felt it is important for me to speak on Bill 
C-401. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the spirit of Bill C-401, an act to amend the Holidays 
Act and make flag day a statutory holiday.  I agree that flag day 
is an important day and that it should be recognized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The flag is what symbolizes our nation.  It is bold and 
represents our strength as a country.  The maple leaf 
demonstrates unity with the stem, the federal government, binding 
the tips of the leaf, the provinces and territories, together. 
It is an internationally respected symbol and an ambassador of 
tolerance, peace and understanding. It is Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Compared to those of other countries, our flag is quite young. 
It was only 34 years ago that parliament debated the adoption of 
a new flag.  Imagine how exciting it would have been to see the 
maple leaf flying over the Peace Tower for the very first time. 
It is that excitement that I hope Canadians everywhere still feel 
whenever they see our flag. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A teacher in my riding of Guelph—Wellington is working very 
hard to make sure that our younger generations share that 
enthusiasm for our national symbols.  Joe Tersigni has put a 
motion to the local Catholic separate school board that would 
require every Catholic school in the district to raise and lower 
the flag every single day.  While this may seem like a normal 
process or way of doing business, as far as Mr. Tersigni is 
aware, no other school board in Canada has done this yet. This 
simple action would go a long way in teaching respect for our 
flag and our country.  It would teach students that our flag is a 
treasured emblem of our nation, one that must never be forgotten 
or abused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Tersigni's school, Our Lady of Lourdes, is hosting a special 
ceremony on Monday to commemorate the adoption of this important 
motion.  On February 15, flag day, every Catholic school in 
Guelph will raise a new Canadian flag and the students and 
teachers of those schools will be reminded of all that it stands 
for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a young country with an even younger flag, but that 
does not mean the maple leaf is not steeped in history and 
significance.  Just think of what we have accomplished in the 34 
years since it was adopted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have developed the Canadarm, a tool that has been critical to 
the success of many space missions.  We have watched inspiring 
individuals like Terry Fox and Rick Hansen venture across Canada 
to raise awareness on very important causes.  And we have twice 
hosted the Olympics and won numerous medals.  We have worked to 
make and to keep peace in every corner of the globe.  We have 
repatriated our Constitution. We have officially adopted O Canada 
as our national anthem. We have come into our own as a nation. 
All under our own flag. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are just a few of the reasons why I feel it is so very 
important to recognize and celebrate flag day.  I do feel that 
flag day deserves more recognition and promotion than is 
currently the case.  If Canadians were to be polled, how many 
could say why February 15 is a very important day? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Wendy Willis, a teacher at Crestwicke Christian Academy in 
Guelph, recently brought her grade 4 class to citizenship court. 
Each new Canadian was presented with a handmade valentine. 
One of her students, Brad Lord, recited a poem welcoming the new 
citizens and outlining all that Canada has to offer.  The closing 
line of his poem was “From coast to coast, it's all within 
reach”.  The new Canadians no doubt believe this statement or 
they would not have chosen to make Canada their new home.  The 
students believe it too, because now they have seen firsthand how 
special it is to be Canadian.

day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be remiss in not mentioning Joyce Hammond who two years 
ago suggested to my office and myself that we should think of 
doing an oath of allegiance to the Canadian flag. I put it 
forward in this very House as a private member's bill.  When I 
did, over 500 municipal councils wrote to me, including a number 
of them in Quebec, and said that they agreed with this premise, 
that this should happen. Mr. Speaker, I put you on notice that I 
will be reintroducing the bill at some point in time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, I sincerely thank my colleague, the hon. 
member for Durham for proposing Bill C-401 because it gives us 
all an excellent opportunity to promote flag day and to encourage 
Canadians everywhere to take part in the celebrations.  My hon. 
colleague, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage says it has been wonderful to promote Canada 
Day and flag day and therefore I make special mention of him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether it is by wearing a Canada flag pin on your lapel or 
dressing in red and white, or attending a flag raising ceremony, 
there are ways for everyone to show a little patriot love. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada truly is the greatest country in the world.  Let us 
celebrate it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think we 
have had a very useful debate today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members of the Bloc will not necessarily be supportive of 
the legislation.  It was interesting to listen to the member as 
she talked about times when singing O Canada in that great 
province and because of the flag's association with the monarchy 
Quebecers felt that it was just too late to make that change, so 
they opted for another flag, the flag of the province of Quebec. 
I do not want to get into an argument about flags but the flag of 
Quebec of course is a monarchical symbol, the monarchy of France, 
so it seems unusual to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly the New Democratic Party has its own wish list.  It 
wants to recognize the women's movement. As I listened to the 
debate by the opposition I reflected and wondered what it must 
have been like back in 1964 when everybody had some reason not to 
proceed with the flag debate.  They wanted to keep it the way it 
way it was, and we should be honouring some other group within 
our society.  I am not saying that the member of the New 
Democratic Party did not have a good argument, but the reality is 
our flag unites all of us, women, men, everyone under one flag. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from the Reform Party thought that it was 
inappropriate to have just one day for celebration, that we 
should be celebrating this within our bodies every day.  I 
suppose we could say the same thing about Christmas which of 
course is a national holiday. If one is a Christian why should 
there be a Christian holiday called Christmas?  It should be 
something that is inside a person every day and there should not 
be a specific statutory holiday for that reason.  The reality is 
that is what people have holidays for, to celebrate the things 
they think are unique in life.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate in the House is amazing.  Other countries celebrate 
flag days because they are proud of their countries:  Argentina, 
Finland, Haiti, Liberia, Panama, Paraguay, and the list goes on. 
Yet here we have this intellectual debate about why we cannot 
have a statutory holiday.  I think that is unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern was that it was not a votable motion.  It would be 
great to carry on this debate for another two hours. I wonder if 
I could seek unanimous consent to continue the debate by making 
it a votable motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent that the 
motion be made votable, as suggested by the hon. member? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed.

Private Members' Business has now expired and the order is 
dropped from the order paper.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise to ask a question of the parliamentary secretary following 
a question I posed back in November with respect to a shortage of 
aviation inspectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question was generated by a report put out by Price 
Waterhouse, a very well respected consultant in Canada.  In the 
study it prepared it found that as the government moves from 
being a hands-on regulator to more or less a monitor and as we go 
through the deregulation process in the aviation industry there 
is a significant and concerning shortage of aviation inspectors 
to inspect aircraft and aviation facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The study says that the growing wage gap between the private 
sector and the department means that the department must either 
choose between a shortage of inspectors or lower the 
qualifications.  This is no time to lower qualifications for 
inspectors.  It cites certain provinces in Canada that have 
inspector shortages in their areas of up to 20%.  It puts a 
number on it and says there are 80 vacancies for inspector jobs 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is in the interest of ensuring that aviation safety 
is addressed on an ongoing basis.  I feel it is, but I want to 
make sure in this circumstance and for this case that the 
minister is taking steps to ensure there is an adequate number of 
aviation inspectors and that they have adequate training to do 
the job. 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I reiterate that Transport 
Canada recognized the recruitment and retention problem with the 
technical inspector community.  In October 1997 it commissioned 
the Price Waterhouse review to help in resolving it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similar independent reviews are now under way of both the civil 
aviation pilot inspector and the aircraft certification 
engineering communities.  It is also important to note that 
Transport Canada has never downsized its number of aviation 
inspectors.  The number of positions has continually been 
growing.  The department has added 179 safety inspector positions 
in the last five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transport Canada has initiated a comprehensive program to deal 
with identified problems through training, new recruitment 
methods and reclassification.  Approximately 66% of civil 
aviation technical inspectors were reclassified after retraining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada was one of the first developed countries to be assessed 
under the International Civil Aviation Organization safety 
oversight program in mid-October.  We were in receipt of an 
interim report and the results were very positive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The interim report concludes that the civil aviation 
organization of Transport Canada has established a very sound 
structure for safety oversight.  The staff has the proper 
qualifications, is provided with appropriate training and has at 
its disposal the proper tools to discharge its duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The interim report also notes that Transport Canada has launched 
a number of initiatives to address recruitment and retention 
issues including commissioning the Price Waterhouse review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to making the final report public in the near 
future— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am sorry to interrupt the hon. 
parliamentary secretary but his time has expired. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been 
adopted. Accordingly, this House stands adjourned until tomorrow 
at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 7.15 p.m.)
