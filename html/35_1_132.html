	<B>Hon. David Anderson (for the Secretary of State 
(Parliamentary Affairs), Lib.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House take note of the opinions expressed by Canadians on the 
budgetary policy of the government and, notwithstanding the provisions of 
Standing Order 83.1, authorize the Standing Committee on Finance to make a 
report or reports thereon no later than December 7, 1994.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Jim Peterson (Willowdale, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
great pleasure for me to rise this morning. We are in the process 
of a historical evolution of the way Parliament deals with issues 
and, more important, we are as Canadians in a historic moment 
in terms of what we are going to do with our economic future.
<P>
	Our combined federal and provincial debt is now greater than 
the sum of all economic activity in any one year in Canada, more 
than 100 per cent of our gross domestic product. This debt has 
been building for the last 20 years. Every minute that I speak 
that debt is going up about $85,000.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	We are at the point at which one-quarter of all federal 
government spending is on interest alone. It is not even going to 
pay down that debt. One-third of all the money the federal 
government takes in goes to pay that interest. That means it 
cannot be spent on the programs which are necessary to build 
our economic future and create a fair and equitable society for 
all Canadians.
<P>
	In spite of many declarations in the past by other 
governments, no government has yet come to grips with the 
problem of our mounting debt and deficit. In the budget of last 
February our finance minister said that we must start. We can no 
longer continue on this route and as an interim target over two 
years he said we would get the deficit down from about 6 per 
cent of our gross domestic product to 3 per cent.
<P>
	This means we will have to go from about a $42 billion deficit 
this year to a $25 billion deficit within two years. If we assume a 
certain amount of growth in our economy this means we are 
going to have to intervene as governments never before have to 
strip over $9 billion out of this deficit through either increased 
federal revenues or cuts in spending. This is a monumental 
undertaking never before seen in the budgetary history of the 
Government of Canada.
<P>
	To assist the government and all parliamentarians in this task 
the minister asked the finance committee, which I am honoured 
to chair, to undertake public discussions not only on the 
enormity of the deficit and how much we should try to get it 
down but whether his economic assumptions are valid. More 
specifically he asked us to consult with Canadians to find out 
exactly what we should do, where we should increase taxes if 
any and where we should cut programs.
<P>
	Our committee has had less than two months, six weeks so far, 
to undertake this task. The minister appeared before the finance 
committee on October 17 and 18 and laid before us two major 
studies, one of which was the purple book, ``A New Framework 
for Economic Policy'', dealing with all of the broad aspects of 
our economic future, how we are going to sustain employment in 
the future, how we are going to cope with the changing world 
economy, the global environment in which we find ourselves, 
and take advantage of the new economy.
<P>
	In this book he outlined five principles to which we must look. 
One is the need for Canadians to acquire new skills. The second 
is how all of us, including governments, can adjust to the 
changing economic circumstances, recognizing it is the private 
sector that creates jobs, and what can be the role of the 
government in aiding and abetting the private sector in this 
quest.
<P>
	One of the major things pointed out is that the standard of 
living of all Canadians has really been declining in 
non-inflationary terms for the past 20 years and this just 
happens to coincide with a fall in the productivity of Canadians. 
Our major challenge, as we all know, is to take Canada, a 
country which in many ways has been a third world because of 
its heavy economic reliance on its resource sectors, to an 
economy which is really in the forefront of relying more and 
more on its human resources.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8316"> 8316 </A></B>
<P>
	The third principle outlined in this book is getting 
government priorities right, which are the areas where we 
should be involved, how we can eliminate those aspects of our 
activities which are of a low priority.
<P>
	The fourth principle is recognizing that we must as legislators 
and as governments play a role of economic leadership, 
recognizing as I stated that it is the private sector which creates 
jobs.
<P>
<B>(1110 ) </B>
<P>
	Also of concern is how the public sector works with the 
private sector to help bring about the transformation of our 
economy to implement the new technologies, to create the new 
type of infrastructure which can take us into the 21st century and 
be among the leaders in global competitiveness. How can we 
enhance further our exports? How can we aid and work with 
small business which will be the major creator of jobs in the 
future to ensure that it has the financial resources and the know 
how to be global players rather than simply backyard putters?
<P>
	The fifth element of this study shows where government must 
play a leading role to create the type of monetary and fiscal 
climate which we need to make all of these other things happen.
<P>
	I want to deal very briefly with the second study that he put 
before us. It deals with this fifth aspect of how we go about 
creating the jobs in the economy of the future, ``Creating a 
Healthy Fiscal Climate''. This was tabled by the minister before 
us on October 18. The next day our committee began its public 
hearings on this very issue.
<P>
	Before I get into some of the details of what we have been 
hearing, members from all parties on this committee have taken 
the task extremely seriously. They have studied. They have 
agonized. They have brought different perspectives to our work. 
In many cases we as members of this committee have been able 
to arrive at a consensus built not only on our work as members of 
Parliament but more important a consensus arrived at listening 
to Canadians from coast to coast.
<P>
	We have heard many witnesses in Ottawa and in every 
province as we travelled. We have heard from the usual 
suspects, the lobby groups that are well entrenched that have 
their head offices here in Ottawa and that we knew would come 
before us and whose advice we have actively sought. We have 
also heard from many individual Canadians who, concerned 
about our future, have brought their perspectives to our 
deliberations.
<P>
	One of the major points of agreement that we have heard right 
across the country is we must go at least as far as the finance 
minister suggested to us in meeting our deficit targets. We must 
within two years get our federal deficit down to at least $25 
billion.
<P>
	A good number of witnesses said that government must go 
further than the $25 billion. We know we are in a business 
upswing at this present time. Growth is strong, job creation is 
strong, but it cannot last forever. There is an inexorability to 
these business cycles. We cannot sustain them on a perpetual 
basis, although everyone wishes we could.
<P>
	There were many witnesses who said please go even further at 
this time. Some have said if we are going to cut or increase taxes 
to the extent necessary to reach these even expanded targets, 
targets beyond what the finance minister has asked of us, we run 
the risk of putting a brake on the economy and slowing the 
growth and the job creation that we already are experiencing.
<P>
	Another consensus that we have reached is that we know we 
are going to have to make some cuts. Not one member of the 
committee and not one witness who appeared before us 
suggested that we could make cuts or increase taxes on the backs 
of the poor or the most under privileged or the least favoured of 
Canadians. All of us are aware of the high level of poverty in 
Canada, particularly among children. It would be 
unconscionable to think that the cutbacks we are going to have 
to make would be on the backs of those least able to deal with 
them.
<P>
<B>(1115 ) </B>
<P>
	In terms of specific solutions to our problems, the minister 
said to us: ``Don't come back to me with generalities; come back 
with specific tax measures or specific cuts that we can make''. 
Unfortunately the consultation process has been less than 
perfect.
<P>
	We had a number of categories of witnesses who have 
appeared before us. There are those who say: ``We are so special 
that we need not be part of this deficit reduction process. Our 
case is so special that we need added breaks; we need added 
funding''. There are others who have come before us and said: 
``We are a special case; don't cut us. We will live with what you 
have given us''.
<P>
	There are others who at least tried to respond to the minister's 
challenge and came before us and said: ``We are special. We can 
put a little bit on the table, but here is where you really have to 
cut, in somebody else's backyard''. All too rare were the 
witnesses who came before us and said: ``I have something to 
bring to the table. I seek nothing from it''.
<P>
	Those witnesses stand out in our minds. There was a wealthy 
person, Bob Blair, from Alberta who said that the generation of 
which he is a part, the generation of which we are a part, those 
who have enjoyed the benefits of this huge increased spending 
way beyond our means to pay it back over the last 20 years, those 
of us who have benefited so richly, have an obligation to give it 
back to our country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8317"> 8317 </A></B>
<P>
	He suggested that the wealthy could be called on to actually 
make donations to a deficit reduction fund for the state. That is 
the type of civitas, as the Greeks called it, or Greek leadership 
which I think all of us admire.
<P>
	I remember a senior citizen who appeared before us in 
Atlantic Canada. He waited through a whole long day of 
testimony. He came before us and he said: ``I am here out of a 
sense of guilt. I am a veteran. I get a pension because I was a 
prisoner of war during the second world war. That pension is 
about $10,000. I was never asked whether I wanted it or needed 
it, but it kept coming in and I have never sent it back. It's not 
even taxed. I am getting that and I don't deserve it. I'm not even 
a war hero. I bailed out over the Ruhr''. This gentleman is 
prepared to put that money on the table to help the rest of Canada 
deal with this deficit crisis.
<P>
	As I go through these deliberations I will always remember 
these two examples, rare examples, of Canadians who said: ``I 
can be part of the solution''. All members of our committee are 
convinced that whatever solutions we adopt, all Canadians, 
except those who are the least favoured, must be part of the 
solution. All Canadians must be asked to bear their fair share of 
the consequences of what we are going to have to do to wrestle 
that debt to the ground, to get the debt down so that our economy 
is once again growing faster than our debt. We owe this to 
succeeding generations to Canadians.
<P>
	One of the major things that emerged during the course of our 
deliberations was that maybe my generation and the generations 
that have been living off this added borrowing, this added 
consumption over the past two decades and who are passing the 
deficit on to younger generations, have an obligation to pay even 
more than their fair share. It is a very interesting concept that 
was brought before us. It emerged in the concept of perhaps we 
should have a tax on inheritances so that some of the wealth that 
has been built up, at least in very rich estates, should go back to 
the state to help pay off the deficit.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	We had a number of proposals before us which stated that 
taxes are almost at the breaking point. There is not much more 
juice to squeeze out of the tax orange by international standards 
and particularly American standards, which are the most 
important in this area. There is not much room to increase taxes 
and there may be no room. We have seen over the past decade 
how our personal income taxes have mattered and how they have 
become less and less progressive.
<P>
	How do we create fairness when we are going about the 
process of cutting back on the deficit in a way that has never 
been undertaken before and which is going to have a dramatic 
impact on all Canadians?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is going to be really tough. It will not be an easy job for us as 
members of Parliament and committee members, nor for the 
finance minister, the Prime Minister and the cabinet. It should 
and will be their responsibility to present Canadians with 
specific budget policy projects. We, the committee members, 
found a nearly universal desire in Canada to deal with the 
deficit, and to do it in a fair and equitable manner for all 
Canadians, especially the poorest members of society.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In going about this cutting, and we are going to have serious 
cutbacks in programs, the committee is not the only body 
looking at potential ways to deal with the deficit. A 
comprehensive analysis of all of our programs has been 
undertaken, a program review by the Government of Canada. 
Other committees as well have been charged with reviewing 
particular programs and undertakings. All these will be an 
important ingredient of this.
<P>
	However, I suspect that none will have a greater impact than 
the recommendations of our finance committee which has had 
the benefit, for the first time in Canadian history, of public 
consultations with a broad range of Canadians.
<P>
	One of the greatest advantages of these public consultations, 
which have never been undertaken, is that in the past those who 
could get in to the finance minister's office could make their 
case behind closed doors. The finance minister has said that this 
will no longer be the way prebudget consultation is carried out. 
It must be done in public before members of a committee that 
has all parties represented. We want all Canadians to see what 
special interests are being advocated, what privileges are being 
advocated and what solutions are being advocated.
<P>
	Unfortunately we have not heard enough of the details on the 
solutions and not enough of a consensus has come to this 
committee across the board. As I mentioned, too much of the 
testimony has been ``cut others but not us''. This is why, as 
members of the committee, it will be our obligation to make 
some very hard decisions on where we might get increased tax 
revenues, where we might get rid of some inequities or 
unfairness in the tax system itself and where our priority for 
cutting programs will be. What are those programs which are 
necessary to sustain the social justice which is so much a part of 
Canada's fabric?
<P>
<B>(1125 ) </B>
<P>
	What are the programs which are necessary to maintain the 
balance that we have always had and which will always be a 
hallmark of our country, the balance between a vibrant private 
sector but a co-operative and supportive public sector which is 
necessary to maintain the balance of not cutting those programs 
which are going to actually help us build a strong economy in 
Canada for our future?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8318"> 8318 </A></B>
<P>
	As we wrestle with these issues, I believe that the process of 
consultation with Canadians must not stop. We will continually 
seek their input. We must continually seek input from members 
of all parties of the House on an ongoing basis, members who are 
of good conscience and conscientiousness who have brought to 
us and laid out in concrete terms where they feel those priorities 
lie.
<P>
	The task is not going to be easy. I know that Canadians expect 
us to deal with this deficit. They will treat us most harshly if, as 
previous governments have done, we pay lip service to the 
problem but do not tackle it directly, concretely and precisely at 
this moment in history. We have a window of opportunity. We 
shall not hesitate to act.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as it has done since the beginning of the process, the 
Official Opposition is reminding you, Quebecers and Canadians 
of the seriousness of Canada's fiscal situation. Nobody, on this 
side of the House or on the other, is denying the existence of 
serious problems, and I would say that when it comes to federal 
public finances, we are actually dealing not with serious 
problems, but rather with a state of crisis.
<P>
	One only has to look at how expenditures and deficits have 
evolved to realize that, in spite of the restraint measures of the 
last few years, the federal debt has grown to become one of the 
largest of any central government in the world. It is standing in 
the way of sustained economic recovery and job creation. This 
has been particularly obvious in the last two years as, in spite of 
certain signs of economic recovery and growth, jobs are not 
being created in a sustained manner. We are not denying the fact 
that we need drastic measures to reduce expenditures, as well as 
measures concerning loopholes in our tax expenditures, as the 
finance minister called them. I believe that there is a fairly broad 
consensus on this point.
<P>
	However, we disagree on the means. For the next few minutes, 
I am going to talk about our analysis of the means used by the 
Liberal government or even the means suggested by our Reform 
colleagues. I will conclude by explaining why the Bloc 
Quebecois will vote against the motion before us this morning. 
We will not support the motion presented this morning by the 
Liberal government with a view to postponing the tabling of the 
finance committee report, because the reasons for doing so are 
not the ones stated by the finance committee chairman.
<P>
	We have been convinced from the start that these 
consultations are a smoke screen. They resemble those held by 
the finance minister before tabling his first budget, last 
February. We are equally convinced that the Liberal government 
is seeking to first move back the deadline, and second reduce to 
nothing the amount of time to be spent analyzing and debating 
the finance committee's prebudget consultation report.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	I can tell you that the motion before us, which seeks to 
postpone to December 7 the tabling of the report originally 
requested for December 2, is the result of intense pressure on the 
part of the official opposition. The initial motion submitted to 
the finance committee asked permission to table the report not 
on the 2nd, as requested by the House of Commons order, not on 
the 7th as sought in today's motion, but on December 16. They 
were taking us for something we are not and assumed that we 
would not remember that December 16 is the last sitting day of 
the year, and that next year we do not come back before 
February, the very month when the Minister of Finance is 
supposed to table his budget.
<P>
	While claiming that there is a need for consultation, a need to 
seek additional ideas, the government is trying to hide its real 
intentions. We hear great sounding, compassionate speeches on 
the need to protect the neediest, but we are not being told the 
truth on the upcoming reforms. We are given grand speeches on 
the social situation, on poverty, when all the measures taken so 
far by the government, in particular since the budget of the 
Minister of Finance, were against the unemployed, welfare 
recipients, students and seniors.
<P>
	Just think that the last budget contained a $5.5 billion cut in 
social programs, a large part in unemployment funds; is that a 
social measure, is that what the Liberal government intends to 
do for the neediest in our society? The major argument used to 
request further consultations is that we do not want to target the 
neediest.
<P>
	Behind the grand speeches, there are barbaric measures, 
unprecedented measures, backward measures, measures that 
would be among the most backward taken by finance ministers 
for many years. Even the Conservatives did not dare make such 
drastic cuts in social programs. Yet, as the Auditor General 
pointed out, there is no analysis of the consequences of such 
cuts, we do not know the relationship between unemployment 
insurance and welfare, but supposedly we are doing a review of 
social programs even without proper information.
<P>
	We are not the ones who said so, although we have in the past. 
The Auditor General himself reminded us last week that this 
government works the wrong way round; without any 
information at all, totally in the dark, it makes decisions that go 
against the poorest, all the while making grand speeches. Such 
behaviour is a disgrace.
<P>
	Since the past gives us a good idea of what the future will look 
like, and since the Liberal government is trying to shorten the 
period of time for public debate on various measures relating to 
taxation, expenditures, issues concerning Quebecers and 
Canadians, since the past gives a good idea of what the future 
will be and since we are faced with this disgraceful shortening of 
democratic debate, I would remind you that since it has been in 
office this government has been proposing, in an  acrimonious 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8319"> 8319 </A></B>
<P>
and cynical way, projects with a view to reducing social 
programs or aimed at students, middle income people and the 
poor.
<P>
	The government sends out trial balloons, not in a disinterested 
way but because this is part of the hidden agenda of the Minister 
of Finance and the Minister of Human Resources Development. 
For instance, when the government talks about taxing RRSPs, it 
is not out of the blue. The government, the Minister of Finance 
already intend to cut and tax RRSPs.
<P>
	When they talk about reforming transfers to post-secondary 
education under CAP, the Canada Assistance Plan, and other 
transfers to provinces and send out trial balloons or make little 
suggestions in the four or five scenarios contained in the report 
of the minister responsible for the development of human 
resources, it is not by chance. It is because it is part of the federal 
government's overall plan to address the deficit problem, to deal 
with the problem of its indebtedness we all recognize by going 
after students, the provinces, with its usual way of transfering 
the burden to the provinces and shifting the deficit and debt 
problems onto the most deprived.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	Members of the Liberal Party of Canada are counting on 
economic growth to improve somewhat the public finance 
situation, not because they believe there will be economic 
growth, but because they are unable to take any responsibility. 
This government has not taken its responsibilities since coming 
to office. It is so irresponsible that it claims that with the savings 
it made this year-more than $2 billion in unemployment 
insurance-the deficit for the current fiscal year is $39 billion 
when it is in fact over $42 billion.
<P>
	It is unacceptable to cut into the unemployment insurance 
fund, to which the federal government no longer contributes, 
and to use the savings they made this year to reduce the deficit. 
It is a way for the Minister of Finance to improve his image, to 
look like a good manager, even though he did nothing to bring 
public finances back under control. He did nothing to close 
loopholes in the Canadian tax system-something he should 
have done long ago-, to correct long-time injustices that he too 
denounced when he was in the opposition.
<P>
	This government is not serious in its endeavours and does not 
inspire confidence, especially since it is only managing the 
downsizing of a crippled system. On our side, the most blatant 
sign of that remains the closing down of the Saint-Jean military 
college. There is talk about cynicism and acrimony. For me it is 
a real symbol, more than a symbol right now, especially when 
we see the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs wearing the 
button denouncing the college's closure, as the Leader of the 
Opposition noted over the week-end.
<P>
	Such behaviour is scandalous and shows a cynical and 
acrimonious attitude. It is also disinformation since this 
minister is himself responsible for closing the Saint-Jean 
military college. Such disinformation and cynicism are typical 
of this government's general attitude, particularly with regard to 
the important issue of Canadian public finances.
<P>
	This is intolerable, especially since the Liberal Party of 
Canada used to advocate transparency, social justice and 
fairness when it was in opposition. Liberal members used to 
describe the Conservatives as almost extreme rightists, but they 
are even worse now that they are in power.
<P>
	Much needs to be done, if we look at the growth of 
government expenditures as well as the public debt crisis 
situation in Canada, with growing deficits, year after year, and a 
growing national debt. We did not wait two months after the 
finance minister's testimony before the finance committee to 
come up with suggestions to put some order in public finances. 
We were upfront. We made suggestions in front of the Minister 
of Finance, after he had made his statement and tabled his two 
books, the colour of which I cannot remember. There has been 
books of so many different colours tabled this past year, Mr. 
Speaker, that we loose track.
<P>
	Unlike our colleagues, we did not wait two months to suggest, 
first of all, that the Liberal government do the responsible thing 
and take steps to recover-at the time, this is what we were 
suggesting two months ago-some $6 billion in unpaid taxes.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	In fact, this first suggestion we had made to the Minister of 
Finance when he testified before the finance committee was 
reflected in the Auditor General's report tabled last week. But 
the Auditor General does not talk about $6 billion, as we had 
estimated, but over $8 billion in unpaid taxes, a quite substantial 
amount that taxpayers in Quebec and Canada owe, on average, 
to the federal Treasury in personal income tax, profits tax and 
goods and services tax as well, the famous GST, which is 
apparently the most commonly abhorred tax from coast to coast.
<P>
	Two months ago we suggested to the Minister of Finance, and 
to the Minister of National Revenue also take the necessary 
steps, departing from their usual laissez-faire policy, to recover 
these $6 billion which became $8 billion following the recent 
tabling of the Auditor General's report. What did they do? 
Nothing.
<P>
	We also suggested to the Minister of Finance at the time to 
ensure that the federal government withdraw from any 
provincial jurisdiction, in other words, that it mind its own 
business, in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8320"> 8320 </A></B>
<P>
view of the assignment of jurisdiction under the Canadian 
Constitution and many interpretations that have been given 
these past few decades.
<P>
	We said then, and we repeat it now, overlap, duplication and 
instances of federal interference, which are increasingly 
numerous and even more centralizing with a Liberal 
government, amount to, by our estimation, approximately $3 
billion per year. That is money! But of course when you ask 
senior department officials to see where the federal government 
is meddling needlessly and ineffectively in fields of provincial 
jurisdiction, they are both judge and party to the case. They will 
not shoot themselves in the foot. These senior officials who are 
in control will not reduce their staff, their power, their 
interference or their budget. Over the years and again recently, 
the Auditor General has found empirical evidence of duplication 
and overlap between the two levels of government, but the 
Liberal government does not want to face up to its 
responsibilities.
<P>
	That is the second suggestion we made to the Minister of 
Finance about a month and a half or two months ago. We 
suggested that he not reduce corporate subsidies a little, as we 
have heard fairly often on both sides of the House, but that he 
eliminate them. Companies receive $3.3 billion a year in 
subsidies. Here, we are not talking about subsidies for regional 
development which have the merit of reducing regional 
disparities in some disadvantaged regions; instead, we are 
talking about direct corporate subsidies, which more often 
involve patronage or paying off the party's friends rather than 
useful subsidies.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Contributions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> I would not go that far, but in any case it has not 
been proven that these subsidies are effective, provide benefits 
and have an impact on the competitiveness of businesses. On the 
contrary, when you subsidize a company in a particular industry, 
the subsidies allocated under this $3.3 billion are unfair to the 
others who cannot benefit from them. And they still want to cut 
spending on the backs of the most disadvantaged people but do 
not even mention eliminating these $3.3 billion in corporate 
subsidies.
<P>
	Do you think that is right? Is it right to cut unemployment 
insurance, welfare and post-secondary education while the 
finance committee and others still continue to leave these $3.3 
billion in direct corporate subsidies? That was our third 
suggestion then to the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	We also suggested that the Liberal government withdraw 
immediately from the Hibernia project, and we are no longer the 
only ones saying so. Almost everywhere, people are speaking 
out against the continuing waste which has already swallowed 
up $3 billion in direct and indirect spending, loan guarantees 
and so on from the federal government. This year we have been 
told about an additional $250 million for a project that will 
never make a profit, that relies on an increase in global oil 
prices, when all forecasts to this day call for an even greater 
reduction in the price of a barrel of oil than we are now 
experiencing.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	Why do they insist on the federal government, Quebec, 
Ontario and other Canadian provinces getting involved in a 
project that will never be profitable? And if it is profitable, why 
is the private sector not doing all the investing? Why must the 
federal government continue to invest hundreds of millions of 
dollars every year if the project is supposedly profitable? The 
1960s and 1970s are over. Let us look at the state of government 
finances. Even my Liberal colleague, the chairman of the 
finance committee, mentioned earlier that government finances 
are in a state of crisis.
<P>
	Despite the serious problems, they continue to spend money 
on this project, perhaps for political considerations, thus 
contradicting the Prime Minister's position during the vote on 
the Hibernia project. It is impossible to understand. If this is not 
political expediency, I wonder what it is. That was our fourth 
suggestion to the Minister of Finance, which has not been acted 
on to this day.
<P>
	We also suggested to the finance minister that $1.6 billion be 
cut from the National Defence budget in response to last year's 
request by the official opposition that this budget be slashed by 
25 per cent. Again, this suggestion was not followed up.
<P>
	We also asked the finance minister to reduce the 
government's operating expenditures by tackling 
mismanagement and widespread waste. There are many 
examples of waste and inefficiency, starting with the Auditor 
General's last report. I will give you just one because I do not 
want to take up too much time, even if I have unlimited time for 
this debate. The Department of National Defence is one example 
that has been popular with all of us for a while, especially since 
last week, when the Auditor General pointed out cases of gross 
mismanagement and inefficiency. They always boast that things 
have been put into order at the Department of National Defence 
in the recent past, but after reading the Auditor General's last 
report, we see that this department is a total mess, that it has 
become a symbol of public affairs mismanagement.
<P>
	I will quote just a few passages to illustrate what I told you. 
The Auditor General's report outlines several cases of waste. It 
says among other things that real property mismanagement at 
DND costs $100 million a year. Real property mismanagement 
alone costs $100 million; they throw away all that money while 
maintaining that the only way to reduce waste and increase 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8321"> 8321 </A></B>
<P>
efficiency in public finance management is to cut social 
programs.
<P>
	The report also points to waste in the F-18 performance 
evaluation program. We are told that the program might be ready 
in 2003, or 20 years after its implementation, and that the 
automation of the Canadian military police records will have 
taken 26 years, if the goal of completing the project in the year 
2000 is achieved. Imagine, 20 years for the F-18 performance 
evaluation program, when you think that, after 20 years, an F-18 
jet is considered obsolete. And 26 years to automate the 
Canadian military police records. In my short career, I never 
thought such delays were possible.
<P>
	In his report, the Auditor General also says about National 
Defence that the army, air force and navy have each developed 
their own information, command and control systems which 
have little interoperability. Imagine, our national defence is 
comprised of three forces that should normally interact through 
office automation and information technologies and systems, 
but these systems are virtually incompatible. We are told that 
the three forces have very limited interoperability.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	Given the situation in National Defence, one can guess what 
goes on elsewhere. We have a serious problem because it 
involves hundreds of millions, or billions of dollars. We read 
that: ``There are plans for future information technology 
projects with projected costs of $1.2 billion''. Mr. Speaker, 
implementing these projects will cost $1.2 billion, but they are 
not supported by adequate cost estimates.
<P>
	In other words, we are spending $1.2 billion to implement 
technology projects, new technologies, but we have no serious 
study on the value, efficiency and usefulness of these projects 
for the future of the three forces of National Defence.
<P>
	Here is another example, which again concerns the 
Department of National Defence. The Auditor General writes: 
``The Department did not have an adequate system in place to 
assess the cost-reduction potential of information technology 
projects or to weigh the benefits of cost reduction against other 
priorities. As a result, the Department has not benefited from at 
least $700 million in possible savings''. Just think! We are 
talking about hundreds of millions, even billions. But it does not 
seem to matter. The government prefers to cut spending by 
targeting the poor and let outrageous situations like that go on.
<P>
	This is incredible. I am flabbergasted. I was even more 
outraged last week, when the Auditor General tabled his report 
because, based on what the other side had been telling us over 
the last year, we thought that public finances had at least 
improved somewhat. This is not the case however.
<P>
	Some measures need to be taken regarding taxation. Until the 
Liberal government takes concrete action, we will not stop 
repeating that it must end the unacceptable situation created by 
family trusts. The government must stop losing hundreds of 
millions every year by allowing  very rich Canadian 
families-not middle income families, not fairly rich families, 
but very rich families-to use family trusts to defer for up to 80 
years taxes on capital gains.
<P>
	These very rich families do not use family trusts as an 
investment tool for future generations, or to help sick or 
handicapped children and relatives to be financially secure: 
They use these trusts as a powerful tax planning device. 
According to some tax experts with an excellent reputation in 
Canada, such as Sydney Goldstein and Neil Brooks, to whom the 
Liberals used to listen when they formed the opposition but no 
longer do so now that they are in office, it is outrageous to 
maintain these trusts for very rich Canadian families.
<P>
	They suggest that, through special studies conducted by 
Statistics Canada, or through data from Revenue Canada or 
major corporations managing the assets of these family trusts, 
such as Canada Trust, which is a major contributor to the Liberal 
Party, the government could obtain sufficient information to 
make an annual estimate of what family trusts set up for the 
benefit of very rich families really costs Quebecers and 
Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	During the hearings of the special committee set up to 
examine family trusts, as openly as possible, as the Minister of 
Finance put it, the Official Opposition asked Revenue Canada to 
provide these data. That was two months ago and we are still 
waiting. Our request has not even been acknowledged. If this is 
what is meant by transparency, we have a problem, because 
Liberals and the Official Opposition obviously do not have the 
same definition of transparency.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Farber, from the Department of Finance, also told the 
finance committee that a legislative authority would be needed 
to collect this information using a tax slip. We have submitted 
such a request. And again we are still waiting for an answer. Not 
only did we not get an answer, but I can tell you that, even 
though they talk about transparency and their will to correct all 
fiscal inequities, we have not had any co-operation from the 
Liberal Party or the senior officials of both the Department of 
Finance and the Department of Revenue. Could it be that these 
senior officials have been ordered by their superiors not to say 
anything and not to take any step to collect data on family trusts?
<P>
	We could also mention all the measures needed to correct the 
tax situation, including the tax conventions signed, as we said 
before, between Canada and countries with many tax loopholes. 
Despite the steps taken by the Minister of Finance in his last 
budget, a recently released study, carried out, I believe, by 
Samson &amp; Bélair, says that, in spite of everything, all the 
government's attempts and all the measures included in the last 
budget, there are still hundreds of millions of dollars being 
exchanged between Canadian businesses and their foreign 
subsidiaries located in tax havens and losses incurred by  the 
subsidiaries being reported in Canada for tax deduction 
purposes. According to the Auditor General and this Samson &amp; 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8322"> 8322 </A></B>
<P>
Bélair study, it is estimated that hundreds of millions of tax 
dollars are lost this way.
<P>
	I have a quote here that I would like to read to my hon. 
colleagues in English, if they will excuse my horrible accent. It 
says: ``The new rules have some merit'', meaning the measures 
taken by the Minister of Finance. ``They will most certainly 
generate ambiguity and uncertainty. Unfortunately, the 1994 
proposal did not bring the changes we were all hoping to see''.
<P>
	In other words, the action taken by the finance minister is not 
enough to prevent tax treaties with countries where corporate 
tax rates are lower than here, in Canada, countries such as 
Barbados, Cyprus, Malta and Papua New Guinea, for example.
<P>
	Because of these tax treaties, businesses, mostly very large 
corporations, do not pay their fair share of taxes here, in Canada, 
and we deliberately allow some of these corporations to forego 
their tax responsibility and to benefit from these tax loopholes, 
these tax havens, thanks to which they can legally save hundreds 
of millions of dollars in federal taxes.
<P>
	We cannot afford these tax conventions any more, especially 
with countries that are well-known tax havens and where tax 
loopholes are legion. This is utterly unfair when everyone else is 
being asked to make sacrifices, from middle-income families to 
the less-privileged, everyone except these large corporations, 
which take advantage of the Canadian tax loopholes and the tax 
breaks deliberately included in the tax treaties signed by Canada 
and these tax havens.
<P>
	There is also the whole question of corporate taxes. I tell you 
this should be examined carefully.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	I submit that the recent data from Statistics Canada on the 
trend of corporate versus individual contributions to the tax base 
reveal some clear facts. Remember that these data are expressed 
in real terms, which means that they take 1986 as the reference 
year. These are real data which take inflation into account. Thus, 
in 1950, Canadian corporations contributed $3.2 billion to the 
federal and provincial treasuries. The same data, with 1986 
being equal to 100, reveal that in 1992, Canadian corporations 
contributed $7.4 billion. But the $3.3 billion in subsidies to 
businesses I was taking about earlier must be deducted from 
those $7.4 billion.
<P>
	So, when those $7.4 billion actually paid by corporations to 
the federal and provincial treasuries are reduced by the $3.3 
billion in subsidies, we have exactly the same amount as in 
1950. The tax burden of companies did not increase in real terms 
but, for individuals, that burden went up from $3.3 billion to 
$87.6 billion.
<P>
	So there is a problem, and I can tell you that it is probably 
related to the tax breaks used by very large businesses. The 
Ontario Tax Equity Committee pointed out in 1990 that 
Canada's large businesses can use about 60 tax breaks that allow 
them not to pay their fair share of federal taxes even though we 
could require them to do so. This has been going on since 1950. 
And I am not talking here about very small businesses or small 
and medium size businesses, which do their job. If you look at 
the data, you will see that they contribute, as good corporate 
citizens do, to the federal and provincial treasuries. I am not 
talking about businesses in my area.
<P>
	Last week, I was talking to the owner of Grégoire &amp; Fils, a 
business that does research and development work in the farm 
equipment sector in my riding. I am not talking about his 
business. I am not talking either about Dutailier Inc. and 
Lacasse, two businesses that export furniture outside the 
country without any grants. I am not talking about these small 
and medium size businesses that create hundreds and even 
thousands of jobs, because that is what small and medium size 
businesses do, they create thousands of jobs.
<P>
	I am not talking about these businesses that perform their tax 
duties and contribute to economic growth, job creation and 
regional development. I am not talking either about a 
businessman like my friend Jean-Marc, from the south shore, 
who has to face very fierce competition from large 
multinationals in the steel equipment sector. He creates 43 jobs 
and pays his fair share of taxes. I am referring instead to very 
large companies who take advantage of measures that are legal, 
but are sometimes borderline measures, to prosper at the 
expense of a deteriorating Canadian fiscal situation, and to 
companies that use legal measures to avoid paying their share of 
taxes to federal and provincial governments.
<P>
	For a year now, I have been examining the Canadian tax 
system more seriously and specifically than previously, and I 
find it is distorted. It is so distorted that last week, my friend 
Léo-Paul Lauzon, a well-known tax expert in Quebec, sent me a 
newspaper clipping he found in <I>La Presse</I>, I believe. I know I 
cannot show that clipping, but it was found in classified ads and 
says in big print: ``Tax losses for sale''. The ad reads: ``Our 
client, a cosmetics distributor with significant tax losses and 
undervalued assets, is looking for a buyer who could use those 
tax losses. Confidentiality guaranteed. Please, contact so and 
so-I will not mention the name of the agency-number so and 
so''. In other words, our system is so distorted that we can now 
sell tax losses. Tax losses are sold like shoes, eggs or chicken. 
They are sold to companies that want to reduce their annual 
income.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Shame.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8323"> 8323 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Is that right?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Certainly not.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> It is not, but I do not sense across the way any 
desire to deal with loopholes in the corporate tax system. They 
are not even willing to examine the corporate tax system. Every 
time the Official Opposition suggested such an examination, 
even during the election campaign, it never got an answer. We 
tried again recently in the finance committee, but we did not get 
any answer. In that regard, the Liberal government members 
sitting on the finance committee can rely on the complicity of 
the Reform members because they do not want the corporate 
taxation to be examined either. It is serious when you think that 
some people even refuse to look at the corporate taxation. We 
are not suggesting any cuts, but simply to look at the problem in 
order to perhaps confirm what has been rumoured for several 
years and confirm also some warnings put forward by the 
General Auditor of Canada as well as some analyses made by tax 
experts. We are now completely fed up with this situation.
<P>
	It is obvious, and I stress, obvious, that we have to find ways 
to improve the management of public finance and we were the 
first to realize that the problem is very serious. While the 
Minister of Finance spoke only in terms of problems with public 
finance, we used a much stronger term. We spoke of a crisis. 
Indeed we recognized even more than the finance minister 
himself that if things keep going on as they are now, the situation 
will become impossible.
<P>
	However, what has the Liberal government been doing for a 
year now to help remedy this situation? In relation to what we 
and others suggested the government should do to stabilize 
public finance, what else did it do but take on unemployed 
workers and welfare recipients, senior citizens and now students 
with the reform proposals put forward by the Minister of Human 
Resources Development, and middle income families with all 
the trial balloons sent up left and right by the Minister of 
Finance, his officials or his Secretary of State? What else did it 
do but take on poor families? Every week, I meet some of them 
in my riding. Families are getting poorer and poorer.
<P>
	In fact, in this International Year of the Family, families are 
getting poorer and more desperate because they see that, in spite 
of all their fine speeches, the fine election campaign the Liberals 
conducted last year, the compassion they said they felt for the 
most disadvantaged, they are even more extremist, more 
reactionary that the Conservatives were at times. They are even 
more extremist than what they denounced as Conservative 
policies when they were in the opposition.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> That is double talk.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> It is double talk, as my colleague puts it. But I 
would even say that it is close to something like calumny.
<P>
	Speaking of poverty, I would tell you that for the last 15 years, 
the evolution of poverty in Quebec and Canada is a cause for 
concern. The poor in Quebec and Canada today do not deserve 
the treatment they have been subjected to this past year.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	I would like to mention briefly certain statistics on trends in 
poverty since 1973 to show you how badly the situation has 
deteriorated and the need to put in place real economic 
development policies, real job development policies, real labour 
training and regional development policies in order to stimulate 
Quebec's and Canada's economy. We do not need infrastructure 
programs which are subject to patronage and create only 45,000 
part-time temporary jobs when we need close to 800,000 jobs to 
get back to the level of the early 1990s; we need real measures.
<P>
	Since 1973, the number of poor families in Canada has 
increased by 41 per cent. During the same period, the number of 
poor people living alone jumped a significant 79 per cent. I am 
referring here to a study published by Mr. David Ross three 
weeks ago and which updates data on poverty in this country. If 
you want more details, and if my Liberal colleagues want to 
know that they are in fact deteriorating a situation which is 
already catastrophic for the poor families of Canada, I will 
gladly give you a copy of that study.
<P>
	It says that the rapid growth of poverty among young families 
in Canada is one of the most disturbing trends in the area of 
family poverty. Not only are people getting poorer, but an 
increasing number of young people are in this situation. It is 
young families who are getting poorer. We had never seen that 
before.
<P>
	Between 1981 and 1991, the poverty rate of families with 
parents 25 years old or less has almost doubled, increasing from 
21.7 per cent to 40 per cent. This means that the number of 
young families living in poverty has nearly doubled. That is how 
we prepare young people, that is how we give them hope for the 
future, by making them poorer at a much higher pace than that 
experienced by their elders.
<P>
	Another piece of information I thought could help this 
government become aware of the problem is that, in 1991, the 
number of poor dependent children under 18 years of age was 
close to 1.8 million. The poverty rate for single mothers is 52.1 
per cent in Canada. It is interesting to know these statistics. 
Women who are single parents are the ones who suffer the most 
from inequities in terms of income and services, both in Quebec 
and in Canada. Compare that with Sweden, for example, where 
the poverty rate among single mothers is 6 per cent.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8324"> 8324 </A></B>
<P>
	We used to say that education was to key to a good income. 
Well, let me mention some important data relating to graduates. 
Although people have diplomas, and it is a fact there is less 
poverty among people who are educated and who are flexible as 
a result of that education, and of course an education is always 
enriching, but it is not as enriching, in the literal sense, as it used 
to be. In 1981, 13.5 per cent of graduates of an educational 
institution, were poor. Today, more than 30 per cent are in that 
category.
<P>
	I wanted to mention these figures in the House because they 
profoundly disturbed me. I thought, and that is what we learnt at 
school, at college or university, that thanks to 
post-manufacturing economies and the new global economy, 
and with the development of the leisure society, modern, 
industrialized societies would, over time, become prosperous. 
People said that in the early seventies. Today, according to the 
update published by Mr. Ross on poverty figures in Canada, the 
exact opposite has occurred.
<P>
	It is a sign that we will need a major turnaround in the 
Canadian economy. This government will have to act 
responsibly, not by hitting at those who have trouble making 
ends meet, but by doing what we strongly suggested it should do, 
which is to carry out a thorough reform of the tax system and cut 
spending of the kind we pointed out earlier and have been 
pointing out to the Finance Minister from the outset, and 
especially since he appeared before the Standing Committee on 
Finance. But we want this government to stop coming down on 
people who do not deserve that kind of treatment.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	In conclusion, I want to say that we will not be a party to the 
trivializing of democratic debate that was reflected in the 
motion presented this morning. We will not be a party to any 
measures that may appear in the finance committee's report, the 
majority report by the Liberal members of the finance 
committee. I have the impression, and I have been saying this 
for some time, that the government decided long ago what 
measures it would take to improve its finances and to reach the 
objective set by the Minister of Finance, and I am referring to a 
deficit that is 3 per cent of GDP in 1996-97. Furthermore, these 
measures are so appalling and entirely in line with the approach 
of the last budget of the Minister of Finance, in other words, a 
well-organized attack against the unemployed, senior citizens, 
welfare recipients and students, that the government is ashamed 
to put them before the House on December 2 as planned, and that 
on the other side of the House, they are trying to reduce the 
number of days provided to debate these suggestions.
<P>
	Again, we will not be a party to a debate the Liberals do not 
want, a debate in which their promises will come back to haunt 
them. We will not be a party to what is actually nothing but a 
masquerade, to these endless rounds of consultations, because 
this government  consults right and left but only retains what 
suits its purpose.
<P>
	We saw this with the last budget, when the Minister of 
Finance approved a suggestion to make cuts in the 
Unemployment Insurance Fund, although there were thousands 
of suggestions that said not to do that. So much for consultation.
<P>
	For all the reasons I just mentioned, the official opposition 
will vote against the motion presented by the Liberal 
government, and we will do so proudly, with our heads held 
high, because our aim is to defend the interests of Quebecers and 
Canadians, as we have done since the very beginning.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I remind the House that 
the length of speeches pursuant to Standing Order 43 will now 
be 20-minute maximum interventions subject to 10-minute 
question and comment periods.
<P>
	Of course sometimes there is a practice where parties or 
members wish to split their time. I would simply ask members to 
indicate to the Chair if and when that should occur. Otherwise, 
members will be recognized for a 20-minute intervention and 10 
minutes of questions or comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
interested in many of the comments which were just made by the 
Bloc member who sits on the finance committee. I am hesitant to 
dignify some of his comments with my own because of what his 
leader said yesterday. I wrote down the quote.
<P>
	I saw his leader say on television that the Bloc are ``a 
superficial event in the political landscape''. That out of the 
mouth of his leader gives us an idea of the commitment of the 
Bloc to this whole budgetary process. When the member uses 
the terms barbaric measures and retrograde and he uses other 
words outside of the House that are not particularly helpful or 
constructive to the debate I think it does a disservice to 
something that is so desperately serious for this nation of 
Canada.
<P>
	He did make a comment in his long and rambling speech about 
the fact that even the Conservatives did not apply such cutbacks. 
Well he is right and that is exactly why we are in the position we 
are right now. The Conservatives did not have the courage to cut 
back the tremendous debt that was left to them by the Liberals.
<P>
	We thought $180 billion left over by the Liberals from the last 
time they were in power was a terrible debt. The Conservatives 
did not have the courage to do the cutting. As a consequence this 
country is now faced with a debt of over one-half trillion 
dollars.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8325"> 8325 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1220 ) </B>
<P>
	However I just cannot leave alone the comment the member 
made that somehow there are difficulties with numbers. I have 
no idea where in the world he would be able to say that the 
accounts receivable to national revenue have suddenly gone 
from $6 billion to $8 billion in the Auditor General's report. 
That is not factually accurate.
<P>
	If the member has taken the time to read presumably the 
French version of the Auditor General's report, I am assuming 
he is referring to the reference made by the Auditor General to 
the fact that some of the accounts receivable are getting on to 
being two years old. As they form part of the $6 billion his 
concern was that they were not collectable.
<P>
	It probably falls much in line with the member's constant 
going on in committee about the fact that there is an average of 
$42 million in each and every family trust. He just did not take 
the time in committee to listen and understand that the report he 
was referring said that the average assets in the firms reporting 
were $42 million. It was simply a quantifier in order to 
determine the type of firms that were replying to the survey. As a 
consequence the Bloc has been telling us, telling us and telling 
us that there is an average of $42 million in the family trusts.
<P>
	It is not just the Bloc. The member for Gander-Grand Falls 
also feeds into some of these misconceptions that there are these 
tax loopholes and tax havens and tells us about all these 
millionaires who are collecting UI. For many Canadians they 
want an easy way out. Don't we all? Many Canadians are 
looking for some justification for not making the cutbacks. All 
of us as politicians have to be very careful. We must make sure 
what we are saying is factually accurate and that it does not feed 
misconceptions.
<P>
	I challenge the Bloc member on his comment that direct 
subsidies to the business sector of $3.3 billion somehow do not 
include the subsidies going to business through things like 
ACOA, western diversification and the funds going through to 
Quebec. He seems to have classified these as being direct 
subsidies to the business sector.
<P>
	The bottom line is I look forward to debating with people who 
will take the time to read the numbers and if they do not clearly 
understand the numbers will take the time to receive advice. 
Then we can share our opinions based on fact instead of some of 
these things that are simply made up.
<P>
	In the 20 minutes allotted to me to speak to this issue the 
people of Canada should know that we will go $1.4 million 
further into debt. Every day Canada spends in the 
neighbourhood of about $460 million. Of that $460 million we 
have to go to the marketplace and secure $110 million. It works 
down to $1,700 per second that we are borrowing.
<P>
	Why is that important? It is important because even under the 
Liberal plan we will be going further into debt by $25 billion 
every year. Even under that anemic plan Canada will slip a 
further $100 billion into debt in the time the Liberals are in 
office. That is absolutely monumental. We do not know what the 
interest rates will be but at a 7 to 10 per cent interest rate on that 
$100 billion we will be paying $7 billion to $10 billion extra in 
interest at the end of their administration.
<P>
<B>(1225 ) </B>
<P>
	That number is very important when we consider that the 
federal government transfers $2.2 billion to the provinces for 
education. Let us understand and compare that $7 billion we are 
going to go further into debt to the $2.2 billion we are presently 
providing for education.
<P>
	Before I get into the Reform proposals I will make one more 
comment. Of the $110 million we are going to go further into 
debt today, approximately $45 million of that will be borrowed 
from foreign markets in this 24 hour period. That means one 
year from now because we are going $110 million further into 
debt we are going to be streaming $3 million more out of Canada 
to foreign capital markets.
<P>
	What could we do with $3 million? There are people in my 
constituency around Cranbrook who want a CAT scan machine. 
It will cost in the neighbourhood of $100,000 and the funding for 
staff and training perhaps will take the same amount of money.
<P>
	However we are prepared to let $3 million for this one 
24-hour period on interest leave the country. If we want to talk 
about barbaric and retrograde, we can apply those terms to what 
we are doing in the intergenerational transfer of debt to our 
children, our grandchildren and our great grandchildren.
<P>
	It is easy to apply labels to certain aspects of this whole 
process which is unfortunate. As the committee chairman so 
aptly said in his presentation earlier, there is absolute 
commitment. I believe there is commitment from the Liberals, 
as I am sure there is from the Bloc and I confirm the Reform 
Party is committed that the people who have the least ability to 
look after themselves must be looked after. They must be 
protected.
<P>
	Therefore, why is the Reform Party recommending that we go 
to zero instead of going to 3 per cent or approximately $25 
billion? Precisely for the reasons indicated by the chairman. We 
are currently in a very strong period of economic growth. It has 
been very clearly illustrated that the difficulty and the reason we 
are having problems in getting any real job recovery along with 
the economic recovery is that people are being taxed out of 
business, taxed out of existence.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
	There are some differences of opinion between us and the 
Liberals. In making our presentation to the Commons 
committee it was interesting that we managed to flush out what 
some of those differences were. In the judgment of the Reform 
Party, there must be a very serious look at the whole issue of 
taxation and how it is done to make sure that inequities are 
ironed out, that there is more fairness and that any loopholes are 
corrected. In spite of that and as a matter of principle we believe 
no more tax dollars are available from Canadians.
<P>
	It was interesting that the member for St. Paul's said: ``Your 
comments on taxation are rather anemic. There is a bit of a throw 
away line about not objecting to the principles eliminating 
inequities in the existing tax system. We have heard much 
testimony. Did you hear nothing that piqued your interest, that 
led you to say yes, there is something that should be examined 
on the tax expenditure side for instance? Was there nothing that 
caught your fancy?''
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	In a second intervention he said: ``I am in rare agreement with 
the member from the Bloc then perhaps because the vision that 
you present is a vision that is far different than I have for this 
country and the role we have to each other as Canadians''.
<P>
	The vision of the Reform Party in terms of its responsibility to 
the country is to get the government off the backs of Canadians 
and once and for all straighten out the situation so that it is no 
longer grabbing, grabbing and grabbing capital from a very 
weak and anemic capital market. It is absolutely accurate and 
correct to say that taxation is simply the confiscation of working 
capital; that is all it is. Taxation is simply the confiscation of 
wealth.
<P>
	If we take more wealth, more capital, out of either businesses 
or the hands of ordinary people they will have less to put back 
into generating more activity in the economy. I underscore then 
that we believe there should be no net increase in taxation.
<P>
	We established our program on five basic principles. The first 
one is that the people at the top of government must be the first 
to make significant and visible sacrifices.
<P>
	I was asked by a member of the House why we spent last 
Tuesday, our opposition day, on a motion to get the pensions of 
MPs into line with ordinary pension plans available to all other 
Canadians. It was really interesting, by the way, because every 
one in the Chamber voted against the motion to get the pensions 
of MPs into line with ordinary citizens, save the 41 Reform MPs 
who initiated the motion. That pension plan must be reformed as 
of a year ago.
<P>
	Also there should be implementation of across the board 
budgetary restrictions of 15 per cent to high level government 
institutions. We saw this last week the appointment of people to 
the Senate, the appointment of the Governor General, and 
therefore the traipsing out of what these people do in their public 
lives. People have  started to take a look at that, have started to 
focus on that and ask themselves: ``Just a second, isn't this the 
same government that is asking me to cut back?''
<P>
	Next is eliminating excessive travel of federal officials and 
reducing the number of ministers of state and associate 
ministers. People are looking for leadership, but unfortunately 
for many political commentators they seem to leave it at that as 
though somehow it might be a solution to the problem. It is a 
solution to the problem only in the respect that people are 
looking for forceful and aggressive leadership. They are looking 
for us to take a step forward and to take the cutbacks necessary 
ourselves.
<P>
	I have already indicated that funding must be maintained for 
high priority items. There are two high priority items in my 
mind. First is enforcement particularly with the departments of 
justice and the solicitor general. Second, every effort must be 
made to ensure that those who are least capable are able to be 
provided for. Third, there must be a cutback and elimination of 
the duplication of efforts among respective departments.
<P>
	There is also something very interesting here. Part of the 
problem is that we do not seem to have an understanding on the 
part of many people, many reporters and many commentators in 
particular in the news media. We certainly do not have an 
understanding on the part of many people on the back benches of 
the Liberal Party of the aspect that there must be substantial 
cutbacks.
<P>
	I noticed in the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> over the weekend an article 
written about a program put on by CTV called ``Due South''. It 
was interesting. It asked people if they had seen the program. 
Some people had seen it and hated it; other people had seen it 
and loved it. The point is that it was done without tax dollars.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	The commentator was basically asking why we should be 
celebrating the great commercial success. Why should we be 
celebrating that we have people employed in Toronto in the film 
industry putting the thing together? Why should we be 
celebrating that it is a commercial success because it has 20 
editions on the CBS network? Why should we not be celebrating 
the programs that are truly Canadian rather than just 
commercially viable programs?
<P>
	I will tell that person why. In this 20 minutes we will be going 
$1.4 million further into debt. That is why we must take steps to 
ensure that things like the film industry are privatized. We must 
reduce subsidies to national museums and galleries as worthy as 
they may be. If you haven't got it, you shouldn't be spending it. 
That is exactly what has been going on. There are $450 million 
available there.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8327"> 8327 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to make another comment about the Department 
of National Defence. The member of the Bloc was raising the 
issue of the Department of National Defence. My own personal 
position is: for people to risk their lives, whether it is in 
helicopters off Labrador, in the former Yugoslavia or on a 
barricade wherever it may be in Canada, do we expect them to be 
given the tools and the training? If they are putting their lives on 
the line they must be properly supported.
<P>
	We combined the spending cuts that had already been put 
forward for the Department of National Defence, together with 
the $300 million that had been recommended by the joint 
committee and came up with a figure of $1 billion. I say to the 
House as an individual that if we want to cut more from the 
Department of National Defence the first thing we must do is 
establish our priorities, our objectives for national defence. I for 
one will never stand for anyone making arbitrary cuts without 
first determining there will be a rollback in the services the 
Department of National Defence will perform.
<P>
	We believe a dollar in the hands of a taxpayer is more 
productive than in the hands of government. The finance 
minister said very specifically that subsidies build dependence. 
I do not know whether members happened to see the front page 
of the <I>Financial Times</I> a couple of weeks ago. It showed that for 
every dollar a person in British Columbia puts into UI he or she 
gets 70 cents or whatever out. Whereas for every dollar a person 
in Newfoundland puts in he or she gets something like $3.70 out. 
Even within UI there is a transfer of wealth. These things must 
be looked at. Am I suggesting this should not be? I am simply 
raising the issue that at the moment there are transfers of wealth 
that build dependency.
<P>
	We have specifically said, for example, that we should reduce 
the subsidy to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation by $365 
million. It was interesting on CTV over the weekend that there 
was some speculation the government was also considering that. 
It is a simple thing to do. Mr. Speaker, you may be aware of the 
fact that my tax dollars, the tax dollars of Canadians and the tax 
dollars of CTV were used by the CBC to outbid CTV on the 
rights to the Olympic games. That was absolutely bizarre.
<P>
	All sorts of cuts must be made, but the bottom line to the 
exercise is that there are no simple answers. It is up to all of us as 
politicians and to the news media to take on the responsibility of 
acquainting the people of Canada with the fact that there is no 
easy way. It is going to be tough but there is a light at the end of 
the tunnel if we are prepared to get aggressive on the debt.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when I hear Reform members making comments, I 
always ask myself whether they are aware  that the party in 
power is not the Bloc Quebecois but the Liberal Party of Canada. 
They are always directing their attacks at the Bloc Quebecois; I 
do not know why, but I find it a little strange.
<P>
	I also noted some insults that were directed at my party, at the 
work that each member of the Bloc Quebecois is doing and the 
seriousness with which we take our responsibilities as the 
Official Opposition, and I was deeply offended. Since the 
beginning, we have been doing what is expected of us in Quebec, 
and I would tell you, even in Canada in some respects, because 
some of our Canadian friends from the Maritimes, and even 
from western Canada and Ontario, speak very favourably about 
the work that my colleagues are doing as members of the official 
Opposition in this House. The same cannot be said about the 
Reformers. Even in western Canada, they are starting to loose 
ground, but that is their problem.
<P>
	With all due respect for my colleague, who is also on the 
finance committee, I would have a question for him. If the 
Reform Party is so serious in its offensive, in its suggestions for 
improving Canadian public finance, why does it leave aside a 
whole section of taxation, a whole section of grants, too? Why is 
corporate taxation excluded? Why does the Reform Party refuse 
to even discuss corporate income taxes?
<P>
	Why is it so dead set against it? Is it a definite mind set? Is it 
dogmatic? Why does it reject the review of tax conventions 
signed with tax havens, when the Auditor General, who is 
objective, and even Samson Bélair suggest that hundreds of 
millions are lost because of these infamous conventions which 
are perfectly legal but, in my opinion, totally immoral, 
considering the present state of public finances?
<P>
	How is it that my colleagues in the Reform Party do not want 
to review this aspect of taxation? Why do they refuse to budge 
when we mention family trusts?
<P>
	Even in the subcommittee set up by the finance committee to 
examine family trusts, they ridiculed the review of this 
question, something requested by the Minister of Finance. Why 
do they keep such a closed mind on discussing family trusts and 
such an open mind on cutting unemployment insurance, the 
Canada Assistance Plan, federal transfer payments for 
post-secondary education, the budget of the Canadian 
Broadcasting Corporation-a stupid measure to cut 30 per cent, 
one third of the budget, suggested last week-, and all the 
measures taken at the international level?
<P>
	Why is the Reform Party so opposed to a serious review of this 
issue? If they are really serious, they should quit being so 
dogmatic every time we suggest something which might impact 
on companies, on very rich Canadians and on certain members 
of their own party.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Mr. Speaker, taxation, as I have indicated, very 
simply is the confiscation of wealth. If you will pardon the term 
said in humour, it is legal robbery. In other words what basically 
goes on is that the people who come to this Chamber make this 
grab legal by virtue of the fact that they are entitled by 
Canadians to do so. It does not make any difference. The taxes 
that are taken from individuals and the taxes that are taken from 
business in a Robin Hood style are then redistributed.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	There are some services, particularly in the area of protection 
and in the area of the environment-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> What about health 
care?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Health care is a good example. There are some 
excellent examples of the intelligent use of these taxation 
dollars but nonetheless they are confiscated from businesses and 
from individuals. We believe, and I state again, a dollar in the 
hands of the taxpayer is more productive than in the hands of the 
government.
<P>
	I would like to take the member up on his comment once again 
about family trusts. There is somehow a myth which he and his 
colleagues have bought into that there are countless billions of 
dollars there. I use that $42 million per family trust figure as an 
example. When they ask for quantification to say how many 
dollars are in family trusts, and then turn around and say because 
Revenue Canada, because the Department of Finance will not 
give us these numbers that somehow they are trying to hide these 
numbers from us, the process truly is not open.
<P>
	The only way that we could quantify how many dollars are in 
family trusts is if we in this Chamber made the determination 
that we were going to tax wealth. We tax income, not wealth. To 
accurately identify how many dollars are in family trusts, 
because family trusts are a part of the entire relationship 
between people and companies, we would have to quantify how 
many dollars perhaps the Speaker is worth, perhaps that I am 
worth, perhaps that the member is worth. Then we would be able 
to determine on the basis of this wealth that maybe we will tax 
you 1 per cent of your wealth over $100,000, whatever the 
number is.
<P>
	It is a completely erroneous position to take in my judgment 
that the finance department and the revenue department are 
somehow surreptitiously or overtly withholding information. 
The information does not exist, so how can they give it to the 
committee?
<P>
	The member said that some of my comments were an attack 
on the BQ. I guess that is part of my problem because I find some 
of the comments to be somewhat nonsensical.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to the Reform member mention the wealth in family 
trusts and that it would amount to taxing wealth, as if wealth was 
a concept that applied only to the rich, because we could not care 
less about the wealth of the poor. Therefore, it is not a problem 
to tax them, increase their burden, reduce the services provided 
to them.
<P>
	My question is this: He knows full well that the Bloc 
Quebecois has been asking for information on family trusts, that 
is to say that family trusts should declare their assets, rather than 
only their revenues. Why is he opposed to the finance minister 
saying in his next budget: This year, everybody with a family 
trust will have to declare the assets in the trust. How else can he 
justify his being opposed to this but to preserve the freedom of 
those who have family trusts? How could such a measure be 
catastrophic for these people?
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Mr. Speaker, there are basically two aspects to 
family trusts as there are with anything. There is this aspect of 
real property, the capital gains portion on real property to which 
the members keep referring. The other is marketable securities 
or other assets of that type. I do not really understand. The 
information does not exist. It is that simple.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by picking 
up on some of the comments that other members have made in 
this debate so far, that we are dealing with a very complex issue.
<P>
	I refer to a paper that was delivered at the University of 
Toronto last August 8 and 9 at the Institute for Policy Analysis. 
It was delivered by Professor Pierre Fortin from the University 
of Quebec. The title of this paper was ``A Diversified Strategy 
for Deficit Control: Combining Faster Growth with Fiscal 
Discipline''.
<P>
	I would like to read a few comments from the abstract of this 
paper, which I recommend to all members because it deals with 
the complexity of the challenge before us:
<P>
	``Under current projections of economic growth and fiscal 
policy for the next two years, the probability that the federal 
government will achieve its stated goal of bringing down the 
fiscal deficit to 3 per cent of GDP by 1996 is almost zero. Four 
types of changes could improve the odds that the target be 
achieved: one, faster economic growth; two, a decline in interest 
rates; three, additional cuts in program spending; four, increases 
in tax rates.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8329"> 8329 </A></B>
<P>
	``It is possible to develop a diversified strategy that would: 
one, allow the deficit target to be met by 1996; two, achieve 
continued reduction of debt and deficit beyond that day; three, 
permit the economy to return to full employment by 1999; four, 
preserve the gains already made against inflation. That strategy 
would have lower interest rates, raise the average growth rate of 
real GDP to 5 per cent per year over the next five years. A 
nominal freeze on program spending would be imposed in 1995 
and 1996 and would be followed by moderate real growth in 
1997 to 1999. There would be no increase in the global effective 
tax rate''.
<P>
	For the largest part the paper exposes the analytical and 
empirical foundations of this proposed combination of 
accelerated growth and fiscal discipline. I quote specifically 
from that paper because I realize that Professor Fortin is a 
respected economist in this country. I have heard he is someone 
who from time to time would even give our members in the Bloc 
Quebecois some advice. It was for that specific reason, aside 
from his reputation, that I tried to get into his paper.
<P>
	I believe that all members in the House have really put the 
right emphasis on the cuts. I do not think anybody watching the 
debates that are going on around here would question the 
commitment, the focus or the debate on cuts. We cannot turn on 
a light around here these days without somebody saying do not 
do that because we have to save money. The message of working 
on achieving cuts has been well impregnated into the thought 
process of this Chamber and of this city.
<P>
	The other area of tax reform in my mind has not really been 
put on the front burner to the level it should be, but the real issue 
for me has to do with faster growth. I believe that is where we as 
members of Parliament are falling short.
<P>
<B>(1255 ) </B>
<P>
	If we are going to meet the challenge of getting our deficit and 
debt house in order we are going to need growth in the country. 
We are going to need jobs. We are going to need investment. We 
are going to need the entrepreneurial spirit recharged.
<P>
	I believe passionately that we will not achieve the growth that 
we must achieve if we are going to meet these targeted numbers 
unless we reform the tax system. The current tax system is no 
longer trusted by business or by the average person in terms of 
the personal side. Look on the business side right now. There are 
37,000 tax cases before the courts with a burden on the justice 
system because of the tax act challenges coming from business. 
Most Canadian recognize that.
<P>
	There is something else that we as a government have to face. 
Members have touched on it this morning. We are now 
competing more than ever for capital around the world. We are 
in a globally competitive regime for capital. In order to have 
capital move to our community, move to our country, we have to 
have a globally competitive tax regime.
<P>
	We should not look at these other countries that are attracting 
capital for investment in their communities in a condescending 
way. We should realize that they are ahead of the game. They are 
ahead of us. They have realized that point. Today capital can 
move with the push of a button.
<P>
	If people who have wealth, capital and are entrepreneurial 
achievers see that by getting a better tax break by pushing or 
parking some of their wealth in either the islands, Switzerland or 
some other part of the world, why would we not expect them to 
try to do that? We would not want them to just leave their money 
here after they had worked hard to achieve this wealth when we 
did not make any effort at reforming our tax system or 
recognizing that those wealth generators are an important factor 
in generating jobs and growth in this economy.
<P>
	The challenge of reducing the deficit and debt is inextricably 
intertwined with having a tax system that will reverse capital 
flows. I will try to explain this.
<P>
	If we have a tax environment that attracts capital from all over 
the world all of a sudden in our community, in our financial 
institutions we will have a glut of capital. When we have a glut 
of capital that means costs will go down. When costs go down 
the interest rate on serving our debt is going to put a lot less 
strain on the fiscal framework of our country.
<P>
	More important, if we have capital in our community that is 
not expensive, that is readily available, the entrepreneurial 
spirit which needs access to that capital can go out and do what it 
does best, take risk and create jobs.
<P>
<B>(1300 ) </B>
<P>
	When those jobs are created, once again on that side of the 
ledger we are going to be putting less pressure on the fiscal 
framework of this nation.
<P>
	I believe that we have a challenge here. We have achieved the 
notion. I would give the Reform Party some credit for pushing 
this whole subject of cuts almost through the wall, but I really 
believe that we as a government and as a Chamber now have to 
put an equal amount of thinking and creativity on how to get 
some growth going.
<P>
	One cannot get growth with the current tax system. The 
current tax system is a disincentive to achievers. It is a 
disincentive to risk takers. It is a disincentive to the 
entrepreneurial spirit in our country. That entrepreneurial spirit 
which is required for taking chances and throwing out ideas that 
can create jobs needs to be nurtured. We are not doing that with 
the system that we have today.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8330"> 8330 </A></B>
<P>
	The problem when one tries to reform a tax system that has 
looked after every little interest group in this country is that the 
political will becomes very fragile. As members know I have 
been trying, I believe in a constructive way, to reform the tax 
system of the country over the last five years.
<P>
	I realize that this may be the last chance in the government's 
term to reform the tax system. If we do not take on the challenge 
of comprehensive tax reform in this budget, we will have 
committed ourselves to a pathway or a direction that will carry 
us for the term of this government. For me, the next 30 to 45 
days is crucial if we are going to address the whole issue of 
comprehensive tax reform on the personal and corporate side.
<P>
	As I started to say, the difficulty we are going to have in trying 
to achieve tax reform is that every interest group in the country 
has a built-in measure of support in the current tax system.
<P>
	As many members know, I have been advancing this notion of 
the single tax system for the last few years, continuing to refine 
it. Many times Canadians will say: ``Why is it that you are 
having problems in moving this debate forward?'' I always say: 
``First of all, there is a basic tax lethargy in the country. The 
second thing is that when you go to eliminate the preferences in 
the tax system, people become very queasy. Their political will 
does not tend to remain strong''.
<P>
	In the latest proposal that our team has put forward, some of 
the income deductions that would be eliminated are the 
following: attendant care expenses; moving expenses; workers' 
compensation payments; employee home relocation loan 
deduction; the stock option and shares deduction; the capital 
gains deduction; the northern residents deduction; forward 
averaging; employer paid health preplanned premiums; child 
care expenses; receipt of intercorporate dividends on the major 
tax credits eliminated.
<P>
	There is everything related to tuition, education, certain 
medical, labour sponsored funds, political contributions, 
investment tax credits, et cetera. There are a lot of preferences 
that have to be eliminated if we are going to have tax reform in 
the country.
<P>
	I believe the tax system is the one instrument that the 
Government of Canada has that can move the whole spirit of the 
country. It is the one act of Parliament that touches every single 
Canadian. If we redesign the tax act in a simplified, fair, 
efficient way so that all Canadians can feel that they are part of 
the tax renewal movement, that will be the spark that is 
necessary to first of all get capital flowing into this country. By 
having a globally competitive tax system, capital will move 
here. That in turn will ignite that entrepreneurial spirit again, to 
take chances and invest in our communities, which is how jobs 
are created. At the same time it is going to give us the ability, 
because of that uptake and faster growth, to make those cuts in 
program spending a whole lot easier  because the growth will 
have picked up some of the pain that will be there because of 
these deep program cuts we are going to have to make.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	I welcome this debate today. It is a very important debate on 
the eve of preparing the budget. However, I caution members to 
consider, as Professor Fortin has stated in his paper, that we 
cannot just look at a system where we only have fiscal 
discipline. At the same time we have to create an environment 
where we can have faster growth. We need faster growth. You 
cannot spark, induce and motivate people into taking chances 
and getting this economy going unless you hit them with a fair 
and constructive tax system.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
have been listening all day to speakers from both sides of the 
House expressing their views on how to run this country 
rationally. We are presented with the following alternative: on 
the one hand, cut services, social services naturally, and on the 
other hand, increase taxes. Never was sound management 
mentioned.
<P>
	When I was mayor of Garthby township, we were required to 
bring down a balanced budget, because municipalities were not 
allowed to have deficits. When I see a government trying to play 
Santa Claus, wasting public funds, being generous, extremely 
generous and acting in such a way that the next two or three 
generations will have to pay for this generosity today, I cannot 
help but worry about the fact that we need to borrow in order to 
pay current debt charges.
<P>
	I could give this Liberal government a number of examples of 
sound management. But last year, before Christmas, the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and member for 
Hull-Aylmer travelled aboard a government jet to go and deliver 
two ten-minute conferences on the benefits of sound 
government management, at a cost of $170,000. Also, the 
restaurant on the 6th floor of this building lost $2 million last 
year, and most of this deficit is due to the fact that senators and 
members forget to pay before leaving. Apparently the waiters do 
not run too hard after their clients either. Two million dollars.
<P>
	The operation of the other place costs $65 million each and 
every year. The government could manage a little better. When I 
hear that good taxpayers owe government $6.6 billion are these 
friends of the regime? I do not know. Corporations, companies, 
small and medium size businesses owe $6.6 billion. The 
government is forced to borrow today because it is dirt poor, yet 
it does not collect what is owed. A government that is unable to 
collect its assets does not deserve to govern the country.

<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I think that you too were the mayor of your 
municipality, so you know full well what happens to voters who 
do not pay their property taxes. After three years, their property 
is sold off to pay taxes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> My question is this: I know that 
the Liberals want to preserve family trusts and tax shelters for 
their friends because they need them to fatten up their election 
fund.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Question! Question!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Why does the hon. member for 
Broadview-Greenwood not talk about sound management? I 
will always remember when we had work done in the sixth 
concession road in my parish-and I will close on this-, all 
local truckers were hired to widen the road by laying 12 inches 
of good gravel. Of course, the trucks were not fully loaded so 
some taxpayers asked me to do something about it. I told them 
that it was not us but the provincial government that was paying. 
When they heard that, they went away reassured. Today, 
whenever Canadian taxpayers hear that expenses will be paid at 
a higher level, they feel as though the money will come from the 
sky. Yet, you never say anything about sound management. Very 
often $175,000 contracts could be carried out for $20,000 or 
$25,000.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Okay.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> So go ahead. Sound management 
is what we expect from you.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Mayor-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> As a former referee I have 
been called a lot of things but I have never been called a mayor 
because I have never been a mayor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> I thought I would give 
you an opportunity, Mr. Speaker, to set the record straight.
<P>
	First I say through you to my friend in the Bloc that we would 
never disagree with you on improving the administration of 
government. I tried to suggest that I think there is a very tight 
disciplined focus on cutting expenses and eliminating not just 
programs but cutting out waste and the expenses the member 
referred to.
<P>
	I also said that the single tax system it is an airtight system so 
that no one can exclude paying their fair share of taxes, 
including the family trusts. That is included as are all incomes in 
the system. I have sent copies to the member. Maybe he just has 
not had the time to read the proposal.
<P>
	I think there is a far more important point to make to the 
members of the Bloc here today. I get the sense from their debate 
that they are not into really constructing a positive spirit for the 
people of Canada today. I get a sense that they are trying to take 
a few cheap shots.
<P>
	I do not want to take any cheap shots, but I do want to say the 
following. I believe that one of the greatest factors in getting 
this economy of Canada going again is restoring confidence in 
our communities, confidence in our entrepreneurial sector, and 
confidence in investing in the country.
<P>
	By having a chamber like this where there are people who are 
constantly talking about taking Quebec out of Canada, I would 
venture a guess that that is costing the economy of Canada a lot 
of money. I hope they can maybe forget about being the Bloc 
Qubecois today and start taking a day to be the Bloc Canadien.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
before going on to my speech as such, I cannot help answering 
the Liberal member who just concluded by saying that we should 
be a ``Bloc Canadien''-what a slogan. Maybe he should take 
the time to think about why we are proposing sovereignty for 
Quebec and why we were elected and realize that it is probably 
in the best interest of Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	I would like him to take just a few minutes to think about it 
and see what kind of partnership there could be in future and 
maybe then he would start thinking more positively about it. 
Now, to reassure him, I entered politics for two reasons. Of 
course, I wanted to help Quebec fulfil its rightful destiny as a 
sovereign country, but I also wanted to improve the 
government's finances.
<P>
	It is not true that we will continue to go deeper into debt year 
after year, because whatever happens on the political front, we 
must improve the government's finances in the short term. The 
Minister of Finance has not done much about it in the past year. 
When he presents his next budget, I expect him to rise in this 
House and say, ``We have achieved our forecast; we will end the 
year with a deficit of $39.5 billion''. And then you will see his 
colleagues rise and give him a tremendous ovation.
<P>
	They will be proud to have such a high deficit, although the 
deficit was $41 billion last year and only the surplus in the 
unemployment insurance fund has made it possible for them to 
reduce the deficit this year, and by so little, $2 billion, just from 
the UI fund. Those people will be happy, they will be proud, they 
will feel like they are in control of the nation's finances.
<P>
	To give an idea of the size of the problem, let us talk about the 
OECD. You know, the OECD compiles statistics. It is not the 
Bloc Quebecois but a very reputable economic organization and 
I want to give you some statistics from the OECD. You know, it 
is not true that we can explain what is going on here by saying 
that it is happening throughout the world. That is not true. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8332"> 8332 </A></B>
<P>
Canada's indebtedness is much greater than other countries'. I 
tell you that the net debt is rising much faster here.
<P>
	Between 1985 and 1993, the ratio of the net debt over the GDP 
for the governments of OECD members, that is 15 countries 
including the G-7 nations, increased by 22 per cent. This is 
already pretty serious. However, for Canada, the increase for the 
same period was 77 per cent. I can just hear the Liberals say 
``There you go; this is what the Conservatives did''. Well, let us 
look at another statistic. The national debt essentially increased 
between 1970 and 1985. If we use the same indicator again, that 
is the ratio of the deficit over the GDP, we went from a surplus of 
0.3 per cent in 1970, to a deficit of 8.7 per cent in 1985, at the 
end of the Liberal government years.
<P>
	This was an unprecedented high which has not been equalled 
since. Now that the Liberal Party is back in office, its Minister of 
Finance launches an unprecedented consultation exercise to say 
that the government will hit hard. That consultation might be 
something new, but the message conveyed is certainly nothing 
new. In the two years preceding the arrival of the current finance 
minister on the scene, his predecessors said the same thing, only 
to end up with timid measures in the budget itself.
<P>
	For all sorts of reasons, people are skeptical about the 
minister announcing this year the cuts which he intends to make 
to reach his objectives. Indeed, there is such a thing as a political 
context and the government must show that the federal regime is 
good and that it benefits every Quebecer. Consequently, the 
Minister of Finance will once again only announce timid 
measures to slightly reduce the deficit.
<P>
	But wait until after the referendum. This is when the major 
cuts will be made. Last Friday, I listened with great interest to 
the finance minister, who was Jean-Luc Mongrain's guest on his 
very popular program in Quebec. The Minister of Finance, who 
looked very serious and deeply concerned by the magnitude of 
the deficit, said: ``This time, Mr. Mongrain, we have no choice 
and nobody will be spared''. I will come back to this ``nobody 
will be spared'' later.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	Now, all of a sudden, he says that we must reduce the deficit in 
order to improve the employment situation. He is saying the 
exact opposite of what his party promised during the election 
campaign. I must admit that I have not followed, day in and day 
out, all the statements made by the Liberals, but I seem to 
remember what the public has remembered, and that is the 
slogan they used and the fact that they were always talking about 
``jobs, jobs, jobs''. They assured us that job creation would 
restore dignity. They have now found out that they must first 
deal with the deficit, and that will help to improve employment.
<P>
	That sounds like what the Conservatives used to say. That is 
what the Minister of Finance used to say, and since the Minister 
of Finance is still at the helm, whether he is Liberal or 
Conservative does not change anything, the statements are all 
the same and Paul Martin, as Minister of Finance, is making the 
same old statements. Nothing has changed, except maybe for the 
colour of the cover page. He now tells us that, yes, these are the 
measures the government has to take.
<P>
	The same thing goes for the monetary policy. It is amazing to 
see how members change their minds when they change sides in 
this House. The Liberals ferociously criticized the monetary 
policy put forward by the Conservatives, but now that they are in 
office, they keep quiet on this issue. They keep going in the same 
direction as their predecessors; all they have changed is the 
director, the Governor of the Bank of Canada, to replace him by 
someone who thinks alike.
<P>
	Some experts, including Pierre Fortin, an economist at 
UQAM whom a Liberal member quoted extensively earlier, 
have told the finance committee that the government still has 
some leeway to toy with the short-term interest rates. The 
inflation rate is low, very low, in Canada, and the difference 
between the rates in Canada and the United States is still 
relatively high, compared to what it could be. Inflation is 
beginning to be felt a little more in the United States.
<P>
	But we keep following the same restrictive monetary policy. 
Worse, we are now being told that both policies, the monetary 
policy and the fiscal policy, will be restrictive. This monetary 
policy, and especially the short-term interest rates, give you 
something to think about. But now they have gone back to their 
offices at the Department of Finance, and that is it.
<P>
	Earlier, a Liberal member said, and this is typical, that 
economic growth would take care of everything. There is 
something fundamentally wrong about this reasoning. The 
figures we get from their own Department of Finance tell us that 
80 per cent of the current deficit is due to structural problems. 
The structural unemployment rate is 8.5 per cent. This means 
that even with strong economic growth, the current deficit 
cannot be reduced by more than 20 per cent and the 
unemployment rate cannot be brought below the 8.5 per cent 
mark.
<P>
	As far as structural problems are concerned, and I will get 
back to this later before I finish, the World Competitiveness 
Report provided some interesting information on Canada's 
competitive position and contained references to structural 
problems. I agree, these are complex issues which are not easy 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8333"> 8333 </A></B>
<P>
to explain, but the people who are running the government 
should understand.
<P>
	Here again, we see very little change from the previous 
government. So what is happening as far as the next budget is 
concerned?
<P>
	I would like to comment briefly on the prebudget 
consultations. I was involved from the very beginning. I went on 
the tour of the Western provinces, and I wonder who was talking 
to whom. These prebudget consultations were planned some 
time ago, but the groups that appeared before the committee 
were informed only two or three days ahead of time. They 
appeared at the last minute and apologized, saying they had been 
invited on very short notice. How come? This was supposed to 
be the widest ranging consultation in the history of the 
Department of Finance, and people hardly knew about it. They 
were unable to make a good presentation, because they were 
pressed for time.
<P>
	At this time of the year, the next budget is already at an 
advanced stage. One wonders how significant the committee's 
contribution can be, when we consider that from today onward, 
every day is almost a whole day too late. There will be a 
postponement until December 7. It could have been much later, 
but there definitely was pressure not to go any later than 
December 7.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	I will now discuss the feelers put out by the Minister of 
Finance concerning RRSPs. It is incredible the kind of concern 
we are now seeing about RRSPs. All options were open, when I 
put the question to the minister on a number of occasions here in 
the House. Did he intend to tax capital accumulated in RRSPs? 
Reduce the maximum annual contribution? The total 
accumulated contributions? Not a word. The door is wide open.
<P>
	One of Canada's weak points as far as its competitive position 
is concerned is its level of savings. In your first course in 
macroeconomics, you learn that one of the key variables that 
generate investment is savings. When you buy an RRSP, this is 
money you save which is then reinvested. If the Minister of 
Finance wants to play around with the savings of Canadians 
which are already very limited, we are not going in the right 
direction.
<P>
	That is the signal he is giving people for next year. People will 
be concerned when it comes time to contribute to their RRSP. 
They will say to people who want to sell them RRSPs: ``Yes, but 
if I put the money in, you say that it is a good vehicle, because it 
helps us improve our tax planning and defer paying taxes on our 
income until we are retired. But now, I am not so sure, because 
there are rumours the Minister of Finance is going to tamper 
with that''. Even if he does not do it in the February budget, we 
have no guarantee he will not do so the year after. He should 
send a clear message to the public that he will not tamper with 
this vehicle and that it would be useless for him to do so. All he 
would be doing is siphon money out of retirement funds. At the 
present time we are borrowing, but this would drive us to borrow 
even more in the future.
<P>
	What is going to happen when these people retire if there is 
less money in their retirement funds? What is going to happen? 
It will be a disaster. It is a very strange reasoning, especially 
when one considers that family trusts can defer paying any 
capital gains tax until the death of the last beneficiary, that is to 
say for 80 years if we limit ourselves to normal life expectancy. 
We are told: ``No, we are not considering actualization every 21 
years, as it was done previously. No, it is out of the question, it 
would be bad for the economy. It would serve no purpose''. Yet, 
the government wants to impose it on individuals, 
middle-income taxpayers. They are told: ``We are going to tax 
your future income right away''.
<P>
	There is a great lack of consistency there. This is a very 
skewed reasoning which will have to be explained. Of course, 
the government keeps the door open by saying: ``Yes, we did not 
do it, but wait for the next budget. This is not too serious''. We 
could have healthy consultations if people knew where we were 
heading. At present, everything is open, in any direction. It is 
not necessarily a bad thing to open everything for review, but 
when we look at the papers that the minister publishes, we see 
very strange things. Take fiscal spending for example, tax 
credits for charitable donations are considered almost like 
wasteful fiscal spending, when they are actually very good for 
the economy. They actually reduce the amount the government 
would otherwise have to pay. Expenses are only dealt with in 
terms of personal income taxes, not corporate taxes.
<P>
	I would like to present a few statistics illustrating the depth of 
the challenge facing us since cuts are so often mentioned.
<P>
	Let us have a look at the distribution of the population in 
terms of income brackets. This is based on income tax returns. 
About 20 million taxpayers file a return. It is rather shocking to 
see that 50 per cent of the population has an annual income of 
$20,000 or less; 50 per cent. If you go up to $25,000, you find 
that 60 per cent of the population has an income of $25,000 or 
less.
<P>
	To balance the budget and bring the deficit under control, that 
means $2,000 for each and every person. Twenty million 
taxpayers at $2,000 equal $40 billion. Of course we could take 
the economic growth into account. However, we must keep one 
thing in mind, the interest on the debt is increasing because we 
are going deeper into debt. Every year, we must pay more 
interest. Economic growth allows us to generate additional 
revenues to pay increasing interests.
<P>
	Now we are told that we must bring this problem under 
control, so the government targets the middle of the pyramid or 
the bottom half, where 60 per cent of the population is.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	Cutting expenditures may affect everybody in pretty much the 
same way. But proportionally, it is those with an income of 
$25,000 or less who are going to be hit the hardest. You can see 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8334"> 8334 </A></B>
<P>
right away that, if this is the way the  government decides to go, 
it is going to be impossible, inhumane.
<P>
	What is the alternative? Why not target the top of the 
pyramid? The middle class is not part of this picture yet, but if 
you want to go higher, you will find that 20 to 30 per cent of the 
population is in the $25,000 to $55,000 bracket. Right away, you 
can see what a huge challenge this is going to be; reduced 
spending alone will not be enough. We should take a look at 
fiscal expenditures. Now you should see how hard it is to get 
information. It is complex, it affects the economy, it hurts, 
whereas it does not hurt to attack the underprivileged, to cut 
benefits paid to the unemployed. They do not consume goods 
and services, therefore they do not contribute to the economy in 
the eyes of that party. Only the rich contribute to the economy. 
That is the myth. And the Reform Party is in total agreement. 
They think alike on this issue. They think that the rich drive the 
economy, not the middle class. This is a terrible thought.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Terrible and terribly wrong.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brien:</B> I hope that they will see fit to deal with the top of 
the pyramid and address the squandering going on at that level.
<P>
	I see that I have only a few moments remaining in my 
speaking time. Let me briefly touch on taxation, just to say that a 
major confidence-building factor is missing at present. When 
you look at outstanding tax accounts totalling $6.6 billion. But 
82 per cent of this amount is owed by 25 per cent of the 
taxpayers who have tax accounts oustanding. Yet the Minister of 
National Revenue is pleased to tell us: ``We are much more 
efficient; we recover a much greater number of accounts''. What 
he does not say is that they go for the small accounts. The large 
ones, they do not touch them. In the private sector, we go for the 
big accounts, we do not deal with the small ones first. Efforts are 
made in both cases, but here you are less efficient; you start with 
small accounts and large accounts. After a while, you have all 
kinds of problems on you hands. I am not talking about accounts 
in dispute, because then you could add another $2.5 billion. The 
Department of National Revenue generally wins most of these 
disputes. This means that, eventually, a few more billions can be 
expected to be recovered.
<P>
	To this we can add the GST with overdue accounts in excess of 
$1 billion. The total amount owed the government is close to 
$9.5 billion. Why? Because people do not trust the government, 
because they feel that they are paying more than their fair share 
and are increasingly turning to the underground economy. More 
and more of them are rejecting and revolting against our tax 
system. What are they doing about this? Nothing yet. They do 
not even have the will to tackle the problem. They do not even 
talk about it. That is unacceptable.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois will include its suggestions in the report 
to be submitted by the finance committee. They must remember 
one thing: They were elected to make  decisions. They must stop 
hiding behind all the consultations they are holding to help them 
make decisions. They are paid to make decisions. The Minister 
of Finance was appointed by the Prime Minister to make 
decisions. He is not going to hide behind committees that will 
support his comments or tell him not to do this or that; it is up to 
him to decide. In any case, people will soon get fed up with these 
phony consultations. People are very skeptical, and with good 
reason, as we will see if they listened to what the people they 
consulted had to say about RRSPs.
<P>
	I will close by addressing the issue of competitiveness. I will 
limit myself to four points out of many. We have our strong 
points, the areas where we rank in the middle, and our 
weaknesses. Since we want to improve, let us look at the 
weaknesses. Since I have only two minutes left, I will close on 
this. Some companies do not provide their employees with 
adequate training. This sounds to me like a training problem. 
The education system is not in line with the business world. This 
also sounds like a training problem. We are told of weaknesses 
in our education system. True, it is a provincial jurisdiction. 
Quite so. But here the provinces get money in the form of 
transfer payments. Suddenly they are told that their aid will be 
cut and that their students will have to go into debt. The 
government can no longer afford it. Students will have to go into 
debt. In addition to having to bear an incredible tax burden in the 
coming years, they will have to go into debt personally to pay for 
their own education. We benefited from the education system; 
now it is their turn to pay the bill for it and pay and pay and pay.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	They take us for a bunch of idiots. What they are trying to do 
is unacceptable. It amounts to several billion dollars. Besides, 
we have learned that they even want to touch the tax points 
which Quebec acquired in the past; they will find obstacles in 
their path. We will block their way.
<P>
	Two more points. We hear that governments have trouble 
adapting to new economic realities. In the present context where 
we must adjust quickly to markets, we need flexible, responsive, 
efficient political entities. What we have here is a political 
system that is completely paralyzed and has trouble moving; it 
consults and consults. How many consultations has it done? The 
Liberals are going over the same ground as the Conservatives 
did in 1984, with consultations on the same subjects. Why? 
Because finding a consensus in Canada is very difficult.
<P>
	And then they tell us that we are out-and-out demagogues 
when we talk about sovereignty. It is a model which they should 
consider seriously. If they were honest, they would tell people 
across Canada that it is an option worth considering. I conclude 
with this: People are ready to make sacrifices, to the extent that 
they feel it is fair and everyone is doing their share, starting with 
the top of the pyramid. In terms of spending, this is the top  of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8335"> 8335 </A></B>
<P>
the pyramid and we must cut spending. When that happens, 
people will really start to gain confidence.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I also happen to have a few 
questions for the hon. member opposite. We hear a lot about 
scenarios, about the country's precarious finances, the 
exponential growth of the debt and the other problems of the last 
few years.
<P>
	As you know, this exponential growth of the debt did not only 
occur in Canada: It was a worldwide phenomenon. I would like 
to know what the monetary and fiscal policy of Quebec's 
government would be-assuming an independent Quebec-, 
because all we hear is that Quebec intends to share Canada's 
financial system and that any monetary policy would be, if I am 
not mistaken, a joint policy.
<P>
	In that context, what would be Quebec's contribution? How 
would it change the system that is currently in place? I am also 
intrigued by the hon. member's comments on interest rates. How 
are we going to deal with the confusion and the concerns of 
international investors if Quebec becomes independent? I am 
curious to hear how we could control interest rates in such a 
context.
<P>
	According to the member, there are some experts who claim 
that interest rates are very low in Canada and that a lot must be 
done in that regard. However, what kind of guarantee can the 
member give regarding those interest rates, assuming that 
Quebec becomes independent? There is no question that, as 
regards finances, political confidence is always a factor. I 
believe that this political confidence exists in Canada, but what 
guarantee do we have that everything will go just fine in Quebec 
if it becomes independent?
<P>
	How will the hon. member convince investors, considering 
that Quebec will have to take its share of the country's $500 
billion deficit, not to mention the deficits incurred by the 
province and by Hydro Quebec? It is well known that deficits in 
Quebec are much higher, per capita, than anywhere else in the 
western world.
<P>
	So, how will the hon. member convince foreign investors, 
given that this new country would be struggling with a huge debt 
larger than that of any other region in Canada? I would 
appreciate an answer to these questions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brien:</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to teach 
the hon. member for Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine some 
economic concepts.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> He does need it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brien:</B> First of all, I am very glad to see that the member 
is starting to reflect upon the possibility of a sovereign Quebec, 
of what a sovereign Quebec could achieve and could be. We 
should probably be thankful to his constituents who are now 
more than ever telling him that they think it is a desirable model 
and probably a forward-looking option. So now, the member is 
curious about the policies of the Bloc Quebecois and is showing 
some interest.
<P>
	I am really glad and I congratulate his constituents for 
showing him the errors of his way. The member raised four 
points in his question, which I want to go over, one by one. He 
said that the public debt is a world-wide phenomenon. It is so 
easy to use clichés! Since the member thinks that this is a 
world-wide phenomenon, let me repeat what I said at the 
beginning of my speech, there are two periods to consider.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	I heard one of my colleagues say that the Liberals are 
responsible for Canada's indebtedness. That is probably more 
exact. Between 1970 and 1985, we started with a surplus to end 
up with a very significant deficit.
<P>
	At the international level, between 1985 and 1993, a period 
dominated by the Conservatives which the Liberals would 
qualify as a very difficult time, the debt level of member States 
of the OECD increased by 22 per cent. Meanwhile, the debt in 
Canada rose by 77 per cent, roughly 3.5 times more than in 
OECD countries. Maybe indebtedness is a world wide 
phenomenon, but the phenomenon in Canada is a lot bigger than 
anywhere else, probably due to structural problems.
<P>
	He takes an interest in what the monetary policy of a 
sovereign Quebec would be. I am happy to see that he thinks 
about it and that a sovereign State of Quebec might be allowed to 
sit on the board of the Bank of Canada to discuss its point of 
view. It would be interesting to finally be able to discuss issues 
as an equal partner. Anyway, all I said about the monetary policy 
is that his party-I do not know if he was a member of 
Parliament at the time or if he followed the business of the 
House-his Minister of Finance and all Liberals criticized John 
Crow and the monetary policy of the Bank of Canada. But now 
that they are themselves in charge, they tell us the current 
restrictive and harsh monetary policy must be maintained.
<P>
	All I noted is a blatant contradiction. All I said about the 
monetary policy is that whoever is asked to apply it should be 
forced to solve the problem of short-term interest rates. He said 
that interest rates are low in Canada, while, on the contrary, 
interest rates are high in Canada. The difference with the United 
States is larger. That is what has to be looked at, especially 
concerning short-term rates. People should not be misled on 
such serious concepts.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8336"> 8336 </A></B>
<P>
	He talked about international finance and the fact they worry 
about a sovereign State of Quebec that would be ``crippled with 
debts'', in the words of the hon. member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine. If Quebec can be said to 
be crippled with debts, how would he describe Canada's current 
debt situation? Canada is, with Italy, one of the countries most 
heavily in debt. Actually, Italy's foreign debt is much less 
serious than Canada's or even Quebec's.
<P>
	What international financiers will look at are the results. That 
is what they will look at. His colleagues and himself-well 
maybe not himself because he will continue to live with us in 
Quebec, especially since we sense a very strong change in 
attitude on his part. As I was saying, his colleagues will have to 
take their responsibilities and consider an economic partnership 
because it is not true that Ontario will refuse to trade with 
Quebec. That province has a $3 billion trade surplus with 
Quebec. I cannot imagine Toronto business people-who are 
supposed to be very rational-saying that even though they 
make money, they no longer wish to do business with Quebec.
<P>
	The Liberals will have to explain to their constituents that it 
could be a very interesting free trade zone. It is a 
forward-looking and constructive option. Our constituents 
expect us to have a sense of responsibility, to stop playing 
politics like we would like to do sometimes.
<P>
	The financial community will indeed look very carefully at 
what is going on in Quebec and in Canada compared to 
international markets.
<P>
	My main concern right now is that Canada is probably 
ill-prepared to face what may happen over the next year. 
Perhaps it will be Canada's credit rating that will suffer the 
most, which is not desirable. As Quebecers, we do not wish to 
see Canada find itself in a difficult situation because it will be 
our neighbour and we want it to be economically healthy. The 
member for Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine certainly 
wants the same thing we do.
<P>
	We are told that 80 per cent of the present deficit is due to 
structural problems. I will talk about structural problems and 
about reports on competitiveness that were prepared by people 
who are not necessarily members of the Bloc Quebecois, but are 
world renowned specialists. They tell us that we have 
weaknesses in adjusting rapidly to the modern context. 
Problems in manpower training were also pinpointed. All 
Quebecers, federalists and sovereignists alike, think Quebec 
should have jurisdiction over manpower training, but no. Simple 
and basic demands like that are just ignored.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	That is why more and more Quebecers, including those in the 
riding of Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, have 
undertaken a positive thought process, and, within a year, will 
make a decision to improve their economic situation, both for 
them and for future generations, in order to build a thriving 
Quebec, next to countries who  hopefully will also prosper, 
Canada and the United States.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I did not expect to be the next one 
to speak. I will nonetheless try to elaborate on the global picture 
of our financial situation. I think the Minister of Finance has 
already explained how critical it is. And not only must we suffer 
these difficult times, we must also suffer cynicism on the part of 
the opposition.
<P>
	When I hear members of the opposition say that the only way 
out is independence or sovereignty, I believe the vast majority of 
Quebecers do not agree with that option which will not generate 
any advantage or improve the economic issues of common 
concern to all Quebecers.
<P>
	I would like to speak mainly of the pre-budget consultation 
which will soon be underway. I believe we are about to have a 
new economic framework.
<P>
	It is important to remember that our government has limited 
revenues, and that problem is experienced by the federal 
government, by the provinces and by countries all over the 
world, especially western countries. Our government has 
limited possibilities for direct investment. They cannot solve all 
the problems and we should not expect them to do so.
<P>
	I believe the purpose of governmental action is to encourage 
partnerships. At the federal level, we are quite prepared to work 
in co-operation with provinces, municipalities and businesses. I 
think it is very important and, as the member from the other side 
said so well, what people want is a spirit of co-operation.
<P>
	One of the strong points of Canadian federalism has always 
been, for 125 years, the ability to find common grounds, to find 
ways of reaching sectoral agreements. Of course there are areas 
under the federal jurisdiction and others under the Quebec 
jurisdiction, but we often have to work together. Instead of 
splitting up and thinking that Quebec will be better off once it is 
on its own in a North American context, I doubt very much that 
Quebecers will agree with such a scenario or, for that matter, the 
proposal of Mr. Parizeau and, of course, the Leader of the 
Opposition.
<P>
	We were talking about the need to control the debt. I think that 
has a lot to do with productivity in Canada. We have to review 
not only our policies and how we manage the government, but 
also how we help the small and medium businesses to revitalize 
the Canadian economy.
<P>
	With that as a background, we are looking for some 
reductions, of course, but that does not necessarily mean that we 
do not want to reconsider our objectives. The government global 
strategy is job creation. By creating jobs, we encourage people 
to pay taxes, to participate in the economy and that is the only 
way out for us.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8337"> 8337 </A></B>
<P>
	When we talk about program review, we always talk about the 
social security reform. I think it is important to recognize that 
after 50 years, we have to review that program. We have to 
reconsider it to allow the federal government to carry on the way 
it should and revitalize the economy of our country.
<P>
	When you take a look at the reform, I think the government 
and all the social and economic stakeholders, from Quebec or 
other parts of Canada, worry about the emergency of finding 
new niches, new opportunities for the Canadian industry. We 
were certainly able to deal-
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Certainly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> Unfortunately, opposition members do not want 
to take part in this debate. The only thing that they are interested 
in is independence, sovereignty, but not necessarily the 
well-being of their fellow citizens.
<P>
	In my riding of Bonaventure, I am very concerned by the level 
of education, of schooling of my constituents. That is certainly a 
problem. There are many certainties in politics. But among 
other certainties is the fact that the rate of secondary level 
graduates is much lower in Quebec than in other Western 
countries. I think that there is a lot to be done at the professional 
training level. We have the opportunity to encourage these 
young people to discover new horizons. The only way that we 
can do that is to ensure a sort of continuity in the Canadian 
federation, but also to encourage the young people to complete 
their studies, to encourage businesses to hire them afterwards 
and to give a chance to these new and small businesses to find 
new markets not only at the Canadian level, but also at the 
international level.
<P>
	The federal government must take into account not only the 
social security net, but also the new defence policy of the 
Government of Canada in a world where the cold war is over, 
where we do not have the same number of soldiers and officers 
any more, where our need or our strategy is no longer a military 
one, as regards the East European bloc. We certainly get some 
benefits from that. No doubt we have to revisit and reconsider 
the funds allocated to National Defence.
<P>
	There is also our foreign policy which costs us a lot of money. 
Once again, we must develop a new strategy. What is the new 
Canadian strategy at the international level? I think the Prime 
Minister made a remarkable demonstration of it when he 
determined that in the future, the Government of Canada and 
above all, the Prime Minister, would have to promote our 
products and services worldwide.
<P>
	Let us look at what happened in China, for example. We 
signed contracts for almost $8, $9 or $10 billion. I think that this 
mission was very profitable to Canadians, to Canadian 
businesses and also to companies from Quebec. We now have 
learned that 30 per cent of the contracts were awarded to Quebec 
businesses. The reputation of Canada was, of course, 
instrumental in all of this. In order to get contracts, especially in 
Asia and  most particularly in China, you have to give small 
businesses support, sometimes at a fiscal level but also at the 
level of foreign policy, to get signatures on contracts, very 
important contracts.
<P>
	According to Bernard Landry, it is unfortunate that these 
contracts were negotiated before the Prime Minister of Canada 
arrived in China.
<P>
	We have to recognize that for these countries it is important to 
deal with politically stable countries, recognized in the area of 
international trade, countries which have acquired an enviable 
reputation like Canada. We must acknowledge that it is not the 
case of Quebec. Quebec is not an independent country, Quebec 
always took advantage of the fact that it was part of Canada, it 
always capitalized on our good reputation in the world of 
international trade.
<P>
	I will repeat that the consultations undertaken by the 
Department of Finance, and naturally the committee, are meant 
to give information to Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	This information on the deficit is fairly well known, we have 
talked at length about the accumulated debt, and about the 
situation in the provinces and municipalities. We have to take 
into account the new Canadian policies regarding job 
development, defence, foreign affairs; all of these have one 
overriding goal, to revitalize the national economy.
<P>
	However, once we have given this basic information, we have 
to itemize spending, we must tell Canadians where our money 
comes from, and explain why we have a deficit. You know, it is 
not easy to explain, but numbers are self-explanatory. That is 
the reason why we must appeal to Canadians from all walks of 
life to give their opinion and suggest solutions to the deficit 
problem we are facing right now.
<P>
	Whether Quebec becomes independent or not, the deficit is a 
problem we share with all provinces. When you prioritize 
economic recovery, you give priority to Canada for the 
economic benefit of all Canadians. Obviously, we must work 
together. I believe that every one of us has the duty to take into 
account the fiscal reality of the country as well as the 
possibilities to find common solutions.
<P>
	We are now talking about the central role of the federal 
government, but we still want to hear the point of view of all 
Canadians in every sector of the economy. I believe that when 
the committee starts touring the country, it will meet east-coast 
fishermen, people working in the forestry area, not only 
workers, but also businessmen.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="8338"> 8338 </A></B>
<P>
	Of course, we must assess what our strengths are, but also our 
weaknesses; this is the way to reach a common position. In 
Ontario, we will certainly meet more industrialists, in the car 
and aerospace industries. There is a lot to do, in every province.
<P>
	Getting advice from all the sectors in which we are strong is a 
priority for these consultations. I hope that the opposition will 
take part in them. University professors, scientists and scholars 
will also be able to contribute so that we can get our national 
economy going again. Strangely enough, when we talk about 
national economic recovery, this includes local and even 
regional economic recovery.
<P>
	This past week-end, in Eastern Quebec, the Université du 
Québec à Rimouski granted economic regional development 
certificates. People, especially young people, were asked how to 
elaborate new economic development policies. I see my time is 
running out. What a pity! Twenty minutes go by so quickly-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I will give the floor back to the member at 3 
p.m. and we will listen to him with great interest. It being 2 p.m., 
pursuant to Standing Order 30(5), the House will now proceed to 
Statements by Members pursuant to Standing Order 31.

	The Bloc Quebecois is prepared to be actively involved as a 
major player in the referendum, because the battle ahead of us 
will be the battle of a lifetime. We will demonstrate that 
sovereignty is essential to the development of Quebec and the

	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last Friday 
it was implied both inside the House and outside that I would 
preclude women with children from working in my office 
because I was concerned that their family responsibilities would 
impair their ability to do their job.
<P>
	That is simply not the case. I apologize for failing to make my 
position clear in my comments in the standing committee. Two 
of my staff are married women with children and I oppose bias in 
hiring, particularly on marital grounds. I asked applicants 
during the interview stage about their family situation but this 
was not a factor in the hiring decision. I selected people on the 
basis of their qualifications and experience.
<P>
	I now understand this is against the rules and I will refrain 
from doing so in the future. However I think it is sad that an 
employer cannot discuss an employee's family situation to 
arrange support for them during family sickness or emergency.

	This story slanders Ukraine and ethnic Ukrainians

	<B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, recently the

damage caused by a lightning strike some 30 years ago.
<P>
	This well-known character resides in North Pelham and is an 
80 foot tall sugar maple tree named the Comfort maple and is 
reported to be 500 years old. I am pleased to announce that 
restoration this summer has had excellent results and the 
Comfort maple is recovering well.
<P>
	This summer the Comfort maple was host to a stamp launch 
by Canada Post for its maple tree stamp series. This event was 
all the more significant because members of the Comfort family 
of West Lincoln after which the tree is named celebrated their 
100th consecutive family reunion.
<P>
	The Comfort maple reminds us that we have been here for 
such a short time. Five hundred years ago the exploration of 
Canada by explorers had only just begun. Yet here stands this 
tree a witness to all subsequent events.
<P>
	The history of the Canadian nation and this tree have run a 
parallel course. The maple leaf is an enduring symbol of our 
great nation. This magnificent tree has survived stormy times, 
as has our country. Both will continue to flourish and grow for 
many, many years to come.

	<B>Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex-Windsor, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canada's economic performance in recent months has been very 
encouraging.
<P>
	Real growth at 6.4 per cent in the second quarter far outstrips 
the performance of any other G-7 country. Retail sales are up in 
the third quarter and up 7.8 per cent over last year. Real exports 
are up 5.6 per cent in the third quarter. This is a record level and 
the fastest growth since 1983.
<P>
	Employment is up by 307,000 jobs since January, all full time 
jobs. Employment growth in recent months has been the most 
rapid in almost six years. The unemployment rate has fallen 
from 11.4 per cent in January to 10 per cent in October. Over 
April to August  the deficit is $4.5 billion lower than in the same 
period in 1993-94.
<P>
	It is results like these that lead the IMF to project that Canada 
will have the strongest growth in output and the highest rate of 
growth in employment in all the G-7 countries in both 1994 and 
1995.

	Meanwhile, the government is cutting UI and welfare

additional 15,000 to 20,000 boxes from locations outside of

chair a meeting of Ministers of the Environment from the G-7 
nations. It will take place in Hamilton in April 1995.
<P>
	The meeting will provide a forum for environment ministers 
from the world's most industrialized countries to discuss 
common priorities and to work together to solve common 
problems. The government is convinced that the twin goals of a 
healthy environment and economy must be pursued at the same 
time. By inviting G-7 environment ministers and

	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
according to the National Council on Welfare over 1.2 million 
children under age 18 live in poverty. From a recent report by the 
Campaign 2000 coalition we learned that there are over 300,000 
more poor children today than five years ago.
<P>
	Furthermore at the latest Canadian Medical Association 
conference it was reported that poor children are twice as likely 
to suffer psychiatric disorders, failing grades and hyperactivity 
than more affluent children. Evidently poor children are more 
apt to drop out of school.
<P>
	For social, moral and economic reasons the government has a 
responsibility to ensure that all Canadian children have an equal 
opportunity to fully participate in Canadian life.
<P>

on child poverty unanimously passed by this House in 1989.

	Same thing for the debt and the deficit. Although the minister 
knows that he must cut spending in the public service, he has not 
made a single proposal. Yet, the minister is already slashing 
social programs without the necessary studies in hand. History 
repeats itself: Ottawa has decided to cut but it is the provinces 
and the unemployed who will pay the price.

Speaker, according to press reports the government is seriously 
considering selling off CBC television stations.
<P>
	Despite the promises made in the Liberal red book to support 
the CBC and the fact that the Standing Committee on Canadian

	The CBC has been and is an essential instrument that allows 
Canadians to see and hear each other and to develop their own

privatize the CBC and to kill public broadcasting? By selling off 
the CBC TV stations what channel will Canadians be able to 
tune into to see Canadian programs?

week when the Reform Party of Canada announced its proposed 
cuts to the federal budget, the most draconian cuts ever proposed 
in the history of Canada, the leader of the Reform Party had the 
nerve to claim that these cuts focused on non-social spending.
<P>
	By calling for a 25 per cent reduction in the budget of CMHC, 
Reform Party members are calling for the federal government to 
break hundreds of federal-provincial contracts and agreements 
as well as thousands of contracts with public and private 
non-profits and co-operatives across Canada. They are also 
calling for cuts in social spending in the worst areas, affecting 
the poorest of the poor.

income is on the average less than $12,000: ``Get out of social

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
situation continues to deteriorate in Bosnia, where 55 Canadian 
peacekeepers are still being kept hostage. In an obvious attempt 
at intimidation, Serb forces launched rockets yesterday near 
observation posts manned by Canadian peacekeepers near 
Visoko. The United States, France, Russia, Germany and Great 
Britain are asking for an immediate cease-fire at Bihac and in 
all combat zones in Bosnia Hercegovina, while General Michael 
Rose, commander-in-chief of the 24,000 peacekeepers in 
Bosnia, mentioned the possibility of withdrawing the UN 
peacekeepers in view of the escalation of armed conflict.
<P>
	Could the Prime Minister confirm that the 55 Canadian 
peacekeepers being kept hostage are being treated well and that 
negotiations with the Serb authorities for their release are still 
deadlocked?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the 55 Canadian soldiers are not, strictly speaking, 
being kept hostage. They are being kept in the positions they 
occupied, and they continue to do the job  they were doing 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8342"> 8342 </A></B>
<P>
before in the territories concerned. I am also informed they are 
being treated quite acceptably.
<P>
	Negotiations are continuing, to try to bring the situation back 
to normal. Everyone hopes there will soon be an agreement on a 
new cease-fire. Of course, here in Canada, we should all support 
our troops, who are going through a very difficult situation on 
their humanitarian mission to this part of the world. We hope 
that although our soldiers are experiencing problems at this 
time, and with them soldiers from other countries, things will 
get back to normal in a matter of days.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
mobility of the 55 Canadians have been severely curtailed, in the 
situation that now prevails in Bosnia-Hercegovina.
<P>
	Could the Prime Minister tell the House whether the Serb 
authorities have reacted officially to the request by the United 
States, Russia, France, Germany and Great Britain for a 
cease-fire at Bihac?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, according to our information, the Serbs would accept 
an indefinite cease fire, while the Bosnian Muslims want a cease 
fire for A period of three months. Meanwhile, discussions are 
continuing to try and reach an agreement. It is encouraging, that 
both parties want a cease fire. We now have to wait and see 
whether it will be for an indeterminate period or for a specific 
period.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, does the 
Prime Minister share General Rose's views about a possible 
withdrawal of all peacekeepers from Bosnia, and does he agree 
that such a withdrawal will only lead to a escalation of the Serb 
offensive, with dire consequences for the civilian population 
and thousands of refugees who will be left without help or 
humanitarian aid?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Canadian troops and other UN troops are playing a very 
useful role. They have managed to protect the civilians there, 
giving them food and medication during the past many winters 
of conflict.
<P>
	To withdraw them, the hon. member is quite right, might 
cause extremely difficult circumstances in Europe.

<P>
	At the end of next week I will be in Europe. I am going to 
Budapest on Sunday where all the heads of state will be. It will 
be a good occasion to deal with the problem. Of course the 
position of Canada is the same as the French and the British. We 
are there but if there is a lifting of the arms embargo we will get 
out.
<P>
	In the meantime, having troops there is very useful. I would 
like to praise the Canadian soldiers who are doing a fantastic 
job. I would like to tell them they have the support of the 
Canadian people.

	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister. Of the G7 
countries, Canada spends the least on AIDS research, while 
Canada is third among the G7 countries for the per capita rate of 
HIV infection.
<P>
	Two days before he leaves for Paris to take part in an 
important international conference on AIDS, how can the Prime 
Minister justify Canada's lagging behind in the fight against this 
terrible illness which affects and threatens the lives of thousands 
of Quebecers and Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member says that Canada is not doing its 
share. On the contrary, I think that Canada is doing its share and 
that we have invested considerable amounts in research to find a 
solution for this global scourge. I hope that the summit 
organized by France and chaired by Mr. Balladur can move 
things forward in all countries of the world. I will be able to tell 
them that Canada wants to do as much as other countries to 
address this difficult problem.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, how can the Prime Minister explain his sudden interest 
in the fight against AIDS when his government only reluctantly 
maintained the $42 million budget for phase 2 of the national 
AIDS strategy, an amount which-may we remind you-the 
Liberals found clearly insufficient when they were in 
opposition?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this program, like all others, is now being discussed 
with all departments. We have a difficult budget problem. We 
inherited a $500 billion debt and the government's resources are 
necessarily limited. We are maintaining the program and we 
hope that research will advance in Canada and elsewhere in the 
world.

	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, Canadians are appalled that some of our 
peacekeepers are being held hostage and were targeted in a 
rocket attack yesterday.
<P>
	In September the Minister of National Defence informed the 
House that he had renewed Canada's engagement in Yugoslavia 
conditionally for six months. He said that the situation is under 
review, if the situation on the ground changes, if the safety of 
Canadian troops is threatened and if the usefulness of the UN 
mandate has been undermined.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8343"> 8343 </A></B>
<P>
	Since the situation on the ground has changed and the safety 
of our troops is threatened and the ability of the UN to carry out 
its mandate has been undermined, will the minister reconsider 
Canada's participation?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I had the occasion to say earlier that the Canadian role 
there is very useful. There will be a discussion this weekend in 
Budapest where the heads of state will be meeting. It will 
certainly be one of the items discussed.
<P>
	The Canadian position has always been that we want to 
maintain our troops there as long as there is no lifting of the 
arms embargo. We are to review our commitment every six 
months. The commitment we made in September will be 
maintained until February and we will review our position in 
due course.
<P>
	In the meantime, I will discuss this next week, especially with 
the French and the British who are in the same position as we 
are. We have decided to have a discussion before making the 
final decision. I will be in a position to report more next week.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I know there is general support for Canada's 
involvement in the United Nations and in NATO but we fear that 
the situation in Bosnia is jeopardized by the suggestions that the 
U.S.A. has now sided with the Bosnians while Russia is 
sympathetic to the Serbs and may unilaterally withdraw its 
peacekeeping forces.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	How is Canada responding to this move away from neutrality 
by our peacekeeping partners?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is not useful for anybody to encourage any side there 
and whoever is doing that is not rendering a service to the 
situation.
<P>
	We have been there for three years. We have soldiers there and 
other countries have soldiers there as well. I think the people 
who do not have soldiers there should be prudent because it is 
the lives of Canadian soldiers and others that are at stake. They 
should keep that in mind.
<P>
	We are there and we think we play a very useful role in terms 
of maintaining peace and helping the citizens to survive. I hope 
the people with no soldiers there will remember that we are 
there.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, Canadians are justifiably proud of our 
peacekeepers but the disregard for the blue berets in Bosnia 
suggests that the UN has mismanaged this mission and is 
tarnishing the reputation of UN peacekeepers, thereby setting a 
very dangerous precedent for this and future peacekeeping 
operations.
<P>
	What is the Prime Minister's government doing to prevent our 
continued participation in this mission from compromising our 
effectiveness in future peacekeeping operations?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the best way we can maintain our international 
reputation is to fulfil our mandate there. When I had the 
occasion in June to go to Sarajevo I was told that the best 
soldiers there are always the Canadians, that the UN always 
relies on Canadians in very difficult circumstances.
<P>
	We are all very proud of them. The fact that they are 
participating will not reduce their reputation. On the contrary, 
they have kept their cool under extremely difficult 
circumstances over the weekend and they should all be 
congratulated. We want to tell them that we are very proud of 
them.

	<B>Mr. Michel Daviault (Ahuntsic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister. When Phase 2 of the 
Canadian strategy against AIDS was approved, it was agreed 
that $1.5 million would be allocated for unplanned 
requirements. Consequently, after proposals are made by 
national partners, the minister has discretionary power 
regarding the use of these funds.
<P>
	How can the government justify that, four months before the 
end of the fiscal year, researchers and organizations fighting 
AIDS still have no guarantee that they will get the promised $1.5 
million?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I take note of the question. When the Minister of 
Health is in the House, she will provide a detailed answer to the 
hon. member.

	<B>Mr. Michel Daviault (Ahuntsic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, that is 
not sure, but he can also take note of my supplementary 
question.
<P>
	Are we to understand that the Prime Minister's government 
was not able to use the allocated resources because there is no 
master plan for the implementation of phase 2 of the national 
strategy on AIDS?

value of this organization. I would certainly be prepared to take

	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sure when the Minister of 
Human Resources Development takes a look at the facts he will 
agree it is an outrageous waste of taxpayers' dollars.
<P>
	My supplemental is for the Minister of Industry. It is on the 
same topic. His department also granted this company $15,000. 
GOSAP's initial investment of $24,000 has been matched by 
$118,000 in federal grants notwithstanding office expenses and 
it does not even have the people with the expertise in place. 
Many small Canadian businesses can only dream of such access 
to capital. It is too bad one has to be a Liberal to receive such 
funding.

Speaker, as with my colleague, the minister of human resources, 
we will certainly have to try to determine the facts of the case.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	In an interview published Saturday in the newspaper <I>La 
Presse</I>, the Minister of Finance announced clearly his intention 
to replace the GST by a national sales tax. He clearly implied 
that Ottawa would act first and negotiate with the provinces 
later.
<P>
	Does that mean that the federal government intends to impose 
its vision on the provinces regarding the implementation of a 
national sales tax and present them with a fait accompli?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Absolutely not, Mr. Speaker. 
Actually I talked on Saturday about the process that I discussed 
with the provinces during the meeting with provincial finance 
ministers, where I said that since consumers and the business 
community were so much in favour of a harmonized tax and 
since some provinces, including Quebec, agreed to it, we should 
carry on with the process. That is certainly our intention.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, will the Minister of Finance be honest enough to tell 
things as they are and admit that the Minister of Finance of 
Quebec told him that he would reject any proposal to replace the 
GST and the PST with a national sales tax?
<P>
	This being said, will the minister admit that by practising as 
he did over the weekend a domineering, cynical and dreadful 
kind of federalism when he proposed a national sales tax, he is 
heading straight for a deadlock because he is attacking the 
provinces head-on on their taxation jurisdiction?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Not at all, Mr. Speaker. The 
hon. member must know that Quebec's sales tax is the one that 
resembles the federal government sales tax the most. Besides, 
such an agreement between Quebec and Ottawa, as between 
Ottawa and other provinces, will not be that major a step.
<P>
	Moreover, I must say that during our discussions, which were 
very constructive, the new government of Quebec said very 
clearly that it would not accept a domineering federalism. Once 
more, I notice that the gap between the Bloc Quebecois and the 
PQ, since they came to power, is widening.

	Is the reason the report is being concealed the fact that it

which is that the black market accounts for 5 per cent of the

than that''.
<P>
	Does the minister recognize that the growth of the 
underground economy, confirmed by a drop in GST revenues 
during the first half of the year as compared to last year at the 
same time, is due to the recent increase of the tax burden and the 
inequities of an outdated taxation system that an increasing

is serious. I have no doubt that my hon. colleague, the Minister

copy of a press release I issued a year ago in which I outlined a

	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe the hon. member should look a 
little further into the reason for the level of GST payments to the 
government.
<P>
	The fact is that we have had a substantial improvement in the 
economy, thanks in large part to the measures of my colleague, 
the Minister of Finance. The result has been more investment in 
productive goods which indeed are often GST exempt. As a 
result of that and as a result, I might add, of my department's 
speedy repayment of certain measures, we are now able to see 
that the GST level is again increasing.

	<B>Mr. Réginald Bélair (Cochrane-Superior, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	Residents of northern Ontario and rural Canada are concerned 
that major transportation changes may happen in an ad hoc 
manner. This creates uncertainty for the future.
<P>
	Could the minister tell us whether he is developing 
comprehensive rail, air highway and marine policies? Could he 
reassure the residents that there will be enough time to adjust to 
the possibility of the changes?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, with respect to the comprehensive review obviously 
that is under way. I think we have made significant progress on 
airports. We hope to be able to deal with the ports. Rail is 
something a bit different.
<P>
	What has happened to railroading in the country over the last 
20 years has literally been done on an ad hoc basis. That is why 
we are in the trouble we are with abandonment and decisions 
being made on a day to day basis without any real policy.
<P>
	We have the Bob Nault task force out there now looking at 
what we can do with the commercialization of CN. We also have 
to deal very soon with the unsolicited bid from CP for the 
purchase of CN assets east of Winnipeg. In that context, with the 
ongoing consultations we have been conducting with shippers 
and interested parties we are committed to making clear a very 
comprehensive rail policy in 1995.
<P>
<B>(1440 ) </B>
<P>
	We have not been stopped. We will deal with the CP offer. We 
will deal with commercialization. We will bring an end to the ad 
hoc decision making that has been plaguing railroads in the 
country for the last 20 years.

	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, recently the Canadian Space Agency gave Telesat 
Canada $428,000 of taxpayers' money to help stabilize the Anik 
E-2 satellite.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Industry. By whose 
authority does the Canadian Space Agency give public money to 
a private consortium?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Canadian Space Agency, as other agencies of 
government, has the authority to expend moneys that are voted 
to it by Parliament.
<P>
	In the case to which my friend is referring, I understand the 
problems that existed last winter with the Anik E satellites were, 
first, ones of great importance to Canada because they 
represented a communications vehicle for much of the 
geographical territory of the country. Second, to try to remedy 
the problem with the satellites in orbit required efforts that 
really represented useful research in terms of techniques. It was 
successful.
<P>
	The view of the space agency, as it has been presented to me, 
is that the technology or the techniques that were acquired 
through the process were ones of value to Canada and within the 
space agency's mandate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, what is the point in privatizing Telesat Canada and then 
continuing to throw public money at it? Telesat Canada is a 
consortium of the largest telephone companies and Spar 
Aerospace. They do not need individual taxpayers' money.
<P>
	I have a supplementary question. Would the minister assure 
the House that agencies under his jurisdiction would not divert 
public money to private use without specific prior permission 
from the minister?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the question is far too sweeping in its scope. I think the 
member understands-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Sweeping it under the rug.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manley:</B> Mr. Speaker, the last questioner from the 
Reform Party wanted ministerial involvement at $15,000. It gets 
a bit ridiculous.
<P>
	The member will understand that the direction of funds used 
in the private sector often through procurement or contracts with 
government is done with the least possible political 
interference. That is something I would have thought the 
Reform Party supported.

	<B>Mr. Réjean Lefebvre (Champlain, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance. He was confirming what 
the Auditor General was saying, that Ottawa does not have any 
management and evaluation tools. In other words, Ottawa is 
governing in the dark.
<P>
	In the same line of reasoning, will the Minister of Finance

to properly evaluate the impacts of that reform?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister

said was that we must absolutely modernize the tools of

This is why we asked Ernst &amp; Young for a report, which was

to use all the technologies available to better manage the

<P>
	<B>Mr. Réjean Lefebvre (Champlain, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
should we infer from this that the government will proceed with 
its reform of social programs without evaluating its impacts, 
simply because the only objective of the reform is to cut into 
social programs to reduce the deficit?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the goal is clear. 
The Minister of Human Resources Development stated it 
repeatedly. The main goal of the reform of social programs is to 
update them, to deliver the goods in a more efficient way. We 
must recognize that the world has changed. The Minister of 
Human Resources Development has recognized it, and I regret 
that the Bloc Quebecois is still living in the 1960s.

	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
national revenue minister has consistently referred to increasing 
customs enforcement and yet this weekend the Ottawa <I>Sun</I> 
quoted a Canada Customs official, and I quote: ``If the line is too 
long we get orders just to wave people through. We don't know 
how many guns or how much drugs we could be stopping''.
<P>
	How in the world can the minister reconcile his boast that his 
department has a 25 per cent increase in enforcement with that 
statement from a customs officer on the front line?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it would seem to me important for the 
member to compare what might have happened before if he 
wants to see the impact of a 25 per cent increase in enforcement 
activities.
<P>
	I should point out to him also that if we attempted to stop 
every vehicle and give a complete search, tourism in this 
country would cease to exist as would trade with the United 
States.
<P>
	I should point out to him that we target areas where we feel 
there is high non-compliance. Therefore, with a number of 
sophisticated methods of achieving some sort of targeting of 
high non-compliance areas, we are able to be remarkably 
effective in the customs work that we do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as a 
result of the boasting about the 25 per cent increase, my office 
contacted his deputy minister's office asking for a 
substantiation of the revenue minister's claim. That was just on 
Friday, so to this point we have not yet received a reply.
<P>
	Surely the minister would not be making unsubstantiated 
claims. Therefore, could he share with the House where all these 
extra customs officials are. Would the minister like to share that 
with the House or are they like Elvis sightings?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last Friday I answered a question from the 
hon. member but his memory appears to be defective.
<P>
	I pointed out that we do in fact target different parts of the 
border at different times of the year, depending on demand and 
that we do alter the mix of customs officers that we have within a 
region or across the country. I also pointed out to him that for 
example at the Commonwealth Games we had 65 extra customs 
people in Victoria brought in from Yukon, Alberta and other 
parts of British Columbia. We therefore have a sophisticated 
system whereby we are able to deploy our resources for the best 
effect.
<P>
	With respect to the 25 per cent, I will get him the figures that 
he has requested. I assure him that we have in fact substantially 
increased customs activities over the past eight months.

<P>
	Bill C-57 seems to prohibit tariffs on supplementary 
agricultural imports. Without proper amendment this could 
jeopardize our ability to safeguard supply management as we 
are committed to do.
<P>
	Is the minister prepared to introduce the necessary

<P>
	<B>Hon. Roy MacLaren (Minister for International Trade,

imports under the new tariff rate quota regime will include 
provisions for supplementary imports for various purposes.
<P>
	The government intends to consult all stakeholders and 
determine what steps must be taken to ensure the continued

<P>
	According to our sources, the $4 billion limit provided for in 
the Small Businesses Loans Act having been reached, the 
minister is about to announce an increase of funds available.
<P>
	Will the minister take advantage of this announcement to fill 
the financing needs of small businesses by allowing these loan 
guarantees to be used to finance their working capital?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the member perhaps will know that when the 
supplementary estimates were tabled an increase in the ceiling 
on the limits under the Small Businesses Loans Act was 
included. We will be continuing our consultation with the 
groups affected by the Small Businesses Loans Act in order to 
endeavour to make adjustments to the program which will be 
acceptable to them and which will render the program more 
fully cost recoverable.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
again to facilitate small business access to financing, is it the 
minister's intention to respect the red book's commitments and 
see to it that business owners no longer have to post personal 
bonds in order to be entitled to loans under the Small Businesses 
Loans Act?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, if I understand the member's suggestion we should 
eliminate the obligation to post personal bonds in order to get 
loans under this program.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I want him to understand that we are going to look, with the 
assistance of himself as well, at the mechanisms underlying this 
program and try to find the best possible way to make the 
program most effective to the largest number of small 
businesses.
<P>
	He will understand the cost incurred in doing that is one that 
has to be recovered. This is clearly the principal program we 
have for dealing with the borrowing needs of small business. In 
designing the program we will have to make sure we do it in the 
most effective way possible to benefit the largest possible 
number of small businesses.

	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if this 
government spent as much time figuring out how to cut spending 
as it does trying to devise new ways of raising and borrowing 
money, we could have been well on our way to balancing the 
budget.
<P>
	This past week the Minister of Finance put out a trial balloon 
to look at what he called victory bonds. Canada already has 
10-year bonds, 30-year bonds, 90-day treasury bills and 
Canada Savings Bonds, just to mention a few.
<P>
	I ask the Minister of Finance, why do we need more bonds in 
our country?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt 
the government intends in terms of the next budget and in terms 
of our attack on the deficit obviously to concentrate on 
controlling government spending. There is no doubt that is 
where the priority lies.
<P>
	Nobody should be under any doubt about that. The 
government did not float a trial balloon. I was asked a question 
in Toronto, a question that I have been asked in virtually every 
city I have gone to in the course of the last month, about the 
possibility of victory bonds following the very generous gesture 
by Mr. Carl McNeil who gave $37,000 in his last will and 
testament to the Canadian government.
<P>
	What I find a little surprising is that the Reform Party would 
not understand the desire of Canadians to come together and 
solve this very difficult financial dilemma we have.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Reform Party recognizes that Canadians want to solve our 
economic problems. Would the Minister of Finance admit that 
solving the problem, bringing confidence back to this country, 
has a first priority and that first priority is an expenditure 
reduction that eliminates the deficit in this country?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, not only do we 
recognize that controlling government expenditures and 
reducing government expenditures are an essential part of 
deficit reduction, but we also recognize the absolute importance 
of confidence in the Canadian population, the Canadian 
investment community. That is why as we see job creation 
continuing apace we are delighted to see the numbers that came 
out last week showing business confidence in this country is 
higher than it has been for a decade.

<P>
	Could the minister assure us that the government is not

	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member 
for his interest in this subject.
<P>
	The Senate recommendation reflects a general view that 
managers of financial institutions require additional 
information and better information on those subjects. It does not 
state however that there should be the additional cost of 
appraisals necessarily in that recommendation. It is one of 42 
recommendations by the Senate.

	The Prime Minister is utterly unable to explain why his 
government has not even invested all the money provided in the 
fight against AIDS. He is planning to go to Paris this week to 
boast about what his government is doing to fight AIDS.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister claim that he will make a 
worthwhile contribution at the international AIDS conference in 
Paris when it is clear that he is completely ignorant on this issue 
and himself admits that he cannot say whether his government 
has adopted a master plan to implement the Canadian AIDS 
Strategy?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I just said that the government has made a considerable 
effort in this area and that we want to do more. But what will be 
discussed in Paris is not the funding that one department or 
another has but rather what comprehensive solutions all the 
interested countries in the world can adopt to solve this problem 
eventually.
<P>
	I do not suppose that the Prime Minister of France will want to 
ask me whether 3 or 4 per cent of our budget was spent or not. He 
will want to know what we want to do about it. I will not go there 
to discuss his budget. I think that all together, we can map out a

we do not think there should be a lifting of the arms embargo and 
that no one from the outside should participate in this war.

will not create peace there, it will just accelerate war.

	The signatures are very significant because they were 
collected in a school where the shooting took place of two very 
dedicated counsellors who were seriously injured but who are

strengthen existing gun laws, to implement longer and

	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 36 I would like to present 
some petitions from constituents in my riding and throughout all 
of British Columbia asking that the Canadian government look 
closely to amend the Divorce Act to allow for standing in the 
courts by grandparents.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
too wish to present petitions in addition to the thousands that 
have been presented in the House in support of an amendment to 
legislation to ensure that grandparents have some entitlement to 
be represented and to have contact with their grandchildren and 
information about their grandchildren.

	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am proud to present this next petition from people in my riding 
pointing out that the hon. Leader of the Opposition has travelled 
to other parts of the world to promote the separation of Quebec 
from Canada.
<P>
	These petitioners wish to advise the House of Commons and 
the Leader of the Official Opposition that the majority of 
residents of Ottawa-Carleton wish to promote Quebec's 
continued participation in the Confederation of Canada and call 
on Parliament to inform the Leader of the Opposition that he is 
not representing the majority of their views.

advertising flyers at their homes in the interests of the 
environment, and to return them postage paid to the sender.

	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 36 I would like to 
present two petitions. In the first petition 189 constituents from 
British Columbia request that Parliament refuse to accept the 
justice minister's anti-firearms proposals. They insist that he 
bring forward legislation to convict and punish criminals rather 
than persecute the innocent.

	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in the second petition petitioners from B.C.'s 
lower mainland pray that Parliament ensure that the present 
provisions of the Criminal Code of Canada prohibiting assisted 
suicide be enforced vigorously and that Parliament make no 
changes in the law which would sanction or allow the aiding or 
abetting of suicide or active or passive euthanasia.

	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to present two petitions on behalf of my 
constituents of Surrey North.
<P>
	The first petition is signed by 189 residents and warns that the 
justice minister is proposing unfair anti-gun legislation that 
will do little if anything to reduce violent crime in Canada.
<P>
	The petitioners feel that this legislation will simply restrict or 
eliminate the rights of honest law-abiding hunters and target 
shooters. The petitioners request that Parliament call on the 
justice minister to bring forward proposals that will enable the 
police and courts to deal quickly and firmly with perpetrators of 
all types of violent crime.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="YOUNGOFFENDERSACT">YOUNG OFFENDERS ACT</A></H4>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the second petition is signed by 176 residents and 
draws the attention of the House to the rise in youth crime, the 
lack of deterrents and accountability in the Young Offenders 
Act, the fact that the Young Offenders Act does not address the 
rights of victims and encourages the recruitment of youth by 
adult offenders, and that the present sentencing provisions of the 
Young Offenders Act ignore public support for tougher laws.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore call on Parliament to urge the 
government to review the Young Offenders Act and address 
three principles: the deterrence of the offender, the 
accountability of the offender, and the rights of the victim.

Mr. Speaker, I would like to submit three petitions on behalf of 
my colleague, the hon. member for Cape 
Breton-Highlands-Canso. They relate to the devastation of 
the Atlantic groundfish industry caused by the seals and the fact 
that the seal industry has declined because of the European 
attitudes toward seals.
<P>
	Now that the groundfish stocks have declined, they urge the 
government to recognize the opportunity presented by the huge 
seal populations and designate herds for use as viable 
entrepreneurial resources.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when we left off before question 
period, I was saying a few words on regional economic 
development and the importance of consulting.
<P>
	I would like to expand upon the significance of the 
consultations that will be conducted across Canada. I think that 
the first point we should recognize-and I think this is a 
common theme for all members of this Parliament-is the 
urgent need for new job qualifications.
<P>
	There is a second one: How to adapt to changing world 
conditions. The third point would be to redesign the role of the 
State; fourth, to put the economy back on track and, fifth, create 
a better, sounder economic climate.
<P>
	The purpose of these consultations is obviously a thorough 
examination of where this Canadian federation is headed, where 
the government of Canada is going and how we can contribute to 
the development of our region, including the riding of 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine.
<P>
	The first theme, for example, is about acquiring skills. I think 
it is important to recognize that, in my region and in Quebec in 
general, many young people do not complete Secondary V, that 
the government has an important role to play to encourage not 
only young people, but also education institutions and the 
private sector to become partners in giving a boost to youth 
education, as this is the only way out.
<P>
	As for the second theme, namely adapting to a changing 
world, it is obvious that the world is very different today from 
what it was between 1945 and 1960. Today, we recognize the 
emergence of countries such as Korea and Taiwan.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	I was not talking about Japan or China, but we are certainly 
living in an era of market globalization. This requires not only a 
lot of thinking but also a great deal of preparation. I think that if 
we as Canadians, especially those in the regions, want to 
become part of the new global market, we must equip ourselves.
<P>
	Above all, the federal government wants Canadians to think 
up ways to make the most of these global markets.
<P>
	The third theme is rethinking the role of government. Back in 
the days before deficits, the government could do anything. In 
fact, all levels of government-federal, provincial and 
municipal-never hesitated to take action to help the people, to 
tell them what to do and how to do it.
<P>
	In the regions, for example, programs were introduced by the 
Government of Canada in co-operation with the Quebec 
government and the local authorities. They did not always 
succeed. True, a number of them failed. Unfortunately, these old 
formulas obviously no longer work. That is why we are seeking 
a new approach, or a new partnership.
<P>
	When we ask the government to act at the local level, it is 
mostly to encourage small business to create jobs. It is no longer 
up to the government to do that. We have to find the financial 
resources, the financial levels to encourage small businesses to 
take themselves in hand, to consult the people around them, to 
set a local policy in line with the provincial policy and a 
Canada-wide national policy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8353"> 8353 </A></B>
<P>
	I think it is important to underline the Canada-wide aspect 
because many of Quebec's exchanges depend on Canada as a 
whole. I think that Quebec is very dependent on a healthy, 
vibrant Canada with an ever-growing economy.
<P>
	If we promote the separation of powers or if Quebec leaves the 
Canadian federation, it is likely that a Canada divided from East 
to West with its Quebec cornerstone missing will surely 
experience medium and long-term problems.
<P>
	It is in the interest of Quebecers, and even in the interest of the 
opposition, that Quebec remains a vibrant part of the Canadian 
federation.
<P>
	The opposition talks about putting the economy back on track 
and restoring confidence among business people. But let us not 
forget that this confidence can only exist if Canada remains a 
united country. The opposition keeps saying that the Canadian 
federation no longer works; but Canada is a member of the G-7. 
I know that we are experiencing economic difficulties, but 
Pierre Bourgault said not too long ago that Quebec's separation 
would be costly, even if it helps promote sectors others than the 
economy.
<P>
	According to Mr. Bourgault, a staunch nationalist and the 
founder of the RIN, Quebecers will be worse off if they become 
independent. What do we propose in terms of consultations to 
reform the federation? After all, the Canadian federation allows 
administrative agreements. There are hundreds of such 
agreements with the provinces, including Quebec. This is what 
federalism is all about and let us not forget that because it is the 
only solution.
<P>
	My time is almost up, but I would like to say a few words 
about the new tax measures, not only between the federation and 
the provinces, and I think we can redefine existing arrangements 
and find an adequate process at the regional level. In fact, this 
was done numerous times at the regional level, including in the 
Lower St. Lawrence region and in the Gaspe peninsula, thanks to 
the direct involvement of the federal government.
<P>
	I should mention the Eastern Quebec Development Plan, as 
well as the initiatives taken by the Federal Office of Regional 
Development for Quebec, which is under the Minister of 
Finance's authority. Thanks to their specific and direct actions, 
small businesses were often able to get back on their feet, to 
expand and to gain access to markets not only in Quebec and in 
Canada, but also overseas, including in Europe and, recently, in 
Asia.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	It goes without saying that the tax measures to be proposed 
will be based on this comprehensive consultation exercise, 
which will include everyone, including urban and rural 
dwellers, members of the opposition, academics and business 
leaders, and which will ensure economic recovery for Canada. It 
is not good to hear that Quebec can separate and go it alone. In 
fact, the contrary is true and Quebecers are aware that our  
federation has worked well for 125 years. We can get along and 
we can develop a lasting economy. I also believe that we will 
enter the next century united, together. Only through the 
Canadian federation will Quebecers make it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened very attentively to the hon. member's comments. I was 
most interested when, speaking about SMEs, he said that we 
should promote a climate of confidence to allow SMEs to invest 
and create more jobs.
<P>
	Here is my question. About 15 days ago, in the shadow of 
Parliament, a committee unknown to most of my colleagues 
opposed a plan by some Liberal members that would have 
created uncertainty about possible pharmaceutical investments. 
It was about the former Bill C-91. I would like to know what the 
member for Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine thinks about 
these investments which are not being made today because of 
the uncertainty created by the government. This costs a lot in 
money, millions of dollars, and some very well-paid jobs are at 
stake.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe the member opposite 
understands pretty well what is at stake here. The contribution 
of the federal government in Quebec, especially in the 
pharmaceutical industry, has been quite obvious.
<P>
	First there was Bill C-22, then Bill C-97, and I think that 
there is still a commitment to maintain this policy, as stated in 
Bill C-91, in the pharmaceutical industry in Quebec.
<P>
	There is no doubt that Montreal's economy depends a lot on 
these technologies. The opposition is finally recognizing that, 
with this federal policy, we have been able to concentrate this 
high-tech industry in Montreal and in the province of Quebec.
<P>
	Of course, if Quebec were to become independent or to 
secede, these companies would most probably decide to leave 
Quebec and settle elsewhere. After all, the main concern of 
these companies is, first, to enjoy a climate of confidence, but 
also to have the assurance that the federal government will 
protect their market and maintain the criteria that are so 
important for the pharmaceutical companies that want to stay in 
Quebec to grow and prosper.
<P>
	The issue of confidence should not be overlooked. Any 
investor would tell you how important political stability is. The 
industry needs to know that the country will support it, in spite 
of all the problems we have. As you know, we went through 
some tough times after the Second World War, when the debt 
level per capita was very high in Canada, but we came through. 
The people looked to the future with confidence. They saw there 
was a lot they could do together. However, by dividing Canada, 
with Quebec going its own way, we will unfortunately lose not 
only some tax benefits similar to those provided for in Bill 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8354"> 8354 </A></B>
<P>
C-91, but also the advantage of  belonging to an economic 
partnership that has, in fact, proven itself.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would ask the hon. member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, who is so concerned 
about the economic development in Quebec, in Canada, even 
throughout the world, if he is equally concerned about the 
economic development in the Magdalen Islands. I would like to 
know if he is at all concerned, for example, by what was reported 
today in the editorial pages of his local newspaper, that is, that 
the Minister of Environment appeared all confused on TV about 
the <I>Irving Whale </I>story, saying that both the booms and the boat 
needed to scoop up the oil in case of a catastrophe were also at 
the bottom of the water.
<P>
	Is he not concerned to see that his minister does not seem to 
understand this issue which is so crucial for the economic future 
and tourism of the Magdalen Islands, a situation which could 
cause one of the worst ecological catastrophes in the area, and 
should he not see to it that the Irving Whale be refloated in a 
more competent manner than that described by the Minister of 
Environment? I am wondering if he is really concerned about 
economic development or if he is content to merely repeat day 
after day in the House the rhetoric and buzzwords he has 
memorized, along with some rather strange items.
<P>
	So, I put the question to him, because I think that what is 
happening in the Magdalen Islands is very serious and that he 
should take his work seriously and not only make beautiful 
speeches he has learned by heart. The issue of the <I>Irving Whale</I> 
is a serious issue for the people of the Magdalen Islands and for 
all Quebecers. So, what does the hon. member answer to that, 
Mr. Speaker?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon: </B>Mr. Speaker, I am glad to see that at last the 
opposition shows some interest in the regions, especially the 
Magdalen Islands. I wish to inform the hon. member that it is 
Patrick Gagnon, the member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, and my colleague from 
Malpeque who informed the media of the importance and the 
danger of the <I>Irving Whale</I> even before the Minister of 
Environment knew about it.
<P>
	The environment minister, the transport minister and the 
Government of Canada gave their support. They recognized that 
it was important to raise that ship which sank about 20 years ago. 
You can be sure that I personally am perfectly aware of the 
importance of refloating that wreck. But anyway, I thank the 
member opposite for showing interest because we must not 
forget that it is no thanks to the Bloc that the operation went 
ahead, or that we could interest the federal government in that 
wreck.
<P>
	We took action. I consulted with my colleague from Malpeque 
and the people last February and believe me, the priority of the 
member for Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine is not only 
the economic development of the islands, but also the integrity 
of their environment because I think that it is shared by 
everybody. Despite the opposition's denials, the government 
takes care of its business and, unfortunately, the opposition just 
discovered a threat to the environment that has been there for 
some time.
<P>
	It is unfortunate that the opposition did not co-operate with us 
during the consultations. All it could do was find fault and play 
petty politics at the expense of the Magdalen Islanders and the 
environmental health of the islands.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will try to be 
brief even though there are many things I would have liked to 
say. First of all, with all due respect, I would like to tell the 
House that it is not the member for 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine or the member from 
Prince Edward Island who alerted the medias. It is the 
veterinarian in the Magdalen Islands who made the public and 
the government aware of the situation.
<P>
	The second thing I would like to say is why did the 
government not conduct a public hearing on this matter? The 
member took it upon himself to act in this regard and then the 
minister made the announcement that there were two or three 
projects to raise the <I>Irving Whale</I>.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	But what the public wants is for the hold of this ship to be 
emptied in order to prevent a disaster. The federal government's 
mandate with regard to regional development is to ensure that 
our water is clean so that tourists will continue to come and 
enjoy the beaches in the Magdalen Islands. That is what regional 
development is all about.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think my colleague and I are very 
sensitive to the environment in the Gaspé Peninsula and the 
Magdalen Islands. I must tell you something. I came here as a 
member of Parliament on November 1. In the first week of 
February, just two months later, I organized town hall meetings 
in the Magdalen Islands and in Prince Edward Island. I think I 
carried out my duty as a member of Parliament to defend and 
promote the interests of my constituents. Surely, I am the most 
directly concerned and would want to be the first to know, if 
something went wrong with that operation, that we will be made 
aware of the fact.
<P>
	In conclusion, we consulted with the population. It is true that 
others showed us that there was a problem. But the issue had 
been talked about for some twenty years in Prince Edward 
Island. It is thanks to the co-operation from the Magdalen 
Islands and Prince Edward Island that we will raise the <I>Irving 
Whale</I>, and thanks to this Liberal government and also, 
obvious-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8355"> 8355 </A></B>
<P>
ly, thanks to the support of the responsible ministers we have 
here.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to enter into this debate.
<P>
	Over the last month dozens of Canadians have come before 
the finance committee to tell us what their priorities are for the 
next budget. Just about every conceivable position has been 
expressed as to what should and should not be done. The 
prebudget consultations have demonstrated one very important 
point: that a consensus does exist among Canadians on the need 
to eliminate the deficit. It is no longer a question of whether, it is 
a question of how and when.
<P>
	Last week I and one of my colleagues did something unique. 
We asked to make a presentation to our own committee. In that 
presentation we laid out a very clear goal to eliminate the deficit 
over a three year period. We listed 25 specific examples of 
expenditure reductions or cuts that could be made in order to 
move toward our goal.
<P>
	We did not attempt to hide the truth from Canadians in a 
political or any other way. We levelled with them and told them 
this would mean cuts of approximately $25 billion after a 
revenue growth of some $15 billion to $16 billion to reduce our 
$40 billion current deficit. That would mean that $12 billion to 
$16 billion, most likely $15 billion, would have to come from 
social programs over a three year period, not all in one year but 
over a three year period.
<P>
	We did not have to do this. We did not have to use this 
approach. Politically it would have been a lot easier to say 
nothing and then criticize the government when it released its 
budget. This is what most opposition or traditional parties have 
done over the years in their adversary role. That is the kind of 
game which is usually played. I am sure the members of the 
government who were in the last House were the best players in 
that type of game.
<P>
	Reform members did not come to Ottawa to play games. Our 
country's finances are too important. They have become our 
number one priority in our pursuit and our objective in this 
House of Commons and in this term of Parliament. We came 
here to change the way politics are done in this country.
<P>
	The proposal we made to the committee was not a superficial 
one. We began working on this project immediately following 
the government's last budget. Over a period of nine months the 
critics in the Reform Party have reviewed every government 
program in their area of responsibility. They have weighed those 
programs against five basic principles that were articulated in 
our presentation. This represents our best effort in proposing a 
constructive alternative to the government's fiscal agenda.
<P>
	In the 10 minutes I have at this time I would like to look at the 
government's reaction to this presentation. In particular I want 
to address two specific criticisms that were levelled against us 
by government and other  members of the finance committee. It 
is important to talk about these criticisms because they go right 
to the heart of what distinguishes the Reform Party from the 
governing party.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	First I would like to address the question put to me by the 
member for St. Paul's who simply asked where I was coming 
from. That was an easy question. Our proposals and 
recommendations are driven by our conviction that the 
government's plan to reduce the deficit to 3 per cent of GDP by 
1997 will not be enough to control or regain the control over our 
debt. We recognize even in the 3 per cent program the 
accumulated debt at the end of three years will be far over $600 
billion.
<P>
	What I think he really meant to ask was not so much where the 
Reform Party was coming from as where it is going. Everyone 
recognizes that eliminating the deficit in three years is not an 
end in itself. It is a means to an end. What is that end for 
Reform? What is our vision of Canada?
<P>
	Surprisingly in comparing what the government said in its 
grey book to what Reform said in its presentation to the finance 
committee not much difference will be found in terms of their 
fiscal and economic analysis. In fact the government's grey 
book is probably closer to the Reform position than it is to the 
red book that the Liberals campaigned on in 1993.
<P>
	However there are some very fundamental differences in 
terms of our perspective of Canada. Reformers argue for less 
government involvement in the economy, for lower taxes, and 
for giving greater flexibility to local and provincial 
governments. The Liberals we believe are afraid of these 
proposals. Why? Where Reformers believe in empowering 
people, the Liberals still believe in empowering the bureaucrats. 
Where Reformers place their faith in individuals, the Liberals 
still place their faith in government. While the Liberals do not 
seem to think Canadians can take care of themselves, we believe 
they can.
<P>
	While it is important to know what Canada's political parties 
believe in and what their vision is, they should not distract us 
from the more immediate problem, one which has nothing to do 
with partisan affiliation or political vision: the problem of our 
debt. It is a major problem.
<P>
	The debt is sucking the life out of this country. It is killing 
jobs. It is killing innovation and entrepreneurship. It is killing 
our social safety net and our health care system. It does not care 
about politics. It does not set priorities. It does not discriminate 
against one problem or favour another. It is an equal opportunity 
killer and it will kill this country unless we do something to stop 
it. If we do not deal with the debt before our creditors deal with 
us, then Canada as we know it will cease to exist.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8356"> 8356 </A></B>
<P>
	This brings me to the second criticism of our presentation. 
This one really upsets me. It was the contention that our 25 
deficit cutting recommendations and the $12 billion to $16 
billion of social program spending must be cut over the next 
three years. Committee members and others have said that 
somehow this is an abdication of our social responsibility to 
Canadians. Nothing could be further from the truth.
<P>
	Reformers did not come to Ottawa to take away the bread 
from starving children. We did not come here to dismantle social 
programs and leave the vulnerable and the unfortunate in our 
society unprotected and uncared for. The debate is over how and 
when to eliminate the deficit. It is not about which party cares 
the most for Canadians. We all care. The debate is about doing 
what has to be done. The Reform Party is not going to apologize 
for telling Canadians the truth.
<P>
	The truth is that social programs will have to be cut. The some 
$67 billion expended in that area will have to be reduced to some 
$50 billion to $60 billion whether we like it or not. If our social 
safety net collapses because of the failure of the government to 
plan for the future and doing what has to be done now, those 
most vulnerable will be the first to suffer and will suffer the 
most.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	Members of the government say it is Reformers who have 
abdicated their social responsibilities to Canadians, but who has 
been in power for over a year and done nothing in that time to 
deal with the debt that is killing this country? In three years this 
government will have allowed our stock of debt to grow by 
another $97 billion. If Canada hits the wall, whose conscience 
will that be on? When international creditors tell the Canadian 
government and I say tell, not ask, who will be responsible? 
When international creditors tell a future Canadian government 
that they will only lend it money if it slashes every program 
across the board by 30 to 40 per cent, then who will have 
abdicated their social responsibility to Canadians?
<P>
	At the present time we have been given an opportunity to put 
our fiscal house in order. While I do not pretend in any way that 
this will be easy, there are promising signs. The economy is 
expanding and Canadians from coast to coast have been telling 
us they are ready for the cuts. Some will debate whether or not 
this is Canada's best opportunity to eliminate the debt. I believe 
this is the proper time to do it.
<P>
	We have a very simple choice: Either we decide where and 
how we will cut or somebody will decide that for us. If the 
government allows the latter to happen, it will be no consolation 
for me to point out which party truly abdicated its social 
responsibility for Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gar Knutson (Elgin-Norfolk, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, does 
my colleague not think that if we cut government spending too 
quickly given that government spending makes part of overall 
aggregate demand on the economy that it would slow down 
growth and perhaps put us into a recession?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, as Reformers we do 
not believe that. The total gross domestic product of Canada is 
around $750 billion. Out of that gross domestic product we 
intend to take out in terms of debt reduction or expenditure 
reduction some $25 billion in total.
<P>
	That is somewhat of a hiccup in the total overall scene. We do 
not think it will have a significant effect on any kind of 
economic growth. We do believe that type of action will create 
confidence in the economy, more growth in the economy, more 
job opportunities and certainly it will be better for Canada as a 
whole on a longer term.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I do not 
want to interrupt questions and comments for which there is still 
some time remaining but I did want to inform you that the next 
government speakers are the member for Elgin-Norfolk and 
the member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce. I would like to give 
notice that pursuant to Standing Order 43(2) these two members 
will be dividing their time.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when I hear the hon. member for Lethbridge say that 
his party is dedicated to helping the most vulnerable, I find that 
hard to believe, considering what was said on the finance 
committee by him and his colleagues about the Maritimes, 
Quebec, Ontario or western Canada. It is nonsense. It makes no 
sense at all to say that we should cut $16 billion in our social 
programs in the next three years, to help the most vulnerable. 
This is a complete distortion of reality.
<P>
	They are not describing reality. They are distorting reality. 
When they say to the government that the only way to clean up 
our public finances is to cut unemployment insurance even more 
than the government has already done, and that it should do the 
same with the Canada Assistance Plan, post-secondary 
education and programs for senior citizens, is that what helping 
the most vulnerable means? Is that concern for social justice? 
On the other hand, when we talk about inequities in the tax 
system, they will not listen.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	That is the extent of their real concern for the most vulnerable 
members of our society. Their only concern is that the privileges 
of very rich Canadians and very big corporations, despite the tax 
inequities applying to both groups of taxpayers are concerned, 
should be maintained. That is the only issue of interest to them 
in this debate.
<P>

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, in reply to my hon. 
friend from the Bloc Quebecois I want to say that our 
philosophies differ completely. There are two ways to approach 
the economic problems of the country, the major debt, a deficit 
every year of $40 billion and a growing deficit under the 3 per 
cent plan of the Liberal government. One is to be fiscally 
responsible and try to live within our means. The other is to 
increase taxes.
<P>
	Since coming to this assembly I have learned that the Bloc 
Quebecois uses a socialist, NDP approach to resolve economic 
matters. Those members should be telling Canadians-and I 
hope Canadians hear this-that they want to increase taxation. 
They do not want to reduce expenditures in a responsible way. 
They believe there is some rich person out there who will fill the 
revenue coffers of the country so the government can spend 
more. We in the Reform do not believe that; we absolutely do not 
believe it.
<P>
	We believe Canadians want more independence. They want to 
be free to spend their own money. They want to be able to have 
more capital so they can invest in their own future and their 
family's future. They want to be rid of government, to have less 
government. That is the best approach to dealing with our deficit 
and other economic problems.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to address the economic policy of the Liberal government 
which regrettably, like those before it, has failed to take the 
necessary steps to deal with the severity of our fiscal crisis, 
leaving Canada and Canadians on a track destined to 
bankruptcy.
<P>
	While in opposition the Minister of Finance stated in his 1993 
Tory budget response:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>What is most astonishing about this budget is that while Canadian taxpayers 
seem willing to directly address the deficit, the Minister of Finance instead 
served them a rehash in a context as to make everyone dream.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He went on to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Liberals propose to confront this challenge head on.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In his first budget the Minister of Finance joined the 
distinguished club of 20 years of finance ministers that failed to 
deliver what they promised in opposition.
<P>
	The interest payment to service our national debt is now the 
largest single item in federal expenditures and is placing a major 
squeeze on the availability of funds for program spending. In 
1981 each Canadian's share of direct federal and provincial debt 
was $4,500. Today that share per capita is over $25,000. Before 
a single dollar of income is redistributed, before a dime goes to 
social programs, before a penny is spent on any other 
government program, $2,200 must be paid yearly in interest for 
each and every person in Canada.
<P>
	The sad part is that we are borrowing the money to do this, 
which simply adds to the overall size of our debt and our 
problems. The fact is that the current spending policies of the 
Liberal government are an immediate threat to the national 
well-being of all Canadians. The Liberals have admitted that by 
targeting the deficit to 3 per cent of GDP per year they will add 
close to $100 billion to the debt. How is that solving the 
problem?
<P>
	By continuing with the philosophy of tax and spend the 
Liberals have changed nothing in the House but the seating plan, 
from this side to that side, and the faces of ministers. The 
cornerstones of our society like health care, education and the 
social safety net are in jeopardy because Canadians are forced to 
borrow $89 million per day or $625 million every week to 
finance the debt.
<P>
	If the Minister of Finance truly believes this is fulfilling his 
promise to break the back of the deficit and attack it head on, I 
suggest he is incompetent. Double talk and inaction in the 
situation are inhuman. It is a great disservice to the country to 
play games with other people's money, tax money.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	Our economy and incomes have consistently grown more 
slowly than our debt. We are now borrowing to pay the interest 
on our debt. This is not a sustainable situation. We are spending 
our children's and grandchildren's money. We are mortgaging 
their future at an alarming rate. I heard a baby up in the gallery 
this afternoon. That baby will have to repay the money that we 
borrow and are spending today.
<P>
	Do our children have a say in how we are spending their future 
earnings? Does this not bother members of the Liberal 
government? When they go home tonight I suggest they look at 
their children and their grandchildren and think about what their 
lives will be like with carcass-like social programs. They were 
lost by a government that borrowed them into extinction.
<P>
	The time to act is now. The government should priorize its 
spending. If health care is number one then it should make 
health care number one and stop cutting the share of annual 
transfers to the provinces. If the social safety net is number two 
then those programs should be restructured so that they are 
targeted at those who truly need them and not everybody and 
anyone.
<P>
	It is all about common sense. Families have used it for years 
in their budgets and members of Parliament obviously used it to 
run their homes. Why is it that when they get to the House they 
forget about that? Why is it that they do not do it when they are 
in government and are ministers of the crown? Why do they not 
operate like they do at home when it comes to government 
moneys from taxpayers? Can they borrow money on their homes 
on which they have mortgages to make the interest payments? 
We both know the answer is no. The bank would repossess the 
house. Somebody is going to repossess our country and we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8358"> 8358 </A></B>
<P>
should do something about it before somebody takes it away 
from us.
<P>
	Let us live within our means. If the federal government only 
has $126 billion in revenues, we should not be able to spend any 
more than that amount. What is so hard about that to 
understand? Why do we continue to fuel the debt by deficit 
spending all the time? Why do we not start on a curve where we 
live within our means with the money we know we can generate 
safely in the country from a strong economy and send the right 
signals and messages to investors and other countries?
<P>
	Let us use Liberal ideology and take a walk into the future. Let 
us take a little walk through the Canada of the future under the 
Liberal government as though it were a house. First, the house 
would be mortgaged to the tune of $650 billion. This is just in a 
couple of years. The welcome mat would be subsidized. As we 
walk in, the first thing we would notice are the third rate 
snowboots and snowsuits hanging by the door. This is because 
corners had to be cut in the family budget to meet the mortgage 
payments and excessive taxes levied by the government.
<P>
	That is okay because we notice that everyone seems happy as 
they huddle around the television to watch whatever magic the 
high salaried executives at CBC have conjured up that particular 
evening with our tax dollars.
<P>
	Next we walk into the kitchen and notice grocery bills stuck 
on the refrigerator door. We are surprised at how expensive 
groceries are these days, but at least the Liberals kept their 
promise and killed the dreaded GST. Oh, wait, what is that we 
notice on the bill? Is it a national value added tax of 15 per cent? 
Disgusted, we turn around and notice a book of home remedies 
on the kitchen table and realize that Liberal cutbacks in health 
care have truly started to hit home.
<P>
	At least after years of paying into the system we think to 
ourselves that the parents will have their RRSPs to fall back on. 
But, wait, the Liberals slowly eroded those programs through 
taxation and on capital gains too. What about the CPP? There is 
not enough money in the program to cover the revenue 
shortfalls.
<P>
	With the current spending practices of the government this 
type of Liberal house is not that far-fetched. I do not want to live 
in it and that is why I am here speaking about the problems in the 
country and offering some solutions on how to solve them. 
Nothing less than a balanced budget in three to four years is 
acceptable. By adopting this Reform recommendation the new 
type of home we would find in Canada would be a big 
improvement over the Liberal version.
<P>
	Let me review four advantages and benefits to all Canadians 
of a deficit elimination program. The first one is a smaller 
mortgage for the country of $580 billion versus $650 billion. 
That is significant. This means we would have affordable 
housing where we could start making interest and principal 
payments and over the term of 30 years pay off our debt. This is 
how we have to do it with our family homes.
<P>
	Second, to balance the budget a full program of review would 
be required. It would allow the government to right size 
government operations. However it is not doing that. If it did a 
proper review instead of consulting special interest groups 
across the country, government departments would have to 
recommit to the good programs; decentralize some programs to 
eliminate duplication of services, thereby lowering costs; 
privatize some corporations which are better served by the 
private sector; and eliminate programs that on a priorized basis 
we either do not need or cannot afford.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	This would enable us to determine what amount of money we 
need to raise as a federal government. Then we could lower the 
taxes. There would be savings under the process. That is the 
benefit to Canadians, the biggest benefit of all. We would be 
leaving money in the hands of the people who earn it and know 
how to spend it better than the people who come into the House 
and lose their brain power.
<P>
	Increasing the wage earner's disposable income would 
kickstart the economy and would continue to fuel the current 
economic recovery rather than hurt it. Following the Reform 
recommendations would restore pride not only in ourselves but 
in our government.
<P>
	This is at a time when politicians and governments are coming 
under the closest scrutiny by taxpayers, by editorialists and by 
people who know the problem is overspending. If the 
government does not get its spending under control the 
politicians in this room will lose the faith of the people which 
will slowly erode our political system.
<P>
	Another advantage to following the Reform 
recommendations is that we have a solution for the province of 
Quebec. Our home includes Quebec. It includes the opportunity 
to get the best deal we can in Confederation without breaking the 
country apart, without tearing at the guts of the economy and 
without going into all the uncertainties that separation so-called 
provides in opportunities for Quebecers.
<P>
	It is a very touchy subject. National unity is very important 
and I believe in the Reform economic program of deficit 
elimination. That is the difference between our proposal and the 
Liberals' so-called tough talk. It is all talk and no action. They 
are not solving the problems. They are just adding gasoline to 
the fire when trying to put it out. By increasing the debt they are 
hurting us. By increasing the debt they are increasing our 
problems.
<P>
	We say we should get to a balanced budget within three years. 
There would be no more deficit annually. We would have a fixed 
debt or mortgage on the country. Then we could start addressing 
the amount of money spent, start creating a surplus and start 
making principal and interest payments on the home of which 
we are all so proud. We want everybody to continue to share the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8359"> 8359 </A></B>
<P>
benefits, but we cannot continue to do it with borrowed  money 
and more borrowed money and adding to the debt.
<P>
	The Liberal government should listen. We have been 
constructive. We have given it advice on where to cut and how to 
cut over a three-year period, and not in one year like it accuses 
us. Governments members like to play politics and we like to 
offer constructive solutions. It is time for the Reform type of 
house.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
hon. member for his comments. Throughout listening to him I 
was mystified because he talked about specifics and the need to 
be specific. I did not hear him give one concrete proposal on 
where to cut government spending.
<P>
	I wonder if the hon. member would come across and be clean 
about it. His arguments are sound but let us talk about something 
specific. Let us talk about the cost of operating the civil service. 
We have a combination of federal and provincial government 
employees amounting to about 886,000 people. The Canadian 
Federation of Independent Business tells us that on average they 
are paid something like 20 per cent higher than similar private 
sector wage earners.
<P>
	What is the member's proposal to deal with that kind of 
problem? Does he propose laying off civil service workers? 
What is his concrete proposal?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, as I said in my speech, this is what the 
Liberal government is doing. It is playing games. It is playing 
politics. All it wants to do is talk, and no action.
<P>
	The member for Durham stands and asks for specifics. If he 
were paying attention in the House instead of having his nose 
buried in the red book, still trying to find out what he promised 
during the election, he would know that on Friday last week we 
filed in the standing committee a report of 25 specific cost 
cutting measures that would benefit the country and Parliament 
if the Liberal government were so wise as to listen to us, take 
what we suggest and implement it.
<P>
<B>(1600 ) </B>
<P>
	We have been very specific. To go through that in the time 
allotted to me in questions and comments would be repetitive. 
As the Prime Minister likes to tell us, read the red book. It is 
there. I would like to suggest to the member for Durham, read 
the report of the Standing Committee on Finance on budgetary 
policy that has been submitted by my colleagues. He will see 
that we have been very specific.
<P>
	On the other item, getting specific about the public service 
sector, is that what the government is worried about, what the 
government employees in the bureaucracy are going to think of 
it, that it is not going to get re-elected, that it is not going to get 
votes? This is what we are sick and tired of in this country. That 
is trivial.
<P>
	In addressing the public sector the amount of money is trivial 
compared with the overall problem of this country and the 
billions we waste in direct subsidies to businesses and the 
billions we waste on foreign aid.
<P>
	In the one minute left to me, I would like to make one more 
comment. If we get our government spending under control we 
could then take a look at that abomination called the Income Tax 
Act and we could introduce a flat tax that would have a single 
rate for businesses and corporations. There is a member of the 
government who has made that suggestion. That government is 
so ignorant of the solutions for this country it will not even listen 
to that member. I am disappointed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Clearly the member for 
Calgary Centre underestimated how much time he had left 
because I have time to give another question, this time to the 
hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there are people here who are indulging in petty 
politics, and I am referring to the Reform Party. The Reform 
Party distorts all the proposals made by the Bloc Quebecois, 
which were about cutting the fat from government operations, 
the recovery by the federal government of $8 billion worth of 
accounts receivable classified as bad debts, which the Auditor 
General mentioned last week, and cutting into the $3.3 billion 
worth of subsidies to corporations. You never hear the Reform 
Party talk about that. Do you know why? Because they are both 
judge and jury. They have a vested interest.
<P>
	There is a question I would like to ask them. I will read them 
something in English, because I think it is significant, and I will 
then do a proper translation. I would like to ask them whether 
they agree with an ad that appeared last week, which I found 
with the help of Léo-Paul Lauzon, the well-known tax expert. It 
says more or less the following in English, if you will excuse my 
heavy accent:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``Fiscal loss to sell. Our client, a cosmetic distributor, has 
important fiscal loss and he is looking for a buyer who is 
interested in using this fiscal deduction. Please call the 
following number''.
<P>
	Do you agree with this practice?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8360"> 8360 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Is that why they will not look at the tax treatment of 
corporations, why they will not consider raising taxes, why they 
will not consider improvements so that everyone, individuals, 
corporations and SMEs, does their share? If their minds are 
closed to such suggestions, then they are doing the petty 
politicking, and they have no interest in the future of Canada, 
although they claim otherwise. They are doing the grand 
standing, in other words.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, we are very definitely interested in 
helping Canadians solve their problems. The difference between 
the Bloc Quebecois and the Reform Party is, after having 
worked with the hon. member in the Department of Finance, that 
when it comes to cuts it does not want to touch or look at social 
program spending whatsoever. That is a sacred trust to the Bloc 
Quebecois. It does not want to reduce one dollar of spending in 
that area. That represents 67 per cent of its overall budget. If it 
does not address its complete budget and only makes cuts out of 
the remainder of the 33 per cent, it is limited to how much it can 
cut. Social spending has to be addressed as the Liberal 
government has proposed in its grey book. It is important to 
discuss and it is important to do something about it.
<P>
	The difference is that we are prepared to look at social 
program review and recommend some cuts but the Bloc is not. 
When it comes to taxation we say no increases in taxes. It says 
there is room for tax increases, go after the family trust, go after 
the RRSPs, go after all those wealthy people in our society and 
that will solve the problem. Those are the differences.
<P>
<B>(1605 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gar Knutson (Elgin-Norfolk, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, let 
me begin by saying that I agree with my colleagues in their 
concern for the debt and deficit. The deficit has reached a crisis 
proportion. I also agree with their concern for children.
<P>
	I believe that we must move urgently to balance the budget but 
we must not use the budget crisis to deal with other pressing 
problems.
<P>
	I commend the government for its commitment to lower the 
deficit to 3 per cent of GDP within three years of taking office. 
Believing that this goal is achievable, I also urge the 
government to move to balancing the budget in as short a time as 
is reasonably possible thereafter.
<P>
	Some people ask why is the debt a problem. Annual interest 
on the debt is $44 billion; that is $44 billion that we do not have 
to spend on education, industrial infrastructure, research and a 
host of other important programs. Just as serious for more subtle 
reasons is the fact that the debt drives up interest rates for 
everyone.
<P>
	Because of the size of our debt international lenders demand 
and receive a risk premium to hedge against a potential drop in 
the value of the Canadian dollar. This risk premium or extra cost 
affects the whole market for money and the cost for borrowing 
consequently is reflected in it. Consumers, homeowners, 
students and all other borrowers also pay this premium.
<P>
	The size of our debt makes our nation extremely sensitive to a 
rise in interest rates in the United States. Canada is forced to pay 
a premium over American rates in order to attract foreign 
capital. When rates go up in the United States we have no choice 
but to raise them in Canada. Thus our sovereignty has been 
severely curtailed as we lose control over our monetary policy.
<P>
	We are hampered from finding made in Canada solutions to 
Canadian problems. Losing control over our economic house 
diminishes our nation and everyone in it. All we can do is hope 
that international forces co-operate with our deficit reduction 
program.
<P>
	Furthermore, as bad as our situation is now, it will be much 
worse if we do not act now with discipline and resolve.
<P>
	Having outlined my views on the seriousness of the problem, I 
would now like to address the solution. The following remarks 
can be entitled a good way to balance the budget versus a bad 
way to balance the budget. Everyone agrees that government 
should cut waste. Cutting waste is a good way to contribute to 
balancing the budget. More often than not waste is designed 
right into programs and as such is not so readily apparent.
<P>
	For example, the coast guard, Transport Canada and fisheries 
and oceans maintain separate fleets with overlapping duties. My 
own riding of Elgin-Norfolk covers approximately 100 miles 
of Lake Erie shoreline. One of the harbours in Port Stanley is 
operated well by Transport Canada. The other smaller harbours 
are managed by small craft harbours of fisheries and oceans. 
These harbours are often neglected due to shortage of funds. 
Regardless, we have two sets of bureaucrats managing a similar 
resource side by side. I would like to suggest that a single 
authority could manage the Lake Erie shoreline, do a better job 
and do it cheaper.
<P>
	The military has recently been highlighted as having some 
waste. In the past this waste was designed in as we kept bases 
open only for political need rather than serving military 
purposes. While this is starting to change we need to go further 
to identity waste.
<P>
	We spend large sums of money on high tech advanced 
equipment such as the CF-18. The CF-18 is not used in 
peacekeeping but would be used in the unlikely event of the 
breakout of world war III or as a token contribution to a gulf war 
like crisis.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8361"> 8361 </A></B>
<P>
	Canada is currently the 12th largest military spender in the 
world. I believe we can cut military spending and find a large 
peace dividend, all the while maintaining our contribution to 
peacekeeping and our security needs.
<P>
	The reserves offer great potential for a cheaper alternative to 
CF-18s and other high tech expensive weapons. In my riding the 
Elgin regiments have contributed nine people to the army who 
are now currently serving in Bosnia. These young men offer 
skill and commitment that represent a great value for dollar as 
citizen soldiers. Unfortunately the reserves often appear to be 
under equipped and generally under resourced.
<P>
	I would now like to speak for a short while on tax policy. I 
accept as a given the government's apparent indication that a 
general tax increase is not in the cards. Certainly the middle 
class of this country will not tolerate a general tax increase. 
However, I need to point out that within this country there is a 
great inequity of income. The top 20 per cent of income earners 
receive over 44 per cent of national income annually while the 
bottom 20 per cent have approximately 2.7 per cent of national 
income. It is within this context that fairness in tax policy needs 
to be considered. There is nothing contradictory in fair taxation 
and deficit reduction. An increase in taxes on the top 20 per cent 
of income earners in this country I believe would entirely 
appropriate at the current time.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	Furthermore, the government should look at tax expenditures. 
The government forgoes $860 million by not taxing lottery 
winnings. This should be changed. The marriage credit costs 
over $1 billion. The government should design it so that it 
benefits the lower and middle class primarily.
<P>
	RRSPs have received considerable attention lately. My own 
view is that the annual contribution rate should be limited to 
$9,000 with corresponding change to private pension plans.
<P>
	The people in my riding have just come through the worst 
recession since the 1930s. Very few of them can even consider 
saving $9,000 a year to put into an RRSP. The benefits of RRSP 
contributions fall most favourably on the rich, those within the 
highest marginal tax rates. This by itself is unfair. Without 
change to the current law the contribution limits are set to rise to 
$15,000 annually. This limit will have little benefit to the 
factory worker or the farmer in Elgin-Norfolk.
<P>
	Lowering the limit will raise government revenue by an 
estimated $750 million to $1 billion annually. It will also restore 
in small part fairness and integrity to the tax system.
<P>
	As we work toward a balanced budget there may be instances 
when for very good reasons spending more, not less, on a 
program is entirely appropriate. I would like to recommend that 
the government treat child poverty as an urgent crisis that 
requires more resources, not fewer, nor even a freeze. This may 
appear like a contradiction. I would like to assure the House that 
it is not.
<P>
	The government has said that it needs to find over $6 billion in 
annual cuts within the next two years to meet its target to 
balance the budget and another $30 billion to $35 billion in 
increased revenue or decrease in expenditures. Within this 
context how difficult can it be to find an extra billion dollars for 
hungry Canadian children?
<P>
	The Department of Human Resources Development has 
produced a supplementary paper to its green paper that outlines 
as an option an enhanced child tax benefit that would raise the 
benefit to $2,500 per child and be clawed back starting for 
incomes of $15,000 and dropping to zero for family incomes at 
$55,000. The cost of this program would be approximately $1 
billion.
<P>
	I would like to remind the House with the greatest respect that 
all Canadians are not participating in the recovery, nor are they 
likely to. If the government does not play a fair role in 
redistributing income this recovery will drive a wider wedge 
between the well off and the disadvantaged. Families that cannot 
compete in a quickly changing, knowledge based economy will 
be unemployed and their children will suffer the worst of the 
consequences.
<P>
	In absolute terms over 1.2 million Canadian children, nearly 
20 per cent of the child population, live in poverty in this 
country today. In most cases their parents are working. Even 
worse, in some provinces one-quarter to one-third of all 
children are poor. This is an obscenity. Even in times of cutbacks 
the issue needs to be addressed. The consequences of child 
poverty need to be addressed just as the consequence of the 
deficit need to be addressed.
<P>
	Poor children are often poorly nourished. The Canadian 
Institute of Child Health states that without adequate nutrition 
children will suffer from stunted growth, intellectual 
impairment and a variety of infectious diseases. They will put an 
extra burden on health care and on prisons as they grow up.
<P>
	To sum up, I agree with my colleagues that the debt and the 
deficit are serious problems. So too are a host of other problems 
and the one I have identified most significantly is child poverty. 
That is why I ask everyone in this House to join with me and ask 
the government for an increase in the child tax benefit and for 
some real solutions for child poverty.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
have liked to hear my colleague opposite talk a little about 
unemployment insurance contributions. We know very well that 
last year the Liberal government increased contributions from 
$4.20 to $4.30 per $100 for employers, and from $3 to $3.07 for 
employees. This is money which is taken out of the market and 
that could create jobs instead of helping the unemployed.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8362"> 8362 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	Moreover, the proposed reform will cut $5.5 billion from 
unemployment insurance over three years. So, contributions 
were increased and spending is being cut by $5.5 billion.
<P>
	Here is my question: What will happen with all that? What 
will happen to the unemployed? Is it just a matter of transferring 
people from the unemployment roll to the welfare roll, thereby 
putting the burden on the provinces which will have to carry 
those welfare costs by themselves?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Knutson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question.
<P>
	First I would point out that the UI program as with every 
government program has to be sustainable. I would suggest that 
a program that has grown from an expenditure of roughly $4 
billion to over $18 billion in the space of 10 years is not 
sustainable. That is one of the reasons why the UI program 
needed to be reformed.
<P>
	The other reason it needed to be reformed was that it did not 
do a very good job in terms of helping people get back to work. 
Consequently that is why the Minister of Human Resources 
Development announced or started his social policy review.
<P>
	I think the issue of unemployment insurance needs to go hand 
in hand with the concept that the best social security is for 
someone to have a job. That is why we need to spend more 
money on training and that sort of thing and perhaps less on 
benefits.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to ask the member who just gave his presentation a question.
<P>
	Earlier today during statements by members one Liberal 
member indicated that the Reform's recommendation of $20 
billion to $22 billion in cuts over three years is too draconian. 
The member following the presentation by my colleague from 
Lethbridge asked whether the severity or size of the cuts that the 
Reform is suggesting would hurt the economy.
<P>
	The finance minister of the Liberal government said he is 
looking for $9.5 billion in cuts over two years. That is an 
average of $4.5 billion. We are recommending $7 billion a year 
over three years. The difference is $2.5 billion per year. Ours 
represents a 1 per cent reduction per year on the rate of the GDP.
<P>
	I would ask the member if he thinks our cuts are severe. Are 
we really just debating over $2.5 billion per year? If so, what 
about the question in reverse. Does he not think $4.5 billion a 
year is too severe and too draconian from that side of the House?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Knutson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I understand the question. I think 
the debate between the Reform Party and the Liberal Party is not 
only on the size of the cuts but where they are made. I do not 
want to underestimate the impact of that debate.
<P>
	My understanding of the numbers is the finance minister is 
looking for roughly a little over $3 billion to meet his targets for 
the following February and an additional over $3 billion for a 
total of six. I may not have a proper understanding of that but I 
did not think it was nine. I thought it was slightly over six.
<P>
	Whether it is $6 billion or $9 billion I agree that we need to 
make our target of 3 per cent of GDP within three years and some 
people are going to be hurt by that. I know the member did listen 
but I would like to remind him of what I said. I think some of the 
money should be found from a tax increase. I think it is 
outrageous when the top 20 per cent of income earners in this 
country are getting 44 per cent of the income while the bottom 
20 per cent only get 2.7 per cent. It is patently outrageous. It is 
unfair and it is wrong.
<P>
	I do not think we need a $15,000 annual limit on RRSPs. This 
limit helps people with an annual marginal tax rate of 50 per cent 
and that is the well off.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this debate is part of the process leading to the budget 
expected in February 1995 and in consequence we must presume 
that no specific measures have yet been decided by the 
government.
<P>
<B>(1620 ) </B>
<P>
	In scheduling this debate the government is asking us what 
direction the budget should take and what have Canadians been 
telling us about budgetary matters. Consequently I will make 
my remarks in that spirit, that nothing has been specifically 
decided, that budget policy is still open.
<P>
	It is understood of course that the government intends to 
pursue the principles set out in the red book, to take the 
two-track approach, the first track being jobs and growth and 
the second track being deficit or debt reduction. In this respect, 
Mr. Speaker, the government as you know published several 
policy discussion papers. As part of its jobs and growth agenda it 
published the famous green book ``Improving Social Security in 
Canada''. Then it published two others. One is ``A New 
Framework for Economic Policy'' known as the purple book and 
``Creating a Healthy Fiscal Climate'' known as the grey book.
<P>
	It has asked two committees to undertake consultations with 
Canadians, the finance committee on the last two and the human 
resources development committee on the other. Both will report 
to the House before the budget. I have to make clear that the two 
are very closely interrelated. One of the goals of the social 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8363"> 8363 </A></B>
<P>
security review is to decide whether our present social programs 
are affordable.
<P>
	The three goals mentioned in that document for the social 
security review are fairness, effectiveness and affordability. It is 
this question of affordability which links the social security 
review to the economic and fiscal questions and to the budgetary 
review.
<P>
	I want to take this opportunity to state categorically, and I am 
speaking on my own, that our traditional social programs are 
affordable. They are not the cause of the deficit. They certainly 
need improvement. Inadequacies must be corrected, but they 
should not be cut. They must be improved and in some cases 
expanded.
<P>
	In this respect the discussion papers are sometimes 
ambiguous. For example this one is entitled ``Improving Social 
Security in Canada''. On the other hand it questions the 
affordability of those programs. As I said, our social programs 
are not the cause of our deficit. They are not the cause of our 
national debt.
<P>
	Most of our social programs were started in the post-war 
forties, fifties and sixties and were built during that period. 
During that period we had one of the strongest economic 
growths in Canadian history. As we built our social programs 
during those decades, we attracted very strong capital private 
investment. It is the same with other advanced countries. We 
must take note that the countries with the strongest economies, 
the highest standards of living, and the highest quality of life 
have also the strongest and best social programs: Germany, 
Holland, Sweden, Canada, Japan.
<P>
	The fact that they built those strong social programs did not 
deter economic growth and investment in their countries. Nor 
did they cause the economies to go into decline once those 
countries brought in these strong and very important social 
programs.
<P>
	I have been listening to the Reform Party members. I believe 
that if we did what they suggested we would bankrupt this 
country. Not only would they not solve the deficit problem, they 
would drive the country and send it in exactly the opposite 
direction. We would end up a third world impoverished country. 
There would be a few rich people. If we did what they suggest, 
we would not solve the deficit. We would drive the country into 
almost a third world status.
<P>
	The causes of our deficit have not been the social programs, 
but have been on the other hand the general weaknesses in our 
economy, high interest rates, unplanned structural change, 
unplanned globalization, monopolistic practices and unfair 
taxation-a lot of tax is not being paid that should be paid-and 
several others.
<P>
	In the red book we said that the Conservative Party was 
obsessed by the deficit.
<P>
<B>(1625 ) </B>
<P>
	I want to refer to some of the things we said in the red book. At 
page 10 we said: ``Without a doubt one of the greatest failings of 
the Conservative government has been the tendency to focus 
obsessively on one problem, such as the deficit, without 
understanding or caring about the consequences of their policies 
in other areas such as lost jobs, increased poverty and 
dependence on social assistance. Social costs are real''.
<P>
	At page 85 in the red book we said: ``Conservative 
government decisions to cut social programs were made without 
acknowledging the effect these cuts could have on crime rates. 
Access to health care, housing, jobs and training is essential if 
crime is to be prevented''.
<P>
	We said on page 20 of our red book: ``The goal of deficit 
reduction would be to cut the deficit to 3 per cent of gross 
domestic product by the end of the third year in office''. We 
said: ``In doing that expenditure reductions will be achieved by 
cancelling unnecessary programs, streamlining processes, 
eliminating duplication, and doing that in partnership with 
provincial governments''.
<P>
	We gave some examples of the things we would cut. We 
started off in the right way. We said we would cancel the 
helicopters, reduce national defence spending, reduce the $4.1 
billion consulting and professional services budget, reduce 
grants to businesses, reduce the size and budget of cabinet 
ministers' offices and the Prime Minister's office. Nothing 
about social programs in there. On the contrary, in chapter 5 of 
the red book we said that they should be strengthened and 
improved.
<P>
	At the very worst the social security review should be revenue 
neutral. If we really mean to improve the programs the review 
should not be a means of attacking the deficit. That is not what 
we said in the red book, that is not what we said in the campaign.
<P>
	So far the government has been good in honouring the 
commitments to the red book. It should not forget what it said in 
that red book about social programs and the deficit.
<P>
	It is interesting to note that not all but many of the 
businessmen who say we cannot afford such things as pensions, 
health care, day care, training, post-secondary education, 
unemployment insurance, a living wage for those who cannot 
work, day after day try to convince us to buy, to buy, to buy, 
more cars, more cameras, more TVs, more holidays, pet food, 
jewellery, camcorders, cigarettes and liquor, with more and 
more credit cards and no down payment. Obviously they either 
think we can afford those things or they do not care.
<P>
	Is there not something wrong with a society where we are 
closing hospitals and schools, where there are more people 
living on the streets, where the gap between the rich and the poor 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8364"> 8364 </A></B>
<P>
is growing, when at the same time the business sector is 
pressuring or encouraging us to buy more and more goods which 
really are not in any way as important as the things I have just 
mentioned. More yo-yos and less hospital care.
<P>
	Those who talk about waste in government sell us products 
with built-in obsolescence so that after three or four years we 
have to buy more and more again. That is waste. That is real 
waste.
<P>
	The whole question about affordability must be looked at in a 
much broader context as to what this country can afford. Can we 
afford more and more consumer goods that do not really count in 
our lives or can we afford better hospitals, better schools, better 
training, better pensions, making sure people are not living on 
the streets and that people who want to work can work?
<P>
	In conclusion, if the government wants the views of MPs and 
their constituents this is what I am trying to deliver today. I had a 
townhall meeting in Montreal just last week. What I am telling 
you today is what these people told me at that townhall meeting. 
Cut the deficit, yes, certainly cut the deficit, but do it as we said 
we would do it in the red book, not by cutting social programs. 
We do not want the status quo. We have to improve things, we 
have to make our social programs more effective and better, but 
do not cut them. Do not cut the deficit on the backs of the middle 
class and the poor.
<P>
<B>(1630 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Beam me up, Scotty. Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce says he wants to 
cut the deficit all right but in doing so he is going to ignore the 
63 per cent of our budgetary expenditures that are used in 
transfers. Then he makes this gigantic leap and says that all the 
cuts that would be made in those would be made on the backs of 
the poor. I have news for him. There is more money taken out of 
social programs by the middle class, including the upper middle 
class, than there is by the poor. He can read that in the statistics 
in his own reports.
<P>
	I give the hon. member some credit for telling us that the 
programs work great as long as there is strong economic growth. 
That is what we have been saying all along but we cannot 
continue to throw money out the door with abandon when we 
have a weak economy.
<P>
	Let us not say that these programs have never caused any 
economic decline in countries that have had them. Look at 
Sweden. Sweden has hit the wall economically. I have personal 
knowledge of that from people I am dealing with who are trying 
to get past immigration into Canada because there are no jobs in 
Sweden any more. Sweden is worse off than we are.
<P>
	If as the hon. member suggests the deficit is not as great a 
problem as we Reformers suggest, I find it passing curious that 
the Liberals have accepted their half-hearted attempts at deficit 
reduction. Either we have a problem or we do not. Let us be 
consistent. Let us decide what we are saying here.
<P>
	Finally, there is one part of his dissertation which I did find a 
little bit offensive. He said the government and taxation are not 
to blame for the deficit or government overspending. It is all 
those evil, ordinary little people who insist on wasting their 
money on consumer goods when mother government could 
spend it so much more wisely on their behalf.
<P>
	I would like to hear the hon. member's response to my 
comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allmand:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has mentioned 
several points and I will try to deal with them all.
<P>
	First, I did mention the middle class. I said not to cut the 
deficit on the backs of the middle class and the poor. That is 
what would be done if we seriously cut social programs.
<P>
	Second, I did not say that the deficit was not a problem. It is a 
problem but deficits can be attacked in two ways. You can attack 
deficits by increasing revenue, by strengthening your economy 
and by putting people to work, or by cutting out programs.
<P>
	A family that has debt problems can take their kids out of 
school, can sell the family car, their house and tools. They can 
probably reduce their debt that way, or they can go out and work 
harder and increase their revenue. By doing it the first way, they 
might end up getting rid of their debt but they would be in a 
serious situation of poverty.
<P>
	I am suggesting that the second way be used. That is the way 
we said we would do it in the red book. We would do it by putting 
the emphasis on economic growth and jobs, by putting people 
back to work so that instead of collecting money from the 
government on unemployment insurance and welfare they are 
paying taxes. Yes, the deficit is a problem, but we do not attack it 
especially by cutting social programs.
<P>
	The member referred to countries like Sweden. Since when is 
the cause of the recession in Sweden due to social programs? 
There have been social programs for a long time in Sweden, 
Germany and many other countries as we have had in Canada 
and they did not have the unemployment problems they have 
today. The unemployment problem they have today is due to 
many of the same things that I said were problems in Canada: 
increased interest rates, globalization, unplanned structural 
change, a lot of things like that, but not the social programs.
<P>
	That is where Reform Party members make a serious mistake. 
They blame everything on the social programs. We had good 
social programs in Canada throughout the  1950s and 1960s and 
we did not have the problem we have today. The cause of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8365"> 8365 </A></B>
<P>
problem we have today is not the social programs, it is other 
things.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	The final point he raised is an important one. He says that I am 
criticizing the poor consumer because the consumer might want 
to buy consumer goods instead of spending money on things like 
health care and education.
<P>
	There are certain things that are important for nations which 
nations can only provide for together as a people through their 
governments. The people decide together that they want to do 
that. A long time ago we decided to have free public education in 
Canada up to grade 12. I do not know, maybe the Reform Party 
would like to reject that and go back to private education.
<P>
	There are certain things such as hospitalization, medicare, 
social welfare programs, public education, environmental 
programs, public highways and the justice system that can only 
be done by the public sector. If we ignore the public sector and 
simply put too much money into the private sector we have 
private sector spending but the country falls apart because we do 
not have the social capital and infrastructure needed to compete 
with Europe, Japan and countries in other parts of the world.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. 
member for Bourassa-Immigration; the hon. member for 
Chicoutimi-Railway Transportation; the hon. member for 
Yukon-Health Care.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, to 
start with, allow me to thank my colleague from 
Saint-Hyacinthe for giving me the opportunity to speak today.
<P>
	Of course, it will come as no surprise that I am going to deal 
with the financial aspect of the issue, particularly as it relates to 
native people. I just listened carefully to my colleague from 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, and I was pleasantly surprised. For us, 
it was a breath of fresh air to hear such a discourse, especially 
following his colleague from 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, whose stand was quite 
the opposite.
<P>
	I do hope that what the member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce 
suggested will have precedence in cabinet. I hope that this point 
of view will be adopted by the Liberal government. But judging 
from the various views expressed so far, sadly, my colleague 
from Notre-Dame-de-Grâce may well be the exception.
<P>
	At any rate, I too have perused the red book. We all do, do we 
not, inevitably? This book is supposed to provide guidance as to 
the intentions of this government while it is in power. The thing 
about this red book that is noteworthy is that it embodied a 
fundamental principle from the very outset, and that is the 
principle of equity. It  was clearly stated in this book that this 
government would not forget the underprivileged, but all we 
hear about these days, with the forthcoming ministerial social 
program reform in particular, seams to indicate and lead us to 
anticipate the worst for the underprivileged. Yet I do hope this 
will not materialize.
<P>
	I just mentioned the principle of equity set out in the red book. 
But recently, certain lead ministers have indicated in their 
remarks that it was more a matter of fighting the deficit. We will 
soon be in a deficit and debt fighting mode, hence our fear that 
the underprivileged will be made, unfortunately, to foot the bill. 
Now, I am listening to what this government is telling us and I 
cannot help but be reminded that this is the government that was 
responsible for starting this national debt spiral in the years 
1976, 1977, 1978.
<P>
	I reviewed the facts carefully. As a matter of fact, the Prime 
Minister was the Minister of Finance at the time, and when he 
was the Minister of Finance, in 1977-I looked up the 
figures-the deficit grew from $3.3 billion in 1976 to $7 billion 
in 1977, when he became the Minister of Finance. It more than 
doubled. And the following year, the current Prime Minister, as 
Minister of Finance, brought down estimates indicating that the 
debt would reach $10 billion in 1978.
<P>
	You can see that the debt spiral was instigated by the Liberals, 
who were however very quick to blame the previous 
Conservative government for it. But if you look at the situation 
since 1985, you can see that it is the debt and the interest on the 
national debt that have driven the deficit spiral.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	I think that the Liberals can also blame themselves for this. I 
wish to respond to the comments made by my colleague from 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine. I hope that he is now 
listening to me on the parliamentary channel. I do not agree at 
all with his statement that Canada has functioned admirably for 
125 years. My findings are totally different.
<P>
	It started off on the wrong foot with the Act of Union. We 
think that things started going downhill when the Act of Union 
uniting Upper and Lower Canada merged Upper Canada's debts 
with Lower Canada's sound management. Why are we in 16th 
place in terms of competitiveness when we used to be among the 
top five?
<P>
	Why are we down in last place among G-7 countries? He 
keeps talking about the prestigious G-7. We should not forget 
that we are the poor relations of the G-7. How much overlap and 
duplication do we have and how much is it costing us every 
year? Very conservative reports now estimate that overlap is 
costing us up to $3 billion a year because the federal and 
provincial governments are continuously short-circuiting each 
other.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8366"> 8366 </A></B>
<P>
	We are told that Quebecers' debt rate, I must point this out, is 
much lower than that of other Canadians. Quebec government 
management is in much better shape than federal government 
management. That is recognized by everyone.
<P>
	As for the consistently higher unemployment rate, the Gaspé 
region, among others, is a typical example. The Gaspé is 
probably among the Quebec regions with the highest 
unemployment rates. Why is the unemployment rate in Quebec 
always higher than the Canadian average? I say that the system 
does not work and that as soon as Quebec gets hold of all the 
tools, I can assure you that its unemployment rate will fall 
substantially and compare favourably with countries that are 
much more advanced that the one we are now a part of.
<P>
	I would like to add that the First Nations are concerned, and 
for the reasons I just enumerated. They think that this 
government will really go after the poorest people and hit the 
poor and middle classes in this society; if Canada has a class of 
poor people, it is certainly the First Nations.
<P>
	Not only social programs, which are a sort of safety net for 
them, are endangered. In a few moments, I will tell you how we 
must get out of this trap. It is probably not by always giving the 
native people more social programs and making them more 
dependent; it is quite the opposite, as I will explain shortly. They 
are concerned not only with threatened cuts in the Department of 
Indian Affairs but also about other departments that have 
specific programs for the First Nations.
<P>
	Take the Department of Health, for example, which has an 
annual budget of about $900 million for the First Nations. So 
clearly, if cuts are made in health, the First Nations will be 
affected and if there is a class of people in Canada who do not 
need to be affected by such cuts, it is certainly the First Nations.
<P>
	It is the same in the Department of Industry and Commerce. 
This department has specific programs for the First Nations and 
so there is a danger that the economic development proposals of 
that department will make the First Nations even more deprived 
than they are now. Parts of other departments, such as Canadian 
Heritage, are concerned with Indian affairs.
<P>
	In any case, we must realize that any cuts affecting the First 
Nations would be disastrous for them since they are considered 
to be Canada's Third World.
<P>
	Although the government congratulates itself on having 
increased contributions to the First Nations by 119 per cent 
since 1983, the figures show that the money spent was already 
provided for in treaties, a point which is often made by the First 
Nations, and I think that they are right on that. Our predecessors 
signed a dozen treaties with the native people in Canada and 
these treaties required the government to provide some services 
and compensation; today, the commitments made then must be 
honoured by the government.
<P>
	I remind you of the social contract of that time, because 
something incorrect is being put forward now to the effect that 
the government is trying to keep the First Nations under its 
wing.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	It has often been said that First Nations people were all lazy. 
However, the social contract of the time was not about that at all. 
It basically said that the government would take 99 per cent of 
the land belonging to First Nations, and relocate these people on 
the one per cent left. The government would also develop all the 
resources. You will see later, in the proposals I am making, 
which are also those of the First Nations, a desire for better 
sharing as well as for putting an end to this paternalistic attitude 
and this dependency.
<P>
	Here are some interesting figures. Native families receive 
about $7,480 yearly. Considering this annual income of $7,480, 
my earlier reference to third world people was not an 
exaggeration.
<P>
	If you take the Canadian economy as a whole, it is very 
difficult for a family to make ends meet on $7,480 per year. In 
fact, this is unacceptable in today's society. Our society prides 
itself on having the best quality of life in the world, but if you 
take a close look at the situation of the First Nations and the poor 
in this country, you will notice an increasing gap between those 
who have money and those who do not. I believe that the First 
Nations are the real poor in Canada and in Quebec.
<P>
	They have a very high degree of dependency, as confirmed 
last week by the Auditor General. Indeed, 43 per cent of natives 
are completely dependent on the government. The 
unemployment rate is seldom below 30 per cent. I visited some 
reserves where it was somewhere between 60 and 70 per cent. 
The only people who had jobs were those who were employed by 
band councils and were paid with money provided by the federal 
government. Except for these people, the others are totally 
relying on the government, not by choice, but because they find 
themselves in the ultimate situation of dependency and isolatin. 
They cannot get out of it under the present Indian Act. I will 
explain later how it would be possible to do so.
<P>
	Over a period of ten years, the number of native people aged 
19 increased 80 per cent; it did so in a situation of dependency, 
in the field of education among others. This situation puts 
enormous pressure on the education system.
<P>
	I frequently receive First Nations people in my office who tell 
me that they cannot pay for the education of some children on 
these reserves, because they simply do not have the money to do 
that. They do not have the money, because the population under 
19 years of age is growing at such a fast pace that the budgets 
cannot keep up. So, we will be faced with a problem not only in 
the education and health sectors, but in all the activities 
affecting our First Nations.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8367"> 8367 </A></B>
<P>
	The rate of the native population growth has been increasing 
regularly since 1983 and has now reached 60 per cent, twice the 
rate of population growth for all of Canada. So, it is normal that 
the budgets will be getting increasingly tighter and more 
difficult to manage. The youth population is growing at such a 
breathtaking pace that young Natives cannot attend school and 
receive the same education that any other Canadian can enjoy.
<P>
	Housing is also a problem. We addressed this issue last week 
during the debate on a private member's motion. Right now, we 
are 40,000 housing units short in all of Canada. This whole 
situation, as I said last week, was decried by the Auditor 
General, according to whom health and education related costs 
are staggering and sky-high, because these people live in 
undesirable and unhealthy conditions.
<P>
	In fact, the Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, and I will come 
back to this issue later, stated in 1992 that 50 per cent of all 
housing units on reserves were practically unfit to live in. So, 
the housing policy needs to be reexamined. Unfortunately, it is 
not being reviewed. We are always told that there is the deficit 
and the budget is tight, but in the meantime people continue to 
live in crowded housing. The houses are inadequate and do not 
respect the Indian culture, but what is worse is that you can find 
up to four generations living under the same roof, as I have seen 
for myself. I think that is unacceptable in our society.
<P>
	Budget decrease for native programs and services.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	We know that the answer, and I am getting around to it, as I 
promised earlier, is for aboriginal people to take responsibility 
for their own affairs through more self-government and jointly 
administered programs, for instance. Normally, the government 
provides special allowances for aboriginal people so they can 
prepare their negotiations.
<P>
	However, there has been a 7 per cent decline in the amounts 
allocated under these programs over the past few years. We have 
a situation where aboriginal people have to negotiate with a 
party that can afford the best lawyers and the best consultants. 
The federal government comes to the negotiating table in a 
position of strength, and the First Nations who want to face this 
impressive federal adversary are told: ``Listen, we cannot 
subsidize your preparations for the negotiating process. You 
will have to make the best of it''. I think the situation is even 
being used as a way to get a cheaper deal in negotiations with 
First Nations. I think that is also unacceptable.
<P>
	I discussed at length the relative decline in subsidies for 
aboriginal housing. Of course, health problems, especially in 
connection with housing, are pretty obvious. As I said earlier, 
the Auditor General has been critical of the situation on many 
occasions. So that is not the answer.
<P>
	What can we say about the participation of aboriginal people 
in the Canadian economy? So far, there has been a policy of 
exclusion. Only one statistic has gone up: welfare payments. In 
fact, that is something Quebec has criticized on many occasions. 
We represent 25 per cent of Canada's economy through our taxes 
and we never get the equivalent back, except in the form of 
welfare or unemployment insurance. We do not think that is the 
answer.
<P>
	The answer to providing for the future of the first nations is 
not to tell them: ``Here is unemployment insurance. Do what 
you can. That is all we are prepared to do''. Obviously, a society 
based on joblessness and unemployment insurance is not a 
society that bodes well for the future, and I think we will have to 
change our approach here.
<P>
	There is a better way to invest this money. But how? Probably 
through self-government. We have had a few examples in the 
Yukon. We had examples with the Sahtu Tribal Council in the 
Northwest Territories. Probably the first example we had in 
Canada was the James Bay agreement. If we look at the living 
conditions of the Cree in Northern Quebec today, I think there is 
probably not a single first nation in Canada that has reached the 
degree of economic development we see here, where the Cree 
have become quite wealthy, although I agree, they are not riding 
around in Mercedes.
<P>
	In any case, a Mercedes would not be very useful on a Cree 
reserve. They would be better off with a snowmobile. In any 
case, compared with other first nations in Canada, these people 
would probably be the first to agree that the James Bay 
agreement was a model of its kind and that self-government 
gave them the tools for their economic development. This is 
proof that self-government is the way to go.
<P>
	If I look at my Quebec counterpart, who is the Premier, since 
he is dealing himself with aboriginal affairs, he is also 
contemplating a new way of doing things: joint management. I 
talked about it earlier. At one point in time in the history of 
Canada and Quebec, we told these people: ``Go live on a small 
piece of land, and of course it was often an unwanted piece of 
land, and we will pay for all the costs''.
<P>
	As of now, the Quebec government is thinking about a 
different approach, that of joint management. Therefore, in 
Quebec, probably with a bigger land base in mind, they will 
examine the possibility for these people to get part of the 
royalties for natural resources, among other things.
<P>
	This is an example where not only native people will have a 
responsibility towards natural resources, but they will also have 
the opportunity to create their own wealth and give work to their 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8368"> 8368 </A></B>
<P>
own people. Putting people to work is very important because it 
promotes pride. The right to work is there for everyone in 
Canada and Quebec and it should also exist for First Nations.
<P>
	There are a few solutions. For example, the Minister of 
Finance says that everybody will have to participate in the 
effort.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	I look at people of Third World countries and native people of 
Canada and Quebec and I say they have one thing in common, 
their despair. Some situations are absolutely outrageous. I said it 
before and gave a few examples, but I have others right here. 
Inadequate housing. I spoke at length about housing, but allow 
me to mention that overcrowding is 16 times higher for native 
people than for Canadians in general. The infant mortality rate is 
four times higher. The suicide rate among young people is six 
times higher. Life expectancy is eight years shorter for natives 
than for other Canadians.
<P>
	The imprisonment rate is astronomical. In a given city where 
natives may represent 5 per cent of the population, you will find 
that as much as 25 or 30 per cent of the inmate population is 
aboriginal. That is an enormous problem. There are also 
problems of alcoholism and drug addiction. Finally, we can 
realize that, for the First Nations, the solution no longer lies in 
dependency, but that does not justify the minister in making all 
kinds of cuts there. It does justify maintaining the amounts 
going towards their safety net, such as social programs, and 
directing these amounts towards self-government and resource 
distribution.
<P>
	Once again, I thank my colleague from 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot for giving me the opportunity to speak 
on behalf of the aboriginal nations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
noticed how you listened carefully to the description that my 
colleague from Saint-Jean just gave about native people. It 
needs no comments. With his statistics on their housing, health 
and education problems, he gave a very real picture of the 
situation. Of course, we realized then that unemployment was 
very high. Here again, we see that the reforms about to be 
introduced always go after the same people-the unemployed 
and the poor.
<P>
	It is hard to ask a question following such a presentation. I 
will simply ask the hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, 
who made a very impressive presentation that also struck me, to 
convey, besides the message he sent earlier, this message about 
native people to his Liberal caucus and to Cabinet. Given the 
presentation we just heard, I am sure that he will be able to make 
this reality sink in and that he will be listened to carefully by his 
caucus.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before resuming debate I 
want to verify whether there are any more questions or 
comments to the hon. member. I must advise the House that 
following the intervention from the official opposition the next 
group of eligible speakers would be from the government side. 
If someone rises from the government side he or she will partake 
in debate. Then of course we will continue and refer to the 
opposite side of the House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank you for 
giving me the floor. I cannot help it if I am also interested in the 
native issue. I may have been faster on my feet than the 
government members. People in this chamber will draw their 
own conclusion.
<P>
	The point I would like to raise today for the benefit of the 
finance minister, and I would like the member for Saint-Jean to 
comment on this, is the appalling situation of the native people 
that my colleague referred to. These people have their pride.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	They said so to the committee on fisheries and oceans. They 
want the tools that would enable them to help themselves. My 
colleague for Saint-Jean pointed out their appalling situation 
but, on the other hand, the native people are asking us, in other 
committees, to give them the tools to help themselves.
<P>
	I know that my colleague also met some First Nations 
regarding this issue. I would like to hear his comments on this. I 
know that it is difficult to settle this matter. Right now, I have no 
authority to do it, but the minister opposite does.
<P>
	However, I would like my colleague for Saint-Jean to 
describe, first, how native people could help themselves in the 
fisheries area.
<P>
	Second, he mentioned that the average native family income 
was $7,480. I would like to hear more about this. I know that, 
last week, the member for Saint-Jean asked the minister a 
question, but the minister did not say when nor how the situation 
will be remedied.
<P>
	The cost of food in remote areas was also mentioned. I do not 
know if my colleague has more information on this topic, but I 
would like him to ask the government some pointed questions on 
this subject.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bachand: </B>Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my 
colleague for giving me this opportunity to explain how we 
might be able to deal with the issue of fisheries, which is typical.
<P>
	I think that the problem with the Minister of Indian Affairs 
and Northern Development or the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans, is that they decide on programs here, in Ottawa, without 
ever going in the field to see how these programs are experi-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8369"> 8369 </A></B>
<P>
enced, to see the level of poverty the aboriginal people live in. 
Were they to do so they would find that aboriginal people often 
have the  solution to their problems. Decisions are taken in 
Ottawa, but the solution is self-government. We have to give 
aboriginal peoples the opportunity to take matters into their own 
hands, to develop windows of opportunity which will pull them 
out of the dependency they have been kept in for 125 years.
<P>
	They were always told: ``Do not worry, we will give you 
money''. That does not solve the problems. The government 
committed itself to some movement in this area, but I am 
anxious to see how they are going to switch from talk to action.
<P>
	In the Far North, another very good example mentioned by my 
colleague, the minister said last week that he had reached his 
objective, he had made me 60 per cent federalist on the issue of 
financing in the Far North. I know, Mr. Speaker, at 2.15 p.m. it is 
Question Period, not Answer Period. Still, I would have liked a 
more accurate answer. I know that the federal government 
spends $14 million in the Far North, but the grocery basket is 
still double what we pay here. The costs are twice what they are 
here, but the salaries are probably about half.
<P>
	I went to Iqaluit and I made a speech on food distribution in 
the Far North. I took Madam the Acting Speaker shopping in the 
Northern Store in Iqaluit. I made a note of the prices. The pack 
of three one-litre bags of milk was $12, while here it costs only 
$5 or $6 and we earn twice as much as they do.
<P>
	There are solutions and they all involve self-government of 
aboriginal people. The Bloc Quebecois will support any 
government initiative in this regard. I join the hon. member for 
Chicoutimi in urging the hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce to promote this idea among government 
members. We must not alter social programs, especially not 
social programs geared to native people.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Susan Whelan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the motion we are 
debating today reads: ``That this House take note of the opinions 
expressed by Canadians on the budgetary policy of the 
government''. The reason we are having this debate is because 
of the foresight of the Minister of Finance who in his February 
1994 budget launched the most extensive prebudget 
consultations in the history of the country for the 1995 budget.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	In unveiling a new economic framework for the government 
known as the purple book on October 17 the Minister of Finance 
has identified five key areas: improving skills; adjusting to 
change; making government more productive; providing 
economic leadership; and getting the nation's finances in order.
<P>
	The finance minister also released a second paper known as 
the grey book on October 18. It outlines the current state of 
federal finances fulfilling a 1994 budget commitment. The 
finance minister has made available to all Canadians through the 
offices of their MPs copies of a workbook prepared by the 
Canadian Foundation for Economic Education. This is a 
national non-partisan, non-profit organization with a history of 
efforts to promote economic understanding among Canadians.
<P>
	According to the preface of the booklet the goal of the 
workbook is: ``to provide you with background information that 
might be useful as you consider the issues and options that face 
Canada. We have tried to clarify the government's views so that 
you can decide whether you agree or disagree with the 
government''.
<P>
	The workbook poses questions such as: what should be 
priority areas for cuts; which government services should direct 
users pay a larger share; how can we deal with potential effects 
on other levels of government; and what is the right balance 
between cutting spending and raising more revenues.
<P>
	The finance minister will not be able to read all the responses 
submitted but he will read a representative sample and a 
summary report of all the responses. As well, all responses will 
be reviewed by a team of officials in the department that will 
pass on to the minister any that are exceptional or unique. I 
encourage all Canadians to take the time to work through the 
book.
<P>
	To support the minister's efforts the House of Commons 
finance committee has also travelled across Canada to listen to 
Canadians' proposals. In my riding I held a prebudget 
consultation meeting in order that the views of the constituents 
of Essex-Windsor could be submitted to the finance 
committee. I will be holding a second prebudget consultation 
meeting on Tuesday, January 17 in Essex, Ontario at 7 p.m. in 
the county council chambers to allow my constituents another 
opportunity to participate in the prebudget consultations and to 
respond to the finance committee's report.
<P>
	In my opinion there are basically four things that can be done 
to address the national debt when considering a national budget. 
First, total government revenues can increase as a result of 
economic growth. Growth in sales and in income generate more 
tax revenues. Second, total government expenses can decrease 
due to economic growth. For example if more people are 
working and fewer people are collecting unemployment 
insurance or welfare then government expenses decrease. Third, 
total government revenues can be increased by changes in tax 
policy. Tax rates can be increased and more items can be taxed. 
Fourth, total government expenses can be reduced by cutting 
government spending.
<P>
	Two years ago the current finance minister, then the finance 
critic for the Liberal Party, addressed these four points by 
arguing that there are only two tracks that can be followed to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8370"> 8370 </A></B>
<P>
tackle the national debt. The first track is to stimulate economic 
growth which increases revenues  and decreases expenditures. 
The second track is to reduce government spending and/or 
increase taxes.
<P>
	The minister correctly argued that to deal with the national 
debt government would have to address both tracks. The reason 
the former government's fiscal plan did not work is that it 
concentrated on the second track, increasing taxes and cutting 
programs while economic policies pushed the country into a 
recession which led to a reduction in economic growth. The end 
result was that the deficit remained relatively untouched.
<P>
	In order to prepare for this debate I held a prebudget 
consultation session in LaSalle, Ontario. As well I have received 
hundreds of letters on the budget. I would like to report to the 
House the views expressed. I want my constituents to know I 
may not agree with all the suggestions but nevertheless I think it 
is important that they be reported. The proposals put forward by 
the constituents of Essex-Windsor at that meeting fall into the 
four categories outlined above and they do address both tracks.
<P>
	To increase revenues and decrease expenditures through 
economic growth my constituents suggested that money needs 
to be spent in research and development to ensure growth in jobs 
and to ensure current jobs. They also suggested that eliminating 
RRSPs will hurt Canadian businesses as investments in stocks 
and mutual funds will be made offshore. This in turn will lead to 
slower economic growth.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	They thought that taxing health benefits may be 
counterproductive. If people opt out of health plans then they 
will be sicker when they seek treatment. This will increase the 
cost of health care as more people are hospitalized and 
hospitalized longer. They also thought that cutbacks on health 
care can lead to increased health care costs in the long run. For 
example, in funding on education and research for AIDS, every 
person in which AIDS is prevented by education saves $100,000 
in health care costs.
<P>
	They also thought that we should be negotiating with the civil 
service. Federal employees account for only a small part of the 
government's budget. A result of the cuts has been poor morale 
which has not led to more efficient service. An efficient public 
service is also required to produce economic growth.
<P>
	To tackle the national debt through changes in tax policy, 
constituents had a considerable number of suggestions. They 
suggested that RRSPs should not be eliminated as not only do 
they shelter income but they are responsible ways for planning 
for retirement. Responsible retirement planning will save the 
government money in the long run.
<P>
	They also thought the government should eliminate the 
business entertainment tax deduction and that it should focus 
more on the underground economy as a source of revenue.
<P>
	They thought that banks should pay higher taxes and that the 
GST problem should be fixed. They believed and were told when 
it was introduced that it was supposed to generate revenues to 
pay down the national debt. They also want the government to 
collect outstanding taxes. They believe that Canada's tax system 
should be reformed.
<P>
	Most of the recommendations made dealt with the fourth 
option, when drawing up a budget in the face of such a large 
government debt: where and where not to cut. The constituents 
of Essex-Windsor made the following suggestions. We could 
reform MPs pensions, eliminate double dipping in the public 
service, reduce government overlap, allow legislation of whistle 
blowing so the waste of public resources can be reported, and 
eliminate the Federal Business Development Bank. A federal 
employee suggested looking at reducing the civil servant forced 
benefit package instead of reducing the number of federal 
employees. They want to reform Canada's social security 
programs.
<P>
	Many of the items my constituents raised are ones this 
government is addressing. I would like to take a moment to 
address those. I started off my statement today by noting that the 
finance minister believes that we follow both tracks to tackle the 
problem of the deficit and the national debt. The minister's first 
budget demonstrates that belief and as a result of that the 
economy is growing.
<P>
	Canada's economic performance in recent months has been 
very encouraging. I will repeat what I stated earlier today. There 
is real growth at 6.4 per cent in the second quarter, far 
outstripping the performance of any other G-7 country. Retail 
sales are up in the third quarter and up 7.8 per cent over last year. 
Real exports are up 5.6 per cent in the third quarter which is a 
record level and the fastest growth since 1983.
<P>
	Employment is up by 307,000 jobs since January and these are 
all full time jobs. Employment growth in recent months has been 
the most rapid in almost six years. The unemployment rate has 
fallen from 11.4 per cent in January to 10 per cent in October. 
The help wanted index is up 2.1 per cent in October and stands 
16.5 per cent above the pre-election level.
<P>
	This economic growth pays dividends and has helped reduce 
the deficit. Over April to August the deficit is $4.5 billion lower 
than in the same period in 1993-94. Furthermore, it is results 
like these that lead the IMF to project that Canada will have the 
strongest growth in output and the highest rate of growth in 
employment in all the G-7 economies in both 1994 and 1995.
<P>
	Another suggestion made at my LaSalle meeting was that the 
business entertainment tax deduction should be eliminated. It 
should be noted that the government's last budget reduced this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8371"> 8371 </A></B>
<P>
deduction from 80 per cent to 50 per  cent. It also suggested that 
government revenues should be increased by clamping down on 
the underground economy.
<P>
	In terms of the underground economy it is important to note 
that 95 per cent of all taxes are paid voluntarily. However, 
enforcement activities are also expected to add $3.8 billion to 
tax assessed in the fiscal year 1994-95. Revenue Canada's 
underground economy initiative alone will result in $750 
million in additional taxes assessed before the fiscal year is 
over.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	Another point raised by constituents dealt with the question of 
uncollected taxes. It should be noted that this money does not 
represent an untapped source of funds for the government to 
apply against the deficit.
<P>
	As I told the Canadian Tax Foundation's annual meeting on 
November 23, 1994, these moneys will be collected with 
interest except where there are legitimate reasons to adjust the 
assessment such as additional information provided by the 
taxpayer or an error in the original assessment.
<P>
	As I noted above, constituents suggested reducing 
government duplication and reforming social security as two 
means of addressing the deficit. The government is currently 
reviewing both social security and all government programs to 
ensure the most productive and efficient services for Canadians.
<P>
	In addition to holding a consultation meeting, I also receive 
hundreds of letters from constituents in my riding offering their 
suggestions and comments. Two resounding themes were heard 
over and over ahead: first, that governments must cut spending; 
second, that painful measures that are implemented must be fair, 
equitable and not betray former trusts or commitments that 
governments made to Canadians.
<P>
	On the first theme, there is recognition and an understanding 
that the debt and deficit must be reduced. Canadians understand 
that our total provincial and federal debt is approximately $700 
billion. Furthermore, they recognize that if we want to pay off 
all our debt, both federal and provincial today, we would need 
more than $24,000 for every man, woman and child in Canada.
<P>
	This figure is ominous, as well it should be. To further put it 
into perspective, they realize that interest costs on our federal 
debt alone are rising by $85,000 per minute. Last year, more 
Canadian tax dollars were used to pay interest on the debt than 
were spent on any other area, more than was spent on health 
care, welfare or programs for seniors, far more than was spent to 
run the entire federal government.
<P>
	We spent $38 billion in interest payments on the debt. In 
comparison, we spent and paid $7.6 billion in UI transfers and 
$19.9 billion in transfers for seniors. Furthermore, our net 
foreign indebtedness is 44 per cent of our gross domestic 
product. It is the highest of all the G-7 countries. Italy comes 
second at 11.6 per cent and United States foreign debt is 8.7 per 
cent of GDP.
<P>
	The workbook released by the Canadian Foundation for 
Economic Education states our problems best. In 1993-94, our 
deficit was virtually all interest payments, $38 billion of a $42 
billion deficit. In 1994-95, this current fiscal year, our entire 
deficit will be due to interest payments on a debt. If things 
persist we will leave the next generation and future generations 
an extraordinary burden, a burden that would likely guarantee 
they experience a lower standard of living than those who 
preceded them and incurred the debt. It will be like leaving a 
mortgage still to be paid but no house to show for it.
<P>
	A resounding theme that permeated from the numerous letters 
I received from my constituents was a plea to reduce 
government spending. So grave is the problem that many in their 
letters wrote: ``I have never written a letter to any member of 
Parliament before but I feel it is necessary that representatives 
in government realize that we have had enough taxes and ask 
that spending be reduced co-operatively with the provinces''.
<P>
	One of my constituents could not have expressed the problem 
clearer. He wrote: ``I am pleading with you to understand that 
new taxes are not the solution. Please reduce government 
spending drastically. If I am not making enough money to live 
the way I want to, it is up to me to come up with more money or 
change my lifestyle. That is my responsibility. I expect the 
government to change its spending style''.
<P>
	Another constituents wrote: ``In hard times we do not have to 
give money away so freely. We should not give interest groups 
handouts at the drop of a hat. If all this nonsense was cut off we 
could probably do away with the GST. That money was 
supposed to pay off the debt and nobody seems to know where 
this money goes''.
<P>
	The second theme was the belief that painful measures that 
are implemented must be fair, equitable and not betray former 
trusts or commitments that governments made to Canadians. 
Along this line I received hundreds of letters on the issue of 
RRSPs. The message was: ``When RRSPs were introduced, the 
government promised us that we would be taxed in the future 
when we used that money. Now I am shocked that you are 
considering breaking this commitment we both made to our 
combined future''.

<P>
<B>(1720 ) </B>
<P>
	Further expanding on this theme the president of the 
Windsor-Essex County chapter of the Canadian Association of 
Retired Persons, known as CARP, stated: ``Historically 
governments have encouraged Canadians to save for their 
retirement by investing in RRSPs. This has not only provided a 
tax deferral on earned income but has also allowed these 
contributions to grow tax free until such time as the funds were 
withdrawn. Now that millions of Canadians are using this 
investment strategy it would be a serious breach of trust to now 
start taxing RRSP contributions and earned interest prior to 
withdrawal''.
<P>
	The possible taxation of dental plans was also expressed as a 
matter of treating all people fairly. One constituent wrote: 
``Dental plans definitely assist individuals and families to visit 
dental offices on a regular basis for preventive dental 
procedures and dental treatment when required. To tax dental 
plan benefits would result in less net income for my family and 
myself because I have a dental insurance plan. I think that is 
unfair. I am sure that many people like myself will have to 
consider whether to continue their dental plan and be taxed or 
discontinue their dental plan and not be taxed. Without my 
dental plan I know my dental health will suffer but I remain 
unconvinced that this tax will provide the economic impact that 
the government is banking on. Don't betray a trust. Don't tax 
health''.
<P>
	Sustainable economic growth can only be achieved through 
solid planning and real productivity and growth. In the purple 
book the minister stated that productivity growth is the 
foundation of economic progress and must therefore be the 
primary focus of economic policy. A more productive economy 
is the only dependable route to more and better jobs for 
Canadians.
<P>
	Research and development can assist in this goal. Between 
1974 and 1993 employment in industries which use high 
technology grew almost three times as fast as in those that use 
low technology. It is estimated that almost half of the new jobs 
that are likely to be created during this decade will require more 
than 16 years of formal education and training combined. 
Government must maintain research and development in all 
areas.
<P>
	Especially in my area one area of concern that has been 
brought to my attention is agricultural research and 
development. Without the agricultural research and 
development in my area, for example, Essex county would not 
have several flourishing wineries as it does today. It is important 
that we continue to promote such research and development.
<P>
	In conclusion, these prebudget consultations have offered my 
constituents a forum for expressing their opinions and concerns. 
In summarizing their statements today the two recurring themes 
are that we need balance and we need fairness in the cuts which 
we make. That in my opinion is the answer. The 1995 budget 
must be fair for all Canadians. Only then will it be accepted.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
listened to the hon. government member with great interest and I 
would like to tell her that the deficit we are currently 
experiencing was initially caused by the Liberals in previous 
years and then fed by this deficit caused by the Conservatives. 
So, the two old parties are equally responsible for the economic 
disaster we are now faced with.
<P>
	The member delivered a speech fit for the Canadian Club or 
an audience of scholars at a university. Now I think that the 
House of Commons is a place where things have to be put in 
pragmatic and practical terms. Her speech was packed with lip 
service, with pious wishes as to what the government could do. 
However, the people do not want to know what the government 
could do, but rather what it will do to resolve the problem. That 
is what matters. Any member of this House can rise and say fine 
words that do not add up to much and I was very disappointed.
<P>
	The people of Canada and Quebec expect from government 
that it take its responsibilities, but we have been denied this 
from day one by the government across the way.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	We will recall, Mr. Speaker, that at the time the red book came 
out, we were supposed to be able to find all the answers in it. As 
it turns out, after all these consultations and delays, this 
government is no further ahead than it was a year ago, the reason 
being that it does not know what to do. It keeps delaying and 
delaying and delaying. The people of Canada want answers now.
<P>
	The problem is that in the 1970s, this Liberal government 
took steps to distribute wealth, which in itself was very 
commendable, but now, it is distributing the deficit. I would like 
my hon. colleague to tell me how the government intends to 
distribute the deficit, all the while ensuring that the 
underprivileged, the poor and the middle class will not be 
targeted as the ones having to pay the greatest part of this deficit.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Whelan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I feel that first I must reply to the 
comments made by the hon. member with regard to my 
constituents.
<P>
	As I stated several times in my speech today, my constituents 
came to a prebudget consultation meeting and hundreds of 
constituents wrote to me. I felt it was my duty to present their 
views today. Those are the views of my constituents, not my 
views, with regard to the majority of the speech I made today. I 
think it is only proper and fair that the constituents of 
Essex-Windsor have the same rights as constituents in other 
provinces. They wanted those rights and that is what I put 
forward today.
<P>

<P>
	With regard to the problem of the deficit and trying to put the 
blame on the Liberal government of the 1970s, I would like to 
remind the hon. member that in the late 1970s and the early 
1980s we had a recession in Canada. Everyone knows that you 
can expect to have a higher deficit during recessionary times. 
However, the 1980s, during the previous Tory government, 
should have been a time to curtail spending and bring down the 
deficit. It was not. It increased spending.
<P>
	To try and blame the Liberals of the 1970s I think is a very 
poor effort on behalf of the hon. member, when everyone knows 
that during economic growth, which we are experiencing now, it 
is the time to cut spending and get our finances under control. 
That is not what happened during the 1980s when the Tory 
government had the opportunity.
<P>
	I do not believe we should blame past governments. We 
should be giving credit to this government and to the Minister of 
Finance for undertaking this effort to allow Canadians to 
express their opinions and to allow for this debate today and in 
the future. It allows us an opportunity to put forward views and 
ideas and allows all Canadians to have input. That is what is 
happening. That is what this government started and it is 
unprecedented.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to thank the member for her speech. I wonder if she could 
clarify something that caught my interest in the previous 
question. We talked about who is responsible for deficits.
<P>
	The province of Quebec has the highest provincial deficit of 
all provincial governments. It represents $9,400 for every man, 
woman and child in that province. Of this debt, 40 per cent is 
owed outside the province of Quebec and outside Canada. It is 
owed to foreigners.
<P>
	Interestingly enough, I went back and discovered that over the 
last seven years of the PQ administration it raised deficits in that 
province by 285 per cent at a time when transfer payments from 
the federal government actually increased to the province of 
Quebec. After the PQ government, I think in 1985, the deficit 
continued to increase but less than half the increase occurred 
while the current premier of Quebec was the minister of finance.
<P>
	I wonder if the member could possibly give some comments 
on the previous speaker's dissertation about how all the debts 
have been created by the federal government.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Whelan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
intervention. I would like to expand on that.
<P>
	We all know that every government, whether it be provincial 
or federal, has a responsibility. We know that the debt, as I stated 
today, of $700 billion is both a federal and provincial number. 
There are a number of provinces that need to get their financial 
houses in order. If the finance ministers of all provinces were to 
follow the example of the federal Minister of Finance, we would 
have a more open process across the nation. That would be 
wonderful.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	As I stated earlier, one problem today with our debt is the fact 
that over 44 per cent of it is foreign owned. With the problems 
developing in other provinces, as my hon. colleague pointed out, 
we have to get control of it both federally and provincially. The 
consultation process, openness in asking Canadians for their 
input and listening to their ideas is the way to do it.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I wonder if I may seek 
some assistance from the House. If members are splitting their 
time would they please indicate it to the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I advise the House that I am splitting the time with my 
colleague. I will take 10 minutes.
<P>
	I am pleased to rise today to take part in this important debate 
on budgetary policy. I think it was Will Rogers in talking about 
the weather many years ago who said: ``Everyone talks about it 
but nobody does anything about it''.
<P>
	We are doing a lot of talking about it today. I heard some very 
sensible things being said in the House and some not so sensible. 
I wonder what the fallout from all that will be. Will someone 
actually do something about it? Is the Minister of Finance 
listening to the words being said in the House, or does he have 
some staff available to sift through it all and separate the wheat 
from the chaff? I hope something is being done because some 
words of value are being spoken here today.
<P>
	Government policy in this whole area, as restated last 
Thursday in the House by the Secretary of State for International 
Financial Institutions, is to bring the deficit down to 3 per cent 
of the GDP. This is not an acceptable policy. Many financial 
experts have stated it. The C. D. Howe Institute is urging the 
government to move faster in the area of deficit reduction. There 
are some signs the Minister of Finance is getting the message, 
but I do not know if he has it all yet.
<P>
	The policy of simply taking 3 per cent of the GDP as the target 
is unacceptable. It would leave us with an $25 billion deficit 
annually in a couple of years. It is unacceptable for another 
reason. In response to a question from one of my colleagues on 
Thursday, the same secretary of state stated that while their 
fiscal policy was to reduce the deficit to 3 per cent of GDP it was 
only an interim target. That can be good news and bad news. 
What will the final target be?
<P>
	How does the government expect to inspire economic 
confidence when its fiscal policy is geared only toward an 
interim target? This is not acceptable to the financial markets. 
This is not acceptable to Canadian taxpayers. Both expect more 
from the government than a vague financial policy based solely 
on an interim target.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8374"> 8374 </A></B>
<P>
	I am beginning to think that not only is it an interim target; it 
is a moving target. The statement of the Reform Party on targets 
indicates that we have to target our spending. I heard statements 
in the House today that social spending should be preserved for 
those in need. I totally agree. We should target our spending to 
those who need it, not those who do not need it.
<P>
<B>(1735 ) </B>
<P>
	Last week Reform finance critics released a paper detailing 
about $10 billion worth of cuts. It was quite a worthwhile paper. 
I will not go over it all but I remind the House that last week the 
Reform proposed that people at the top of government must be 
the first to make visible and significant sacrifices such as 
reforming the pension plan of MPs.
<P>
	Last week in the House a private member's bill was proposed 
to reform the plan and the government and other members voted 
against it. They did not want reform if it was going to cost them 
money.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cannis:</B> Read the red book.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> That is unacceptable. I have read the red ink 
book.
<P>
	The Secretary of State for International Financial Institutions 
described the paper brought in by the Reform as containing 
positive suggestions. It is refreshing the hon. minister 
recognizes the value of some of the ideas being batted around in 
the House.
<P>
	I remind everyone of the precarious situation of our country. 
We have a debt at the federal level of $530 billion or $540 
billion. We are increasing that debt. As of this year our deficit 
spending looks like another $40 billion, which works out to a 
rate of $110 million each and every day we go deeper into debt. 
It is a serious problem. The public at large in Canada is finally 
starting to haul it aboard. Certainly the financial institutions 
have hauled it aboard. It is time the government did so.
<P>
	I will touch on one small area today and perhaps two if I have 
time to show what we can do to wrestle with reducing spending. 
I am the critic for official languages. I would like to suggest that 
we can save in the area of $310 million annually. This is not a big 
deal relative to the amount of deficit spending we are going 
through, but if each area can pick up $310 million in a year and 
spread it across the board we can get this thing under control.
<P>
	Because I am talking about savings in the area of official 
languages I know they are waiting across the way to jump all 
over me and tell me how terrible our policies are. Let me 
reiterate with regard to bilingualism and official languages that 
the Reform Party is pro-bilingualism, not anti-bilingualism. 
The more people have French and English the better off we are. 
The more multilingual people in the country the better off we are 
in trade with the Pacific rim, with Europe and around the world. 
We are not anti-bilingualism; we are anti-waste. A  lot of waste 
spending is incurred under the aegis of the Official Languages 
Act. We have to cut that out.
<P>
	Another policy would be to give language and culture to the 
provinces and say they are theirs to take care of; if they want to 
spend money on them they can go ahead and decide to do so. We 
would leave it to the provinces. From the $310 million I am 
talking about we could trim about 30 per cent or $80 million 
from funding for official languages education. We could leave 
that to the provinces, keep the federal government out of it and 
save $80 million. Education, after all, is a provincial 
responsibility and should be left to the provinces like culture 
and language.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	It should also be noted that most of the money is used to fund 
immersion programs. Immersion, especially French immersion 
of youngsters, has been touted by powerful special interest 
groups like Canadian Parents for French as the best means to 
create bilingual children. This is simply untrue. Several studies 
indicate that French immersion, especially at the younger ages, 
has been a failure.
<P>
	Dr. Hector Hammerly of the linguistics department of Simon 
Fraser University has done extensive research in the area and 
has concluded that French immersion is based on a series of 
incorrect assumptions. Rather than producing graduates fluent 
in both languages, it turns out people who he says speak 
frenglish. They speak and write French poorly and they have 
difficulty in English. Dr Hammerly has discovered that core 
French is as effective in producing bilingual graduates as French 
immersion and costs less to operate.
<P>
	Therefore, if we are spending money on something that does 
not work, surely we can afford to cut that spending.
<P>

	I am always available to discuss any problem involving 
bilingualism or French immersion with anyone.

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I regret the 
member's time has lapsed. Possibly he will have the opportunity 
to conclude his remarks within the context of a question or 
comment from a colleague.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I was very interested in the quote from my 
colleague with respect to French immersion. I have worked for a 
number of years in the field of education and have known the 
best experts not only in Canada but throughout the world.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8375"> 8375 </A></B>
<P>
	It was my understanding there was a consensus that the 
immersion model was the best one in terms of learning a second 
language. I am really quite surprised with his assertion. 
However I recognize it is always possible to find someone who 
will disagree with any body of knowledge.
<P>
	Is it true that those educated through the immersion mode 
supposedly do not speak it very well? The studies I have seen 
show that they do as well as their peers do. In fact they very 
often do better even when we throw in factors such as 
socioeconomic status and intelligence.
<P>
	Why is it that people such as I who have French as a first 
language and others who have Greek, Italian or another 
language are able to learn English? They are able to learn their 
own languages and not speak frenglish. I think my English is 
reasonably good.
<P>
	Could the hon. member somehow try to explain to me what 
appears to be a contradiction? Most French speaking people I 
know whose first language is French and most other Canadians 
who have another language as a first language end up speaking 
the English language very well. If that is the case, why should 
English speaking students who have English as a first language 
and learn French not be able to do the same? It does not make a 
whole lot of sense to me. I would certainly like some 
clarification.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> Mr. Speaker, English speaking people are able 
to learn French. There is no difference in brains as I understand 
it. I am trying to tell the hon. member for St. Boniface and 
anyone else who wants to listen that there are problems with 
French immersion training among youngsters. This problem has 
been brought out in a most recent issue of <I>Saturday Night</I> 
magazine. I would be very happy to pass a copy of it to the 
member. I would also be happy to give him a copy of Professor 
Hammerly's book. This evidence of the failure of immersion 
training of youngsters is being swept under the carpet because 
this group of parents for the French language receive a grant of 
$900,000 a year from the federal government. They parlay that 
apparently into more. They are not at all interested in doing 
anything but continue touting immersion training, whatever its 
deficits.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
very attentively to the comments made by my colleague from 
the Reform Party and I think he is right on the issue of early 
language training. However, that is not what I want to talk about. 
What bothers me a little is his proposal to transfer language and 
culture to the provinces.
<P>
	We know full well that if Canada implemented the hon. 
member's proposal at this time-since I have always thought 
that Canada was an artificial country kept together from coast to 
coast to coast by the policy of the two official languages-, we 
would have a problem because we in Quebec have a long 
tradition.
<P>
	As you know, Quebec anglophones have their own elementary 
and secondary schools as well as their own school boards, 
hospitals and universities in and outside Montreal. So this is not 
a problem for Quebec but I think that francophones in the rest of 
Canada would lose all their services, which would be very 
dangerous. I do not know if the hon. member has thought about 
it, but I think that there would be no problem in Quebec but that 
francophones in the rest of Canada would simply lose their 
services. Could he comment on this?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> First of all, we must realize that Quebec already 
has a problem with Bill 101. I believe in Quebecers' generosity 
so there should not be a problem in the future because the people 
themselves will decide what to do and for whom and how much 
to spend. I assure you that the same applies elsewhere in Canada. 
Canadians are quite generous by nature; they care about their 
fellow citizens whatever their origin and will do what is needed 
to protect languages or anything else.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux:</B> That is not the reality.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is truly an 
honour to be able to speak on such an important subject. I would 
like briefly to go back to my involvement and interest in the 
subject of debt and deficit and why I became involved really in 
politics.
<P>
	In 1984 all of us realized that this country had a major 
problem and that we had to deal with it. At that point we were 
$190 billion in debt and we had someone who promised to help 
us get out of that. Of course by 1988 we realized that those 
promises were not going to be kept and that even though we were 
promised with some more time something could be done, an 
awful lot of us said no way, and so the birth of the Reform Party.
<P>
	Basically there were a number of test cases that came for 
where the Canadian public was at. We had the elite and the 
media saying that Charlottetown was the answer to a lot of our 
problems and the Canadian people sent their first message.
<P>
	In 1993 we had another very sound second message sent 
which stated: ``You had better deal with that debt and deficit or 
you know what is going to happen''. The PCs suffered from that. 
To the Liberal's credit they have realized that is exactly where 
people are coming from. We must deal with this and we must do 
it right now.
<P>
	However, when we look back to February 22 of this year that 
probably was the darkest day in this House when we found that 
nothing had changed and that nothing had happened. Now we are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8376"> 8376 </A></B>
<P>
into the fall and winter of 1994 and we now hear that come hell 
or high  water we are going to deal with this debt and deficit. I 
hope that these are not just more words because if so the third 
message will come from the Canadian electorate and that will be 
borne out on the Liberal Party.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	Three per cent of GDP by 1996 or 1997 is just not good 
enough. That is so minor in terms of what has to be done. People 
will not accept that. We have to do things to change. We have to 
show lower taxes so people will have the incentive to spend 
more money and leave their money at home. We need to 
downsize government dramatically. We need to help people help 
themselves. Certainly taxing RRSPs is not the answer to that.
<P>
	We need to get government out of business. We need to stop 
duplication between the provinces and the federal government. 
We need to solve the Quebec problem, the native land claims 
problem. We need to show leadership in areas like the WTO and 
the OAS to name just a few. We need to reform the whole 
government starting with pensions, as we have heard so many 
times. We need to look at many other areas of government to 
reform, not the least being the Senate.
<P>
	Many speakers have dealt with our zero in three plan which 
we have had in place for a number of years and which we have 
now fine tuned. Each of us as critics in our areas has been asked 
to specifically go after the things that affect us most.
<P>
	As the foreign affairs critic I will deal just with that area and 
the sort of deficit reduction that we would see there. As an 
earlier member said, we do not have the specifics, I would like to 
let him know that we have a lot of specifics, certainly more than 
we have heard from the other side.
<P>
	In talking about foreign affairs and how we would do our 
share as part of government to reduce, I would go back to our 
foreign affairs review on which we spent the last seven or eight 
months listening to hundreds of witnesses across the country. 
The strange part was that so often we spent our time dealing in 
an academic exercise, not dealing with any real policy and never 
did we talk about the kind of cost cutting that we would 
recommend to the minister when the time came for his call to 
say here are the cuts that we can make.
<P>
	Instead of asking key questions like what can we afford, what 
should be the priorities in foreign affairs, we conducted major 
discussions as to whether human rights abuses should be 
considered as being grave, severe or serious before Canada 
should respond with positive measures to help.
<P>
	I point out that all of the above words are synonyms and have 
no quantitative or qualitative differences. It was like arguing 
whether the movie ``The Omen'' was frightening, scary or 
horrifying. We spent our time discussing words that really were 
in the area of academia interesting, but in the actual area of 
making a difference not very.
<P>
	As a result while the final report was precisely worded it did 
not deal with some of the key things like how we are going to cut 
our debt, how we are going to reduce our spending and yet still 
try to get the job done.
<P>
	As a result we did put forward a dissenting report on the 
foreign affairs review. Our number one issue that we talked 
about was fiscal responsibility. We pointed out that the report 
had asked for numerous spending increases and had asked for no 
cuts. Not one place did we suggest a cut.
<P>
	Since we found this unacceptable we went ahead with our zero 
in three proposal and said how can we make cuts. Out of that we 
came up with $1.3 billion worth of cuts that we feel are essential 
if we are going to balance that budget.
<P>
	In this proposal we looked at a number of areas. The first one 
was operating expenses of government. In the area of foreign 
affairs and CIDA we have a number of administrative costs. 
There have been cuts in the past.
<P>
<B>(1755 ) </B>
<P>
	If you talk to the bureaucrats, they will tell you that you 
cannot cut any further. In the tough times we are in we have to 
cut further. We do not have a choice. In the unreal world, in the 
utopia that we often hear described around this place, we would 
not have to make those cuts. That utopia does not exist and those 
cuts are necessary. We cannot go on any longer without making 
those cuts.
<P>
	We have to cut government to government aid programs. As 
many members are aware, at our recent convention held here in 
Ottawa we passed a resolution which asked for a tough analysis 
of this whole area of aid. The big thing we cannot avoid is this 
whole aid question as being one of a slush fund for the minister 
or the Prime Minister whenever they travel.
<P>
	I have press releases here that I got today showing again $2 
million here, $80 million there. It is like a slush fund, like when 
we go to a cocktail party we simply hand out a cheque just to 
show what good guys we are. The Canadian people are not going 
to accept that anymore. They want NGOs to handle the aid 
program. They want NGOs who are responsible and who are 
prepared to raise equal funds on a one to one basis. They are not 
prepared for 100 per cent funding any longer. They are asking 
for transparency and an evaluation of the programs they get 
involved with. That would be the way the Reform Party would 
approach that area.
<P>
	I am not saying we would cut foreign aid. I am saying we 
would target it. We would look at it and try to get the best bang 
for the buck. We cannot be all things to all people.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
	The third area we might look at is the whole area of 
international grants. We give a lot of grants and in many cases 
there is no accountability for those. I could go on if I had more 
time to talk about those. Again, the Canadian people are asking 
us to evaluate those international programs and to be sure that 
the money is being spent in the best possible way. We are cutting 
money to our students but we should be looking at what we are 
getting for some of these international grants.
<P>
	As well, we have to take a look at some of the institutions we 
belong to. The policy of the Canadian government has been that 
we have to belong to everything that is international. We belong 
to more organizations where we do not know what they do. 
When the Auditor General took a look at this three years ago he 
could not even find out what the aims of some of these 
organizations we belong to are, who their boards of directors are 
and what they hope to accomplish.
<P>
	What I am saying is that in all areas of government, it does not 
matter what department, we are going to have to make some 
cuts. There is no question about that. We must recognize that and 
we must expect the ministers in each of those departments to 
come up with those kinds of cuts. That is our goal. That is what 
must be our goal. It is what we in this House must all agree on.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I really 
enjoyed the hon. member's speech. I think that it is very 
sensible. He is an opposition member and the opposition's role 
is to ask questions. The role of the government is to find 
solutions and solve problems. I think that the Liberal 
government facing us was not in opposition long enough to 
really prepare for governing, but you know that Canadians, 
outside Quebec and the west, decided that it would be the 
government so it should govern.
<P>
	I would like to discuss something about my colleague's 
speech, his reference to the Quebec problem. Quebec does not 
have a problem; I think that the rest of Canada has a problem, 
because Quebecers will decide freely in a referendum.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	He talked to us about Charlottetown. That accord was a 
historic event which shows us beyond any doubt that Canadians 
and Quebecers voted no, but for entirely opposite reasons. So 
Charlottetown clearly shows the differences between Quebec 
and the rest of Canada.
<P>
	My question for the hon. member, who made a very good 
speech, is this: Is it not time now to see what Quebec wants and 
let Quebec develop fully?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, I certainly did make 
reference to the Quebec problem. Maybe problem is the wrong 
word. I should have said concern.
<P>
	Members know where we come from on that sort of issue is 
that basically we believe the day of two founding nations was 
the case back in history. Now we have 10 equal provinces. We 
have 12 million people in this country whose original language 
is not English or French. Therefore let us get on with it is the 
point. Let us get on and make this country Canadian.
<P>
	We are Canadians. We are proud of it. We want Quebec to be 
part of that. We believe that grassroots Quebecers also want to 
be part of it but they are tired of the old line way of dealing with 
things. They want to deal with things now in 1994 style. That is 
let us deal with the problems, the jobs, the debt, the deficit, the 
criminal justice system. Those are the areas they want to hear 
about.
<P>
	They do not want to hear us talking about this constitutional 
garble. Let us get on with it. Have the referendum. Tell the 
people the facts and then let us get on with it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I would like the member for Red Deer to clarify something for 
me. During his presentation he indicated that taxing RRSPs was 
not the answer. Earlier today one of the members from the 
Reform Party indicated that RRSPs should be taxed. I am a little 
bit confused. Maybe he could clarify.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ramsay:</B> Who?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cannis:</B> Maybe it came from a different fax machine, I do 
not know. The other question I have is this.
<P>
	He indicated chopping, chopping, chopping and this 
government is not coming forth with any proposals. Often the 
Minister of Finance is asked these questions. As custom has it in 
this House at the appropriate time the minister will come forth 
with those answers. Right now, as we all know, we are going 
through the consultation process to hear what the people are 
saying so that we can collect this information and come forth 
with the proposals. I would like clarification on the RRSPs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, the less government we 
can have and the more we can let people be responsible for 
themselves, an RRSP is the way to do it. To tax something like 
that, one is saying: ``Hey, we are not even going to let you take 
care of yourself''. Had we stayed out of CPP back in 1965, we 
would have been better off if it was not going to be run like an 
insurance program because look what government did to it.
<P>
	What we are saying is this. Encourage people to take care of 
themselves. The RRSPs are doing that, do not touch them. Do 
not raise taxes. I would be really surprised if anyone over here 
agreed with that.
<P>
	As far as the studies in 1984 we knew we had a problem, $190 
billion in debt and we said: ``Fix it''. Mulroney said: ``I will'' 
and then he chickened out. In 1988 he said: ``Hey, I need a little 
more time. I just did not have enough''. By then we said: 
``You're lying''.  We had an election but people believed him. In 
1993 they did not believe him any more and members saw what 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8378"> 8378 </A></B>
<P>
happened. That is what will happen to anybody else here who 
does not deal with that number one problem.
<P>
	That is why we are losing our jobs. That is why it is not 
working.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I listened with great interest to the vast majority of 
speeches made today. I really appreciated them and I would like 
to briefly summarize the key arguments of each party.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	When Bloc members take the floor, we hear about the deficit. 
We are told that the debt is huge and even more than huge. But 
then, they tell us not to change anything because if we do we will 
create problems-I think we understand that-the big problem 
of course being Canada. This is the essence of the Bloc's 
message.
<P>
	The notion that Quebec could be a problem was rejected by 
these people, but they were quick to say that Canada is the major 
problem. I do not think it is the case and people should be honest 
about this issue. The fact is that, for years, we spent a lot of 
money; now, we all have a big problem on our hands and we all 
have a responsibility to try to find solutions together.
<P>
	I appreciate listening to speeches made by Reform Party 
members.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The main thrust is cut. It is easy. It is so simple to bring in a 
balanced budget. It is not difficult. I did it as a former deputy 
minister. You have to realize, and I think my colleagues do but 
they will not admit it, that whenever you cut something there are 
victims at the other end.
<P>
	For example, when we talk about cutting aid to other countries 
we forget that there are potential victims there. We would like to 
make Canadians believe we do that out of the goodness of our 
hearts. Let us be honest. We get a lot in return. We also add to our 
own security when we do that. Let us be fair when we talk about 
whatever it is that we are going to do, to cut or to add or to 
subtract. Let us be fair. Let us share the impact.
<P>
	I was really shocked, Mr. Speaker, and I think you noticed it 
when the colleague previous to the last, and perhaps he did not 
see it that way, attacked Canadian Parents For French, which is a 
very honourable organization. The suggestion was that because 
they get some assistance from government that they go on 
promoting immersion as opposed to believing that immersion is 
the appropriate model.
<P>
	You will remember, Mr. Speaker, that I said that there are 
roughly seven million French speaking Canadians whose first 
language is French and there are probably 12 million others 
whose first language is other than French. We all learned 
English in an immersion setting. In fact we have learned it so 
well that some of us speak English better than we do our own 
native tongue.
<P>
	I reject completely the whole hypothesis that immersion is not 
effective. I reject it totally. I have already made a call to look at 
the most recent research. If I am wrong I will come back and I 
will tell the member.
<P>
	It is easy to come in here and make those kinds of accusations. 
Take one <I>Saturday Night</I> magazine article and that is it. That is 
not good enough. It is absolutely and totally unfair to attack a 
group of responsible Canadians who have been working for 
years to give their children the best of all possible educations 
and then just slough it off on one reference, one supposed expert.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Well, I better change gears because, frankly, it upsets me 
when I think about the exaggerated and insensitive comments 
which were made.
<P>
	I want to say a word on the consultation process. As you know, 
before undertaking that process, about a month ago, the minister 
and his department had the good sense of providing us with a 
number of documents on economic development in Canada, in 
times of deficit, debt, et cetera, so that we would have a 
background, based on facts, to better understand the problem. 
As you well know, the finance committee started to travel 
throughout Canada to consult the people, to find out what 
Canadians think of this pre-budget consultation process and 
what they think about the cuts, the taxes, et cetera.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance himself has gone to a great number of 
Canadian cities to attend all kinds of meetings where he listened 
to people who expressed their concerns and then he told all 
members of Parliament, not only members from his party, but all 
the members, to feel free to share with him their views on the 
budget.
<P>
	I think this is an initiative that deserves to be supported. When 
I heard someone say that these were phoney consultations, I 
found that allegation insensitive and unfair. I think it is really 
very ill-considered to claim that the Minister of Finance has 
undertaken pro forma consultations.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	Frankly, people who make such statements are going too far. I 
am only a private member, but I have had the opportunity to talk 
with some of my colleagues, with businessmen and women, as 
well as a number of constituents not only in my riding of St. 
Boniface, but throughout Canada, and here is what I found out.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8379"> 8379 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	After having talked not only with my own constituents and 
having had a number of meetings with them, but having chatted 
with Canadians across the country, here are some of the things 
that I have found, noted and shared with the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Surprise, surprise, surprise, virtually everyone I talked to said 
they were taxed too much. I suppose I would probably agree 
with that. Interestingly enough, they wanted to see how our 
taxation rate compared to that of other countries and particularly 
those countries that are major trading partners such as the U.S., 
Japan and a number of other countries. They also felt that if one 
was a wealthy person one had the means to avoid paying one's 
fair share of taxes. These are impressions, opinions and views 
they shared with me.
<P>
	They also believed, rather passionately I might add, that rich 
Canadians should not be allowed to pay no or few taxes. 
Whether or not this is totally true is not the issue. The issue is 
that these people believed it. They also believed the same thing 
of what they call rich corporations.
<P>
	There was a bit of a problem when they were asked to define 
rich. They could not agree too quickly as to what the definition 
might be. However, they were really annoyed that banks 
supposedly, according to their perception, do not pay a 
sufficient amount of taxes. I think banks would probably 
disagree with that. In fact I have met some bankers who have, 
but that was the perception by Canadians.
<P>
	I have more. They wanted loopholes blocked. These are 
Canadians from different walks of life who do not have loophole 
opportunities. They really feel that many of those loopholes are 
not there in order to assist Canada and Canadians generally but 
that they are there in order to assist those who have more. They 
felt that probably in most instances those should be closed.
<P>
	There was also unanimous feeling that people earning profits 
on their investments in Canada can avoid paying Canadian 
taxes. I have been looking into that. Apparently people can make 
money on their investments in Canada. If they shuffle the money 
out they pay less tax if their money is in another country. They 
said: ``If that is so is it really fair that they come and make their 
money in Canada and then take it elsewhere in order to avoid 
paying some of their taxes?'' That is what they believed.
<P>
	There were a number of cases on student loans concerning 
people who are supposedly very wealthy or relatively wealthy 
today who still owe student loans. They have not paid those 
loans. The people are angry because many of them had student 
loans. Many of them today have families with children who have 
student loans. They have paid off their loans and will help their 
children go through college or university.
<P>
	They also had a lot of good, common sense. They said: 
``Clearly, if somebody cannot pay off a student loan why give 
them a hassle? Why go after them? Why not set it aside for the 
time being until they can get their lives financially together and 
then later on, if it straightens out, they can collect?'' There was a 
strong feeling that anyone who today is relatively well off and 
still owes the government money on student loans should pay off 
that student loan and the sooner the better.
<P>
	There has been a lot of discussion today about family trusts. 
These people with whom of I spoke also mentioned it. Whether 
the perception is correct or not, there is a belief that there is a lot 
of money put away in family trusts that is not being taxed at the 
same rate as my own, your own or their own earnings. They felt 
that was wrong.
<P>
	They also asked a number of interesting questions. Is it time 
for this country, supposedly one of the few that does not have an 
inheritance tax, to look and see whether or not that would be a 
useful measure?
<P>
<B>(1815 ) </B>
<P>
	They also had the equally strong feeling that the black market 
economy needs to be addressed. Some of them were rather 
sympathetic and said it was the way the poor man and the lower 
middle class got around taxes. They think that wealthier 
Canadians have a number of mechanisms to assist them in doing 
that if they choose. Then perhaps it is not so bad after all. The 
general feeling was that once the richer paid their fair share that 
much of the black market economy would disappear.
<P>
	Of course it would not surprise you, Mr. Speaker, that the 
whole question of MP pensions came up. They are pleased to 
know the government will be addressing that issue shortly. If for 
no other reasons than symbolic ones, they are aware that 
features of that pension plan are significantly different from 
what most Canadians enjoy. They want that matter addressed.
<P>
	They want not just MP pensions looked at. The general feeling 
was that all Canadians should be able to retire with a pension 
that permits them to live their remaining years with some 
dignity. They felt that all pensions should be looked at so that we 
could strengthen pensions generally and where they are too 
generous perhaps tailor them. They really felt Canadians should 
be able to retire with a pension that would permit them to live in 
dignity. I was extremely pleased.
<P>
	A final point that came out of these discussions is that the 
Auditor General has a great deal of credibility. They felt that 
those issues the Auditor General raised pointing out serious 
problems in terms of money not being used as appropriately as it 
should be need to be addressed. They would like them addressed 
in the budget each year.
<P>
	After a number of weeks of talking with constituents and 
Canadians across the land those are the points that have been 
made to me. I might add those are the points I have shared with 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8380"> 8380 </A></B>
<P>
the Minister of Finance hoping that he  might be able to address 
some or all of them when he comes forth with his next budget.
<P>
	I think the Minister of Finance is looking for that kind of 
input, that kind of precision, that kind of assistance. When he 
does come forward with the budget it will address our 
government's goals to reach 3 per cent of GDP in terms of the 
deficit by the third year of government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I have shared with you and my colleagues some of the 
concerns expressed by a number of my constituents and 
Canadians concerning the budget to be tabled in this House in 
February 1995. What the Minister of Finance is looking for, I 
think, is the same kind of information from other members of 
Parliament, so that he can take their viewpoints into 
consideration.
<P>
	These are the comments I wanted to share with you and my 
colleagues in the House of Commons.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
carefully, although with a little bit of difficulty, to the remarks 
made by my colleague opposite. He talked about the 
consultations that the Minister of Finance has been holding for a 
month now.
<P>
	We could easily accept his arguments if the Minister of 
Finance were the only one holding consultations. Unfortunately, 
we have a government that is continually consulting. The 25 
committees consult and so do the departments. And while all 
these consultations are taking place, no decision is made. I think 
the government is trying to muddle the issues by making 
Canadians believe that it is taking their opinion into 
consideration. After all these consultations, decisions will 
eventually be made, but they are constantly being delayed.
<P>
	Instead of talking about what divides us, I would like to ask 
my colleague from St. Boniface a question about what unites us.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	The redistribution of wealth has united this country for more 
than 25 years. We have, in Canada and in Quebec, a unique 
social system and I think we should be careful not to lose it. My 
concern and the concern of all members of the Bloc is that the 
government may destroy this system, reduce it, make it less 
effective.
<P>
	And our greatest fear is that middle and low-income 
Canadians will end up paying the price. My question is this: Can 
the member for St. Boniface assure this House that it is not only 
middle and low-income Canadians that will end up paying for 
these changes?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his 
comments and questions. Yes, absolutely, the Prime Minister 
said in the House that social programs needed to be changed 
because they were created many years ago for conditions which 
are no longer the same.
<P>
	He also said a few days ago that saving money was not a 
priority. If we can make savings at the same time, fine. I also 
said in my speech-and this is why I was surprised to hear my 
colleague say that he listened carefully to my speech, but had 
some difficulty with it-, that we should not take money from 
the most disadvantaged.
<P>
	I said it many times. I even gave several examples. So why did 
he have so much difficulty? The other thing that I am really 
afraid of is that he accused the government of consulting. Does 
that mean that if his party ever formed the government, it would 
not consult? Aha! That is what is being suggested. If it were the 
government, the Bloc Quebecois would not consult.
<P>
	Of course we are consulting. We do not need to present a 
budget until February 1995. What should we be doing? Make 
decisions without consulting? That is what the Bloc would do. I 
find that most disturbing.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
much of what the member said.
<P>
	Certainly consulting with constituents is what we have all 
been attempting to do for quite some time. Whether it is at a 
farmers' market or a town hall meeting all of us have heard the 
message. A lot of what he said is the same message we are 
hearing.
<P>
	One thing really interests me when he talked about the 
underground economy. There is a sort of dream that if they 
thought it was fair they would all just rush in and start paying 
tax. I question whether that is true. I think the underground 
economy is huge and is much greater than what we have 
imagined.
<P>
	I wonder what the member thinks about the single tax 
proposal or the flat tax proposal. The reason I ask that is does he 
not think that if we totally reformed the tax system and 
everybody felt they were being treated fairly that is how we 
would get back to people being willing to pay their taxes? It is 
not just by the cosmetic changes we are talking about.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleague's 
question. It is a fair one and he makes a number of good points.
<P>
	If in my remarks I suggested that I thought Canadians all of a 
sudden would want to pay taxes as a result of some changes in 
the system that was not my intent. My constituents told me with 
respect to the black market economy that they felt there were 
loopholes for some individuals, perhaps wealthier Canadians 
and perhaps government ought to consider whether or not 
certain aspects of the black market economy were loopholes for 
poor or lower middle class or middle class Canadians.
<P>
	The question was raised. I do not know the answer to the 
question but I certainly do not want to give the impression that 
people thought that would correct the problem. The problem is 
much more complex. It is very difficult to quantify as my 
colleague has mentioned, and as the Minister of Finance or the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8381"> 8381 </A></B>
<P>
Minister of National  Revenue indicated today. I want to make 
sure we are on the same wavelength and I think we are.
<P>
	With respect to the flat tax, I must confess that I have done 
quite a lot of reading on it. One of my colleagues has taken a 
great deal of interest in it. I do not know enough about taxes 
generally to be able to say that is the way to go. Not only have I 
read the material but I have read critiques of it both in favour and 
not in favour.
<P>
<B>(1825 ) </B>
<P>
	It would bother me if the flat tax was not sensitive to those in 
the lower income brackets. I think it could be. We are talking 
about Canadians who earn $7,000 to $12,000 a year. Those 
people really should not pay any taxes. Therefore I could not 
support it from that perspective.
<P>
	Let me say as a final comment that I am quite willing to 
support any type of taxation that is sensitive to the various 
economic realities in the country. I want it to be fair but I also 
want it to be perceived to be fair by Canadians because if they do 
not have that perception it does not matter whether it is flat or 
what have you it just will not work. It simply will not work.
<P>
	What we have to be aware of is if we were to change the 
taxation system completely, and for the moment let us say it was 
a flat tax, there could be many potential ramifications that we 
had not anticipated. We have to anticipate the potential negative 
impacts on Canadians. I would want to make sure those were 
understood before going forward with the change.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
always appreciate what the hon. member for St. Boniface has to 
say in this House. I would like to ask the hon. member whether, 
to his dying breath-I was going to say, looking at the hon. 
member for Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, when it 
really comes to the crunch-he will objet to any tampering by 
the government with RRSPs?
<P>
	For the average Canadian taxpayer, it is practically the only 
vehicle available, one that was used by our parents and 
grandparents to save some money for their retirement. Today, 
however, that feeling of security has vanished because they are 
concerned government policies may cut into the savings that 
many have been keeping for their retirement. In view of 
galloping inflation, they may think this vehicle is no longer a 
safe one. Has the hon. member for St. Boniface met people in his 
constituency who have the same concerns? And how did he 
respond to those concerns?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member's 
question. Yes, that question came up several times. I am not 
prepared to support taxes or measures that will prevent any man, 
woman or couple from retiring with the money they need to live 
with a certain amount of dignity.
<P>
	Before making a statement, however, and this is not to evade 
the issue, I want to understand the larger picture, what the 
Minister of Finance intends to do. If you ask me today to say yes 
or no, I cannot do that as a responsible member, because I do not 
know yet-I have the impression I will probably know as soon 
as you do-what will be in the budget that is brought down in 
February.
<P>
	However, I can assure the hon. member that the question was 
raised. Yes, my answers were similar to the one I just gave and 
yes, I intend to support measures that will make the system 
fairer, if possible, and also fairer in the perception of the general 
public. I do not want measures that will prevent people from 
retiring with enough money to live with a lot of dignity, not just 
a little.

<HR><B><A NAME="8385"> 8385 </A></B><P>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="IMMIGRATION">IMMIGRATION</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
November 16, I asked a question of the Minister of Citizenship 
and Immigration about the system of patronage created by the 
previous government in the IRB and maintained by this 
government in its appointments to the board.
<P>
	Indeed, there are very serious internal problems within the 
board between members appointed by the Conservatives and 
others appointed by the Liberals. That patronage had been 
denounced in the report commissioned by the minister himself 
and written by Professor James Hathaway of York University in 
Toronto. Unexpected and unexplained resignations and 
suspensions have occurred recently in that quasi-judiciary 
body.
<P>
	For instance, we can mention the cases of Michael Schelew, 
deputy chairman, who is actually under a judiciary 
investigation; Greg Fyffe, executive director, who resigned 
under unexplained circumstances. Board member Singh Bal had 
to resign following a review of appointments by the Standing 
Committee on Immigration and Citizenship because he came to 
Canada illegally.
<P>
<B>(1905) </B>
<P>
	For all those reasons, the Bloc Quebecois has asked and will 
continue to ask for a thorough investigation on the general 
operations of the board.
<P>
	I take this opportunity to once more draw to the attention of 
the government the genocide in Rwanda and the tragic situation 
of its people. Unfortunately war has not ended in that country. 
Thousands upon thousands of people are murdered or forced to 
leave their country and Canada does very little to help those 
refugees.
<P>
	As opposition critic for citizenship and immigration, I receive 
complaints just about every day regarding the unjustified 
refusal to grant visas as well as the red tape to which Rwandans 
in Nairobi, Kenya, are being subjected. The government must be 
more open, more generous with Rwandan refugees.
<P>
	Finally, I would like to say a couple of words about 
proposition 187, adopted by referendum in California, on 
November 8, during the American elections. If enacted, this 
proposal will deny illegal immigrants and their family, 
especially their children, access to health care, education and 
social services. The victims of this attack against fundamental 
human rights are, for the most part, Hispanics from Mexico and 
Central America.
<P>
	I recently travelled to Costa Rica where I witnessed the 
unanimous condemnation of this proposal by the different 
governments of this region. The Secretary General of the OAS 
also criticized this measure. In the United States, President 
Clinton, the Conference of Catholic Bishops, and agencies 
fighting racial discrimination denounced this measure.
<P>
	I join the thousands of Hispanics living in the United States 
who are protesting this proposition, and assure them of my 
support.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, while I 
thank the hon. member for his intervention, I have to say that I 
am at a bit of a loss as it bears little or no relation to the question 
that he asked at the time. However, I will be happy to respond.
<P>
	I certainly agree with the hon. member, as would just about 
everybody on this side of the House, with regard to his 
comments relating to the situation in California. I would like to 
assure the hon. member that he need not fear any such situation 
ever taking place in this country, at least not while this 
government is in charge of policy.
<P>
	With regard to the situation in Rwanda, as the minister has 
told the member on several occasions, the situation is extremely 
difficult and complicated. The immigration service overseas is 
doing the very best it can given the chaotic situation. It would be 
unwise of us, not to say criminal, to put Canadian personnel at 
risk. It would not help the situation of refugees if we put 
Canadian personnel in a situation in which they would be 
unsafe.
<P>
	We are dealing with the matter as expeditiously and as quickly 
as we can under the auspices of the UNHCR and we will 
continue to do so. We thank the member for his interest. We 
suggest to him that if he knows of specific situations in which 
things are going wrong through some difficulty with the 
department he should let us know.

	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, last 
week, last Tuesday to be more precise, I asked the Minister of 
Transport, following the two train tragedies, if he had instructed 
VIA Rail officials to immediately correct the shortcomings with 
respect to emergency measures and first aid for passengers in 
case of a train accident.
<P>
	The minister did answer my question, confirming that he had 
asked VIA Rail to take all necessary measures on a provisional 
basis to try and correct the shortcomings, thereby ensuring to the 
extent possible the safety of passengers and employees. That is 
where the problem lies. The minister said: ``to the extent 
possible''.
<P>

<B>(1910) </B>
<P>
	Does the minister realize that what is possible is determined 
by his office? Indeed, the emergency measures and all first-aid 
kits met DOT standards. It is up to the minister to upgrade these 
standards.
<P>
	I am not satisfied with the minister's answer when he says that 
the measures required, the applicable measures will be 
determined on the basis of the investigation. The Minister of 
Transport knows full well what safety measures are required. It 
is those he has implemented in other means of transportation.
<P>
	The minister must have the same measures apply to rail 
transportation, starting immediately. The minister may be 
hiding behind the fact that trains are the safest means of 
transportation. He even told me that it was an unprecedented 
situation.
<P>
	However, that is no reason not to review safety standards in 
case of accident. We should not wait for another accident to 
happen before taking action. It is up to the Minister of Transport 
to act, and he must act now by upgrading safety standards. We 
must not forget that the statements of accident victims show that 
VIA Rail is not prepared and equipped for emergencies, as 
evidenced by the fact that the passengers could not open the 
doors, that they had to break the windows to get out, that 
first-aid kits only contained bandage rolls.
<P>
	The facts are obvious. Safety standards are clearly inadequate 
and must be upgraded without delay, especially since even VIA 
Rail employees feel that they lack the training and the 
equipment needed to respond effectively to such an emergency. 
It is a very serious situation when the employees themselves feel 
they are poorly trained to deal with a situation like this.
<P>
	I reiterate my question to the minister: Does the minister 
intend to upgrade safety standards? The minister must be aware 
that more people could have been hurt or killed in this accident 
and that we must do all we can to avoid this kind of tragedy in the 
future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this 
opportunity to respond to the comments of the hon. member for 
Chicoutimi with respect to the railway accidents at Brighton and 
Rimouski.
<P>
	I would like to start by saying I probably travel more by train 
than any other member in this House and, incidentally, my 
father was on the train going to the Gaspé when it jumped the 
tracks, so what the hon. member said touched a personal chord.
<P>
	I have nothing to add to what was said by the Department of 
Transport last week. Emergency exits, first aid kits and 
emergency evacuation procedures are all matters of concern. I 
may remind hon. members that the Minister of Transport, the 
government, VIA Rail and Transport Canada see these elements 
as a priority and intend to ensure there is a thorough 
investigation.
<P>
	However, the Transportation Safety Board, as the minister 
pointed out, is the body that was created by Parliament to 
investigate transportation accidents, which it is doing in this 
particular case. If the investigation reveals any irregularities 
with respect to the ability to intervene, it will be in a position to 
advise Transport Canada immediately.
<P>
	The police forces concerned, both the VIA Rail contingent 
and the public police forces, are either conducting their own 
investigations or pooling their efforts, as well as stepping up the 
application of regulations and their own readiness. Furthermore, 
VIA Rail has already started a preliminary review of the 
accident and internal procedures.
<P>
	In concluding, I would like to quote what was said by the 
minister: ``We are going to do everything we can at VIA Rail, at 
Transport Canada, and at the police forces. Every possible 
avenue will be explored to make sure that the people who travel 
in Canada on VIA Rail trains can do so in safety and security''.

	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
September 20, I asked the Prime Minister a question that I think 
is extremely important if we are to have a federal health care 
system in this country. The question related to the private clinics 
in Alberta and what action the right hon. Prime Minister was 
prepared to take on this contravention of the Canada Health Act. 
At the time the Prime Minister responded that he was committed 
to maintaining a system where medicare was free and portable 
for everybody.
<P>
<B>(1915) </B>
<P>
	Clearly what we see in Alberta is a two-tier health care 
system in operation. It is not hypothetical but in operation. 
There is no doubt that private clinics are part of the two-tier 
system. Certainly any research that has been done indicates that 
it would be a contravention of the Canada Health Act. Yet the 
federal government has refused to act.
<P>
	At the same time we see the premier of Alberta cutting back 
general health care by some 20 per cent from the province's 
health care budget by 1997, as he has projected. While it is clear 
that many ordinary Albertans will have difficulty getting health 
care, at the same time the two-tier system is allowed to flourish.
<P>
	If one looks at the current situation in Alberta, one example is 
that the number of hospital beds in Edmonton has been reduced 
by 20 per cent. These cuts have had very tragic consequences for 
many Albertans. Now we hear many stories coming from 
Alberta about the devastating effects of some of the cuts. If the 
transfer payment system continues as it is, federal transfers will 
be phased out for all provinces by the year 2015. That indeed 
would be the end of a truly national system.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="8387"> 8387 </A></B>
<P>
	On the one hand in private clinics patients are being charged a 
fee on top of what the clinic charges the government health 
insurance plan. Clearly it is a case of government health care 
plans paying and the consumer paying on top of that.
<P>
	It is clearly a violation of the Canada Health Act. It is one that 
must be dealt with immediately and effectively if the federal 
government is to fulfil its commitment to have a Canada health 
care system and preserve the five important components of the 
system. Of course it will not be done if the federal government 
does not continue its contribution through the equalized 
program funding.
<P>
	In answer to my question on September 20 the right hon. 
Prime Minister concluded by saying: ``I hope that Mr. Klein will 
respect the laws of Canada''.
<P>
	I would like to raise the question again. Hoping that this 
breach of the Canada Health Act will be dealt with is not good 
enough. I repeat my question: What is the government prepared 
to do?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
leader of the New Democratic Party for keeping to the question 
that she had originally asked. It is refreshing.
<P>
	The government believes it is very doubtful that a private 
system offering health services as consumer goods for profit 
would benefit the health of Canadians.
<P>
	At the September 1994 conference of health ministers all 
ministers present, with the exception of Alberta, reached an 
agreement to regulate private clinics. It is clear that all 
provinces, with the exception of Alberta, are ready to take steps 
to end charges for medically necessary care at private clinics.
<P>
	The imposition of facility fees is not a direction in which 
these provinces and the federal government see our health care 
system moving. Our health care system is evolving. 
Alternatives for health care may involve care clinics instead of 
an institutionalized setting. This can be beneficial. However, if 
it is accompanied by charges for medically necessary care, it 
will not be consistent with what has been the history of our 
publicly funded system.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 38 the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have 
been adopted. Accordingly the House stands adjourned until 
tomorrow at 10 a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 7.20 p.m.)
