that when the House of Commons did attend Her Excellency the 
Governor General this day in the Senate chamber, Her Excellency 
was pleased to make a speech to both Houses of Parliament.  To 
prevent mistakes I have obtained a copy which is as follows: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>Honourable Members of the Senate,</I><BR> 
<I>Members of the House of Commons,</I><BR> 
<I>Ladies and Gentlemen:</I> 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an honour for me, today, to open this Second Session of the 
Thirty-Sixth Parliament of Canada. I appreciate having the opportunity so 
early in my mandate to represent the Queen as one of the three elements of 
Parliament. It is a responsibility which I take seriously, and I intend to 
follow your deliberations closely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike my immediate predecessors, I have not had the privilege of serving 
among you. I do, however, value highly the role that you play and the 
dedication that you show in making this remarkable institution work 
effectively as the centrepiece of the Canadian democratic system. I am very 
aware of the sacrifices that so many of you make in your personal and 
professional lives in accepting the challenges of public office. The 
commitment you have made is one that I share, and I look forward to 
working with you over the next five years in the service of the people 
of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, the representatives of the Canadian people gather to open the 
session of Parliament that will carry the country into the new millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We stand before a new century confident in the promise of Canada 
for our children and grandchildren. Technology is altering every 
aspect of our lives. Knowledge and creativity are now the driving 
force in a new economy. And collaboration is becoming more 
essential as the issues facing our diverse society grow in their 
complexity. But Canadians will succeed in this changing world, 
just as we have succeeded throughout our country's history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The promise of Canada was born in an age when countries were 
forged through war or revolution. Our nation's founders chose a 
unique path, which has become the Canadian way—creating a 
country dedicated to peace, order and good government for all its 
citizens. It took foresight and commitment to break the mould of 
the nation-state founded on a single language, culture or 
religion. That foresight and commitment have been greatly 
rewarded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada began as a small colony with little industry and no role 
of its own in global affairs. Over generations, individual 
Canadians built a better future for their families and their 
communities. Canadians and their governments overcame barriers of 
distance and a harsh northern climate to build a national 
railway, a system of highways, a postal service, and national 
cultural institutions, as well as hospitals, universities, and 
other institutions. Canadians and their governments also put in 
place a modern social safety net. Together, these achievements 
have provided the foundation for our quality of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within a few generations, we evolved into an independent nation 
with an advanced industrialized economy and a voice in the 
councils of the world: the United Nations, the G-8, the 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, NATO, and 
many others. Canada is now serving its sixth elected term on the 
United Nations Security Council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ours is a voice for peace. Canada was the first to propose the 
use of troops for peacekeeping. Today, Canadians are keeping the 
peace in many countries around the world. But whenever tyranny 
has threatened peace and security, Canadians have never hesitated 
to answer the call. Together with our proud Canadian veterans, we 
remember those who paid with their lives at Vimy Ridge, on Juno 
Beach, and at Hill 355 in Korea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the tradition of the coureurs des bois, we have explored the 
frontiers of science. From the invention of newsprint to the 
creation of advanced computer languages, Canadian ingenuity has 
helped to build the information age. From the discovery of 
insulin to the earliest pacemaker, Canadians have given new life 
to millions around the world. Canada was a pioneer in the 
peaceful use of space, becoming a leader in satellite 
communications and remote-sensing technologies. Today, our 
astronauts are using Canadian technology to help assemble the 
International Space Station—the largest scientific project in 
history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a complex world, diverse approaches, skills and ideas are 
essential to building a higher quality of life. Canada is a 
bilingual country in which both men and women of many different 
cultures, races and religions participate in economic, social and 
political life. Our diversity is a source of strength and 
creativity, making us modern and forward-looking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our actions and our history make us at home in a world of change 
and increasing interdependence. Our human talent, our values and 
our commitment to working together will secure Canada's 
leadership in the knowledge-based economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, Canadians can look with pride on Canada's success. We 
have a dynamic economy, a strong and democratic society, and a 
sense of community. We are recognized throughout the world for 
our quality of life. We will build a higher quality of life for 
all Canadians—for our children, ourselves, and our neighbours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>A Strong and United Canada</B> 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A high quality of life for Canadians and a strong, united Canada 
are inseparable. The Government will continue to take a 
comprehensive approach to strengthening the unity of our country. 
All its actions will serve to strengthen Canada by enhancing the 
quality of life of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our federal system allows us to value the different strengths of 
each region of our country. It guarantees all citizens equal 
rights and freedoms. And it enables Canada's wealth to be shared 
by all citizens no matter where they live—from Newfoundland in 
the east, to British Columbia in the west, to our newest 
territory, Nunavut, in the north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last two Parliaments, Canadians have built a foundation 
for even greater success. Our economy is strong. Our citizens 
enjoy expanding opportunities and increasing choices. Our 
artists, writers, musicians and filmmakers draw admiration from 
around the world. And Canada itself earns the respect of the 
community of nations as a symbol of peace, democracy and 
compassion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best way to achieve the promise of Canada for every citizen 
is to work together to build the highest quality of life for all 
Canadians. But there are some who would pull us apart rather than 
bring us together. Even though Quebeckers do not want a third 
referendum, the Government of Quebec continues to talk about 
holding another one. The Government of Canada therefore reaffirms 
the commitment it has made to Quebeckers and all other Canadians 
that the principle of clarity, as set out by the Supreme Court of 
Canada, will be respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To seize the opportunities and meet the challenges of a new global 
economy, we must work together in the Canadian way and concentrate on 
what matters most to Canadians. We must take bold steps today to make 
Canada even stronger in the next century. This requires national will, 
national strategies and partnerships across the country. Citizens and 
governments must collaboratively build an even stronger and more united 
Canada, a Canada that remains an example to the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians expect their national government to focus on areas 
where it can and must make a difference. And they want this done 
in the Canadian way—working together, balancing individual and 
government action, and listening to citizens. Canadians expect 
their Government to be fiscally prudent, to reduce the debt 
burden, to cut taxes, and to pursue the policies necessary for a 
strong society. The emerging global marketplace offers an 
enormous opportunity to create more Canadian jobs, more Canadian 
growth and more Canadian influence in the world. It provides 
expanding opportunities to secure a higher quality of life for 
all Canadians. To seize these opportunities, we must build on our 
strengths. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Achieving a higher quality of life requires a comprehensive 
strategy to accelerate the transition to the knowledge-based 
economy, promote our interests and project our values in the 
world. Together, we will strive for excellence. This demands that 
we collaborate with our partners to:

</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the changing nature of the world economy, the 
prospects for a high quality of life in any country will 
depend—as never before—on having a population that is 
adaptable, resilient and ready to learn throughout life. The 
foundation for this is laid in the very early years. No 
commitment we make today will be more important for the long-term 
prosperity and well-being of our society than the commitment to 
invest our efforts in very young children. Parents and families 
have the primary responsibility for the care of their children. 
But all of society must work together to ensure that our children 
develop the abilities to succeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government will extend and make more accessible Employment 
Insurance benefits for parental leave, to help parents take more 
time from work to spend with their children. It will make its own 
workplace policies and those of federally regulated employers 
more family friendly. Through further tax relief, it will put 
more dollars in the hands of families with children. And, with 
its provincial and territorial partners, it will work to reform 
family law and strengthen supports provided to families to ensure 
that, in cases of separation or divorce, the needs and best 
interests of children come first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal, provincial and territorial governments are developing 
together the National Children's Agenda. As part of this work, it 
is the Government's objective to reach an agreement among 
governments by December 2000 on a national action plan to further 
support parents and families. This plan will be consistent with 
the Social Union Framework Agreement. It will set out common 
principles, objectives and fiscal parameters for all governments 
to increase resources and further strengthen supports for early 
childhood development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make it easier for families to break the cycle of poverty, 
the federal, provincial and territorial governments also 
established the National Child Benefit. The Government of Canada 
is already investing an additional $1.7 billion annually in 
low-income families with children, while the provinces and 
territories are investing in complementary services. The 
Government wants no family to have to choose between a job and 
benefits for their children. Therefore, by 2002, the Government 
will make a third significant investment in the National Child 
Benefit, while seeking a commitment from its provincial and 
territorial partners to increase their investment in services for 
families with children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>Young Canadians</I>

earlier age. They deserve more and earlier opportunities to get 
involved, develop their talents and expand their skills. In doing 
so, they will become active and engaged citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government will focus on providing young people with more 
opportunities to connect to the Canadian experience, to view 
their country in all its splendour, to gain a first-hand

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the global, knowledge-based economy, the advantage goes to 
countries that are innovative, have high levels of productivity, 
quickly adopt the latest technology, invest in skills development 
for their citizens, and seek out new opportunities around the

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have built a strong and dynamic economy. It is the 
cornerstone of our quality of life—providing Canada with the 
means to continue building a more equitable society, a healthier 
population, and stronger communities. In the space of only a few 
years, our nation's finances have gone from deficits and debt to 
balanced budgets, with low inflation and low interest rates. Laws 
and regulations have been modernized and the role of government 
in business decisions has been reduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government will continue to build a better environment for 
economic growth and enhanced productivity by reducing the debt 
burden, cutting taxes, and making strategic investments. Such 
investments will help small businesses grow, encourage trade, 
support citizens in developing the skills they need, and ensure 
that Canada has modern infrastructure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government is committed to prudent fiscal management. It 
will never let the nation's finances get out of control again. It 
will keep the ratio of debt to GDP on a permanent downward track. 
It will deliver on the commitment it made at the beginning of 
this Parliament to devote half the budget surplus to debt 
repayment and tax relief, and the other half to investments that 
address the social and economic needs of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>Lower Taxes</I> 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the nation's finances have improved, the Government has begun 
to deliver broad-based tax relief—totalling $16.5 billion over 
three years. As the nation's finances continue to improve, the 
Government will further reduce taxes to increase the disposable 
income of Canadians, enhance innovation and risk taking, and 
create a more robust economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax reduction is a key component of a strategy to increase 
individual incomes and to ensure an economy that produces the 
growth and wealth which enable those public and private 
investments necessary for a high quality of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its next budget, the Government will set out a multi-year 
plan for further tax reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>Increased Trade and Investment</I> 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's economy is more open than any of the leading 
industrialized countries. We are blessed with a population that 
comes from countries all over the world. Foreign markets for our 
goods and services provide us with new opportunities. Foreign 
investment provides us with capital, new ideas, new technologies, 
and innovative business practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To build on Canada's advantage, the Government will increase its 
trade promotion in strategic sectors with high export potential—sectors 
ranging from biotechnology and environmental and 
information technology to tourism, culture and health. It will 
also continue to support innovation and the development of new 
technologies in leading export sectors such as agriculture, 
agri-food and natural resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will launch Investment Team Canada—a co-ordinated effort by all 
governments and the private sector to make the international community 
more aware of the unique opportunities for investment and growth 
in Canada. The Government will also modernize legislation to make it 
easier for global corporations to locate their headquarters in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government will use the upcoming round of World Trade Organization 
negotiations, including those on agriculture, to help build a more 
transparent, rules-based global trading system—one that ensures a level 
playing field, provides better access to world markets for Canadian 
companies in all sectors, and respects the needs of Canadians, our culture, 
and the environment. In addition, the Government will work with its 
partners in the hemisphere toward the establishment of the Free Trade Area 
of the Americas by 2005. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>Skills and Knowledge for the 21st Century</I> 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A skilled workforce and a capacity to innovate continuously are 
crucial building blocks of a successful 21st century economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last three years, the Government has put in place a 
strategy to build on Canada's advantage as the country with the 
most highly educated workforce in the world. It has made it 
easier to save for a child's education. It will make college and 
university more affordable through Canada Millennium 
Scholarships. It has improved student debt relief and provided 
better tax assistance to finance lifelong learning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue to build on this strategy. The Government will 
forge partnerships with other governments, public- and 
private-sector organizations, and Canadian men and women to 
establish a national action plan on skills and learning for the 
21st century. This plan will focus on lifelong learning, address 
the challenge of poor literacy among adults, and provide citizens 
with the information they need to make good decisions about 
developing their skills.

</I></B></P><P align=left>To ensure that the Public Service of Canada remains a strong, 
representative, professional and non-partisan national

into the 21st century, the Government will also focus on the 
recruitment, retention and continuous learning of a skilled 
federal workforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>Infrastructure for the 21st Century</I> 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For Canada to generate jobs, growth and wealth, it must have a 
leading, knowledge-based economy that creates new ideas and puts 
them to work for Canadians. To do this, it is essential to 
connect Canadians to each other, to schools and libraries, to 
governments, and to the marketplace—so they can build on 
each other's ideas and share information. Achieving this 
objective will require new types of infrastructure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>Knowledge Infrastructure</I> 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Improving Canada's knowledge infrastructure means supporting a 
new generation of leaders, attracting the best researchers, and 
encouraging our graduates to put their talents to work here at 
home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government will introduce the legislation necessary to 
create the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. These 
institutes will provide a model for world-leading research, 
bringing together for the first time all the researchers who have 
an impact on health to undertake shared research priorities. This 
innovative approach recognizes the importance of collaborative 
research for improving the health and well-being of Canadians and 
for building a high-quality health system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada has for many years been one of the most 
important contributors to research at Canadian universities. In 
the last two years, the Government has pursued an ambitious

build on this agenda, the Government will: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>increase its support to the Granting Councils, enabling them to 
forge new partnerships with our universities to attract the best 
research minds in the world through an innovative program of 21st

</I></B></P><P align=left>find new markets for new products and services developed through 
research by universities and government research centres. 
</UL></UL><UL>

safety and economic well-being of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>Information Infrastructure</I> 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Improving Canada's information infrastructure will support the 
exchange of ideas and the conduct of business over computer 
networks, connect Canadians to the information highway, and 
accelerate the adoption of electronic commerce. The Government 
will: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>take steps to make Canada a centre of excellence for electronic 
commerce and encourage its use throughout the economy; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>re-introduce legislation to protect personal and business 
information in the digital world and to recognize electronic 
signatures; and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>provide increased access to high-speed Internet service for 
classrooms and libraries and stimulate the production of Canadian 
multimedia learning content and applications. This will build on 
the success of SchoolNet. 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government will become a model user of information 
technology and the Internet. By 2004, our goal is to be known 
around the world as the government most connected to its 
citizens, with Canadians able to access all government 
information and services on-line at the time and place of their 
choosing. We will build on a pilot project now under way to make 
www.access.ca a personal gateway to government information and 
community content on the Internet, and we will encourage all 
Canadians to make use of this address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our knowledge-based economy is more than high-tech companies. It 
is an economy in which all sectors strive to use leading 
technologies and processes. It is an economy in which old 
barriers to access or of distance matter less—where 
technology enables urban and rural communities from the Atlantic 
to the West to the North to compete globally, and where 
technology opens new doors to all Canadians. It is an economy in 
which rural Canada also benefits from value-added activity, 
environmentally astute land management, and new job skills and 
opportunities. It is an economy in which clusters of technology 
development already exist in smaller communities all over Canada. 
Indeed, it is an economy in which technology can lead to greater 
economic stability for the primarily rural regions in which 
cyclical resource industries—agriculture, fisheries, forestry, 
mining and tourism—are the dominant sources of wealth. The 
Government will encourage the development and adoption of new 
technologies in all sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>Cultural Infrastructure</I> 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The strength of Canada is reflected in its rich diversity.

writers, singers and performers, through our filmmakers and 
artists, and through those who chronicle our history and preserve 
our heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New technologies offer new opportunities to strengthen the bonds 
between Canadians. The Government will bring Canadian culture 
into the digital age, linking 1,000 institutions across the 
country to form a virtual museum of Canada. It will put 
collections from the National Archives, National Library and 
other key institutions on-line. It will also increase support for 
the production of Canadian stories and images in print, theatre, 
film, music and video. In particular, it will increase support 
for the use of new media. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>Physical Infrastructure</I> 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada must also continue to improve its physical infrastructure 
for the 21st century. To increase trade and economic growth, we 
must ensure that we have the capacity to move people and goods 
safely and efficiently. To maintain the quality of life in our 
cities and rural communities, we must ensure that we have clean 
air and water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government will work with other levels of government and the 
private sector to reach—by the end of the year 2000—agreement 
on a five-year plan for improving physical infrastructure in 
urban and rural regions across the country. This agreement will 
set out shared principles, objectives and fiscal parameters for 
all partners to increase their resources directed toward

decisions about the next significant investments in health—ensuring 
that our health system meets the evolving needs of all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A modern health information system will give health professionals and 
individual citizens improved access to up-to-date information about health 
issues and treatment options. The Government will ensure that citizens in 
every region of the country have access to such information so they can 
make better-informed decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government will protect the health of Canadians by

and citizens to meet our country's commitment under the Kyoto 
Protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It will set and 
enforce tough pollution standards, in particular to better 
protect the health of children, seniors and residents of the 
North. It will place greater emphasis on sustainable development 
in government decision making. It will also address the 
structural weaknesses that have been identified in the management 
of toxic substances. Internationally, Canada will provide 
technical assistance to developing countries in adopting 
sustainable practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government will introduce legislation and stewardship

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Social Union Framework Agreement, reached earlier this year, 
is a commitment by governments to work together for Canadians. It 
calls for governments to report publicly on the effectiveness of 
social programs. It also commits governments to eliminating 
barriers that unjustifiably impede the mobility of citizens 
within Canada. These barriers include rules that prevent some 
citizens from obtaining recognition of their qualifications when 
they move to another province, that deny some students use of 
their student loans when they study out-of-province, and that 
restrict access to essential services for some 
citizens—including those with disabilities—because of their 
province of origin. The Government of Canada is committed to 
working together with its partners to meet the deadlines set out 
in the Social Union Framework Agreement, thereby removing all 
unjustifiable barriers to mobility no later than 2002. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 2001, Canadians will mark the International Year of 
Volunteers—a time to celebrate the achievements of Canada's 
everyday heroes. The Government recognizes the need to build 
partnerships with communities and to renew its relationship with 
the voluntary organizations that serve and sustain them. The 
Government will enter into a national accord with the voluntary 
sector, laying a new foundation for active partnership with 
voluntary organizations in the service of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Strong communities depend on the participation of all their 
members. To this end, the Government will pursue its efforts with 
other governments, the private and voluntary sectors, and all 
citizens to build communities in which Canadians with

more at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the Government will continue working with its

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government will work with Canadians to ensure that our 
communities continue to be safe. Its focus will be balanced, 
combining prevention and a community-centred approach with action 
to deal with serious crime. It will expand the community-based 
crime prevention strategy and re-introduce legislation to reform 
the youth justice system. The Government will combat drug 
trafficking while helping communities aid those most affected. It 
will also launch a program of restorative justice to help victims 
overcome the trauma of crime and provide non-violent offenders 
with a chance to help repair the damage caused by their actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government will focus attention on new and emerging threats 
to Canadians and their neighbours around the world. It will work 
to combat criminal activity that is becoming increasingly global 
in scope, including money laundering, terrorism, and the

the needs of people. We have the expertise to advance an agenda 
of human security—protecting people from threats to their 
rights, their safety and their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is an outward-looking country, with a trade-oriented economy and a 
population drawn from every corner of the globe. We have a reputation 
internationally for making a difference—through our contribution to 
eliminating landmines, our work with NATO and the United Nations 
in Kosovo, our development assistance to Asia and Africa, our efforts 
to establish the International Criminal Court, and our work to renew the 
international financial system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Cold War recedes into the past, there is a greater need 
to complement national security with an approach that addresses 
the growing challenges that undermine the security of 
individuals. Human security is challenged when children are used 
as soldiers in combat, when citizens are denied their rights, 
when civilians are caught in conflict, and when people are the 
victims of economic crisis, natural disaster, widespread disease, 
or environmental degradation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians recognize that their quality of life depends in part 
on the quality of life of their neighbours—those who share this 
planet with us. A world where people are secure is a world where 
fewer people are forced to flee their homes, where there is less 
crime and terrorism, and where there is a reduced threat of 
disease and pollution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government will give increased prominence to human security in its 
foreign policy, working to achieve meaningful progress in the councils of 
the world on a global human security agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 2001, the United Nations General Assembly will hold a special 
session on children. In the spirit of partnership that led to the 
historic treaty banning landmines, the Government will work to 
reach key international agreements to protect the rights of 
children. Canada will champion efforts to eliminate the 
exploitation of children, including the use of child soldiers in 
armed conflict, and will help address the crisis of children 
affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government will act with like-minded countries to reform and 
strengthen international institutions such as the United Nations, 
International Monetary Fund, World Bank and World Trade Organization. 
It will also work to develop a new approach internationally to support the 
diversity of cultural expression in countries around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To advance Canada's leadership in the Arctic region, the Government will 
outline a foreign policy for the North that enhances co-operation, helps 
protect the environment, promotes trade and investment, and supports the 
security of the region's people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government will increase international development assistance and 
work in innovative ways to enable poor countries to improve the quality 
of life of their citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government will also continue to ensure that the Canadian Forces have 
the capacity to support Canada's role in building a more secure world and 
will further develop the capacity of Canadians to help ensure peace and 
security in foreign lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Honouring Canada's Promise for the 21st Century
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we prepare to celebrate the turn of the millennium, we can 
look to our past with pride and to our future with confidence. 
Like previous generations, we will face new challenges. But 
guided by our values and our collective experience, we can ensure 
that Canada remains the best place in the world in which to 
live—the best place to raise children, to learn, to pursue 
opportunity, to share in rich, diverse and safe communities, and 
to admire the beauty of nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All Canadians—every citizen, every government, every business and 
every community organization—have a part to play. We will build the 
21st century together.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House proceeded to the consideration of the speech delivered 
by Her Excellency the Governor General at the opening of the 
session. 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Limoges (Windsor—St. Clair, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is with a profound sense honour and humility that I move the 
motion, seconded by the hon. member for Laval West, on the 
address in reply to the Speech from the Throne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to pay my respects to Her Excellency the Governor 
General and thank her for delivering the speech to both Houses. 
I offer the governor general my sincere congratulations on her 
historic appointment and wish her much success in the years 
ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to thank the Right Hon. Prime Minister and the 
government for the honour conferred on me, the recently elected 
member of parliament for the riding of Windsor—St. Clair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members know, earlier this year I succeeded my friend 
and hon. members' former colleague, the late Shaughnessy Cohen. 
Shaughnessy had a heart of gold and an infectious personality. 
She served her constituents well and I intend to be just as 
enthusiastic as she was in representing the interests of my 
constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The riding of Windsor—St. Clair is a special riding in that the 
people who live there represent the very best of what makes 
Canada such a great place to live.  They are hard working people 
who play by the rules, raise their families and care deeply about 
their community and their country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Proof of this can be seen in the fact that for the last 30 years 
the Windsor-Essex county area has led the country in per capita 
donations to the United Way.  The tremendous sense of pride and 
community I see every day in Windsor and Tecumseh is what makes 
serving as their member of parliament so meaningful to me. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along with numerous other localities in Canada, Windsor—St. Clair 
has an active and vibrant francophone community to which I am 
proud to belong.  My parents, and their parents before them, 
were aware of the importance of preserving their language and 
culture and equally aware of the challenge involved.  I face 
that same challenge every day, as do my children.  Our 
government has done much to enshrine the rights of francophone 
Canadians from sea to sea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Windsor is proud of its heritage as Canada's car capital. 
Windsor is equally proud to be the home of Hiram Walker, 
producers of the famous Canadian Club whisky. 
Windsor's long-established industries are doing very well under 
our government, but the city has progressed beyond its 
traditional industrial base of assembly and manufacturing 
plants.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Windsor casino, with its 20,000-plus visitors daily,  has 
become Canada's number one tourist attraction.  Among its 
positive economic effects are the thousands of well paid jobs it 
has created, and the millions of dollars in new revenue to the 
provincial government, in large part from U.S. visitors. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Windsor's economy is changing in other ways as well.  For 
example, aided by our government's investment in technological 
and skills development Windsor is now the tool and mould capital 
of the world.  Our city is home to well over 100 high tech design 
firms using state of the art computers, machines and robotics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Industrial leaders in our community such as Tony Toldo, the 
Rodzik family, Michael Soltz and Steve Reko are demonstrating 
Canada's leadership in quality manufacturing, industrial design 
and research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During our government's time in office there has been 
considerable corporate investment in Windsor.  The big three 
automakers, General Motors, Ford and Daimler-Chrysler, have all 
made significant investments to the lasting benefit of Windsor 
and Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the investment in new factories and the 
modernization of existing plants and equipment we have seen the 
establishment of the cutting edge automotive research centre, a 
partnership involving the government, the University of Windsor 
and Daimler-Chrysler Canada.  The centre is using state of the 
art computer assisted design and telecommunications technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such investments are a clear demonstration of confidence in 
Canada's economy and an acknowledgement that Canadian workers are 
highly skilled, well educated and efficient.  It also reflects a 
great degree of confidence in our government and our Prime 
Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, coming from Windsor I have very large shoes to fill. 
Paul Martin Sr., Eugene Whelan and Mark MacGuigan served in 
government with great distinction as very effective 
representatives of their fellow citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, the member of parliament for Windsor West, 
the Deputy Prime Minister, has not only served our part of the 
country throughout his long and distinguished career, he has 
worked on behalf of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These men and my immediate predecessor provide me with inspiring 
examples of what it means to be a member of parliament, but I 
must say that my own sense of public service came from my 
parents.  They instilled in their children the importance of 
making a meaningful contribution to our community and the world 
around us.  That is why I spent 14 years on city council in 
Windsor prior to joining members here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I decided to run for parliament it was because I wanted to 
help Canadians realize their dreams.  I wanted to help build 
on the accomplishments of this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my previous career in the banking industry I had many 
opportunities to help people realize their dreams.  I worked with 
men and women who were applying for student loans, loans for 
their first cars, mortgages for their first homes or starting new 
businesses.  I helped people invest their life savings and plan 
for their retirement years.  I listened to their dreams and their 
plans for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also remember when Canadians were uncertain about the future, 
insecure about their jobs or unable to find one.  I remember when 
there was a huge budget deficit, high interest rates and a 
ballooning national debt.  Most of us seriously doubted that the 
nation's pension plan would be there for us when our turn came to 
retire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was little talk about dreams and the future and more about 
just making it to the end of the week.  That was six years ago. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leadership and balanced approach of the Prime Minister and 
the Minister of Finance have meant that this government has been 
able to accomplish many things.  Over the years the government 
has introduced major tax cuts, eliminated the deficit and begun 
to reduce the national debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government is investing in priorities such as health care, 
education and technological innovation to prepare Canada for the 
21st century.  Today the unemployment rate in Windsor is a mere 
half of what it was in 1993 and the local economy is very 
strong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now when I run into my former clients they are again talking 
about their dreams.  They have renewed hope for the future.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is now experiencing the longest stretch of economic 
growth since the 1960s. The unemployment rate now stands at 
7.5%. This is the lowest it has been since June 1990, and it is 
now almost four points lower than the 11.4% our government faced 
when it came to power in October, 1993.  Over 1.7 millions jobs 
have been created since that date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last budget, we announced $7.7 billion in tax cuts over a 
three year period, and the tax cuts of $16.5 billion announced 
in our last two budgets will benefit all taxpayers. 
In fact, 600,000 low income Canadians will pay absolutely no 
federal income tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have brought down a second balanced, surplus budget. We 
have proposed a tax plan of four consecutive balanced, surplus 
budgets.  This is only the third time since Confederation that 
such a feat has been accomplished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of the Canadian equal opportunity strategy, we announced 
an additional investment of over $500 million for the purpose of 
creating Canadian institutes for health research. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a record of commitment, a record of achievement, a 
record in which our government can take pride.  It is a testament 
to the vision and the leadership of our Prime Minister.  More 
important, this is a record that has improved the life of every 
Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is still much more that remains to be done.  We must 
continue to reduce the tax burden on Canadians in a meaningful 
and responsible manner.  We must continue to reduce the national 
debt and we must continue to foster a climate where entrepreneurs 
can succeed, where we reward talent and hard work, and where 
Canadians can be confident in their economic future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time we must build on the strengths of our national 
health care system and take steps to modernize it so that it is 
ready for the challenges of the 21st century.  We must provide 
families with the support framework they need to ensure that 
Canada's children, our children, get the best possible start in 
life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Working with provinces and territories, we have opened a new 
front in the war on child poverty with the creation of the 
national child benefit system, the most important new social 
program since medicare.  It takes an innovative national approach 
to helping low income families with children.  It boosts programs 
and services for children.  It helps parents make the transition 
from welfare to work.  The Government of Canada's contribution to 
the national child benefit system is the Canada child tax 
benefit, CCTB.  We have pledged to increase the CCTB by $2 
billion by Canada Day 2000.  This means a family earning $20,000 
with two children will get over $3,700 through the CCTB. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must invest in higher learning and scientific research to 
secure our place in a knowledge based economy.  This year Canada 
became the first country in the world to connect every public 
school and every public library to the Internet.  Connecting all 
Canadians remains a priority for our government.  High speed 
access is essential to give Canadians a competitive edge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Investments like the millennium scholarship fund 
will generate over 100,000 scholarships each year for low 
and middle income post-secondary students over the next decade. 
As well, there are programs such as the Canada savings education grant 
in which our government is topping up new contributions through the 
registered education savings plan, RESP.  These are an enormous 
hit with parents saving for their children's future education. 
Over 300,000 new RESP accounts have been opened since the new 
grant was announced last year.

program our Prime Minister renewed last December with a

the Speech from the Throne proposes a proactive agenda. The last 
throne speech of the 20th century is truly an action plan that 
sets the foundations for a promising future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a federal member of parliament, one of my priorities is to 
try to improve our national roadway system, because it is 
critical to the quality of life of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our roads are used to transport the products we sell and the 
food we eat to Canadian cities and towns. 
The roadway system is the backbone of our tourist industry and 
the lifeline of our foreign trade. As such, it must be safe and 
effective to ensure our prosperity. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another priority for me is the environment.  In my riding of 
Windsor—St. Clair we are the victims of cross border pollution 
in addition to what we ourselves add to the mix.  In recent years 
Canadians have become increasingly aware of all types of 
pollution.  While many industries are working to clean up their 
act, like the Ford Motor Company attaining ISO 14001 
certification in our local plants, citizens are worried that 
individuals in the various levels of government are neglecting 
their environmental responsibilities.  This growing awareness is 
one of the reasons that environmental activists are no longer a 
fringe group.  They are now the mainstream population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting to know our new Minister of the Environment has given me 
a renewed sense of confidence in our ability to make real 
progress.  That message is also reinforced in a vision expressed 
in the Speech from the Throne.  One of the best ways to succeed 
is to support the development of clean technologies.  For 
example, this spring Daimler-Chrysler revealed the first zero 
emission fuel cell car in North America.  The Ballard fuel cell 
is Canadian technology that is also being successfully tested in 
mass transit.  Such a development could dramatically reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing I leave the House with this thought.  In the last 
election Canadians chose our government to lead the nation into 
the 21st century.  Canada has been recognized for six straight 
years by the UN as the best country in the world in which to 
live.  With our government's inspiring vision for the future 
unveiled earlier today we have indicated that we are ready for 
the new millennium.  Together we can build a society that strikes 
the right balance between economic investment and respect for the 
environment, the right balance between support for innovation and 
support for our cultural diversity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With a balanced approach we can build a society where every 
Canadian has a place and where we all share the rewards. Together 
we can ensure that Canada remains the best country in the world in 
which to invest, to learn, to work and to live in the 21st 
century.  In doing so we will strengthen Canadians' sense of 
pride and belonging to this vast, diverse and beautiful nation, a 
nation woven from caring communities like my own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hereby move, seconded by the hon. member for Laval West, that 
the following address be presented to Her Excellency the Governor 
General of Canada:

</I></B></P><P align=left>May it please Your Excellency: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We, Her Majesty's most loyal and dutiful subjects, the House of

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
great honour for me to second the motion for the address in reply 
to the Speech from the Throne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I would like to thank the Prime Minister 
for giving me the opportunity to second the motion before 
the Parliament of Canada. I would also like to thank the voters 
in the riding of Laval West who have put their trust in me to 
represent them in the federal parliament, which is a great 
honour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As their elected representative I will continue to work with my 
colleagues as well as with the private sector and NGOs to meet 
the challenges of the new millenium, which were outlined in the 
Speech from the Throne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The riding of Laval West Quebec, is very representative of 
the population of both Quebec and Canada. It is home to 
Canadians of various origins, mostly francophone, but there are also many 
anglophones and Canadians of Greek, Portuguese, Armenian, 
Lebanese, Egyptian, West Indian, Jewish and other origins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The riding has a major rural component, depending mainly on 
horticulture, and a very urban component, namely the great 
city of Laval. There are low, middle and high income families. 
It is a community that works hard together and, like Canada 
as a whole, finds a way to affirm its diversity in unity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Laval is the second largest city in Quebec. Since its 
inception its activities have shifted toward the secondary 
sector, without eliminating all of its primary sector. 
In the past 15 years Laval's focus has been on high tech and 
the industrial, commercial and financial sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The priorities set by our government in the throne speech are 
completely in line with the expectations and priorities of the 
families in Laval: a prosperous and healthy society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Children are the foundation of the society of 
tomorrow.  The more attention we focus on the children of today 
in their early years, the better their future and our future 
will be.  Dozens of community and not for profit organizations 
are already involved every day in helping low and middle income 
families.  Our government intends to adopt a positive and 
responsible attitude to bring hope to the families of 
Laval, the families of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I was listening to Her Excellency reading the Speech from 
the Throne, something kept crossing my mind.  I believe 
that every member of this House, above and beyond any 
differences of opinion, was thinking exactly the same thing: the 
progress this country has made in the past six years, the work 
that has been accomplished by all Canadians, is truly 
remarkable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a moment to review the position Canada was 
in six years ago. Unemployment was at 11.4%. Inflation and high 
interest rates were undermining our economy. There was 
a record deficit of $42 
billion which was constantly rising, adding to our country's debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a nutshell, Canada was on the verge of bankruptcy, and 
something drastic definitely needed to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government was therefore elected with the mandate of 
remedying the situation. 
Canadians realized this was going to mean some difficult years 
and numerous sacrifices, but they also realized they could count 
on us to listen to them, to work along with them, to make the 
necessary choices, keeping in mind their values and their 
priorities.  We had the confidence of Canadians and we knew that 
we could have confidence in them as well.

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at what we have become today: a country of over 30 
million people, with unemployment at its lowest level in ten 
years.  The era of budget deficits is behind us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With inflation and interest rates under control, many Canadians 
are now able to buy a house and start a family without having to 
worry about going deep into debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are also seeing their tax bill drop.  The news in the 
throne speech is that their net income will rise in the years 
ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aware that running a country is more than an exercise in 
accounting, our government has done all this. 
Balancing a budget is not an end in itself and neither is 
lowering taxes.  Rather, these are ways of bringing about a 
vision, our vision, the vision of all Canadians for a strong, 
united, and prosperous Canada with a quality of life unequalled 
anywhere else in the world, a Canada whose successes know no 
limitations. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While some would have us live in the past, this government has 
always had its eye on the future, on the future of this country 
and on the future of every single Canadian, and the future begins 
with families and children.  It begins by giving every young 
Canadian a chance to succeed in the new knowledge based economy 
and build a better quality of life.  This government has no 
higher priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why over the last few years we placed the cornerstones 
of the national children's agenda with a special focus on the 
problems of low income families with children.  Along with our 
partners we have made considerable progress so far.  We created 
the national child benefit through which low income families 
receive in total $1.7 billion every year while provinces and 
territories are reinvesting in complementary services.  Our 
government has already pledged new funds that will bring the 
total to $2 billion a year by July 2000.  And that is not all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we speak, hundreds of projects to help children and parents 
are under way in communities across Canada with the assistance of 
federal programs, projects that benefit from programs such as 
aboriginal head starts which were recently expanded to include 
children who live on reserves, the Canadian prenatal nutrition 
program which funds community groups that counsel and help women 
at risk of having unhealthy babies, the community action 
program for children which funds community groups that assist in 
meeting the developmental needs of at risk children from birth to 
age six.  We did all this as we were fighting to bring the 
nation's finances under control.  Imagine what we will be able to 
do now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government has committed to increasing resources for early 
childhood development, providing targeted assistance for low 
income families with children and fostering family friendly 
workplaces.  We will continue to work with our partners, the 
provinces and the territories, to further improve community support 
for early childhood development.  We will continue to invest in 
the national child benefit.  We will continue to put more money 
in the hands of families through further tax relief.  We will 
give parents the freedom to spend more time with their children. 
We will implement workplace policies that are more favourable to 
families and we will modernize family law with an eye to placing 
the needs of children first. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not all that our government has done to help children. 
In recent years we have also introduced the Canadian 
opportunities strategy to provide Canadians with easier and more 
affordable access to education and training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have established the Canada Millennium Scholarship Foundation 
and set up a $2.5 billion fund that will begin distributing over 
100,000 scholarships a year to postsecondary students from low 
and middle income families starting in January.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have created the Canada education savings 
grant to help Canadians invest in their children's future.  We 
have introduced a tax credit for interest payments on student 
loans. In addition, we have implemented other programs, the 
benefits of which will continue to be felt for years to come: 
the youth employment strategy, SchoolNet, a program promoting 
community access to the Internet, and the computers for schools 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne clearly indicated that we will be 
building on these sound foundations in the years to come, that 
we will be relying on the modern infrastructure currently being 
put in place, not only to improve the skills and prospects of 
young Canadians, but also to help them to better know their 
fellow Canadians from other regions and our society, which is 
one of diversity within unity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We took office at a time when major changes were taking place. 
These changes, which include globalization, the rapid emergence 
of new technologies and their application in all areas of the 
economy, have a growing impact on the daily lives of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians had every reason to be concerned. Not only was our 
country at the mercy of events, but the government had very 
limited means to start the process of catching up. The burdens 
of the past were preventing us from moving toward the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's throne speech is indicative of a complete turnaround. It 
reaffirms Canada's position at the forefront of a knowledge based 
economy, it stresses our country's attachment to social justice 
and equity, it shows a Canada that is united by the compassion, 
optimism, determination and deep conviction of its citizens, 
and it will be the best country in the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud of our government, but I am particularly proud of my 
fellow Canadians. We never let go of our values. We never 
listened to those who wanted us to take the easy way out. 
Instead, we rolled up our sleeves and set out to do the task at 
hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We took advantage of the solidarity and determination of 
Canadians and we marched together toward our common objective, 
which is to make Canada a country with a future, a country 
constantly striving for ever greater success.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Her Excellency<BR> 
the Right Honourable Adrienne Clarkson<BR> 
Governor General of Canada<BR> 
Installation Speech 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate<BR> 
Thursday, October 7, 1999<BR> 
Prime Minister, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You have expressed to me the affection, loyalty and esteem of the Canadian 
people, 
which it will be my honour to convey to our gracious sovereign, Queen 
Elizabeth II. I am 
pleased to accept the responsibility of being Her Majesty's representative 
in Canada, with 
all that entails, through our history and our custom. Knowing better than 
anyone my own 
shortcomings, I undertake this task with humility and ask you all, as 
Canadians, to help 
me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take on the responsibility of becoming Canada's 26th Governor General since 
Confederation, fully conscious of the deep roots of this office, 
stretching back, to the 
Governors of New France and to the first of them, Samuel de Champlain. In 
our beloved 
Georgian Bay, which lies on the great water route he took from the French 
River to 
Huronia, there is a cairn, placed on a small island, between a tennis court and 
Champlain's Gas Bar & Marina, which commemorates his passage and quotes 
from his 
journal: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Samuel de Champlain<BR> 
by canoe<BR> 
1615 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“As for me, I labour always to prepare a way for those willing to 
follow”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those willing to follow have embodied the institution of the Governor 
General in ways 
which have demonstrated the evolution and constant reaffirmation of this 
country. 
Canada's institutions have never been static. They are organic—evolving 
and growing in 
ways that surprise and even startle us. In a mere 30 years, between 1952 
and 1982, we 
repatriated the Governor Generalship and our Constitution. We adopted our 
flag, we 
formalized our understanding of Rights and we strengthened and expanded 
the bilingual 
nature of our country. The Governor General is one skein in the woven 
fabric of what 
Eugene Forsey characterised as our “independent sovereign 
democracy”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Champlain's successors have had many activists among them. Lord Elgin, who 
helped 
Baldwin and LaFontaine to anchor the Canadian model of democracy in 1848, 
stands out 
as somebody who appreciated the originality of a country which would 
promote such a 
project. He loved to wander about our few small cities, on foot, glorying 
in snowstorms, 
eschewing the formality of his office and speaking of his admiration for 
“this glorious 
country” and “its perfectly independent inhabitants”. He also said, that 
in order to have 
insight into the future of all nations, it was necessary to come here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Vincent Massey, our first Canadian Governor General, laid the groundwork 
for practically 
all of our modern cultural institutions—the Canada Council, the National 
Arts Centre, the 
Order of Canada, among others. And my predecessor, Roméo LeBlanc, 
reinforced the 
central fact of French Canada across this country, culminating in the 
success of last 
month's Summit that put New Brunswick and Acadia at the centre of the map of 
francophone reality. This was only fifty years after the great painter, 
Paul-Emile Borduas, 
had exhorted Quebec, and by implication, all of us, to abandon “the smooth 
and slippery 
walls of fear” by refusing “to act knowingly (or consciously)—beneath 
(our) psychic and 
physical possibilities.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me a moment of personal reflection. The Poy family, arriving here as 
refugees, in 
1942, was made up of my parents, my brother and myself. Three of us are in this 
Chamber today. We did not arrive as part of a regular immigration 
procedure. There was 
no such thing for a Chinese family at that time in Canadian history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My mother's intense and abiding love is here in spirit today. My brother, 
Dr. Neville Poy, 
was seven when we arrived. And my father, Bill Poy, is here—extraordinary, 
in his 92nd 
year. Lance-Corporal Poy, dispatch rider with the Hong Kong Volunteer 
Corps, received 
the Military Medal for his bravery during the battle of Hong Kong. Like 
many soldiers, he 
never speaks of those actions, but it is his bravery, which is the 
underpinning of his 
children's lives. To have been brought up by courageous and loving 
parents, was a gift 
that made up for all we had lost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said before, the city of Ottawa, then, was small and 
white—like 
most of 
Canada. Much of its psyche was characterised by what Mavis Gallant has 
called “the 
dark bloom of the Old Country—the mistrust of pity, the contempt for 
weakness, the fear 
of the open heart”. But it was also the place where our family was 
befriended by the 
Molots, who owned the local drugstore, the Marcottes and the Proulx, among 
whom we 
lived in Lower Town, and our guardian angels, the Potters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because my father had a job with the Department of Trade and Commerce and 
because 
we lived among French Canadians, I became fixated, from the age of five, 
with the idea 
of learning French. I remember the day when I was dressed up in my patent 
leather 
shoes and pink smocked dress, and was taken up the street by my parents to the 
convent of Ste. Jeanne d'Arc, where I was interviewed by a kindly woman 
wearing white 
all around her face, while a dim crucifix glowed in the background. 
Walking home, I 
sensed that there was dejection in the air and disappointment. It had been 
explained to 
my parents that it was not possible for a Protestant to receive French 
language education 
in Ottawa. In my lifetime, this has changed to such a radical degree that 
I don't even 
need to comment on it. But that early sense of something being impossible, 
which 
actually was nonsensical, put steel into me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farley Mowat has pointed out that a little adversity in childhood is a 
very good thing for 
animals—including human ones. Our family, like many others, had lost a 
great deal but 
we had also gained an enormous amount: a country with lakes, with small 
mouth bass 
and with free public education. We became addicted to the wilderness 
because, as Pierre 
Morency says, “Le nord n'est pas dans la boussole; il est ici”. 
[“The 
North is not on the 
compass. It is right here.”] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As John Ralston Saul has written, the central quality of the Canadian 
state is its 
complexity. It is a strength and not a weakness that we are a “permanently 
incomplete 
experiment built on a triangular foundation—aboriginal, francophone and 
anglophone”. 
What we continue to create, today, began 450 years ago as a political 
project, when the 
French first met with the aboriginal people. It is an old experiment, 
complex and, in 
worldly terms, largely successful. Stumbling through darkness and racing 
through light, 
we have persisted in the creation of a Canadian civilization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are constructing something different here. As Jean-Guy Pilon describes 
in one of his poems: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>«Racines tordues à vaincre le feu<BR> 
À cracher au visage des étoiles.<BR> 
C'est ici que respirent, grandissent<BR> 
les constructeurs». 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Tormented roots that defy the flames<BR> 
Spitting in the face of stars.<BR> 
Here the builders breathe, and grow.” (Translation) 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the opportunity to leave behind the useless blood calls of 
generations, now that 
we are in the new land that stretches to infinity. Wilfrid Laurier 
understood this clearly: 
“We have made a conquest greater and more glorious than that of any 
territory”, he said, 
“we have conquered our liberties”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There seem to be two kinds of societies in the world today. Perhaps there 
have always 
been only two kinds—punishing societies and forgiving societies. A 
society like 
Canada's, with its four centuries of give-and-take, compromise and 
acceptance, wrong-doing 
and redress, is basically a forgiving society. We try—we must 
try—to forgive what 
is past. The punishing society never forgets the wrongs of the past. The 
forgiving society 
works towards the actions of the future. The forgiving society enables 
people to behave 
well toward one another, to begin again, to build a society in hope and 
with love. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know, that in joining Canadian society, we will be able to accept the 
invitation, 
offered, in 1970, by Grand Chief John Kelly: “As the years go by, the 
circle of the Ojibway 
gets bigger and bigger. Canadians of all colours and religions are 
entering that circle. 
You might feel that you have roots somewhere else, but in reality, you are 
right here with 
us.” That the aboriginal circle enlarges to include all of us—native and 
immigrant—arriving 
by boat and plane to a vast and beautiful land, has been characterised by 
Michael 
Ondaatje, as a “vision of nature beyond the human ego”. This is a place, 
he said, “fixated 
by the preoccupying image of figures permanently travelling or portaging 
their past—we 
are all still arriving. From the Filles du Roy to Dionne Brand's new 
Canadians is a 
miniscule step”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not forget that this complexity is whole. To be complex does not 
mean to be 
fragmented. This is the paradox and the genius of our Canadian civilization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the contemplation of our wholeness, lies the symbolic importance of the 
Governor 
General: the identification of this post with inclusiveness—the 
inclusiveness that lies at 
the core of Canadian society, at its best. This is the essence of our 
notorious decency, 
our infamous desire to do good. And it is important to recall that with 
the great waves of 
immigration, there has been, since the beginning, an underlying motif: the 
lost, the 
rejected, and those who dreamed of another life would come here and would 
make a 
contribution to the whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a 1913 photograph, a group of Scandinavian immigrants in Larchmont, 
Ontario is 
huddled around a blackboard on which is written: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Duties of the Citizen 
</I></B></P><P align=left>1. Understand our government.<BR> 
</I></B></P><P align=left>2. Take an active part in politics.<BR> 
</I></B></P><P align=left>3. Assist all good causes.<BR> 
</I></B></P><P align=left>4. Lessen intemperance.<BR> 
</I></B></P><P align=left>5. Work for others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be easy to focus obsessively on all the pitfalls and prejudices 
that undoubtedly 
landmined this path of good intentions. But in examining the intent, you 
see the 
underlying central assumption. It was expected that the immigrant, along 
with everyone 
else, would join in the social process, which was democratic, co-operative 
and other-directed. 
The fact that it would take another 50 years for this kind of 
inclusiveness to 
become colour blind, means, simply, that it took another 50 years. Too 
long, of course. 
Far too long. But in other countries, it would take a hundred. In some, it 
has never come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The essence of inclusiveness is that we are part of a society in which 
language, colour, 
education, sex and money need not, should not divide us, but can make us 
more aware 
and sensitive to difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I learned to be a Canadian through a series of eternally virginal public 
school teachers, 
who treated me only as bright—and not bright yellow. They were mostly 
small-town 
Ontario women who, given some of our history might have been narrow-minded; but 
without exception they had the ability to reach out and understood, 
instinctively, the need 
for compassion and the stirring of imaginative curiosity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that my parents, like so many other immigrants, dreamed their 
children into 
being as Canadians. And, as the explorers pushed, every day, beyond the 
limits of their 
knowledge, what were Cavelier de la Salle, La Verendrye, Hearne and 
Mackenzie doing, 
if not imagining themselves spanning this astonishing space. Luckily, all 
of us came to a 
land where the aboriginal peoples have always dreamed life into being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is customary to talk about how hard immigrants work and how ambitious 
they are, but 
those of us who have lived that process, know that it is mainly the dream 
that counts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I'm not talking here of fantasy. I am talking of the true dream that is 
caught in the web of 
the past as it meets the wind of the future. All of us have this, even if 
we do not express 
it. This is what gives a nation, such as ours, its resonance, its depth 
and its strength. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The dream pulls us on and transforms us into Canadians. The dream gives us the 
strength to avoid being stereotyped by the past or limited by the 
expectations of others. 
The dream brings openness, adventure and, of course, pain and confusion. 
But, as 
Leonard Cohen observes, “There is a crack in everything. That's how the 
light gets in”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the light that is in us, we have created a place of dynamic 
innovation. Innovation 
in political structures. New approaches toward social relationships, 
towards citizenship. 
Military innovation in peace keeping. Economic innovation in cutting edge 
industries, from 
the railway of 150 years ago to aeronautics, today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not see ourselves as a small country of 30 million people, 
floundering in a large 
land mass. We are among the healthiest, best-educated people in the world, 
with great 
natural riches. We have two of the world's great languages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not see ourselves as people who simply react to trends but as 
people who can 
initiate them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not see ourselves as people to whom things are done but as people 
who do 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our history demonstrates that we have the self-confidence to act and to 
act successfully. 
We can—when we trust ourselves—seize hold of the positive energy, 
flowing out of the 
choice we have made to be here and to continue what remains an unprecedented 
experiment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The streetcar our family often took on Sunday afternoons to Rockliffe 
Park, used to pass 
the closed gates of Rideau Hall. I'm so glad that has changed. I'm 
delighted that crowds 
of people now come through the grounds and the Visitor Centre. I look 
forward to 
continuing the tradition of welcoming Canadians to what is, in effect, 
your national house. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But we will not always be in Ottawa. John and I intend to travel and 
re-travel this whole 
country by plane, train, car, canoe and kayak. We are initiating the 
holding of a public 
levee in each province and territory we visit. You are all invited. In ten 
days we will be in 
Alberta for our first official provincial trip. Our first levee will be 
held on Saturday, October 
16th at 4 p.m. at the Museum of the Regiments in Calgary. In November, we 
will be in 
British Columbia and our levee will be on Sunday, November 21st in Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to meet as many of you as we can, not only on special occasions at 
Rideau Hall 
and at La Citadelle in Quebec City, but where you live and make your lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We bring to this new work, a deep commitment to the relationship between 
francophone 
and anglophone, which is the essential and central fact of our political 
history. We have 
already long-established, personal interests in French immersion 
schooling, shelter for 
the fragile in our society and human rights. And I am committed, as I have 
always been, 
to affirming and furthering the full expression of that more than half of 
society to which I 
belong—a group which modestly calls itself women. We also have a history 
of deep 
involvement in and love for the arts. Beauty and excellence are not the 
property of a 
select group. They are the means by which we most profoundly express our 
society and 
they belong to every one of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I take up this task, I ask you to embark on a journey with me. 
Together, I hope that we 
will be able to do it with the Inuit quality of isuma, which is defined as 
an intelligence that 
includes knowledge of one's responsibility towards society. The Inuit 
believe that it can 
only grow in its own time; it grows because it is nurtured. I pray that 
with God's help, we, 
as Canadians, will trace with our own lives, what Stan Rogers called 
“one 
warm line 
through this land, so wild and savage”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And in the footsteps of Samuel de Champlain, I am willing to follow 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jean Chrétien<BR> 
Prime Minister of Canada 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At The Installation Ceremony of Governor General<BR> 
Adrienne Clarkson 
</I></B></P><P align=left>October 7, 1999<BR> 
Ottawa, Ontario 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Your Excellency, Madame Adrienne Clarkson. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to offer the best wishes of the Government, Parliament and people 
of Canada as you take the oath of 
office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to express appreciation to the Right Honourable Romeo 
LeBlanc and Mrs. Fowler LeBlanc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With quiet dignity and abiding good grace, they have left an indelible 
mark on this high office. Especially through 
the creation of the Governor General's Caring Canadian Awards, which now 
give long overdue honour to our 
voluntary sector. Those countless Canadians whose daily acts of generosity 
and compassion are the strongest fibre 
of our national character. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When he took office in 1995, this proud Canadian became the first Acadian 
to serve as Governor General. And I 
know that the opportunity to participate in the 8th Summit of La 
Francophonie in his native New Brunswick at the 
end of his mandate gave him special pleasure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was touched by his show of pride at the historic meeting between French 
President Jacques Chirac and our 
Acadian community. At the emotional way that Mr. Chirac renewed the 
unbreakable bond of fraternity that connects 
Acadians with the home of our ancestors, and praised the exemplary 
accomplishments of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that for Mr. LeBlanc this was truly a moment to savour in a long 
career of public service to Canadians. One 
that has known many, many high points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ladies and gentlemen, we are gathered to honour a person of singular 
talent, discernment and achievement. Who 
today becomes the representative of our Head of State in Canada. Whose 
selection as Governor General is just one 
more remarkable stop in an incredible personal journey. One that began as 
a little girl in a refugee boat heading for 
Canada. Fleeing the dispossession and cruelty of a terrible war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From this uncertain beginning, the arc of her life has taken a steady 
upward course. An arc that has run parallel with 
the development of the Canada we know today. A cosmopolitan nation. At 
home with our diversity. Comfortable 
acknowledging the rights of all of our citizens. Willing to give those 
rights full recognition in our laws and 
institutions. In practice as well as theory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She and her family were initially turned away when they sought refuge in 
Canada. Because they were Chinese. Her 
presence here today tells us how far we have come as a nation. A nation 
built by immigrants. By those who sought 
our national dream and our safe haven. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not for me to tell Canadians what they already know about Madame 
Clarkson. Her list of accomplishments as a 
journalist and commentator speaks for itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I would like to say a few words about that special quality that makes 
her so worthy of this office at this time in 
our history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We live in a time of globalization. Of a global village. In which people 
and nations are coming together as never 
before. Across time-zones, borders and cultures. And in which we wonder 
what place there will be for diversity. 
What room to protect and nurture unique voices and experiences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As few others, Madame Clarkson has sensed the essential harmony in that 
distinctive blend of voices and 
experiences that gives Canadian culture its unique flavour. Blessed with 
extraordinary insight, she has put her gifts 
to work creating venues of expression for our artists, musicians and 
writers. From every corner of our great land. 
From all backgrounds and walks of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has been a high act of public service. A moving statement of 
affection for her adopted country. And a powerful 
qualification for the duties that she is about to undertake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Above all, I believe that her selection as Governor General sends a 
powerful message. One that makes clear our 
resolve as a nation to ensure that our voices and our stories remain a 
vibrant part of our shared experience. And a 
vital aspect of a strong and distinctive Canadian presence in the global 
village. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ladies and gentlemen, we are coming to the close of the 20th century. A 
great and a terrible century. One of bright 
dreams and dark nightmares. When we often had reason to wonder whether 
there was any hope for the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For me, the success of Canada has been about proving—to ourselves and 
the world—that there is always hope. For a 
brighter tomorrow. For new opportunity. For tolerance and understanding. 
Madame Clarkson, your experiences and 
success fortify me in this belief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of all Canadians, I thank you for accepting these new 
responsibilities. And I also wish to extend my 
thanks and best wishes to Mr. Saul. I know he will be an able companion in 
the days to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish you every success in the service of the best country in the world.
