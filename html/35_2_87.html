<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="ANACTTOREVOKETHECONVICTIONOFLOUISDAVIDRIEL">AN ACT TO REVOKE THE CONVICTION OF LOUIS 
DAVID RIEL</A></H3>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ)</B> 
moved that Bill C-297, an act to revoke the conviction of Louis 
David Riel, be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, I think that today is a great day for our 
country as we begin debate at second reading of Bill C-297, an act 
to revoke the conviction of Louis David Riel.
<P>
	In presenting this bill, I was not carried away by my imagination. 
I am following in the path of a number of colleagues from different 
political parties who have, over a period of many years, taken 
various steps that should help us finally bring about a resolution to 
a longstanding paradox: Riel has been recognized as one of the 
Fathers of Confederation, but, legally, he remains a criminal 
sentenced for high treason.
<P>
	Louis David Riel played a very important role in the history of 
Canada. Among other things, he is considered one of the founders 
of the province of Manitoba, and the person principally responsible 
for its subsequent entry into Canadian Confederation. He was, at 
the time, a very strong voice for the west. Without his intervention, 
the federal government of the time would have turned the present 
western provinces into territories run by governors appointed by 
Ottawa.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	It was thanks to him that Canada pushed back its frontiers to the 
Far North and then to the Pacific. In 1871, he organized the 
resistance to the American invasion that allowed the country to 
consolidate its borders. He was the first to defend the rights of the 
Métis, the first nations and francophones.
<P>
	The House of Commons recognized Louis David Riel's, and I 
quote: ``deep devotion to his people and his willingness to pay the 
ultimate price of his life to help his people''.
<P>
	The question of Louis David Riel has quite a history in the House 
of Commons. Let us take a brief look at the various actions taken.
<P>
	On September 23, 1983, the Conservative member for Edmonton 
East, William Yurko, tabled Bill C-691, an act to grant a pardon to 
Louis David Riel. On March 14, he tried again with Bill C-228, but 
with no more success.
<P>
	On June 28, 1984, there was Bill C-257 and, on December 13, 
1984, Bill-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The hon. member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot on a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, would it be possible to ask my 
colleagues from the Reform Party to keep the noise down a bit 
while my colleague, the member for Rimouski-Témiscouata is 
speaking.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I am sympathetic to the 
request, but it is not a point of order as such. The House notes the 
intervention of the hon. member and we hope that the debate will 
go on according to the parliamentary practice of the House. The 
hon. member for Rimouski-Témiscouata.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> With Bill 
C-257 on June 28, 1984 and Bill C-217 on December 13, 1984, Les 
Benjamin, the NDP member representing Regina-Lumsdon, 
called for the guilty sentence against Louis David Riel to be 
overturned.
<P>
	On November 28, 1985, on the occasion of the hundredth 
anniversary of the hanging of Louis Riel, the hon. member for 
Hamilton East, the present Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, asked the House for a posthumous pardon for 
Louis David Riel.
<P>
	I would like to read what the hon. member said on November 28, 
1985, and to adopt the words as my own: ``We are now in 
November and one hundred years have gone by since the hanging 
of Louis Riel. I now ask that this Conservative government 
exonerate the victim of the conspiracy of another Conservative 
government.
<P>
	For one hundred years, politicians and historians have shown 
that the government purposely misrepresented the events known 
today as the Riel Rebellion. Letters and  diaries of the participants 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5448"> 5448 </A></B>
<P>
and observers reveal the use of unethical tactics to obtain political 
benefits from the rebellion.
<P>
	In a letter from the Marquis of Landsdowne to Prime Minister 
Macdonald on August 18, 1885, the Marquis wrote: ``You regard 
the recent outbreak in the Northwest as merely `domestic trouble', 
which should not be elevated to the rank of a rebellion. I am afraid 
we have all of us been doing what we could to elevated it to the 
rank of a rebellion and with so much success that we cannot now 
reduce it to the rank of a common riot''.
<P>
	The reason for the Macdonald government's promotion of a 
common riot to a full blown rebellion was to win additional 
funding for the near bankrupt Canadian Pacific Railway. While the 
CPR benefited from the events of the summer of 1985, a Métis 
leader was hanged. Louis David Riel, who died unnecessarily, 
deserves to be exonerated by the Government and recognized as a 
victim of wrongdoing.''
<P>
	On September 16, 1987, another NDP member, Nelson Riis, 
representing Kamloops, adopted the idea of his colleague as his 
own, and tabled Bill C-265. On October 13, 1989, Bob Skelly, the 
member for Comox-Alberni, also NDP, tabled a motion calling 
for recognition of Louis David Riel as one of the Fathers of 
Confederation.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	On March 9, 1992, the House of Commons was to take an 
important step. On that day, the hon. member for Yellowhead, Joe 
Clark, who was then Minister of Constitutional Affairs in Brian 
Mulroney's Conservative government, obtained the unanimous 
consent of the House for the following resolution:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Pursuant to order made Monday, March 9, 1992, the following motion was 
deemed moved and adopted:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House take note that the Métis people of Rupert's Land and the North 
Western Territory through democratic structures and procedures took effective steps 
to maintain order and protect the lives, rights and property of the people of the Red 
River;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House take note that, in 1870, under the leadership of Louis Riel, the 
Métis of the Red River adopted a List of Rights;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House take note that, based on the List of Rights, Louis Riel negotiated

the existing aboriginal and treaty rights of the Métis;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House take note that since the death of Louis Riel, the Métis people have

of Manitoba and his contribution in the development of Confederation; and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House support by its actions the true attainment, both in principle and 
practice, of the constitutional rights of the Métis people.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	On November 16, 1994, I followed the lead of my NDP 
colleagues and introduced Bill C-288, requesting the revocation of 
the conviction of Louis David Riel.
<P>
	On February 22, 1996, in answer to a letter from Mr. Ron Swain, 
President of the Ontario Métis Nation, the Minister of Natural 
Resources, who was also responsible for Métis issues, noted that a 
number of steps had already been taken to recognize Louis Riel's 
contribution to Canada's development: stamp offerings, tributes in 
the form of statues and cultural performances, and a resolution 
passed by the House in 1982, recognizing Riel's unique and 
historic role as a founder of Manitoba. She noted the $150,000 
contribution by the federal government for the new statue of Riel in 
front of the Manitoba legislature. The minister ended her letter by 
saying, and I quote: ``I would nevertheless wish to assure you that 
the federal government will continue, in the future, to listen to the 
views of the Métis''.
<P>
	On May 12, 1996, at the unveiling ceremonies of the new statue 
of Louis Riel in front of the Manitoba legislature, the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, the hon. member for Winnipeg South Centre, said, 
and I quote: ``For all Canadians, Riel was a Father of 
Confederation. Promises were made to the Métis that were not 
kept. As long as I am in a position of power, I will try to make sure 
that the Métis have full and equal participation in this country''.
<P>
	On June 4, 1996, I made another attempt and introduced Bill 
C-297, again to request the revocation of the conviction of Louis 
David Riel.
<P>
	Mr. Ron Swain, President of the Ontario Métis Nation, wrote to 
the Prime Minister asking him to support the bill. The Minister of 
Natural Resources, answering this letter on behalf of the Prime 
Minister, said, and I quote:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``As part of the process of healing the wounds created by the 
historical events surrounding the life of Louis Riel to which you 
have referred, please be assured that the federal government 
remains committed to pursuing various avenues to recognize Mr. 
Riel's place in Canadian history.''

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I understand that my colleague, the hon. Anne McLellan who, as federal 
interlocutor, deals with Métis issues, will be writing to you in response to your 
petition to her and the Prime Minister on this issue to assure you that the federal

Mr. Riel's place in Canada's history. To that commitment I should like to add my 
own personal assurance that I will be supportive of these initiatives as they are 
developed.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>Translation</I>]

	The Secretary of State for Training and Youth replied to Mr. 
Swain in a handwritten note, and I quote:

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Further to your letter of June 7, 1996 on the issue of Louis Riel and setting the 
record straight, I will get back to you with a further update on what is happening. I 
am committed to doing something soon.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	But who is this man who, 152 years after his birth and 111 years 
after his death by hanging, is still talked about with so much 
passion?
<P>
	Louis Riel was born in St-Boniface on October 22, 1844 as the 
son of Louis Riel, a Metis, and Julie de Lagimonière, the daughter 
of the first white woman to give birth in the North-West. He was 
the oldest of 11 children in a very close and deeply religious family. 
His grandfather had settled at Red River at the beginning of the 
19th century and married a Metis woman named Marguerite 
Boucher.
<P>
	A gifted child, he studied at the Petit Séminaire de Montréal 
from 1858 to 1865. Louis David Riel was a good student, always 
among the first in his class. He learned Greek, Latin, French, 
English and Cree. He also received an education outside of school 
since he lived at the Manoir de Terrebonne belonging to Mrs. 
Masson, a high society lady who owned a complete library that had 
been built up by the famous Louis Joseph Papineau.
<P>
	After his father died, Riel quit school and worked at Sir George 
Étienne Cartier's law firm. Two or three years later, he returned to 
Red River where he would play an important role in protecting the 
rights not only of the Metis but of all the citizens of Red River. At 
that time, the colony's population was estimated at 12,000 and far 
from homogeneous. In addition to a majority of French speaking 
Roman Catholic Metis, who engaged in buffalo hunting, there were 
English speaking Anglican Metis, who worked the fields, and 
Scottish Presbyterian settlers.
<P>
	Despite their different languages, religions and lifestyles, these 
groups had learned to live together in a bilingual climate, but 
Ottawa's territorial ambitions combined with the attitude of some 
newcomers would upset this delicate balance. These extremists' 
strategy was to provoke a civil war in the colony and blame the 
Metis so as to destroy their political power.
<P>
	As a result of his two fights in 1869 and 1885, Louis David Riel 
became the symbol of a linguistic and cultural minority whose 
survival rights were ignored for a long time and are still threatened, 
and of the struggle waged by Western settlers who were concerned 
above all with being free and communing with nature so as to 
prevent civilization from disrupting their lifestyle.
<P>
	Unfortunately, Riel has sometimes been portrayed as a traitor or 
a madman. He was a founder of Manitoba and was elected three 
times to the House of Commons. He was a spokesperson for his 
community and fought racism by championing human rights.
<P>
	Basically, Louis Riel was hanged all those years ago because he 
had fought for rights which are now generally recognized as 
legitimate: the right of any people to govern itself, with universal 
suffrage and responsible government; the right of the Metis to own 
property, which much be recognized and respected; the recognition 
of the Metis as a nation and a distinct society; the right of the Metis 
to have their own language and religion, a right recognized by 
granting bilingual status to their laws and courts, and a dual 
denominational school system.
<P>
	The rights claimed by this native leader at the time have, for the 
most part, been inscribed in the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms of 1982. Riel fought vigorously for the rights of the 
Metis and successfully conveyed the concerns the first western 
Canadians had. He embodied the dreams of the Metis and instilled 
in all native peoples the desire to fight for their dreams and beliefs.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	A growing number of western Canadians are realizing that Riel 
was the first to defend western Canada against the central 
government and a forerunner of the movements opposing central 
Canada's economic and political power.
<P>
	We are not asking that history be rewritten. What is done is done, 
and Riel is dead. But the memory of Louis Riel is alive and, for that 
reason, he must be cleared. Precedents exist around the world 
where innocent victims, often political opponents sentenced for 
reasons of state, have been pardoned.
<P>
	In the letter containing his last wishes, Louis David Riel asked to 
be given a simple funeral and surrounded with the comfort of 
religion. ``Far be it from me and my mortal remains to seek 
vengeance. I forgive those who have been so unfair to me''.
<P>
	Motions to pardon Louis Riel have been tabled in this House by 
Conservative, Liberal, NDP and Bloc Quebecois members. On 
March 10, 1992, this House unanimously passed a resolution 
recognizing that  ``Louis riel paid with his life for his leadership in 
a movement which fought for the maintenance of the rights and 
freedoms of the Métis people''. All the parties represented in this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5450"> 5450 </A></B>
<P>
Parliament must now unite not to restore the great Canadian that 
Louis David Riel was to life but to restore the dignity he was 
stripped of.
<P>
	I would like to conclude with this poem by Manie Tobie:
<P>
	Fils d'un rugueux pays, écoute, prête l'oreille,<BR>
 	Jamais tu ne croirais une chose pareille.<BR>
	Certes, après tout ce temps, la terre parle de toi.
<P>
	Et ton souvenir cause partout l'émoi.<BR>
 	Tu passes pour un héros, mais plus souvent rebelle.<BR>
	La mention de ton nom fait surgir la querelle,<BR>
 	Ou bien l'admiration. Difficile labeur?<BR>
 	Resteras-tu vaincu? Deviendras-tu vainqueur?<BR>
	Se rappelant encore, on traîne ta mémoire,<BR>
 	On te rend innocent en admettant ta gloire,<BR>
	Hélas! beaucoup trop tard arrive l'amnistie.<BR>
 	Ceux qui au bout des ans t'auront enfin connu,
<P>
	Regretteront toujours que tu fus le pendu.<BR>
 	Si ce n'était pas toi, qui donc commit le crime,<BR>
 	Dont tu fus par erreur l'innocente victime?<BR>
	Le sang crie, cher riel: la force est dans l'union.<BR>
 	Et ceux qui croient en toi te donnent encore raison.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (St. Boniface, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to take part in today's debate and I want to 
congratulate the hon. member who just spoke on this important 
initiative.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I take pleasure in addressing this House on a matter very dear to 
the hearts of the Metis people of this country and one that is of 
significant importance to all Canadians. Clearly it is a matter of 
great interest to this government as well. I applaud what appears to 
be at first glance a laudable objective.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	-to recognize the injustices suffered by Louis Riel and to 
correct the situation.
<P>
	However, a number of questions were raised. Can we actually do 
what is being proposed here today? Can the legislative branch of 
the government overlook a judicial decision? This is a 
constitutional issue. Is this bill supported by a majority of Metis 
people in Canada?
<P>
	The hon. member's initiative is laudable but, given the Bloc's 
vision, some wonder whether it is a ploy to make the agenda of the 
Bloc and the Parti Quebecois more palatable. Is the hon. member a 
pawn for the separatists forces? I am not saying this to be mean. 
However, we are well aware that the Bloc's vision is different from 
that of the other political parties. This issue must be raised here in 
this House, otherwise we would be denying reality.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Parliament is being asked today to do something which it may or 
may not be able to do, to revoke the conviction of Louis Riel. It can 
do so, but is it constitutionally solid? Will it stand? Could it be 
contested? Those are questions we need to raise.
<P>
<B>(1125 )</B>
<P>
	I have conducted considerable research in this area. I have 
discussed Louis Riel and the constitutional implications of what is 
being proposed with the finest experts in the land. There is a great 
deal of debate. It seems, according to certain authorities, that a 
legislative revocation of the conviction may in fact be invalid. It 
may be unconstitutional.
<P>
	It would appear, according to those same sources, that it would 
be highly unlikely that a judicial overturning would stand up in the 
courts or would stand up to that kind of challenge. It might be 
improper since it may be a breach of the constitutional divide 
between the legislature and the judiciary.
<P>
	Hon. members know that some eight private members' bills 
have been tabled in the House since 1978 on the matter of Louis 
Riel. A considerable amount of parliamentarians' energy continues 
to be expended trying to find ways to heal the unfortunate events of 
the past while also trying to find appropriate ways to honour Louis 
Riel's contribution to the building of Confederation.
<P>
	I have been among those who have been proud to speak out on 
this matter. For example, in 1995 while debating this issue, I 
suggested that we form an all-party committee with an MP from 
each political party to determine whether this bill was feasible or 
whether there was a more appropriate option. I was not able to find 
unanimity to proceed in that way. I wanted to discuss what might 
be the best course of action for which we could find unanimous 
consent.
<P>
	I have worked with certain authorities such as the Library of 
Parliament. I have held discussions with people of St. Boniface, my 
riding, where Louis Riel is buried, with ministers of justice and the 
solicitor general on this issue, including our senior minister for 
western Canada, the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	I also had the opportunity to speak on this matter in 1992 when I 
supported the resolution:
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``That this House recognize the unique and historic role of Louis Riel as a founder 
of Manitoba and his contribution in the development of Confederation; and that this 
House support by its actions the true attainment, both in principle and practice, of the 
constitutional rights of the Metis people''.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5451"> 5451 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I supported this motion. I even requested that we take a further 
step.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I said that, in a spirit of justice, we should go a step further and 
``recognize Louis Riel not only as the founder of Manitoba but as a 
Father of Confederation''.
<P>
	As you can see, I strongly support the idea of clearing Louis 
Riel, and I support the principle underlying the bill. However, as I 
said earlier, I am somewhat concerned about where it could lead us.
<P>
	I find it ironical that a political party has once again tabled a 
private member's bill, allegedly to settle the issue of Louis Riel's 
conviction, but which essentially seeks to take advantage of the 
circumstances surrounding this case to possibly build a wall 
between English and French Canadians, something that would be 
unfortunate.
<P>
	I am not the only one concerned. In a letter to the Prime Minister 
regarding this bill, the president of the Metis National Council, 
Gérald Morin, said, and I quote:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	First of all, there is a reference. I have it here and I want to make 
sure I read it correctly.
<P>
	He says that he has been encouraged and pleased by the 
productive dialogue that has been initiated and promoted by the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Natural Resources 
covering a wide range of Metis concerns, including the exoneration 
of Louis Riel and the appropriate recognition of Riel as a Father of 
Confederation. The Minister of Foreign Affairs has stated that he 
wishes this dialogue be about correcting the wrongs of the past with 
respect to the Metis people. At the unveiling of the Louis Riel 
statue in Winnipeg on May 12, 1996 he added: ``Promises were 
made to the Metis that were not kept. As long as I am in a position 
of power I will try to make sure the Metis have full and equal 
participation in this country''.
<P>
	The letter from the Metis National Council, written by Gerald 
Morin, continues: ``We have grave concerns about the potential 
negative impact of the bill. While the goal of the bill appears 
positive, we are concerned about its potential use as a tool by those 
who are intent on breaking up Canada. To in any way allow this to 
occur would be a travesty to the vision of Louis Riel, which was for 
a strong and united Canada and a homeland where the rights of all 
people, including French language rights, were assured.''
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	Members will know that Louis Riel negotiated the terms of 
admission of Manitoba into Confederation, the Manitoba Act, 
which provided for certain guarantees for Metis people, including 
schooling and religious rights as well as recognition of French and 
English language  rights. The rights of other citizens were also 
clearly set out.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Such was Louis Riel's vision of a united country in which all 
would participate equally.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Louis Riel was then elected three times by acclamation to the 
House of Commons.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Riel was an eloquent speaker. He was a staunch protector of the 
rights of the Metis and, in fact, of all members of the community, 
aboriginal and non-aboriginal, anglophones and francophones.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Louis Riel's fate has long been a heavy burden for his family and 
for all Metis people. We must find a solution and a way to 
recognize his importance and the injustices that he faced.
<P>
	Is this the way to proceed? I do not know. We need a solution that 
would be supported by all parties and by the Metis people, for this 
is ultimately, I believe, what we should all want, the rehabilitation 
of Louis Riel. What does it mean? It means recognizing the fact 
that he would not have been convicted of treason had he received a 
trial according to the standards of fairness normally upheld. 
Clearly we could say that. We could come to some agreement and 
the Metis people of Canada would agree that is so.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	His role in the history of Canada is of such importance that he 
deserves to be called a Father of Confederation. This is what 
``clearing'' means. This is what Metis people and Riel's 
descendants want. Surely, we have the authority here, as a political 
structure, to do precisely what I just suggested, perhaps in more 
eloquent terms, and to rehabilitate Mr. Riel, the Father of 
Manitoba, to be sure, but also a Father of Confederation, of 
Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to speak to Bill C-297 to revoke the conviction of Louis 
Riel.
<P>
	In discussing the merits of this bill, there is one thing to which 
we can all agree, and that is the important contribution made by 
Louis Riel to the building of this great nation.
<P>
	Louis Riel played a key role and was an important contributor to 
Confederation. Louis Riel had a vision for this country over 100 
years ago. He was a man of action, a man who looked to the future. 
If Mr. Riel were with us today he would say: ``Let us look to the 
future. Let us build a society where the Metis people can take their  
rightful place in society, standing shoulder to shoulder with all 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5452"> 5452 </A></B>
<P>
others''. He would be urging us to focus our energies on finding 
solutions to our present day problems and building for a better 
future.
<P>
	With that in mind, I would like to spend a few minutes talking 
about what the federal government is doing today to advance the 
interests of Metis and off reserve aboriginal people. As many 
members are aware, the Minister of Natural Resources fulfils the 
role of federal interlocutor for Metis and non-status Indians in 
addition to her other ministerial duties. In that role the minister acts 
as a point of first contact and where necessary as a facilitator 
between Metis and non-status Indians and the appropriate federal 
ministers and departments.
<P>
<B>(1135 )</B>
<P>
	In addition to that role, she oversees the federal government's 
participation in the tripartite self-government process, which is the 
forum being used to negotiate self-government with Metis and off 
reserve aboriginal groups within the context of the Canadian 
Constitution.
<P>
	As many members are aware, on August 10, 1995 the federal 
government announced its approach to the implementation of the 
inherent right and the negotiation of self-government for aboriginal 
people, including Metis and off reserve aboriginal people. The 
federal approach contemplates various practical ways of 
implementing self-government for Metis and off reserve aboriginal 
people, including the development of self-government institutions 
providing services, the devolution of programs and services and 
forms of public government all responsive to the needs of the Metis 
and of off reserve aboriginal people.
<P>
	The federal approach has provided a stronger mandate for the 
tripartite self-government process which will allow for progress to 
be made on the implementation of self-government.
<P>
	In that regard, I note that self-government processes are 
currently under way in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, 
Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. 
There have also been some preliminary discussions on the 
possibility of beginning an urban self-government process in 
Winnipeg.
<P>
	As part of the self-government framework announced last 
August, the federal government also committed to cost share with 
the provinces the enumeration of Metis and the identification of 
Indian people living off a land base or off reserve. Since the 
announcement of the federal approach the federal government has 
participated in and cost shared the development of a proposal for a 
Metis enumeration along with the province of Saskatchewan and 
the Metis Society of Saskatchewan.
<P>
	I understand the federal government is prepared to cost share this 
enumeration. Enumeration is very important as the information 
provided by an enumeration would prove very valuable in the 
implementation of self-government for Metis and off reserve 
aboriginal people.
<P>
	Before closing, I would like to mention one more important 
program through which the federal government works with Metis 
groups in an effort to meet their objectives. For the past several 
years the federal government has participated in bilateral processes 
respectively with the Metis National Council and the Congress of 
Aboriginal Peoples. Like the tripartite self-government process, 
the bilateral process is also managed from the federal perspective 
by the Minister for Natural Resources.
<P>
	The bilateral processes provide a forum for the congress and the 
council to discuss issues of utmost importance to them in their 
relationship with federal departments. The bilateral processes 
generally focus on issues such as self-government, access to 
program funding and the devolution of programs and services.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to return to my initial comments about 
Louis Riel, about the kind of man he was and what he would do in 
our situation. I believe he would urge us to keep our focus on the 
future and to continue to build on these self-government initiatives 
which I have just described.
<P>
	Louis Riel was a builder, within his community, within his 
province, within the nation of Canada. Indeed, Louis Riel was a 
member of Parliament, a man publicly commended by the 
Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba for his assistance to Canada in 
repelling an American invasion. He was working to build a society 
where his people could contribute to the important decisions that 
confront us all in building a better future.
<P>
<B>(1140 )</B>
<P>
	The federal approach to self-government, which I outlined 
earlier in my speech, of working together with the Metis people and 
off reserve aboriginal people will finally begin to finish the task 
that Riel began many years ago.
<P>
	For many years within society walls have divided the aboriginal 
and non-aboriginal communities. When we look back in history we 
see the efforts of Louis Riel and others to tear down those walls and 
create a society where all people, regardless of race, religion or 
language worked together to build a great nation.
<P>
	Today we must remember that legacy and take that message to 
heart as we continue to build this nation. We must continue with the 
Canadian values of tolerance, justice, fairness, working together, 
sharing and generosity to all people. Canada is big enough for all 
people regardless of the differences. By working together and 
seeking to understand the tragedies of the past, the divisions that 
exist will be avoided. We will be able to begin the process of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5453"> 5453 </A></B>
<P>
tearing down the walls and building  an inclusive society where all 
people can feel fully and properly a part of that society.
<P>
	The federal and provincial governments together with all people 
within the nation working together will be able to build this great 
society, a society that Louis Riel had in mind, the society that he 
fought hard to protect, a society that he wanted to see, a society 
where all of us could live in shared dignity and mutual respect.
<P>
	Let us not forget the work of Louis Riel. Let us not forget his 
vision. Let us not forget the work he did to bring this about. Let us 
never let go of the dream of a country where Canadian values will 
be first and foremost in all of our minds. Let us, in all we say and 
do, honour the memory of a very courageous man, a leader and a 
true Canadian.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
privilege and an honour this morning to be able to speak about 
revoking the conviction of Louis David Riel for high treason and 
restoring his memory here in this House.
<P>
	I listened to the speech of my colleague, the hon. member for 
Rimouski-Témiscouata, who has, in my view, done a good job of 
laying out for us the life-I was going to say the work-of Louis 
Riel. I have also just listened to the speech of my Liberal colleague, 
who, in his turn, has emphasized the important human qualities 
shown by Louis Riel during his unfortunately all too brief 
existence.
<P>
	But, at the same time, I cannot but deplore the fact that the 
member who should perhaps, of all the members in this House, 
have the greatest interest in this subject, the member from 
Manitoba, has not taken the lead in supporting the bill before us 
with more vigour, resolve and determination.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	What is this bill about? I think it would be appropriate at this 
time to reread it for the benefit of the House and also for the benefit 
of viewers. This is a bill to revoke the conviction of Louis David 
Riel.
<P>
	Louis David Riel, it should be remembered, was a member of the 
House of Commons for the electoral district of Provencher from 
1873 to 1874. He was convicted of high treason on August 1, 1885, 
sentenced to death, and hanged on November 16, 1885 at Regina, 
then part of the North West Territories.
<P>
	The second whereas recalls that, notwithstanding his conviction, 
Louis David Riel has become a symbol and a hero to successive 
generations of Canadians who have, through their governments, 
honoured and commemorated him in specific projects and actions. 
Finally, the third whereas of this bill points out quite rightly that it 
is consistent with this recognition that the conviction of Louis 
David Riel be now revoked.
<P>
	The bill would therefore have Her Majesty, by and with the 
advice and consent of the other Chamber and of this Chamber, 
revoke the conviction of Louis David Riel for the offence of high 
treason, while recognizing that nothing in this Act shall be 
construed as limiting or reflecting in any manner Her Majesty's 
royal prerogative of mercy or the <I>Letters Patent Constituting the 
Office of Governor General</I> relating to pardons.
<P>
	This is not, as you know, the first time this subject has been 
raised in the House. I would like to point out that, on November 28, 
1985, the Liberal member for Hamilton East asked the 
Conservative government of the day, through the Speaker of this 
House, to exonerate the victim of the conspiracy of another 
Conservative government, that victim of course being Louis Riel.
<P>
	That hon. member, who is still sitting in this House, more or less 
committed herself in 1985 to supporting the pardon of Louis Riel. 
Now once again she has the opportunity of putting her good 
intentions of 11 years ago into deeds. I trust that, even if her seat is 
not on the line, this time, she will follow up on it.
<P>
	Just to show how important this case is, and how often it has 
been brought up in the House, as well as to stress the point that this 
ought to be the very last time it is brought up in the House-and the 
only way that can happen is if this bill is passed-may I point out 
that, in the past, many other people in the House have shared the 
same concern we have today.
<P>
	On September 23, 1983, William Yurko, who was then the 
member for Edmonton East, introduced a bill to grant a pardon to 
Louis Riel. That bill was not followed up on. He tried again on 
March 14, 1984.
<P>
	On June 28, 1984, Les Benjamin, the NDP member for 
Regina-Lumsdon, called for the conviction of Louis David Riel to 
be revoked.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	On December 13, 1984, Mr. Benjamin tried again, followed on 
September 16, 1987 by another NDP member who is still among 
us, the hon. member for Kamloops, who again introduced a bill to 
revoke the conviction of Louis Riel.
<P>
	Today we have a bill introduced on November 16, 1994, and here 
we are nearly two years later. The hon. member for 
Rimouski-Témiscouata is now proposing a bill to revoke the 
convicition of Louis Riel.
<P>
	Louis Riel was a great man in his day, a man of conviction, a 
humanist. He held a vision, not only for the Métis people, but for 
all Canadians from sea to sea. It seems that he was not given the 
attention he deserved. The tenor of the times precipitated events, 
and trapped him in a process which, as others have already said, 
was a mistake on all sides but not, most certainly, an act of treason. 
What took place was an error.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5454"> 5454 </A></B>
<P>
	On many occasions over many years, the governments of all 
of the provinces have examined this issue. Many have adopted 
resolutions or motions aimed at his rehabilitation. But this House 
has not yet done what must be done. We find ourselves today with 
an opportunity to finally correct the course of history.
<P>
	I trust that the member from Manitoba who referred just now to 
letting some time pass will instead pick up the torch and be the first 
to lead all of us in the House to rehabilitate the memory of Louis 
David Riel.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, let me 
say at the outset that I can understand the sentiments lying behind 
Bill C-297, an act to revoke the conviction of Louis David Riel.
<P>
	Perhaps the most recognizable name in all of Canadian history, 
he was certainly the greatest leader ever produced by the Metis, the 
people whose history is woven together with that of western 
Canada. Yet modern historical research has demonstrated that Riel, 
in spite of his undeniable greatness, was afflicted with tragic flaws. 
To revoke his conviction more than 100 years after the fact glosses 
over those flaws in favour of a historically inaccurate portrait of the 
man and his age.
<P>
	Riel's greatest failing was his monumental vanity which is 
illustrated in a curious way in my hon. friend's bill. That bill is 
entitled ``an act to revoke the conviction of Louis David Riel''. In 
fact Riel was not baptised with the middle name David. Rather he 
adopted that name when he was about 30 years old and he always 
wrote it in quotation marks.
<P>
	He used the signature Louis David Riel to express his conviction 
that he was like the David of the Old Testament, a sacred priest 
king. Riel also called himself the ``prophet of the new world'' and 
``prophet, priest king and infallible pontiff''. He claimed to be the 
divinely inspired founder of a new religion which was to be a sort 
of higher stage of Roman Catholicism for the new world.
<P>
	Many of those who knew him thought he had gone insane when 
he started to issue these revelations. In fact, he was confined to 
insane asylums in the province of Quebec for almost two years 
from 1876 to 1878. Whether or not he was insane in the medical 
sense, he clearly saw himself as a divinely inspired prophet. This 
self-understanding was central to the movement he led in the 
Saskatchewan valley in 1885.
<P>
	He began the uprising by climbing the steps of the mission 
church at Batoche and proclaiming ``Rome has fallen''. The 
governing council of the Metis of Batoche declared Riel to be their 
official prophet with a right ``to direct the priests''. Even as the 
Canadian expeditionary force was advancing on Batoche, Riel and 
his council were debating religious innovations such as changing 
the sabbath from Sunday to Saturday.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	As I have said, opinions differ about his sanity. Several 
psychiatrists have written that he was mentally ill. Contemporary 
historians tend to see him more as a religious enthusiast and 
millenarian leader. Either way, little would be served by revoking 
his conviction in 1996. We can hardly argue that religious 
enthusiasts are not subject to the law. If we say he should not have 
been convicted because he was not responsible by reason of 
insanity, what message are we sending to the Metis? Does it help 
them if we label their greatest leader a lunatic?
<P>
	From a historical point of view, there is little doubt that in the 
context of his own day, Riel was properly convicted of treason. Let 
me expand on four reasons why I draw this conclusion.
<P>
	First, there is no doubt that Riel encouraged his followers to 
rebel against the crown. In addition to the testimony of many eye 
witnesses, we have documents in his own hand. Perhaps the most 
interesting is a short sentence that he wrote in French: ``La justice 
ordonne de prendre les armes''. One of his secretaries, William 
Henry Jackson, translated it into English: ``Justice commands to 
take up arms'', boldly underlining the phrase ``to take up arms''. 
These and similar texts will be found in the five volume set <I>The 
Collected Writings of Louis David Riel</I> published by the University 
of Alberta Press and edited by a team under the direction of the 
renowned historian George Stanley, who served as lieutenant 
governor of New Brunswick and who also designed Canada's flag.
<P>
	There is no legal defence for taking up arms against the 
sovereign. If the movement is successful, a new legal order is 
created but if it fails, the instigators will be charged with treason. 
That is why the great leaders of the American Revolution pledged 
to each other ``their lives, their fortunes and their sacred honour''. 
They knew they were taking a risk that transcended legality and 
that they would pay the supreme price if they failed. Louis Riel 
despite his failings had some of that same kind of courage. It does 
no credit to his memory to come asking for a posthumous pardon.
<P>
	I could add that my hon. friends in the official opposition may 
wish to keep all this in mind if they believe, as the Government of 
Quebec has said, that they can take Quebec out of Canada in 
defiance of the law and the Constitution.
<P>
	Second, Riel's motives in fomenting the northwest rebellion 
were mixed to say the least. Toward the end of 1884 he entered into 
behind the scenes negotiations with the federal government, 
volunteering to leave Canada if the government would pay him a 
large sum of money. He felt he was owed at least $100,000 as an 
indemnity for past services to Canada, but offered to leave for 
$35,000. He told this to Father Alexis André, Superior of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5455"> 5455 </A></B>
<P>
Oblate Missionaries at St. Laurent, and to D. H. MacDowall, 
member of the Northwest Territories Council from the district of 
Lorne.
<P>
	According to MacDowall, Riel said that if the government would 
consider his personal claims against them and pay him a certain 
amount in settlement of these claims, he would arrange to make his 
illiterate and unreasoning followers well satisfied with almost any 
settlement of their claims for land grants the government might be 
willing to make. Riel turned to violence only after it became clear 
that the government would not give him any money.
<P>
	Third, it is often said that taking up arms in the northwest 
rebellion was the last resort of desperate men. Their peaceful 
attempts to have their grievances resolved had all been ignored by 
an uncaring government.
<P>
	The truth however is very different. The Metis settlers of the 
Batoche area did have claims to press. Many of them had settled 
along the banks of the South Saskatchewan River while the survey 
was going on and they wanted their lots resurveyed from the 
standard rectangular system to long, narrow river lots. Also, they 
wanted a distribution of land and scrip for the Metis of the 
northwest similar to what had been done in Manitoba. The 
government was in the process of dealing with both claims.
<P>
	During the winter of 1884-85 the Department of the Interior sent 
an official to make a special study of the river lot claims along the 
South Saskatchewan River and the cabinet appointed a commission 
to enumerate claims for land and scrip across the northwest. It was 
the news of these measures that prompted Riel to turn to violence. 
He realized that if the government dealt with the real life 
grievances of the local people, his own future as a political leader 
would be over.
<P>
	Finally, Riel got a fair trial within the context of his own time 
and place. He was tried before a stipendiary magistrate and a jury 
of six as required by the Northwest Territories Act. There was no 
legal mechanism for trying him in any other way.
<P>
	Wellwishers in Quebec paid for him to be represented by 
outstanding talented lawyers. One, François-Xavier Lemieux, later 
became chief justice of the Supreme Court of Quebec. The other, 
Charles Fitzpatrick, served as chief justice of the Supreme Court of 
Canada. Riel also had two appeals, to the court of Queen's bench of 
Manitoba sitting en banc and to the judicial committee of the privy 
council in London.
<P>
<B>(1200 )</B>
<P>
	Louis Riel was a complex man. In speaking against the bill I 
have been forced to dwell on the negative side of his character and 
career. Of course there was a positive side as well. Riel saw that the 
days of the fur trade and buffalo hunt were coming to an end. He 
wanted to make a place for the Metis in the new society growing in 
the west. He saw his people not as aboriginal wards of the crown 
but  as British subjects or American citizens, depending on which 
side of the 49th parallel they lived.
<P>
	He wanted them to settle down as independent, self-sufficient 
farmers, not to be dependent on government handouts. He 
campaigned vigorously against the whiskey trade that was so 
debilitating to all native people.
<P>
	There are some things in Riel's legacy to admire and it is not 
surprising that the Metis people of today revere his memory, but 
nothing will be gained by this legislative attempt to rewrite history. 
Let us leave history to the historians.
<P>
	As members of Parliament, let us try to live up to the standard 
that was laid down by former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau when 
he said, quoting John F. Kennedy: ``We will be just in our time''. It 
is hard enough to do that without trying to take on the fruitless task 
of second guessing the justice of another era.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> We have only two minutes 
left for private members' business. I will now recognize the hon. 
member for Québec-Est.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Louis Riel question is a very emotional one for me. As I listened to 
the speech by the hon. member for the Reform Party, I wondered 
whether he really knows his history, because the judgment made 
against Louis Riel in 1885 was clearly unjust.
<P>
	Louis Riel was led before a jury of six anglophones and tried by 
an anglophone judge in Regina, as Donald Smith drove the last 
spike for the transcontinental railway. In that same year, French 
was banned in Manitoba. Louis Riel was, in fact, the victim of a 
miscarriage of justice that reflected the attitude to francophones at 
the time. People in Quebec knew that Louis Riel's cause was just 
and that by the last battle of Batoche, Riel was no longer a sane 
man.
<P>
	He was a victim of his own cause, just though it was, and 
Quebecers and francophones across the country were outraged by 
the decision made by a jury of six anglophones, negating the rights 
of Louis Riel. Despite the uproar this caused in Quebec, even John 
A. Macdonald, the Prime Minister of Canada at the time, said:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``All the dogs in Quebec can bark, but Louis Riel shall hang''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	John A. Macdonald said that. It was a way to punish the French 
fact in the west, although the rights of francophones were 
supposedly guaranteed. I may also point out to my dear colleagues 
from 
<P>

<B><A NAME="5456"> 5456 </A></B>
<P>
western Canada that subsequently the rights of francophones in 
Manitoba were abolished for one hundred years.
<P>
	The conviction of Louis Riel was unjust, unacceptable and 
unpardonable. If people want to reconcile Canada with its 
francophones, let them adopt, fairly and squarely, a formula to 
absolve or pardon Louis Riel.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The hour provided for the 
consideration of private members' business has now expired and 
the order is dropped to the bottom of the order of precedence on the 
Order Paper.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="YUKONQUARTZMININGACT">YUKON QUARTZ MINING ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from October 11 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-6, an act to amend the Yukon Quartz Mining Act 
and the Yukon Placer Mining Act, be read the third time and 
passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak today in support of Bill C-6, which 
is the result of approximately five years of negotiations in Yukon.
<P>
	A lot of people have expressed interest in Bill C-6 and many of 
them either wrote to the House Standing Committee on Aboriginal 
Affairs or testified before the committee when it recently held 
hearings on these proposed changes to the Yukon Quartz Mining 
Act and the Yukon Placer Mining Act.
<P>
	I want to begin my remarks today by praising those citizens who 
took the time and made the effort to communicate their views to all 
of us on the committee.
<P>
	Even more, I want to praise the many citizens who volunteered 
their time and effort over the years of discussion and debate in 
Yukon as well as the many organizations and businesses which had 
such a strong commitment to the democratic process as to fund 
participation in such a decision making process. The give and take 
of discussion, the responsibility to whatever interest group one is 
representing and, most of all, the awareness that the YMAC 
discussions would probably impact the economy of Yukon more 
than anything other than land claims, were a weighty load for them 
to carry and they deserve our praise for their efforts.
<P>
	YMAC stands for Yukon Mining Advisory Committee, the 
group which hammered out this agreement. It is almost entirely 
because of its efforts and the compromises which were reached in 
Yukon that the Reform caucus and I support Bill C-6. To state it 
simply, Bill C-6 represents a made in Yukon solution to Yukon 
problems. I do not want to see it changed to a made in Ottawa 
solution.
<P>
	Yukon has a relatively small population, estimated to have 
grown to 31,452 as of July 1, 1996. Major sectors of that 
population were involved in the YMAC decision which debated 
how to change Yukon's mining legislation to accommodate 
environmental concerns such as ensuring adequate reclamation of 
mining sites and placing deposits to guarantee that the work is 
completed.
<P>
	It was the recommendation of the House standing committee, 
just as it was the recommendation of the Government of Yukon 
representatives who testified before the committee, that Bill C-6 be 
passed as is with no amendments whatsoever. The reason for the 
importance of not meddling with Bill C-6 lies in the fact that 
YMAC reached a delicate balance about what should be done to 
accommodate those environmental and land use concerns 
surrounding the second most important primary economic 
generator in the Yukon Territory, mining.
<P>
	To show how important mining is for those folks in Yukon, one 
who appeared before the committee kindly sent me figures for the 
amount of gold from placer mining in Yukon from the first 
shipments in 1885-86 up to and including 1995, a total of 110 
years. The number of fine ounces of gold was 12.6 billion. In 
dollars which are current for the year when the gold was produced 
the value of the gold was $967,789,808,000. That does not mention 
jobs, personal and business taxes and the numerous spinoffs across 
the rest of the economy.
<P>
	If we look at the value of total mineral production in Yukon, not 
just placer gold, only in the recent decade from 1985 to 1995 we 
see a value of $3.4 billion, according to the 1995 Yukon review. 
This is despite the fact that 1993 and 1994 were very bad years and 
that 1995 barely returned to the level of 1986 for total mineral 
production.
<P>
	Mining means big money in Yukon in economic terms. Mining is 
called a primary economic generator. That means that it is not a 
spinoff from employment elsewhere as would be true, for example, 
of housing construction.
<P>
	Unfortunately, according to research supplied by the Library of 
Parliament, the biggest primary economic generator for Yukon is 
transfer payments from the federal government. As a percentage of 
provincial revenue, Yukon Territory received 58.3 per cent of its 
estimated income for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1996 from 
general purpose federal transfers plus an additional 12.8 per cent 
from specific purpose federal transfers for a total of 71.1 per cent 
of all Yukon government income.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	By comparison, my province of British Columbia for the same 
period received 12.6 per cent of its income from specific purpose 
federal transfers and nothing whatsoever for general purpose 
transfers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5457"> 5457 </A></B>
<P>
	By raising 87.4 per cent of its revenue from internal sources 
B.C. was second by two-tenths of a per cent to the province of 
Alberta. Sadly, Yukon falls far behind and I hope that is something 
that can turn around in the future.
<P>
	To see for myself and to deal directly with the people most 
involved in this legislation, this past summer I travelled around 
Yukon. I talked with many people there about Bill C-6 as well as 
other federal concerns. There is a lot of anxiety in Yukon in view of 
its huge dependence on Ottawa as to whether, in our present times 
of severe fiscal constraint, it will mean that the Government of 
Yukon as well as Yukon Indian bands have to stand on their own 
two feet financially.
<P>
	A great many people in Yukon told me in no uncertain terms that 
the only hope Yukon has of becoming more financially independent 
from these federal transfers is the industry of mining. Many people 
said they were afraid that Bill C-6 would damage the Yukon mining 
industry, especially the vulnerable placer mining, where many 
claims are worked in the short northern summers by dad and mom 
and perhaps an adult child or a couple of hired helpers.
<P>
	To see what the Yukon government revenue is like we might 
want to glance at the budget from last year. The 1995-96 budget 
estimated the territorial revenue would include $35.4 million from 
personal income tax, $10.3 million from corporate income tax and 
$7.1 million from fuel tax for a total of $52.8 million from its total 
revenue of $497.8 million.
<P>
	I have supplied my hon. colleagues with some statistical data so 
that they can understand the profound concern in Yukon about 
whether these proposed changes from Bill C-6 are going to create 
an administrative tangle that will seriously damage the Yukon 
mining industry.
<P>
	This legislation will be accompanied by many pages of new 
regulations and by a brand new process of obtaining permits for 
mineral exploration as well as getting a new mine into production. I 
raised these concerns during the departmental briefing provided 
last spring for the Reform Party by the Department of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development. It told me it was taking every 
precaution to ensure that Bill C-6 will not have a negative impact 
on Yukon mining.
<P>
	At the time I was inclined to believe those assurances from the 
department but that was prior to a shocking event which took place 
August 8 with regard to what could become Canada's first diamond 
mine in Yukon's neighbour, the Northwest Territories.
<P>
	To put what happened into perspective, my colleagues should be 
aware that in looking at provincial and territorial income, at the 
bottom of the heap in so far as paying for its own well-being stands 
the depressed economy of the Northwest Territories which received 
72.2 per cent of its 1995 income from general purpose federal 
transfers, plus 10.7 per cent for specific purpose transfers for a total 
of 82.9 per cent of the income of the Northwest Territories coming 
from federal transfers. That is a tragic number and I ask my hon. 
colleagues to bear in mind as well the 71.1 per cent for Yukon as a 
percentage for territorial income provided by federal government 
transfers.
<P>
	In both Yukon and the Northwest Territories jurisdiction over 
natural resources remains with the federal government although the 
northern accord gives the Northwest Territories more control over 
its energy resources. That gives Ottawa enormous control over the 
lives and activities of people in both territories. It is a profoundly 
serious responsibility which rests especially on the Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development.
<P>
	How has that minister discharged that enormous responsibility in 
the Northwest Territories? He has single handedly sent a very bad 
message to the international mining community. This is what 
happened. The BHP project has already invested about $200 
million in trying to open Canada's first diamond mine in the 
Northwest Territories. BHP Diamonds plans to employ a yearly 
average of 830 people across the 25-year life of its project and 
1,000 people during the construction. Two out of every three will 
very likely be northerners and one out of every three at least will be 
aboriginal.
<P>
<B>(1215 )</B>
<P>
	My colleagues will remember the figures I supplied to them 
earlier. Currently the federal government provides 82.9 per cent of 
the revenue of the Northwest Territories through general transfers 
and specific purpose transfers. By contrast, the Northwest 
Territories had a total 1995-96 estimated revenue of $1.2 billion of 
which only $92.9 million came from personal and corporate 
income taxes. If it were not for well paid government employees 
paying taxes, the Northwest Territories would have very little 
revenue of any kind today.
<P>
	Against the backdrop of that information I quote from an 
October 7 Calgary <I>Sun</I> article regarding the BHP diamond project: 
``During the exploration phase, 60 per cent of BHP's workforce 
were northerners and 25 per cent were aboriginal. That is a 
welcome change from NWT's dependence on government jobs or 
welfare and should the final project go ahead, the private sector 
will flourish in the Arctic.
<P>
	``The company has also trudged through the most excruciating 
and whimsical regulatory hurdles in the western world. It passed 
the arduous and intrusive federal environmental assessment review 
panel, a two-year trial. BHP's proposal is the only mining project 
except for uranium mines to ever complete such an investigation. 
BHP's environmental impact statement is eight volumes long and 
weighs 64 pounds. It went through the enviro-extremist wringer''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5458"> 5458 </A></B>
<P>
	The columnist then went on to describe in his own terms what 
happened on August 8 when it was supposed to be announced that 
BHP had passed the environmental review board. Instead: ```The 
federal government will negotiate a binding environmental 
agreement with the company,' Irwin announced to a startled BHP. 
They had after all met every existing requirement''.
<P>
	The columnist again attributed a direct quote to the Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development: ``The agreement will 
cover all of those issues not normally part of license terms and 
conditions''.
<P>
	The columnist then imagined the following comment from the 
minister: ```Forget the law', said Irwin. `I am the law. Sure you 
passed all our tests and paid all our fees but I want more'''. Then 
again the columnist attributed a direct quote to the minister: ``I will 
be assessing progress on the environmental and benefits agreement 
before signing the water licence for the project''. The columnist 
pointed out that the benefits agreement was voluntary in the first 
place.
<P>
	I understand that due to unsettled land claims, BHP embarked on 
the remarkable project of negotiating four separate voluntary 
socioeconomic agreements or so-called impact benefits 
agreements, also known as IBAs with the Treaty 11 Dogribs, the 
Treaty 8 Yellowknives Dene, the Metis and the Inuit of Kugluktuk.
<P>
	In view of Yukon land claims and Yukon self-government 
legislation, Bills C-33 and C-34, passed in the first session of the 
35th Parliament, we can all see the handwriting on the wall with the 
BHP project. We can see what a major mining development in the 
Yukon will quite possibly have to go through before the 
Government of Canada allows the brave would be developers to 
invest their dollars in Canada's north.
<P>
	That columnist in the Calgary <I>Sun</I> referred to the deadline 
imposed for all these additional totally unprecedented conditions 
being thrust on BHP as ``Irwin's 60-day temper tantrum''. I wish 
this issue was that simple.
<P>
	The columnist went on to raise some of the fundamental 
questions to which the BHP experience must inevitably lead the 
international mining community. What comes next? What other 
gimmicks can the minister of Indian affairs invent to gum up the 
works for this private investment group which has already sunk 
about $200 million into trying to start Canada's first diamond 
mine?
<P>
	The columnist raised a question with which I cannot help but 
agree: ``If the major spin-offs went to Montreal instead of 
Edmonton, do you think Irwin's personal agenda would be allowed 
to get in the way?''
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I have allowed the member 
to repeatedly mention one of our other colleagues by his name. I 
would ask his co-operation.
<P>
<B>(1220 )</B>
<P>
	Although these come from quotes, we cannot in the House do 
indirectly that we cannot do directly. I would ask his co-operation 
as much as possible to make the change to the appropriate portfolio 
the minister carries and try to avoid the member's name.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stinson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will try. The writer finishes his 
article by asking: ``How long will BHP and other potential 
investors stand for Canada's anti-business bias?''
<P>
	Let us be very clear about what has happened here. An 
international company, in partnership with a group of Canadians, 
has explored an area of the Northwest Territories. They have 
complied with every existing Canadian law. They plan to invest 
nearly $6 billion in a region of Canada that has been beset by 
tragically high unemployment and which basically exists on gifts 
from the rest of Canada.
<P>
	The Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development 
apparently wants to forget that part of his responsibilities stated in 
his title, namely that he is responsible for northern development. 
Instead, I believe the outrageous situation with the BHP diamond 
project will do serious damage to Canada's international reputation 
as a good place to invest mining exploration dollars.
<P>
	Canada has already lost its market share of those exploration 
dollars due to the whimsical, complex and disorganized regulatory 
climate for mining in Canada, despite the fact that the mining 
industry has been very willing to enforce high standards for 
environmental protection. The problem is not the protection of the 
environment. The problem appears to be a federal government 
more concerned about protecting the jobs of bureaucrats on the 
government payroll rather than protecting the environment.
<P>
	The BHP diamond project passed the toughest environmental 
review. Nevertheless and with no advance notice or negotiation, the 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development imposed 
additional conditions which are delaying the start of construction 
as the northern winter closes in.
<P>
	The last time I spoke to the minister no end was in sight. He ran 
roughshod over the investors involved. Is BHP's experience the 
norm of what international mining companies must face if they 
intend to invest in Canada?
<P>
	When we look at Bill C-6, the anxiety which was already felt 
about whether it would have a negative impact on Yukon mining 
has been intensified by the minister's inexcusable conduct 
regarding mining in the Northwest Territories.
<P>
	I believe we can use the example of what the Minister of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development has imposed on the BHP 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5459"> 5459 </A></B>
<P>
diamond project in the Northwest  Territories to demonstrate what 
an anti-business mentality must permeate the Department of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development, the very people responsible for 
development in the north, if they are capable of doing such a thing 
to a serious and responsible mining investment group.
<P>
	As a career mining man myself, I want to assure my hon. 
colleagues that the biggest reason why Canada has been losing its 
market share of international mining investment dollars is the 
regulatory boondoggles such as those just imposed on the BHP 
diamond project by the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development. At this point the damage has been done. It is my 
profound hope that the minister will act far differently regarding 
Yukon mining and that Bill C-6 will not become another serious 
blow to mining in Canada.
<P>
	During committee hearings on Bill C-6, Mr. Harlan Meade, 
vice-president of Westmin Resources Limited, a strong voice for 
improving the entire Canadian mining regulatory framework, 
pointed out one other significant problem with Bill C-6. That 
problem is the terrible delay between the time when the legislation 
was needed many years ago, the long duration of the YMAC talks 
followed by literally years since the Liberal government took 
power while little or nothing was done.
<P>
	As Mr. Meade told our committee: ``The failure to move quickly 
to provide regulations sufficient to fulfil the public's desire for 
environmental standards for exploration is contributing to the 
public perception of problems being encountered in the Yukon by 
the exploration industry''.
<P>
	He points out the value of encouraging voluntary compliance 
and says: ``For several years now the larger companies have been 
voluntarily conducting their exploration to standards similar to 
those that exist in other jurisdictions, including reclamation 
activities''. He and many other people from the Yukon have 
emphasized the importance of widespread consultations regarding 
the regulations which will accompany Bill C-6, although they are 
not part of it. Industry must be involved in such consultations 
because industry is best at knowing how to achieve the desired 
environmental protection with a minimum of cost either to industry 
or to the government.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	Due to Mr. Meade's former employment as vice-president of 
environment for the Westmin Company as well as his long time 
involvement with other environment and land use issues, I believe 
my colleagues should give special heed to his opinions. 
Governments, overloaded with senior administrators and pencil 
pushers, have a lot to learn about the time it takes to fully consult 
with the public in order to put forward the best possible legislation 
which can be willingly supported by the people to whom it applies.
<P>
	In conclusion, I urge my hon. colleagues to learn from the 
mistakes of the past regarding the environmental regulations of 
mining and to pass Bill C-6 without amendment.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> We will now proceed to the 
next stage of debate on Bill C-6 where members will have up to a 
maximum of 20-minute interventions subject to 10 minutes of 
questions or comments.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
tempted to enter into debate with the former speaker, but I will 
restrict my comments to the legislation under consideration, Bill 
C-6, an act to amend the Yukon Quartz Mining Act and the Yukon 
Placer Mining Act.
<P>
	It should be noted that the Yukon Quartz Mining Act was first 
brought forward in 1924 and the Yukon Placer Mining Act in 1906. 
They have been virtually unchanged since that time. I think 
everyone is in agreement, while they may not be in agreement with 
some of the details of this bill, that there is need for change. That is 
the reason I am supporting this bill.
<P>
	In 1924 and 1906 the bills basically provided administrative 
direction, dispersal of federal lands for the use of mining and 
mineral rights and the collection of royalties. There were really no 
environmental regulations at all at that time, quite understandably 
given the era.
<P>
	It is very important to say at the beginning that there are 
environmental and other regulations related to mining in the 
Yukon, but these amendments are restricted to exploration 
activities for which there has not been environmental regulation. 
When one looks at the number of pieces of legislation both federal 
and territorial that apply to mining in the Yukon, no one should be 
left with the thought that there has been no environmental 
regulation. In fact 14 pieces of federal and territorial legislation are 
currently on the books that relate to mining activity in the Yukon. 
This is of itself a problem which I will address a bit later.
<P>
	As has been pointed out by other speakers on mining in the 
Yukon, the quartz mining and hard rock mining are basically larger 
companies but the placer mining is very often small family 
operations, some larger than others. Mining is the largest private 
sector employer and largest private sector income generator in the 
Yukon. Therefore it is a very important industry to everyone in the 
Yukon because of the spin-off effects of the jobs created and the 
taxes collected. To all of us who want to see greater economic 
development in the Yukon, it is very important that mining 
continue to be a essential part of the economy.
<P>
	At the same time we live in a territory that is almost the size of 
Sweden which is really in many ways and to many people the last 
wilderness frontier. Many other industries are based on the wilder-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5460"> 5460 </A></B>
<P>
ness from outfitting, to  trail guiding, trapping and so on. They also 
rely on land use in the Yukon.
<P>
	I want to address specifically some of the issues and not so much 
the content of this legislation. Previous speakers have talked quite a 
bit about the content. Essentially the legislation addresses certain 
environmental issues related to exploration that have not been 
covered by existing pieces of legislation.
<P>
<B>(1230 )</B>
<P>
	I am empathetic with those in the industry who say that we have 
an extremely complicated process to facilitate mining in the Yukon 
and they are right. I strongly believe there should be good 
regulations and good environmental controls, but I also feel it 
should not be such a cumbersome process for those who wish to do 
exploration or who wish to proceed further.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier, there are 14 pieces of legislation which 
affect mining in the Yukon. As came out quite clearly during the 
committee hearings on this bill, those pieces of legislation in and of 
themselves are often incompatible and at odds with each other. 
That is clearly unacceptable and must be addressed. It is not 
addressed by this legislation and continues to be an outstanding 
issue.
<P>
	Essentially the bill contains four classes. Under each class there 
are different requirements for notifying the public of the kind of 
work the company will be doing. Each of the four classes has 
different requirements.
<P>
	There is not opposition to the entire bill but there is a concern 
with respect to a lack of requirements in certain classes. For 
example, under a class I licence for developing exploration it is not 
necessary to give notification to any public body. When a company 
does exploration there may not be intrusive harm to the 
environment but there usually is some. They may be taking in a 
Caterpillar; they may be going by river; they may have to cut down 
trees and so on. A real issue for a lot of groups was that there 
should be a notification requirement for all of the four classes.
<P>
	A good aspect of the legislation is that it does allow time for 
implementation. For example, in the quartz mining amendments 
there is a six-month transition period for implementation. For 
placer mining there is a 12-month implementation period. The 
current operating conditions obviously would apply during those 
periods.
<P>
	Another positive element of the bill is that a full review of the 
regulations will have to take place after two seasons of 
implementation. That is particularly important because it is not 
always possible to foresee the long term effects of some aspects of 
legislation or regulations. Certainly no one wants to see the 
industry regulated out of business.
<P>
	I can say that in the 10 years I have been the member of 
Parliament for Yukon and have worked with the  mining industry, 
there has been a real desire on behalf of the industry to see that 
there are good environmental practices. There have been many 
advances.
<P>
	The Yukon Mining Advisory Committee was established in 1990 
by the previous government to bring together representatives of 
industry, the conservation groups and the First Nations to formulate 
amendments to these two acts. It was very tough to find a 
consensus in this diverse group which has differing interests on 
these issues. It is fair to say that after two years of meeting, in 1992 
the Yukon Mining Advisory Committee worked hard to reach a 
consensus. The mining community gave up something and other 
groups gave up something. They came up with a fairly good 
consensus on what could be done in the immediate term. It was not 
seen necessarily as a long term objective.
<P>
	Other jurisdictions could learn from this. The process of the 
mining advisory committee was exceedingly good. It was an 
attempt to sit down face to face to come to grips with difficult 
issues. The resulting report was positive. The problem was that in 
the intervening time, from 1992 to 1996, there was a change in 
government which again changed the mandate. There was certainly 
a lag when the committee was not as active as it had been. Also in 
1995 the land claims and self-government agreements came into 
force through this Parliament. There were certain requirements 
under those agreements which had not been met in the mining 
advisory committee process.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	The lesson to be learned is that the YMAC process is an 
extremely good one to use. However, we cannot have a process of 
consensus making and then have a lag of three to four years and 
expect the consensus will hold together. That is essentially what 
happened with this issue. It is not the fault of anyone in particular 
but we and other jurisdictions could learn from this process.
<P>
	I would like to raise a few things about the legislation which 
were raised as concerns in the committee. Although I am 
supporting passage of the bill, these are issues which will have to 
be dealt with down the line.
<P>
	We should understand that these proposed amendments do not 
really conform with the Whitehorse mining initiative which was set 
in 1994. The proposed legislation does not make our mining 
legislation as strong as that of the NWT, British Columbia or 
Alaska. It is a true compromise but certainly by Canadian standards 
it does not come up to that of our neighbours in the Northwest 
Territories.
<P>
	Another concern which needs to be addressed is that it does not 
meet all the objectives of the Whitehorse mining initiative. Again, 
that came after the 1992 consensus and is another example of why 
this gap between the process of consensus making and 
implementation created a real problem.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5461"> 5461 </A></B>
<P>
	I mentioned earlier the concern about notification on class I. 
That is a general concern of a number of groups.
<P>
	Security and security deposits. Everyone in Canada can 
understand that there have been huge costs to the Canadian 
taxpayer in terms of environmental clean-up of various mining 
sites, and this is quite true in the Yukon. People want to see 
adequate security provisions. This legislation basically states that 
security will be determined on a case by case basis. It has been 
suggested that this is not sufficient but should simply be required as 
a cost of doing business.
<P>
	I am somewhat empathetic to those, particularly small operators, 
who say that this would be very difficult to fulfil. This section of 
the act will have to be watched really closely in terms of the 
implementation I spoke about earlier.
<P>
	Another issue as a result of the time gap is a very serious concern 
which was raised by the Council of Yukon First Nations. Under the 
land claims and self-government agreements there is a very clear 
clause that the federal government must consult with the First 
Nations in terms of any legislation it is bringing forward. This 
came up around Bill C-68, the firearms legislation, where the four 
groups including the Council for Yukon First Nations who have 
constitutionally entrenched agreements, according to their view 
which they substantiated, had not been properly consulted. It is 
equally true with this bill.
<P>
	These agreements came into place after the 1992 consensus. We 
have an adjustment here to a new political dynamic which in 
respect of this legislation I would have to say was not met. It must 
be addressed by the federal government.
<P>
	Wildlife habitat is an issue of great concern. Between the 
territorial and federal government there is a bit of contention about 
who is responsible for the preservation of wildlife habitat. To make 
the point, CPAWS, the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society 
unbeknownst to most Yukoners did staking in some very sensitive 
wildlife habitat areas. Of course, it did not have to notify anyone 
because that was not in the law. The society did it not because it 
was going to mine, but to point out that wildlife habitat areas are 
not protected under this legislation. It has not been sorted out 
whether the federal or territorial government is going to take 
responsibility for this. It is an outstanding concern.
<P>
<B>(1240 )</B>
<P>
	Another concern is competing land use. Historically, under 
mining legislation there is what is called the free entry system. In 
other words someone can stake and mine with free entry into any 
lands. There was an incident in Whitehorse recently in green space 
behind a residential area and people were fairly upset. The free 
entry system is not part of this legislation. I will not dwell on it, but 
it is an issue with regard to competing land use between  outfitters, 
wilderness guides and trappers that people did raise which needs to 
be discussed at length.
<P>
	Many people see this piece of legislation as better than nothing. 
As much as anything it points out what we have to do in the future.
<P>
	Mining is important and it needs to be supported. We need to 
streamline the regulations and process. The involvement of all 
stakeholders in the regulations would be a very important step on 
behalf of the federal government to perhaps bring together some of 
these concerns in a constructive way.
<P>
	The federal government has put forward a proposal to the Yukon 
for the devolution of northern affairs programs by 1998 and that 
includes mining. We see that within two years, should these 
amendments pass today, there will have to be a comprehensive 
review of mining legislation by the territorial government if it is to 
assume responsibility for mining as a territorial responsibility. The 
YMAC process illustrated the usefulness of that kind of body of 
consensus making but also the faults if one does not follow up with 
action immediately.
<P>
	The real challenge within the next two years will be for the 
federal and territorial governments to work together to consolidate 
some of these pieces of legislation to make sure that mining 
legislation conforms to the Whitehorse mining initiative, and to 
ensure we can have a viable industry but also an industry which 
respects environmental standards and regulations.
<P>
	I will conclude by simply saying that this is a step in the right 
direction. It will require a lot of further work but it will take us one 
step toward better mining legislation in the Yukon.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to congratulate the member for Yukon for her balanced and 
thoughtful approach as usual and for the opportunity she gave us to 
better understand the implications of mining in her riding. I wish I 
could say the same for the member for Okanagan-Shuswap who is 
still struggling after three years in Parliament to learn the basic 
rules of debate in this House.
<P>
	The debate on Bill C-6 can legitimately take place against the 
background of the leadership council accord document, namely the 
Whitehorse mining initiative dated November 1994, and signed by 
a number of outstanding citizens and politicians including our 
Minister of Natural Resources. In the document we find some very 
interesting statements which deserve to be put on record in 
connection with this second reading debate. On page 14:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The environmental impact of mining can be minimized by: careful exploration; 
mine design and operation, including risk assessment; and appropriate management 
policies, programs and procedures. Prevention of post-closure impacts requires 
effective site reclamation and monitoring. Voluntary programs emphasizing-</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5462"> 5462 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	On the same page:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Environmentally responsible mining exploration, development, operations and 
public policies are predicated on maintaining a healthy environment and, on closure, 
returning mine sites and affected areas to viable, and, wherever practicable, 
self-sustaining ecosystems that are compatible with a healthy environment and with 
human activities.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is beautiful stuff on page 14. There are also other very 
interesting and meaningful paragraphs on page 16. Time does not 
allow me to read them all.
<P>
	Under planning and environmental assessment, the following 
principle is espoused:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Environmental assessment is an essential tool for identifying potential 
environmental impacts of proposed projects, determining their acceptability, and 
evaluating potential mitigation and remediation measures, thus enabling economic 
activity to proceed while safeguarding the health of the environment.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Among the goals is to ensure that government policies and 
programs adequately incorporate environmental considerations.
<P>
	This is music to the ears of anyone who is concerned with 
sustainable development because this is the essence of good 
sustainable development policy processes. It is a very recent 
document as I mentioned, dating back less than two years.
<P>
	Coming to the bill, an act to amend the Yukon Quartz Mining 
Act and the Yukon Placer Mining Act, this bill establishes an 
environmental management regime for mining activities conducted 
in the Yukon Territory.
<P>
	This bill amends the Yukon Quarts Mining Act an the Yukon 
Placer Mining Act to provide an environmental management 
framework. This is a much needed initiative. The member for 
Yukon already referred to it in positive terms.
<P>
	It is desired if we in Canada are to make environmentally 
sustaining mining processes a reality. It must be noted that to this 
point Yukon is the only jurisdiction in North America that has not 
regulated the impacts of mineral exploration and development.
<P>
	Until now, experience has taught us that mineral development 
can result in habitat loss, the leaching of acids into soil and water, 
creating sedimentation in rivers and streams, adding to water 
pollution and other erosion problems to name a few.
<P>
	We all appreciate that mining is an important factor in the 
Canadian economy but it must be achieved through a well 
regulated industry which safeguards the environment, human 
health and wildlife and which takes into consideration the justified 
claims and goals of our native people. Again, the member for 
Yukon made reference to that.
<P>
	I am told that each day in Canada the mining industry generates 
approximately 1 million tonnes of waste rock and 950,000 tonnes 
of tailings, totalling some 650 million tonnes of waste a year.
<P>
	At present there are approximately 6,000 abandoned tailing sites 
in Canada. Some of these contain 185 million tonnes of uranium 
mine tailings considered to be low level radioactive. Others contain 
an estimated 875 million tonnes of rock and tailings capable of 
allowing acid to leach into the soil and water.
<P>
	The clean-up costs of all these abandoned tailing sites is 
estimated at $6 billion I am told, a cost which presently is likely to 
be borne by the public at large, Canadian taxpayers, if and when 
required.
<P>
	Some of us are concerned that certain activities described in the 
bill as class one activities require no approval or notice, and 
therefore the level of activity approved under class one exploration 
programs could cause significant environmental damage, 
especially in environmentally sensitive areas and heritage sites.
<P>
	The potential impact of these class one activities is significant 
when one considers that there are over 40,000 mineral claims in 
Yukon.
<P>
<B>(1250 )</B>
<P>
	Imagine the cumulative environmental impact of these claims if 
not properly regulated. It could have a far reaching impact on the 
environmentally sensitive northern ecosystem, but as a general rule 
it should be a concern regardless of whether the ecosystem is 
particularly sensitive. That sector has a long way to go in operating 
within a regime that is now becoming more and more accepted in 
the southern latitudes.
<P>
	In order to provide a regulatory framework in Yukon or 
anywhere else in Canada capable of ensuring environmentally 
sustainable mining, the government should seriously consider the 
following suggestions. First, it should provide an environmental 
protection regime that is as strong as any in North America and not 
weaker than that.
<P>
	Second, it should ensure that mineral rights are not granted 
without considering competing land use values. I will address that 
issue a little later.
<P>
	Third, it should regulate all stages of mineral exploration and 
development.
<P>
	Fourth, it should ensure that sufficient funds are set aside to 
cover the full costs of mine reclamation, namely the good old 
polluter pays principle.
<P>
	Fifth, it should ensure effective inspection, monitoring and 
enforcement of mineral activities including provisions for citizen 
enforcement.
<P>
	Sixth, it should provide for special control measures for 
ecologically and culturally sensitive areas.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5463"> 5463 </A></B>
<P>
	Seventh, it should ensure that penalties for failing to meet 
regulatory requirements are strong enough to act as a real 
deterrent.
<P>
	I will spend a couple of minutes discussing the free entry system. 
In Canada and throughout North America there has been a pattern 
over the decades to have a so called free entry system which 
permits the mineral operator to enter lands where minerals are in 
the hands of the crown. It obliges the government to grant 
exploration and development rights if the miner, the applicant, 
applies for them.
<P>
	The free entry system was developed in the 19th century to 
encourage the extraction of mineral resources. While this approach 
may have been suitable and understandable when Yukon was 
considered a wild frontier to be tamed, it is certainly no longer 
appropriate today. Elevating the importance of mineral extraction 
above all the other resources has led to other problems.
<P>
	Provinces such as Alberta, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia 
and other countries such as Australia have eliminated the free entry 
system. Other jurisdictions in Canada are currently moving away 
from the free entry system.
<P>
	Under the free entry system, the right to stake a claim and mine 
cannot be refused on public lands unless the lands have been closed 
entirely from staging. This fails to give consideration or protection 
to other land users, which is a very serious matter. This fact is 
recognized in the Whitehorse mining accord which I mentioned 
earlier. The need to consider other land uses is also stressed: ``No 
aspect of social, economic and environmental sustainability can be 
pursued in isolation or be the subject of an inclusive focus without 
detrimentally affecting other aspects''.
<P>
	It seems the Government of Canada has a responsibility to all 
members of the public when regulating the uses of public lands. It 
basically boils down to that. Under the free entry system it could be 
said that the government essentially abdicates its responsibility to 
regulate whether mining activity will occur at a particular site.
<P>
<B>(1255 )</B>
<P>
	I would submit that the free entry system is still a fundamental 
weakness of mining in the mining regulatory system in Yukon.
<P>
	In short, the free entry system assumes mineral development is 
the most important interest in public land and once a mineral claim 
is staked there can be no consideration of importance of other uses 
of public lands. This flaw undermines the effectiveness of good, 
sound, long term land planning. This method requires the 
government's attention. I would hope that it will be possible to do 
so if not in committee in the examination of the bill then on another 
occasion.
<P>
	The automatic right to mine on public lands should be replaced 
by a system where the government has the discretion to permit the 
production and development of crown minerals as in the case with 
other natural resources such as timber, gas or oil, or even if 
necessary deny their particular use for reasons related to the larger 
public interest.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I thank you for this opportunity to participate in 
this debate.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to thank the previous speaker for his well thought out 
comments. I really do not have much disagreement with him at all.
<P>
	I would just like to make a couple of points and perhaps ask a 
question. The first comment is around the class one and the fact 
that there is no necessity for public notification. I think that is an 
issue that causes a lot of people, including me, some uneasiness. I 
would add, however, that when one stakes a claim under class one 
one has to register that claim so that it is registered with the mining 
recorder. There is that kind of notice at least. However, I still think 
it is an outstanding issue.
<P>
	As I said in my remarks, the issues around quartz and placer 
mining certainly are not completed by this legislation. There is 
much left to do.
<P>
	The hon. member mentioned reclamation. I agree that is a huge 
problem. In one instance in Yukon, a venus mine was closed down. 
The owners have long since disappeared and have probably become 
some other company. The estimated cost to the Canadian taxpayer 
is about $800,000 for the clean-up of the arsenic leaching tailings. 
This is very costly and it is something we do have to be concerned 
about.
<P>
	I wondered if the hon. member would support the suggestion that 
has been made, which is not in this legislation, but for future 
consideration that 1 per cent of royalties from mining be put toward 
reclamation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caccia:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am glad for the correction that the 
member for Yukon made in connection with class one procedures. 
As for the suggestion of the 1 per cent royalty, it is a policy 
approach that commands attention and certainly requires serious 
consideration.
<P>
	Quite frankly, I cannot think of a better alternative in order to 
ensure that the corporate and collective benefit that may derive 
from certain economic activity, in this case a mining activity, also 
is put in a position to restore the quality of the environment as it 
existed before. There may be alternative approaches which I am not 
aware of but this approach certainly is one I will look at very 
carefully.

	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (for the Minister of Indian Affairs 
and Northern Development, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-51, an act 
respecting the water resources of Nunavut, be read the second time 
and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to </B><B>Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to address the House on Bill C-51, the Nunavut Waters Act. I 
am pleased to bring this legislation before the House so that we can 
establish a modern water management regime in the eastern Arctic 
that has a solid legislative and regulatory basis.
<P>
	Bill C-51 is important for a number of reasons. First and 
foremost, it represents a major step forward in fulfilling the 
government's obligation under the Nunavut land claims agreement. 
As my hon. colleagues are aware, our commitment to fully 
implement land claims agreements was clearly stated in the red 
book. This is an ongoing process that will require the continued 
attention and support of the House.
<P>
	Section 13 of the Nunavut land claims agreement requires that a 
special board be established with powers over the regulation, 
management and use of waters in the settlement area. The 
agreement also requires that this board be established through a 
statute. This is the primary purpose of Bill C-51.
<P>
	However this proposed legislation does more than fulfil a lawful 
commitment under the Nunavut land claims agreement. It also 
advances the government's policy of fostering the political 
development of northern Canada by supporting the decision 
making in the north by northerners.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As the Nunavut water board begins to plays its role, local 
participation in the decision making process will increase. The new 
regime will result in a significant decrease in the number of 
applications for water use licences requiring ministerial approval 
as compared to that under the former Northern Inland Waters Act.
<P>
	By establishing a viable, affordable and efficient form of 
government in Nunavut, the bill will allow the Inuit to effectively 
practise self-government in the eastern Arctic. Without passing any 
new law, under powers given in the land claim agreement, the 
Nunavut water board was established on July 9, 1996, on the third 
anniversary of the coming into force of the agreement.
<P>
	As it stands now, the Nunavut water board has all the powers 
described in section 13 of the land claims agreement, but the latter 
did not give any details regarding the board's responsibilities. In 
view of the regulatory nature of the board, its role and jurisdiction 
were to be laid out in the bill before us today.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In order to ensure that the regulation and licensing of water use 
in Nunavut has a clear basis in law, we must proceed with this 
legislation. Bill C-51 will establish a fair, efficient and 
comprehensive water licensing system. In so doing, it will enhance 
the prospects for economic development and job creation in 
Nunavut while respecting the rights and benefits flowing from the 
Nunavut land claims agreement with the Inuit.
<P>
	In the interests of good and efficient government the proposed 
legislation extends the jurisdiction of the Nunavut water board 
beyond the settlement area to encompass the entire Nunavut 
region, except for national parks. In this regard Bill C-51 exceeds 
the requirements of the Nunavut land claims agreement but creates 
a uniform management regime.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	It is critical that we have a uniform water management regime 
throughout Nunavut. A single regime will be more cost effective, 
consistent and easier to manage, and will meet the government's 
commitment to industry to streamline the licensing process. I want 
to assure my hon. colleagues that we are not establishing a 
completely new system of water management with this legislation. 
Bill C-51 is modelled on the Northwest Territories Waters Act and 
its predecessor, the Northern Inland Waters Act, with a few 
modifications to reflect the requirements of the Nunavut land 
claims agreement.
<P>
	The Nunavut water board will have responsibilities and powers 
equivalent to those currently held by the Northwest Territories 
water board, which are essentially the authority to license the use 
of water and the deposit of waste. Licences will not be required to 
use water for domestic purposes, for emergency purposes such as 
fighting fires or controlling floods, or in national parks.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Bill C-51 sets clear rules for issuing, renewing, amending or 
cancelling water use licences. These rules give the industry added 
certainty and will protect the environment in the eastern Arctic. 
Also, they will ensure that the licensing process takes into account 
the interests of all the water users.
<P>
	The Nunavut water board will have a wide range of powers to 
carry out its mandate, including holding public consultations with 
regard to licence applications. In some cases, such as applications 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5465"> 5465 </A></B>
<P>
for permission to expropriate, the board will be obliged to hold 
public hearings.
<P>
	In such a case, the board will have to form a panel made up of 
some of its members and will have to give advance notice of the 
hearing. It will also have to publish notice of its decisions.
<P>
	The board will have the power to impose strict conditions for the 
issuance of licences. The maximum proposed penalty for offences 
is a $100,000 fine, one year imprisonment or both. Similar 
provisions exist in other similar water management systems 
elsewhere in Canada.
<P>
	Furthermore, I am happy to inform the House that the board will 
have the authority to order the compensation of consumers 
adversely affected by licensees' activities. It will also have the 
power to order a licensee to deposit a security with the Department 
of Indian Affairs and Northern Development.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Bill C-51 will clearly place a great deal of decision making 
authority into the hands northerners and in particular the Inuit of 
Nunavut. At the same time, in a fashion similar to the Northwest 
Territories Waters Act and the Northern Inland Waters Act, the 
governor in council will retain the authority to make water 
management regulations. However, in certain instances, as 
specified in Bill C-51, the recommendation of the federal minister 
will be subject to the concurrence of the board.
<P>
	In the interests of effective planning, the water board will be 
expected to work closely with the Nunavut planning commission 
and the Nunavut impact review board. Legislation covering these 
two boards will be introduced in the near future.
<P>
	As mentioned earlier, there are important provisions in the 
legislation that reflect the letter and spirit of the Nunavut land 
claims agreement. Specifically, the Nunavut water board will not 
be allowed to issue, renew or amend a water use or waste deposit 
licence that may substantially affect waters that are on or flow 
through Inuit owned land unless a compensation package is in 
place.
<P>
	To ensure a smooth transition from the current water licensing 
regime, all licences issued under the Northwest Territories Waters 
Act will continue to be valid after promulgation of Bill C-51. 
Hearings that had begun under the Northwest Territories Waters 
Act before the Nunavut board was established will continue until a 
decision is reached. If hearings for an application had not 
commenced when the Nunavut water board was established the 
application will be addressed by the Nunavut water board under the 
provisions of the new legislation.
<P>
<B>(1310 )</B>
<P>
	This legislation also contains a clause that will validate decisions 
made by the Nunavut water board before Bill C-51 comes into 
effect, as long as those decisions would have been valid under the 
Nunavut Waters Act.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As the members of the House know, in the eastern Arctic, we are 
concerned about the impact of the Nunavut Land Claims 
Agreement on the other Inuit who have traditionally occupied and 
used the land in the region affected by the settlement of land 
claims.
<P>
	I am happy to say that Bill C-51 does take these concerns into 
account, with respect to water. The proposed Nunavut Waters Act 
includes provisions allowing the representatives of the Makivik 
Corporation to sit on the board whenever it studies activities 
affecting areas, in Nunavut, which the Inuit of Quebec use in equal 
proportion.
<P>
	The Inuit of Northern Quebec will also be fully represented 
before the board when it will examines issues concerning the 
islands and the maritime regions traditionally used by these 
aboriginal people. Some First Nations will also be represented 
before the board when the issues at hand affect the regions they 
have traditionally occupied and used and are still using.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Negotiations with the Nunavut Tungavik Incorporated to 
establish this board have proven to be extremely complex. We have 
fundamentally different views on how the new water management 
regime should be implemented. Essentially, NTI is of the opinion 
that the Nunavut water board should be the final authority on the 
issuance and enforcement of all water licences in Nunavut and that 
there should be no ongoing role for the responsible minister or for 
the governor in council.
<P>
	We believe it is the responsibility of elected governments, not 
appointed boards, to establish an appropriate balance between 
economic development and environmental protection. This 
principle of accountability is at the very heart of our system of 
democratic government.
<P>
	There is concern that NTI's position would give the Nunavut 
water board more authority on water matters than a future elected 
Nunavut government when the responsibility for water 
management is transferred to the territories. This is clearly not the 
situation in any other jurisdiction in Canada and it would not be an 
acceptable situation in Nunavut. Unfortunately, it has become 
evident that we cannot reach a consensus with NTI on this matter. 
In the interests of good government and to eliminate regulatory 
uncertainty in Nunavut, we have decided to proceed with Bill C-51 
which fulfils our legal obligation and is fully consistent with the 
Nunavut land claims agreement.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5466"> 5466 </A></B>
<P>
	Let me reiterate that the regime we are establishing in Nunavut 
is very similar to the regime already in place and working well 
in the Northwest Territories. This regime has recently been 
strengthened, modernized and streamlined based on extensive and 
positive consultations with key stakeholders in the north and in 
particular with the aboriginal peoples.
<P>
	Bill C-51 ensures that more decisions that affect the people, 
waters and environment of Nunavut will be made in Iqaluit, Rankin 
Inlet, Cambridge Bay and other eastern Arctic communities as 
opposed to in Yellowknife or Ottawa.
<P>
	I believe this is a logical step forward in the political 
development of the north. I believe that it is an important step 
toward the creation of a new territorial government in Nunavut. I 
am therefore seeking the support of hon. members from both sides 
of the House in referring this bill to committee for review.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak today on the bill before us respecting the water 
resources of Nunavut. As usual, I will briefly put things in 
perspective for my colleagues and also for the people who are 
presently watching us.
<P>
	When I took on the role of Indian affairs critic and when I read 
words such as ``Nunavut, Nunavik'', I was all confused. I think 
people wonder where Nunavut and Nunavik are. It is important to 
put these things in perspective before dealing with the content and 
provisions of the bill as such.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	Finally, it may now be said that Nunavut is a territory where 
Inuit people are everywhere. It is a huge territory north of Quebec, 
Ontario and Manitoba, almost 4,000 kilometres long. It is inhabited 
mostly by Inuit people, although there are also Dene and Metis 
people in the western part.
<P>
	If we look at the whole of the territory north of the 60th parallel, 
starting with the west, we see a new division of the Canadian map. 
We know there are already Canadian provinces. We know there are 
also two territories that are the Yukon and the Northwest 
Territories. We have a tendency to divide them according to the 
Inuit influences and traditions.
<P>
	If I start with the far west, this territory is called Inuvialuit. An 
initial agreement on self-government was signed here at the time 
with the Inuit people from the northwestern part of the country.
<P>
	Immediately after that comes Nunavut. Here too, within a few 
months of our last federal election an agreement on 
self-government was signed. This is probably the first Inuit 
territory in Canada. Inuvialuit is a small territory, while Nunavut 
starts immediately north  of Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec, and 
stretches on across almost all of the rest of Canada.
<P>
	Discussions are being held on self-government for Nunavik, the 
same as for Inuvialuit and Nunavut. It is the northern part of 
Quebec, which was transferred like the other territories in 1912. 
These territories are under discussion now. I know the Inuit and 
Cree people are discussing these territories. Quebec may be 
partitioned. But I will not get into this. Today we are dealing with 
the water resources of Nunavut.
<P>
	I simply want to tell you that northern Quebec will always 
remain in Quebec, unless Quebec itself decides to let it go, which I 
doubt very much. I wanted mostly to locate Nunavut in relation to 
Nunavik and Inuvialuit. There is also a small Inuit section of 
Labrador, where discussions on self-government are bogged down.
<P>
	I have had the pleasure of visiting these four regions. There are 
land claims involved. There are demands for self-government in 
Labrador. Newfoundland seems to have a hard time negotiating 
with the Inuit who live there.
<P>
	So Nunavut represents most of the land occupied by the Inuit. 
This territory will be formally established on April 1, 1999. What 
does Nunavut mean in Inuktitut? It means ``Notre monde'' in 
French and ``Our Land'' in English. It means that these people have 
lived in this part of the continent for over 10,000 years. Traces of a 
presence dating back 10,000 years have been found in the Nunavut 
territory.
<P>
	The Inuit world is extremely interesting. As I said, I had the 
pleasure to travel there several times. There is an example I often 
use when making speeches, as I did last week in my riding, when 
people in a classroom asked me about the Inuit, their territory and 
traditions. A part of their culture that is especially rich is the 
Inuktitut language. I do not know much about Inuktitut, but I know 
they have 50 words to describe snow. When we talk about snow, 
whether it is melting, wet, solid or icy, we only have one word for 
it: snow. But they have 50 words for it. The region has a very rich 
Inuit culture, and the language itself is very interesting.
<P>
	These people signed a self-government agreement in 1993, as I 
said just a few months before the federal election. The Inuit had 
been working toward self-government for 20 years. I will give you 
a little historical overview in a moment.
<P>
	People wonder why the Inuit did not start earlier. Since they have 
occupied the land for over 10,000 years, 20 years seems like a very 
short time. I think everyone will agree that 20 years is a rather short 
period of time.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	But native people and Inuit people do not share our concept of 
property. Our culture finds its roots in Great Britain and France and 
with it comes a need to mark  boundaries, to insist that the property 
we plan to buy be properly surveyed, be given a proper legal 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5467"> 5467 </A></B>
<P>
description. We white people have one way of seeing the ownership 
of property that is completely different from the way the Inuit and 
native communities see it.
<P>
	In fact, when they first came here, the Europeans were surprised 
to see that these people had almost no conception of what property 
was. For them, the land was there and it was to be shared by 
everyone, and not divided up into individual pieces of property.
<P>
	The Inuit-and I can vouch for this having visited them-are a 
family-based people. They are often on the move, leading a 
nomadic life. With a population density of one person per 1,000 
square kilometres, the likelihood of encountering another human 
being is quite slim. The concept of property is therefore foreign to 
them. All that land, this whole area of the continent belongs to their 
peoples and to whoever decides to live there.
<P>
	When the self-government agreement was finally signed in 1993 
after 20 years of negotiations, it was described at the time as an 
agreement under section 35 of the Canadian Constitution, which, as 
you know, recognizes treaties entered into with the Inuit, Métis and 
Indians, as defined in the Indian Act.
<P>
	Of course, this self-government agreement being covered by 
section 35 of the Constitution, any disagreement on the 
interpretation of the agreement may eventually end up before the 
appropriate courts.
<P>
	The Nunavut planning commission was established to oversee a 
transition period of six years, from 1993 to 1999, when the transfer 
of powers will be complete.
<P>
	These people are already at work and they have set their 
priorities. Not surprisingly, water is listed as a priority. And so are 
impact assessments because there have been some mishaps in 
Nunavut and in the Yukon as well. Just the other day, we debated 
Bill C-6, consideration of which was concluded this morning and 
whose purpose is to regulate to some extent, through 
environmental standards, land use.
<P>
	There have been cases of abuse in that respect in Nunavut. That 
is why their number one priority is to try to clean up mining 
operations. There are mines that have caused considerable 
pollution and the committee was concerned about that. It was also 
concerned about waters because ridiculous ideas about water use 
come up every now and then. Some can be quite surprising. Take 
for instance the Americans who were keen to build pipelines to 
carry, no, not gas, but water.
<P>
	Indeed, water does have a real value there, because, even if some 
traces of pollution have been noted for some time now, it is still 
purer than our ground water supply here.
<P>
	So we are sometimes tempted to misuse these waters, and I think 
the bill before us today is quite consistent with the work of the 
board watching over the list of priorities, that is water cleanup and 
impact studies.
<P>
	The bill is also interesting in this regard, because it provides that 
impact studies will not be limited to the environment, but will 
extend to caribou sanctuaries and Inuit communities. We will thus 
have a board with slightly broader powers which, before granting 
any operating licences, will be in a position to say: ``We want to 
know the impact this will have on our caribou''. It is important, 
because caribou is a traditional source of food for the Inuit, and 
everybody knows that this animal is very sensitive to 
environmental changes.
<P>
	We will have an act to respect Inuit traditions and to examine 
carefully the impact of water use not only on the Inuit, but also on 
animal populations.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	Finally, the Nunavut planning commission, the very same 
commission, will also be in charge of zoning and urban planning, 
because there is some urban development. Everybody thinks of 
Iqaluit, the capital. It must be remembered that the Inuit decided 
that the capital of Nunavut would be Iqaluit, while the present 
capital of the Northwest Territories is Yellowknife. So, the Inuit 
said: ``The government functions that you agreed to hand over to us 
will be carried out in our capital'', and there was a discussion to 
determine whether it would be Rankin Inlet or Iqaluit. Through a 
referendum, the people finally chose Iqaluit as their capital.
<P>
	These are more like villages. The capital, Iqaluit, with 3,600 
inhabitants, it is not a major urban centre. I went there and found 
that it takes maybe an hour to cover all the streets. Nevertheless, 
people are concerned about zoning and urbanization and they want 
to make sure their community develops adequately while 
respecting the environment.
<P>
	Earlier, I said a few words about the location. Nunavut covers 
1.9 million square kilometres, or one-tenth of Canada. It is larger 
than three quarters of Greenland and it is six times the size of 
Germany.
<P>
	Nunavut extends from the 60th to the 85th parallel. It is bordered 
by Arviat in the south, Coppermine in the west, Alert Bay, which is 
known because it is a military base in Canada's far north, is the 
northern border, and Iqaluit, on Baffin Island, in the east. The small 
island of Sanikiluaq, in the Hudson Bay, is also part of the territory. 
This is interesting, given that mining operations were once 
conducted on this island.
<P>
	We often wonder why the Indian affairs department deals with 
this issue. The explanation is the same as for Bill C-6, which dealt 
with quartz and gold mining in the Yukon. The department for 
which I am the official opposition critic is called the Department of

Indian Affairs and Northern Development. This means it is 
responsible for everything north of the 60th parallel. This also 
explains why bills such as this one often come under the 
jurisdiction of the Indian affairs department.
<P>
	Nunavut has a population of about 22,000, including an 
overwhelming majority of 17,500 Inuit. Earlier, I mentioned some 
figures about the number of people in relation to the size of the 
territory. A quick calculation shows that 1,900,000 square 
kilometres for 22,000 inhabitants represents a little less than one 
inhabitant per 1,000 square kilometres. This is probably one of the 
least populous parts of the planet, which does not mean however 
that just anything should be allowed to go on in that region. The 
legislation we have before us is to develop a very important 
resource of Nunavut, its waters. Even though its population is 
small, the time has come now for Nunavut to have a little more 
control over its waters.
<P>
	Nunavut has 22,000 inhabitants, including 17,000 Inuit. In the 
four large regions I mentioned at the beginning of my speech, the 
Inuit population totals 25,000 people. Iqaluit, the capital of 
Nunavut, is a city of 3,600 people, some 2,000 kilometres away 
from Ottawa. Iqaluit has 20 kilometres of roads. These figures 
show how isolated it is. I will tell you more about this later.
<P>
	I was elected as the member for Saint-Jean in October of 1993. 
Since there were 205 new members, the Prime Minister decided at 
that time that the new Parliament would not start sitting before the 
following February. My leader at the time having confirmed me in 
my role of official critic, the first trip I made in that capacity was to 
Iqaluit.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	I spent two days in Iqaluit. Since I knew nothing about Iqaluit, I 
spent the first day walking around and talking with people. I met 
some interesting people. Since Iqaluit is a small town of 3,600 
people, it does not take long to see it all, to walk down every street. 
As it was quite cold, I had to walk fast. During my first trip, the 
temperature was 30 degrees below zero, and during my second trip, 
it was even colder.
<P>
	The first time, I walked around and talked to people. The native 
issue is fascinating, because one has to see the living conditions of 
the people firsthand. Things are quite different in native 
communities. They are also different in Metis communities, in 
Inuit communities and even from one Inuit community to another. 
Just like I said a while ago, there are four regions, and each one of 
them is different.
<P>
	One realizes that subsistance hunting and fishing are extremely 
important to them. The first matter I had to discuss with the Inuit 
concerned their economy, and how they can make a living in an 
economy where they have no choice but to hunt and fish to provide 
half of their food. Among other things, I noticed that a loaf of bread  
costs $3 in Iqaluit, and the price of two litres of milk is $7. These 
people's wages are half the national average, and groceries cost 
twice what we pay here.
<P>
	These people have a hard time making ends meet, and their only 
option is to turn to nature by hunting and fishing in their traditional 
way. Naturally, water is important in that regard. During part of the 
year, the water flows freely, and the thawing of streams is a 
wonderful thing to see, but they have harsh winters, and they need 
snowmobiles to go hunting and fishing. Snowmobiles are a 
necessity.
<P>
	I made my second trip to Iqaluit for hearings on social program 
reform, and many people told us how important water is to them. 
That is why this bill comes as no surprise to me today. They are 
concerned about water quality. However, there was not much 
flowing water when I was there. As I was saying, the temperature 
was 30 below during my first trip and 40 below during the second 
one. When we tried to leave, we could not. The plan's engine froze. 
We had to go back to the hotel and wait for another plane from 
Montreal to pick us up. It took a whole day.
<P>
	When the second plane landed, they left the engine running to 
avoid any further problem, since the engine on the first plane froze 
in the bitter cold, as I was saying.
<P>
	There are also some interesting issues in terms of economic 
development. I talked earlier about the progress being made in 
commercial hunting and fishing. They have stores up there that 
specialize in the marketing of caribou, seal and whale meat, for 
instance. The industry exists, but is not allowed to ship outside 
Nunavut. I think discussions are under way to find ways to allow 
Canadians and Quebecers to have the opportunity to enjoy these 
delicacies. People up there would like to export caribou or seal 
meat, as these species are not threatened with extinction. It would 
be very profitable for them to be able to sell these products.
<P>
	Then there is the transportation industry. Air Cri provides 
passenger air service to several communities. Actually, almost 
every community is accessible only by air. Air Cri is crucial to the 
economy. They are also taking control of several hotel facilities.
<P>
	There is also the federal contribution pursuant to the Nunavut 
agreement. The federal government has agreed to pay them $1.1 
billion over 14 years, a very attractive contribution indeed.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	They will be able to use this money for economic development. 
In fact, Nunavut and Nunavik encourage economic development 
programs especially in the business sectors I mentioned earlier.
<P>
	There is a profusion of new public and professional agencies. 
Since the agreement was signed in 1993, people are beginning to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5469"> 5469 </A></B>
<P>
receive money and to ensure sustainable  development. And I think 
that this legislation is in keeping with sustainable development.
<P>
	Moreover, three new national parks will be established. Also, 
there will be a mining resources evaluation program. I must point 
out that mining requires a lot of water. This legislation will correct 
certain oversights.
<P>
	Before speaking about the bill, I want to explain the background 
of the Nunavut agreement, which was signed in 1993 and which led 
directly to this legislation. As I said, the Northwest Territories were 
established in 1912 out of the northern parts of Manitoba, Ontario 
and Quebec. After 1950, the Northwest Territories were governed 
by an appointed commissioner and an elected territorial council, 
which was not really very representative. It was only around 1975 
that the council began to be representative.
<P>
	In 1966, the federal government set up the Carrothers 
commission, which advised it on a greater distinct representation in 
the centre and in the east. Before that, these subdivisions did not 
exist and there was only one vast Northwest territory. People asked 
that the territory be subdivided so that it could be more 
representative.
<P>
	In 1967, the federal government transferred the management of 
nearly all programs to the Government of the Northwest 
Territories, the legislative assembly of which is in Yellowknife. I 
visited the Northwest Territories legislature, and it is obvious that 
this institution was inspired by Inuit tradition.
<P>
	It a fairly recent structure, having been built about ten years ago, 
I would say, and it is quite nice. Part of the structure looks like 
igloos, it is difficult to describe. In Inuit tradition, the circle is 
omnipresent, whereas our Parliament is laid out to show the 
difference between the government benches and the opposition 
benches. We face each other. Over there, everybody sits in a circle. 
I find that very interesting.
<P>
	We can see that the Northwest Territories have been heavily 
influenced by Inuit culture, as well as Dene and Métis culture. 
There are many Dene and Métis in the western part of the Nunavut. 
The circle is very important for these people.
<P>
	In 1976, a Inuit group, Inuit Tapirisat of Canada, of which Mrs. 
Kuptana is president-this organization still exists and it is quite 
dynamic-suggested the federal cabinet establish a territory 
separating the west, the center and the east of the Territories.
<P>
	In 1981, a new approach was suggested, that is the creation of a 
new government composed principally of Dene and Métis, but this 
plan never was adopted. In 1982, a referendum was conducted on 
the idea of dividing the territory. The question was: ``Do you think 
Northwest Territories should be divided?'' The participation rate 
was 53 per cent, and 56 per cent of those who voted said yes. I must 
say that organizing an election or a referendum in the Nunavut is 
almost a  miracle. To begin with, even before the election or the 
referendum, informing the people of every village takes weeks. It 
is absolutely extraordinary to see a 53 per cent participation rate. 
People from Nunavut often have to travel 200 to 300 kilometres by 
snowmobile to vote in a referendum or an election. Under those 
circumstances, people who exercise the vote are real heroes of 
democracy. I think that people who travel 300 kilometres by 
snowmobile to vote deserve our appreciation.
<P>
	The government recognized the referendum on certain 
conditions. Of course, there are several political parties in 
Northwest Territories. One of the conditions was that all parties 
accept the division, and they did. Second, all parties had to accept 
the division of powers between the territories and local 
governments.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	Some specific fields like education and health were transferred 
to Inuit people even though the government of the Northwest 
Territories had jurisdiction over them. So, there were agreements to 
effectively divide powers and to ensure viability of all of the 
Northwest Territories after the separation. I think that, by now, we 
can consider that it has been proven that all the territories are 
viable.
<P>
	In 1992, there were a second referendum on separation into four 
regions and 54 percent of the voters said yes. As I said earlier, the 
Nunavut agreement was signed in May of 1993, just a few months 
before the last federal elections, in October.
<P>
	The bill is on water resources of Nunavut. It was read the first 
time on June 14 1996. It implements the water management 
provisions of the Nunavut agreement. Pursuant to chapter 13 of the 
land claims agreement between the Inuit and the federal 
government, a commission or a board was to be formed to settle the 
issues concerning waters. This is why we are studying legislation, 
which, in some ways, is very similar to many others, whose aim is 
to implement clauses of the Nunavut agreement.
<P>
	Some of us have a few minor concerns regarding the members 
appointed by the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development. I have here a breakdown of the members of the 
Nunavut Water Board. Four members are appointed by the Minister 
of Indian Affairs and Northern Development on the 
recommendation of an independent development organization; two 
members are appointed directly by the minister; two members are 
also appointed by the minister but on the recommendation of a 
minister from the Northwest Territories; and the chairperson is 
appointed by the Indian affairs department on the recommendation 
of the other members.
<P>
	I think the Indian affairs department and minister have too much 
control over this process. At this stage, we have not yet completed 
our consultations and we do not yet know if we will ask for 
amendments to these provisions. We obviously agree with the 
substance of the  legislation, but on the issue of the establishment 
of the board, I think the government should have given more 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5470"> 5470 </A></B>
<P>
autonomy to local groups instead of leaving it all up to the Indian 
affairs department.
<P>
	This new legislation is similar to the one that already exists in 
the Northwest Territories-because there is one-under the 
jurisdiction of the territorial legislative assembly. Its primary 
function is to license uses of water and deposits of waste.
<P>
	Interestingly, this bill provides for public hearings and, in line 
with the Nunavut agreement, shows great respect for the Inuit. This 
is important to us because I think that, when we talk about water in 
Nunavut, we have to talk about Inuit traditions and culture.
<P>
	I just want to mention four paragraphs that have attracted my 
attention. Public hearings are allowed and their conduct is 
governed by certain administrative rules which recognize the 
importance of the culture, customs and knowledge of the Inuit. For 
instance, the testimony and contribution of some experts is 
acknowledged during public hearings on issues such as the use of 
waters in Nunavut but the role of the Inuit, who are probably the 
best experts on water quality, will also be recognized. This 
provision will truly allow them to influence proceedings.
<P>
	Before holding public hearings on a request concerning water the 
NWB must take whatever steps are necessary to inform the public 
that hearings will be held, namely by giving notice, circulating 
information and setting the day, hour and place of the hearings.
<P>
	This goes back to what I was saying earlier because these people 
live in such vast areas that if they decide, for instance, to come to a 
public hearing, they must be notified weeks ahead because 
travelling 200 or 300 kilometres on a snowmobile is not an easy 
thing. It requires some planning and this is why I was saying earlier 
that these people are the heroes of democracy, because they travel 
hundreds of kilometres for a hearing, an election or a referendum. 
This is why it is important, and the bill makes adequate provision 
for it.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	If the public receives, within a reasonable time frame before the 
beginning of hearings, the information transmitted to the NWB on 
requests about water, the Nunavut water board will hear testimony 
and advice from experts and will spread this information on the 
largest possible scale.
<P>
	The interesting aspect of public hearings is that the NWB holds 
such hearings in the communities that are the most directly 
affected. No matter the community, no matter how isolated it is, if 
there are problems in a far northern community, the NWB will have 
to hold public hearings locally so that people do not have to travel 
long distances. In that respect, this bill is quite consistent with  the 
Nunavut agreement as such, and, this is, I think, worth mentioning.
<P>
	Requirements will be prescribed by law for such purposes as 
issuing, renewing or amending a license in respect of a use of 
waters or a deposit of waste that may substantially alter the quality, 
quantity or rate of flow of waters through Inuit-owned land, unless 
an agreement has been reached between the parties concerned.
<P>
	From now on, people who worked in mines or elsewhere will 
have to comply with the regulations, and a public hearing will be 
held as soon as it is felt that their activity may substantially alter 
the quality, quantity or rate of flow of waters. Through the Board, 
the Inuit will have more control over development projects and the 
environmental impact of those economic development projects.
<P>
	The Board will also perform those other functions described 
earlier by my colleague. It will be required to work closely with the 
Nunavut Planning Commission and the Nunavut Impact Review 
Board. These Commissions come directly under the Nunavut Land 
Claims Agreement signed in 1993. They will ensure compliance 
with environmental standards and will oversee social and economic 
impact. This is also interesting, because it broadens the mandate 
somewhat further.
<P>
	There is something about the bill that has been said many times 
before: it does not apply to shipping. I know it is hard to include the 
whole area of sea and air traffic in the North. I was an 
environmentalist before I got into politics and I believe everybody 
remembers the mess of the <I>Exxon Valdez</I> in Alaska. That is why I 
wonder if the bill could not have had a larger scope and include 
shipping.
<P>
	I do not understand why we are told that shipping is not affected. 
That means that ships, oil tankers and others, may carry on. Of 
course, ships are governed by other laws, but not necessarily ones 
that come under the jurisdiction of the Northwest Territories' 
legislative assembly or of the capital, Iqaluit, which is Nunavut's 
capital, where the Inuit are. We will examine the possibility of 
adding some clarification.
<P>
	I spoke a moment ago about the Board's membership. We lament 
the extent of the Department's control over appointments. Even 
though, for instance, several organizations are invited to submit 
recommendations, the minister has the final say on appointments.
<P>
	The bill suggests that public hearings be held for some big 
projects. Not only will there be hearings for existing projects, 
which could involve stricter water management rules, but from 
now on, anything that could affect water quality, quantity or 
flow-rate will have to be submitted to the Board. That is important 
for us.
<P>
	As for possible recourse, the independent developer is naturally 
entitled to ask the competent jurisdiction to decide if someone has 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5471"> 5471 </A></B>
<P>
a right to use Nunavut's water.  They will make regulations, and if 
these regulations are contravened, recourse will naturally be had to 
the courts.
<P>
	Therefore, the bill, as such, is completely consistent with the 
agreement, where this took 20 years. I told you earlier that there 
were 20 years of negotiations, although they were preceded by 
several hundreds of years of joint occupation of the area by Inuit 
and whites. It is therefore in line with the Nunavut agreement.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	The management provisions, as I said, are being implemented 
with the greatest respect for the Inuit, with compensation, recourse 
as an option, and the real possibility for them to hold hearings, to 
examine fully any development projects. It merely gives official 
expression to the act, the Nunavut provisions.
<P>
	We will naturally vote in favour of the bill, although the 
Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern 
Development, to which this bill will be referred later on, will be 
looking at the possibility of perhaps going a little bit further with 
respect to navigation or to control by the Inuit of their board.
<P>
	We feel that the Nunavut Inuit government has the competence 
and abilities required to make appointments and also to be 
responsible for this board. I think that it will demonstrate 
confidence in the Inuit. I have confidence in the international 
experts on the quality, quantity and flow of water, but the Inuit, 
who have been living there for 10,000 years, perhaps can be trusted 
when it comes to controlling the waters.
<P>
	Therefore, with respect to Bill C-51, we will be looking at the 
possibility of making small changes. As for the merits of this bill, 
the Bloc Quebecois is completely in favour of this legislation, and 
when it has been passed, we will be wishing the Inuit the best of 
luck with the management of the quality, quantity and flow of their 
waters in Nunavut.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I stand 
today to oppose Bill C-51 for three reasons. The first is that I 
support good government, namely, government which provides a 
necessary service, is cost effective and is accountable to the people 
who pay for it. The second is that the government's process has 
been faulty.
<P>
	The third and most serious reason is that the original legislation 
creating Nunavut ought to be declared unconstitutional on the 
grounds that it creates what amounts to another province without 
meeting the 1982 constitutional requirement that at least seven 
provincial legislatures representing 50 per cent of Canada's 
population have to consent to Nunavut's creation. The provinces 
have never been asked.
<P>
	With regard to the need for good government, this new illegal 
province of Nunavut, which of course is not a  province officially 
but will have the administrative and governmental trappings of a 
province, has a land mass about twice as big as the legal province 
of Ontario. Its population at 22,000 is less than the area population 
of Cranbrook, B.C. where I have my constituency office.
<P>
	Canadians often complain about the fact that the Atlantic 
provinces are so small, but even the beautiful but tiny province of 
Prince Edward Island has a population of 130,000, about six times 
the population of the new illegal province of Nunavut. My hon. 
colleagues will therefore understand if I state my firm belief that 
having so much government for Nunavut is over governing at its 
worst.
<P>
	Specifically the Nunavut Water Board's eight appointed 
members plus a chair for a population of 22,000 is part of the 
excessive bureaucracy of an additional 930 civil service jobs cited 
by a Coopers &amp; Lybrand report of December 1992 on establishing 
Nunavut, plus 705 public service jobs to be transferred from 
Yellowknife. The entire Northwest Territories Water Board 
currently consists of from four to nine members and Nunavut has 
half the land and less than half the population. However, the 
various groups of northern peoples apparently said they wanted 
additional board members in order to guarantee representation for 
different population groups, including the Inuit of Nunavut and the 
Inuit of northern Quebec.
<P>
	I can understand somebody wanting something. There are things 
I would like myself, for example, a big ranch on prime land maybe 
with a herd of fallow deer, or all of the waterfront of a small lake in 
central British Columbia. There are two things that keep me from 
having that big ranch or lake. First, nobody is going to give it to me 
just because I want it. No, if I am going to have the ranch or lake, I 
am going to have to pay for them. The second thing that stops me is 
that I would have to look after them because nobody is going to 
look after them for me just because it is something I would like.
<P>
	Neither of those conditions applies to the Nunavut Water Board. 
Somebody else is going to pay for it and somebody else is going to 
have to look after it. Mr. Speaker, it is no surprise that the 
somebody is you and me and all the other taxpayers of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1355 )</B>
<P>
	With such a small population and such a huge land mass, it is 
perhaps not surprising that the Northwest Territories is at the 
bottom of the heap compared with all other provinces and the 
Yukon in so far as paying their own way is concerned. I make 
mention of that not that it is the fault of the people who are in the 
Northwest Territories, I simply mention it as a fact.
<P>
	According to research supplied by the Library of Parliament, for 
the 1995-96 budget year it is estimated that the Northwest 
Territories received 72.2 per cent of its income from general 
purpose federal government  transfers of funds plus 10.7 per cent 
from specific purpose federal government transfer of funds for a 
total of 82.9 per cent of the income of the Government of the 
Northwest Territories coming from federal transfers. Let me repeat 
that astounding number: 82.9 per cent of the income of the 
Government of the Northwest Territories for the fiscal year 
1995-96 came from federal government transfers.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="5472"> 5472 </A></B>
<P>
	If this were to provide the necessities of life, many Canadians 
would probably go along with such a staggering figure, but when a 
lot of those funds go to employ bureaucrats who seem to be thicker 
on the ground than the caribou, Canadian taxpayers lose patience. 
Maybe the Ottawa mandarins have led such sheltered lives that 
they do not realize that civil servants are not a necessity of life. 
Taxpayers want the number of civil servants kept to a minimum, 
just the minimum required to provide essential services. Instead, 
all too often taxpayers find themselves funding such ridiculous 
bureaucracies as the water board consisting of eight members plus 
a chairperson to serve the 22,000 people of Nunavut.
<P>
	Good government has to do with having the people elect some 
leaders who are responsible to ensure that public services are 
provided at a cost the people can afford, by the level closest to the 
people and best able to perform the service efficiently. Instead, the 
Nunavut Water Board is appointed by the Minister of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development who in turn was 
appointed-surprise-by the Prime Minister after being elected by 
the people of Sault Ste. Marie, which the last time I looked on the 
map was a long way from Nunavut.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My dear colleague, you still have quite a bit of 
time left in your discourse.

AIDS is a scourge that has affected the lives of families all across

<P>
	One of my former students has contracted this terrible disease 
from a heterosexual partner who has already died because of AIDS. 
Recently she was awarded the Ovation Award for Activism by the

	Like many Canadians, my constituents appreciate the effort the 
government has made through the National AIDS Strategy to 
combat the disease through research, treatment and education.
<P>
	Canada has made a substantial and recognized contribution in 
fighting AIDS. I was pleased to see the response to the petition I 
presented on the AIDS strategy. It states that the Minister of Health 
is participating in active discussions in various sectors concerning 
the federal role with regard to HIV-AIDS.
<P>
	I urge the Minister of Health and the entire government to secure 
continuing funding for the AIDS strategy before the program runs

	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, today I 
would like to honour the courage and determination of two young 
men from my riding, who made the 6,000-kilometre journey from 
Calgary to Drummondville by canoe.
<P>
	Alain Bourbeau and Jean-Philippe Bourgeois made a trip that 
has not been made since the 18th century. These two coureurs des

along the route of the fur trade.
<P>
	This was an adventure which brought them both closer to nature 
and to the essentials of life. As one of them so aptly put it: a life 
that is not lived in search of a dream is not worth living. This 
phrase describes not only their present day exploit, but the exploits 
of all Quebecers involved in past exploration and discovery in the 
vast reaches of North America.
<P>

Brunswick. The federal government is providing more than 
$100,000 for this important initiative.
<P>
	The youth internship program provides students and employers 
with opportunities to work together by developing skills and 
knowledge that can lead to employment. Students participate in on 
the job and in class training which will be applied directly to 
specific jobs.
<P>
	In preparing the students for work readiness, they will be taught 
basic employability skills along with anger management and social 
skills training. The program is designed to include special needs 
students, youth at risk, learning disabled and native students.
<P>
	I applaud the federal government for funding this innovative 
program and I congratulate all the students, teachers and businesses 
involved.

know that small business is the engine of our nation, the place 
where job creation has been phenomenal.
<P>
	I am particularly pleased to be able to highlight four Burlington

Ray Simmons is CEO of CRS Robotics, a leading developer of 
human scale robots and robot systems. Ian Hopkins heads up 
Magic Wand Carpet Cleaning, a company he plans to franchise 
across North America. Archie Bennett is president of Zeton Inc. 
which designs and manufactures small computer controlled pilot 
plants. Kevin Milne's company is Mars Metal, a specialty casting 
and keel company.
<P>
	Each of these individuals credits their team of employees and 
good customer relations as the keys for their success in the 
marketplace. This government salutes their success and the success 
of the entire small business sector in Canada.

be entrepreneurs and to Canada becoming an evermore successful 
trading nation.

October is Women's History Month, this year's opportunity to 
celebrate the contributions of the women who laboured to shape 
our nation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	This very special month affords us the opportunity to celebrate 
past and present contributions by the women who have helped 
shape our country and to encourage future generations of women to 
continue to contribute to the enrichment of our country.

accomplishment and identifies the fingerprints of women who 
toiled to make the difference.
<P>
	This year's celebration coincides with the annual 
commemoration of the Persons Case of 1929, a legal and political 
battle to have all Canadian women considered as persons under the 
British North America Act.

Speaker, last month on Canada's west coast, just out of Bella Bella, 
a light keeper reported a downed float plane and initiated an 
immediate response which allowed the pilot to be saved by a search

<P>
	And, last week's storm is being called the worst to hit the west

<P>
	In fact, the media reported: ``Coast guard officials were 
breathing a sigh of relief that no sailors were killed during a 
powerful storm that hit the west coast''.
<P>
	Their relief, I am sure, stems from the 100 per cent failure of 
four newly automated light stations in B.C.
<P>
	Speaking to our lighthouse experts, besides lacking crucial up to

missing from the automated data. One is visibility, another is sea

judged adequately by a machine.

	<B>Ms. Colleen Beaumier (Brampton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
October marks the 67th anniversary of the Persons Case.
<P>
	It was in 1929 that the British judicial committee of the privy 
council declared that women are persons under the terms of what 
was then called the British North America Act. The decision was 
delivered in response to a dispute over whether section 24 of the 
BNA act permitted women to be appointed to the other House.
<P>
	In striking down an earlier decision of the Supreme Court of 
Canada, the privy council called the exclusion of women from 
public office ``a relic of days more barbarous than ours''.
<P>
	This decision went a long way in combating the sentiment 
expressed by a British court in 1876 that ``women are persons in 
matters of pains and penalties but are not persons in matters of 
rights and privileges''.
<P>
	Members from all parties should note that there are more women 
in this Parliament than in any other previous Canadian Parliament. 
I would ask all members to join me in commemorating the Persons 
Case and to recognize it as a watershed event-

<P>

<P>
	The federal government intends to continue to work with other 
levels of government and industry in our area to promote growth 
and opportunity for our citizens. Programs such as technology 
partnerships Canada, the Canadian television and cable production 
fund and the program for export market development, not to

<P>

Canada's worst criminals, those who are deemed likely to continue 
repeating their pattern of violent crimes.
<P>
	Why is it that we have yet another case of a repeat dangerous 
offender out on parole?
<P>
	As revealed this past weekend, George Harvey Miln was 
classified a dangerous offender in 1980 after being convicted of 
sexually assaulting three teenage boys in Kelowna, B.C. the 
previous year.
<P>
	In the early 1970s he was convicted of similar crimes in Toronto.
<P>
	Subsequently, Miln was allowed to apply for parole every year. 
In 1993 he was deemed rehabilitated and released.
<P>
	Lo and behold, Miln decided to revert to his old ways by 
seducing two teenagers this past August with beer, drugs and 
pornographic magazines before sexually assaulting them.
<P>
	Are these not the same crimes for which he was sent to prison 
indefinitely in 1980? Here we go again, a special parole board 
deciding who it feels is rehabilitated.
<P>
	Miln committed crimes in the 1970s, 1980s and now in the

we are to create good, lasting jobs in sufficient numbers to truly

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="POVERTY">POVERTY</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, last week 
the Prime Minister championed the cause of the homeless. He told 
everyone in Canada that he was aware of their problem, that he was 
very sensitive to the problem and that he saw people like these 
every day and talked to them.
<P>
	My question is as follows: Will the Prime Minister admit that his 
government's record, which shows that it has concentrated far 
more on reducing the federal deficit than on dealing with the 
problems of those who live in  poverty, is a clear indication that the 
Prime Minister is far more inclined to listen to those who are 
prepared to pay $1,000 for a Liberal Party fund-raising dinner than 
to the homeless and the poor of this country?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the speeches I made last week, I made it clear to 
Canadians that there are social problems that remain to be dealt 
with in this country and that as soon as we have achieved our 
objectives-and I am glad to see that the Minister of Finance is 
well ahead of the forecasts he made a few years ago and that we 
will have a balanced budget a few years from now-and I told the 
business people I met that before concentrating exclusively on tax 
cuts like the Reform Party is doing, we had to remember that we 
still had problems to deal with, that there were poor people in our 
society. That is what I told business people in Toronto and 
Winnipeg, and I told them that was our priority.
<P>
	In the course of my life I have met people who live on the street. 
I met some of them and talked to them, and that is why we want 
Canadian society to function properly and why we want a 
government that is in good shape, so that we can really look after 
their problems. That is our abiding concern.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime 
Minister keeps saying that there are still problems in this country, 
as if he had started to deal with the problems of the poor. However, 
that is not the case. The number of poor people and poor children 
has increased steadily since 1993, when his party came to power.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister realize that by cutting the Canada social 
transfer, money that is used for health care, education and social 
assistance, he is aggravating the problems of the poor by forcing 
provincial governments to reduce funding for measures that are 
intended to support people who are in need? Will he at least admit 
that?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, despite the cuts we had to make, in his February budget 
the Minister of Finance directed $250 million more towards 
helping the poor through a system of tax rebates for their benefit.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	I agree we have made cuts, but clearly, if the hon. member looks 
into this he will realize that when you take federal transfers to 
provincial governments-in his case, to the Government of 
Quebec-since we came to power we have not reduced our transfer 
payments. Some transfers have gone down, but equalization 
payments have gone up, so that today Quebec receives about the 
same amount it received when we came to power.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime 
Minister just misspoke himself. The poor, the people we are talking 
about, do not pay income tax. That is what I am trying to explain to 
the Prime Minister. We cannot use fiscal measures to help those 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5477"> 5477 </A></B>
<P>
who are in need because they do not have enough money to pay 
income tax. And that is a fact.
<P>
	One of the measures introduced by this government was 
employment insurance reform. Will the Prime Minister admit that 
as a result of this reform, his government has forced thousands of 
unemployed workers, tens of thousands of unemployed workers, to 
go on welfare? Does the Prime Minister think this is the kind of 
measure that will help the neediest in our society?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, to answer the first part of his question, I would like to say 
that even people who do not pay income tax receive tax credits. In 
other words, if they do not have to pay taxes and they are entitled to 
tax credits, the government sends them the money to which they 
are entitled. If I am not mistaken, the same applies to the GST. 
These are amounts that are paid directly to them by the 
government.
<P>
	I repeat that we have tried to put our finances in order, and today, 
we enjoy the benefits of this policy because interest rates are at 
their lowest levels since 1958. Last week, a political leader said 
that reducing interest rates was a priority. I am referring to the 
Premier of Quebec, Mr. Bouchard.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="UNEMPLOYMENTINSURANCE">UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE</A></H3>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development. But 
first, I would like to say, to follow up on what has just been said, 
that the unemployment rate has gone up, again.
<P>
	On October 9, the Minister of Human Resources Development 
said he wanted to assure all Canadians that the employment 
insurance program had become a more active measure or insurance 
program. He stated that a total of $800 million will be injected into 
this program every year.
<P>
	According to a departmental document, however, not only is this 
$800 million investment not assured, but making this investment 
possible will require recovering a further $365 million per year, 
and the measures planned to recover the amounts collected by 
people who cheat the system will not be enough. As a result, a 
special recipient assistance services will be established.
<P>
	Will the minister admit that this $800 million will not be 
available for active measures unless an extra $365 million is 
recovered every year?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what I will say is that the new 
employment insurance program makes work more attractive and is 
designed to encourage unemployed Canadians to go back to work, 
and that we want to help  them through active measures. I think this 
is very important.
<P>
	The envelopes I was referring to last week represent an $800 
million improvement over what would have been the case had no 
changes been made to the employment legislation. By the year 
2000, if the calculations are correct and they will be, approximately 
$2.7 billion in active measures will be available to unemployed 
Canadians who want to find jobs and re-enter the labour force.
<P>
	This is therefore $800 million more than what would have been 
available otherwise.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, not only 
is this not $800 million more, but the question I just asked the 
minister was this: Does he or does he not admit that, according to 
his own officials, in order for this $800 million to be generated, an 
extra $365 million will have to be drawn from the system every 
year by going after people who cheat the system-and in cases of 
real fraud, we agree-but also through a proactive approach in 
which all recipients may well be treated like potential abusers?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I can assure you that, when we 
talk about recovering certain sums, the labour market is very 
different today from what it was 15 or 20 years ago. We will do our 
best to break away from the past and deal with the current situation.
<P>
	Very often, businesses use employment insurance to alter the 
labour market playing field. They are the ones we intend to go 
after, not those individuals who are eligible for benefits and whom 
we want to help. We have compassion for these individuals and 
want to help them re-enter the labour force.
<P>
	But we will not let employment insurance become a tool in the 
hands of businesses to be used to alter the labour market playing 
field. In a word, we are against fraud but in favour of showing 
compassion for those who truly need assistance.

	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last 
week the Prime Minister said not to read his lips but to read his 
record. That record is pretty dreadful.
<P>
	There are 1.4 million unemployed Canadians, two to three 
million who are underemployed, 500,000 who have given up 
looking for work. One in four Canadians is worried about losing his 
or her job. There are record bankruptcies, record levels of personal 
debt, plummeting personal incomes, record taxation levels and a 
list of broken promises as long as your arm. It is a record to be  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5478"> 5478 </A></B>
<P>
ashamed of. The government has not learned the lesson that taxes, 
taxes, taxes kill jobs, jobs, jobs.
<P>
	When is the government going to stop breaking the backs of tax 
worried Canadians and start shrinking government and lowering 
taxes? That is what creates jobs.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
given this new found interest in jobs perhaps I should remind the 
hon. member what his leader said in 1993. In Penticton, Reform 
leader Preston Manning said it would take up to three years before 
any job creation would occur under his party's economic plan.
<P>
	In fact, he acknowledged that his zero in three plan could 
actually cost more jobs in the interim and then he went on when 
asked a further question he said: ``What is the alternative?'' The 
alternative was the government that was elected. It has seen the 
private sector create close to 700,000 new jobs. That is 700,000 
more jobs than the Reform Party would have created.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, I would remind members to please 
not use each other's name in the House. Use a title or riding.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
surprised the finance minister is still fighting the last election.
<P>
	Since the government has taken power the average family has 
lost $3,000 of annual spending power because of tax increases. 
Under the Reform's tax cut proposals a single income family of 
four with an income of $30,000 will pay 89 per cent less in federal 
tax. The Reform plan offers low and middle income Canadians real 
tax relief.
<P>
	Will the finance minister stop the attack on Canadian families 
and announce today that it is time to give Canadians a pay raise 
after years of Liberal-Tory national pay cuts?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, let 
us understand what the Reform Party recommended in its 
document last week. In its $2,000 tax reduction, a one earner 
couple with two children and an income of $15,000 by its numbers 
would save $420.
<P>
	The same one earner couple with two children and an income of 
$100,000 would save $3,200 a year and more that made a capital 
gain.
<P>
<B>(1430 )</B>
<P>
	That is progressivity according to the Reform Party. This is a tax 
cut for the wealthiest Canadians and it is done in order to pay for 
the gutting of the basic social programs that protect the middle 
class in this country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
finance minister has a lot of gall when he talks about tax relief for 
high income Canadians.
<P>
	Using Reform's tax cut proposal, according to a StatsCanada 
econometric model that we had run this  morning, over a million 
low income Canadians would no longer have to pay taxes. That 
would leave money in their pockets where it is desperately needed 
instead of in the pockets of bureaucrats and high-flying politicians 
where it is usually wasted.
<P>
	When is the government going to realize that its rinky-dink, 
make work, job creation programs are not the way to help 
Canadians and that cutting the size of government and giving 
Canadians real tax relief is?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Reform Party likes to think it has done something new. 
Essentially it is recommending that we rob the poor to pay the rich.
<P>
	For anybody who wants to understand what the government has 
done, let me quote Carl Weinberg of High Frequency Economics, 
the American expert on what has happened in this country. He said 
that you can now price Canadian securities on the basis of domestic 
economic fundamentals rather than slavishly marking up U.S. 
yields. That is what happened. He said it is a whole new world.
<P>
	He goes on to say that what is happening in Canada right now is 
one of the boldest experiments in macroeconomics that has ever 
been undertaken. It is a sea change in the way we will have to think 
about this country.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Now that we are back in shape, we have to close 
in a little bit on the questions and the answers.

	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this is only Monday. On March 19, the heritage minister returned 
DMX's license to the CRTC because the proposed Canadian and 
French content of the company's audio programming was clearly 
insufficient. However, on October 11, the minister granted the 
license to DMX, even though the situation was still essentially the 
same.
<P>
	Since DMX's proposal is basically the same in October as it was 
in March, can the heritage minister explain what made her change 
her mind and grant a license to DMX?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the answer is the same as 
the one I gave before recess, about a week ago. The reason is that, 
thanks to our intervention, the two companies involved have 
increased their Canadian content by 25 per cent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the minister's reputation for calculating speaks for itself. How can 
the heritage minister intimate that DMX increased its Canadian 
content, considering that 17 of the 35 channels DMX intends to

it.

	<B>The Speaker:</B> Dear colleagues, you must always address the 
Chair.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the calculation is as 
follows. The CRTC requires a 30 per cent Canadian content from 
Canadian cable operators. DMX and Power raised their Canadian 
content to 40 per cent. The difference between 30 and 40 per cent 
represents the 25 per cent increase I told you about a week ago.

	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the new Minister of Human Resources 
Development.
<P>
	The government's latest billion dollar tax grab is a payroll tax on 
part time employment. Why has the government imposed a new tax 
on part time employment that will hurt those Canadians least able 
to afford it: small business, working mothers and university 
students working their way through school?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are approaching the 
unemployment situation in a new way. We want to make sure there 
is an ethic of work in this country. We want to make sure that every 
hour counts.
<P>
	Five hundred thousand workers now benefit from unemployment 
insurance, which we now call employment insurance. They are 
now covered by this scheme because part time workers are 
included in it.
<P>
	This is part of the new labour market we are in where many 
people work only part time. We wanted to cover them and this is 
the reason we are doing it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister says that every hour counts. So does every dollar. The 
government will collect between $1 billion and $1.5 billion before 
it pays out any benefits with this new tax.
<P>
	Taxing part time employment results in increased labour costs 
and with any kind of logic the net result is fewer jobs.
<P>
	Given the government has a $5 billion surplus in the UI fund, 
why will the government not give an immediate 28 per cent to 30 
per cent reduction in the UI tax rate as recommended by the 
Reform Party and the Canadian Federation of Independent 
Business so that businesses can help stimulate the economy, help 
stimulate job creation and help business create those jobs that the 
government promised?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
when one looks at the Reform Party's suggestion, it would appear it 
is going to pay for its premium reduction by eliminating a great 
deal of the benefit that arises from the program.
<P>
	These are the questions one should really address: Is it true that 
the Reform Party would eliminate sickness benefits? Is it true that 
the Reform Party would eliminate maternity benefits? Is it true that 
what the Reform Party would do with unemployment insurance is 
to put Canadians out on their own and effectively pay for that 
premium cut by cutting off those Canadians who are most in need 
of the help it provides?

	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, last 
Friday, the Commission nationale des parents francophones 
released a study on the funding of official languages programs. 
This study shows that the federal government clearly favours the 
anglophone minority in Quebec at the expense of the francophone 
minority in Canada.
<P>
	Can the Minister of Canadian Heritage confirm that, according 
to her own figures, 1 million francophones outside Quebec receive 
only 36 per cent of the budget allocated to the official languages 
teaching program, compared to 64 per cent for the 636,000 
anglophones in Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to see that 
the hon. member, who learned such good French in his hometown 
of Penetanguishene, now admits that there are 1 million 
francophones outside Quebec, that they are not paraplegics in 
wheelchairs in any way, shape or form, and that they are not about 
to disappear.
<P>
	Second, I am also happy to admit that, since the inception of the 
bilingualism and biculturalism commission, the federal 
government has invested $5 billion in this area. Ever since we came 
to office and even today, for every dollar spent on providing 
services to anglophones in Quebec, two dollars are spent on 
francophones in the rest of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
saying that the minister is ``like'' a snowblower is not the same as 
saying she ``is'' a snowblower. When I spoke about francophones 
outside Quebec, I did not mean that they were paraplegics in 
wheelchairs, but that, compared to anglophones, they are put at 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5480"> 5480 </A></B>
<P>
somewhat of a disadvantage by this government,  especially since 
the minister cannot even answer such a simple question.
<P>
	So I ask the question again, because she probably wants to 
correct such a deplorable situation in this so-called bilingual 
country.
<P>
<B>(1440)</B>
<P>
	Can she do it? She suggested some action plans at a press 
conference. So I am asking her, since we know what federal action 
plans to save francophones are worth, if the federal government has 
ways of forcing the provinces to better fulfil their constitutional 
obligations to francophones?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I gave a specific answer. 
At this time, for every dollar spent on minority schools in Quebec, 
two dollars are spent outside.
<P>
	The figures quoted by the Comité national des parents 
francophones reflect the fact that there used to be many more 
English language school boards in Quebec because that province's 
education policies supported minorities, which was not the case in 
some other provinces in the 1980s.
<P>
	Today, thanks to federal policies, there is a French language 
school board in every province, except Ontario. That is why the 
figures show the way things should have been in the early 1980s, 
but unfortunately were not.

	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last week the Prime Minister announced his fiscal policy 
for the near future. Higher taxes will be used to balance the budget. 
Higher tax revenues will be used to increase spending. It is obvious 
that the Prime Minister only listens to old fashioned Liberals who 
get their jollies out of spending other people's money.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Why does he fail to grasp 
that Canadians have a fundamental right to keep the money they 
earn and to spend it in the way they like rather than having it spent 
for them by the Liberal caucus?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I could not believe it when I read somewhere last week 
that the Reform Party is going to spend money. Remember they 
said they were to spend more money for-

	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> We are putting back what you took away.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> Fine, I do not disagree with 
that.
<P>
	We said that the goal of this government is to stay the course and 
to go to zero cash requirements and zero deficit as quickly as 
possible. We are not there yet and already the Reform Party is 
trying to spend the money we are saving.
<P>
	I said that when we are at zero there are problems in our society 
that have to be managed where the federal government has to play a 
role. We are not there just to have an across the board tax cut; that 
when a person pays $100,000 of tax he will receive $10,000 of 
benefits is not the way we will do things. We will target our tax cuts 
and spending to make sure that those in society who have less can 
have the chance that they deserve.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister has clearly defined the battleground 
for the next election. There is one group of people that will want to 
increase spending of the people's money. There is another party 
which will give it back to the people who have earned it.
<P>
	Trevor McLean, a small business owner in my riding in a recent 
letter said: ``Over-regulation and overtaxing small business have a 
multiple negative impact on our economy-. They cause enormous 
disincentives for jobs, business failure and investment''.
<P>
	Why does the Minister of Finance listen only to bureaucrats and 
in his economic update offers no hope to small business and the 
desperate unemployed Canadians who would find jobs if taxes and 
regulations were cut?
<P>
<B>(1445 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Minister of Finance has listened to the vast majority of 
economists in this country. They have said very clearly that a tax 
cut at this particular time would be inappropriate. They have said 
that a broad base tax cut at this time would not only be 
inappropriate but would undoubtedly lead to higher taxes later.
<P>
	I simply ask Reformers to listen to what John McCallum of the 
Royal Bank said last week. He said that as a result of the actions of 
this government we are going to see a steadily declining debt to 
GDP ratio. We are going to give this country the possibility of 
having tax cuts which the Reform Party is unable to provide.
<P>
	The vast majority of legitimate economists in this country have 
simply said that what the Reform Party is suggesting is the road to 
financial ruin and we will not accept it.

	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister for International Trade.
<P>
	Canada recently negotiated behind closed doors a free trade 
agreement with Israel. Given that the Israeli swimwear industry 
imports its fabric from Europe without paying duty, unlike our 
companies, this treaty may kill the top of the line swimwear

<P>
industry, which is located primarily in Quebec, thus costing 
hundreds of jobs.
<P>
	Despite the fact that the official opposition raised this important 
problem last May, and in light of the present discontent of the 
swimwear industry, how can the minister explain that he has done 
nothing to protect this up and coming industry with its job creation 
potential?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there have been extensive consultations with 
the industry through the Sector Advisory Group on International 
Trade as well as directly with the industry itself. In preparation of 
the free trade agreement with Israel a lot of consultation went on. 
As a result of that, we responded and said we would give a two and 
a half year phase out period.
<P>
	The problem the swimwear industry has is that it has to pay a 19 
per cent duty on European fabrics. We have now given the industry 
the opportunity to address this issue before the Canadian 
International Trade Tribunal to try and even up the playing field so 
that within the two and a half years it will be in a position where it 
will be able to compete fairly. The industry has accepted that so 
that we do have a level playing field and we are trying to protect 
jobs in that industry.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, when 
the minister says he has consulted, I would like to quote him 
Claude Gilbert's reaction: ``When I learned by accident that Ottawa 
was negotiating with Israel, I was terrified''. There was no 
consultation.
<P>
	In order to resolve this situation, which may well increase 
unemployment, primarily in Quebec, will the minister promise 
today to negotiate access to the European textile market at the 
earliest opportunity, and in the meantime to impose equivalent 
tariffs on Israeli products in this sector?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister for International Trade,

the next two and a half years by allowing for a phase out. I might 
also add that all of our other industries will receive immediate 
access to the Israeli market with absolutely no tariffs at all which is 
a good advantage for them.
<P>
	We are protecting that industry by giving it the opportunity to 
sort this matter out with the Canadian International Trade Tribunal. 
The industry knows what is involved and knows what to do. There 
were consultations. We will certainly want to assist it to make sure 
that we preserve jobs in Canada. Overall this agreement has to

and this very morning two of my ministers have met with a

French authorities, and I am convinced that the latter will, once

not be possible in France.

putting before the House of Commons federal endangered species 
legislation in a couple of weeks. That speaks for the aspirations of 
Canadians in all parts of the country.
<P>

<P>
	As I said, outside of complaining about the weather, this is the 
one file that elicits the most passionate response from both young 
and old alike.
<P>
	Second, it is important to understand that we want a national 
framework and not a national patchwork. That is why it is equally 
important that all the provinces and two territories, along with the 
federal government, have agreed to a national accord to protect 
endangered species. The country and Canadians will get a national 
strategy which they and these species are entitled to.

	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development.
<P>
	Under the land claims agreements which have been signed by the 
federal government and entrenched by Parliament, there is a 
provision that when federal legislation affects the groups which 
come under those land claims they must be consulted. I have 
written to his colleague, the Minister of Justice, about this issue as 
well.
<P>
	Can the minister tell the House what steps he and the Minister of 
Justice are taking to define what consultation is because it is 
causing a lot of confusion. I am afraid it will result in costly law 
cases if we do not have a definition of consultation under the land 
claims agreements.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, that is a good question.
<P>
	As the hon. member is aware and is still celebrating, the Yukon 
is now represented by a new government and three of the members 
are aboriginal. They are very concerned that there be consultation 
with First Nations. I have talked to the new leader of the Yukon and 
I am prepared to sit down with him and develop a more proactive 
scheme than we had under the former government.

<P>
Question No. 56-<B>Mr. Wells:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Have any tenders been awarded in the past 12 months by Public Works Canada 
where any condition or provision provided for in the tender document was waived 
and the contract awarded despite the non-compliance with this provision or 
condition?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services, Lib.):</B> It is Public Works and Government 
Services Canada, PWGSC, policy that bids be evaluated solely 
against the criteria set out in the tender document. In addition, all 
contracts issued are subject to compliance audit. In two recent 
audits of contracting, in both headquarters and the regions, and 
based upon a random selection of files, no cases were identified in 
which mandatory bid evaluation criteria were waived.
<P>
	However, suppliers who believe that PWGSC has failed to 
comply with the stipulated criteria in a tender have recourse to the 
Canadian International Trade Tribunal, CITT. Over the past 12 
months, approximately 60,000 contracts have been awarded. 
During this time the CITT has found that on two occasions, 
PWGSC through error did not conduct the evaluation according to 
the criteria set out in the bid solicitation.
<P>
	PWGSC strives continually to ensure that errors of this nature 
are not repeated. Systems and procedures are constantly evaluated 
and ``lessons learned'' maintained in order to improve our 
performance in this regard.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="NUNAVUTWATERSACT">NUNAVUT WATERS ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-51, 
an act respecting the water resources of Nunavut, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Just before question period the hon. member for 
Kootenay East had the floor. It is around 35 minutes that he still has 
left.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, members 
will be happy to know that after the first five minutes I am already 
half way through my speech which does not change the fact that we 
are going to be opposing this bill for three fundamental reasons. 
Just before the break we were dealing with reason number one 
which is that it represents bad government.
<P>
	Good government has to do with having people elect some 
leaders who are responsible to ensure that public services are 
provided at a cost people can afford by the level closest to the 
people best able to perform the service efficiently.
<P>
	Instead, the Nunavut water board is appointed by the Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development who in turn was 
appointed by the Prime Minister after being elected by the people 
of Sault Ste. Marie, a long way from Nunavut. Its costs will be paid 
by the people of Canada who have no say whatsoever about the 
board; all we get to do is pay for it.
<P>
	Regarding my second reason for opposing Bill C-51, namely the 
process the government used, the government has been 
ridiculously slow. The Nunavut land claims agreement passed in 
1993. It required the federal government to establish three major 
governing institutions, including the Nunavut water board within 
three years, by July 9, 1996, or the board members would be 
appointed and proceed as though the legislation had been passed. 
This Nunavut water board has been up and running for several 
months without the limits imposed on it by legislation.
<P>
	We are all aware that Bill C-51 was tabled so late last spring, on 
June 14, that there is no way it could have passed before the July 
deadline. It was totally irresponsible of the government to delay its 
consultations about the Nunavut water board with both industry 
and northern residents until August 1995. Because it was a 
foregone conclusion that especially given the great distances and 
the severe climate of the Northwest Territories it would simply not 
be possible to receive widespread public input and draw suitable 
legislation to get through Parliament before the July deadline, this 
government should have started the necessary consultations very 
shortly after it took power three years ago.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5487"> 5487 </A></B>
<P>
	Were the officials in the Department of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development so lax in their duties that they failed to 
make the fact known to their minister or did the minister simply not 
care? Clearly the Liberal government is totally unfamiliar with the 
process of thoroughly consulting with the people of Canada's 
north. Despite a lot of fine talk, the federal government has been 
run by unaccountable bureaucrats both in the south  and especially 
in the north who, plain and simple, do not realize that it takes time 
for people to provide input.
<P>
	The result is that this legislation was not brought to Parliament 
with enough time for proper debate before the July 1996 deadline.
<P>
	Another defective part of the government's process is that it has 
repeatedly refused to provide a briefing to our caucus critic and 
other members of the Reform caucus despite our repeated requests 
ever since Bill C-51 was tabled last June. Only on the morning of 
Friday, October 11 this year when Bill C-51 was quite possibly to 
be debated that same day did the government offer to brief the 
Reform caucus on Bill C-51. Clearly once again the government is 
treating this House with contempt.
<P>
	Parliament is not a rubber stamp and the Reform Party is doing 
everything possible to thwart the Liberals' efforts to depreciate this 
Parliament and the democratic process in Canada. That fact should 
probably be raised as a question of parliamentary privilege because 
the lack of a departmental briefing on legislation proposed by the 
government makes it extremely difficult for my colleagues and me 
to perform our proper role of holding the government accountable 
and providing our own thorough input about the content and likely 
effects across Canada of legislation that the government is 
proposing.
<P>
<B>(1520 )</B>
<P>
	However, this government does make it a practice to trample on 
the rights of parliamentarians, which means trampling on the rights 
of the voters who elected us. Now we must proceed with 
consideration of Bill C-51, even without a departmental briefing.
<P>
	This enactment creates the Nunavut water board to license uses 
of waters or deposits of waste on other water users. The board must 
also establish agreements providing appropriate compensation for 
any loss or damage due to changes. The board must work closely 
with the Nunavut planning commission and has input on all 
Nunavut land use plans involving water, which is to say that this 
Nunavut water board will have a remarkable influence once it is in 
place within the new illegal province of Nunavut with its sweeping 
powers. The powers are so great that Parliament had to add a 
special clause to ensure nothing in the original Nunavut bill gave 
this illegal province greater powers than those enjoyed by the legal 
provinces. That clause is subsection (2) of section 23 of the 
Nunavut Act, which should never have been allowed to pass this 
House in the first place.
<P>
	This is my final point of objection and certainly the most serious. 
It was raised in the book <I>Our Home or Native Land?</I>, written by 
constitutional scholar and lawyer Mel Smith of Victoria, B.C. Mr. 
Smith wrote that perhaps the only way out of the terrible waste and
<P>
over government of the Nunavut deal would be to declare the entire 
issue unconstitutional. I quote page 22 of his book:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Since 1982, the Canadian Constitution requires that the establishment of new 
provinces requires the approval of not only Parliament but also at least seven 
provincial legislatures having 50 per cent of the population of Canada. If this new 
territory is not tantamount to establishing a new province without the consent of the 
other provinces and therefore subverting the constitutional requirement, then I do 
not know what a new province would look like. If it looks like a duck, quacks like a 
duck and walks like a duck, the chances are it's a duck.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Therefore I ask my hon. colleagues, very few of whom were 
elected to Parliament when it passed legislation to create the vast 
new bureaucracy called Nunavut, to join me in opposing Bill C-51, 
the Nunavut waters act, not only because it represents bad 
government and was advanced by a bad process but because the 
original Nunavut legislation should be declared unconstitutional.
<P>

	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.

<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to address Bill C-49, the 
Administrative Tribunals (Remedial and Disciplinary Measures) 
Act. This bill illustrates once again our government's commitment 
to fulfill the promises it made to Canadians.
<P>
	The bill is part of an integrated and consistent effort to promote 
sound public management and economic growth. It is also a major 
component of our goal to restore the confidence of Canadians in 
their national institutions.
<P>
	We must continue to build this confidence by displaying 
openness, honesty and integrity, while also managing our finances 
in a responsible way. Members of this House are aware of the 
results of the program review, this fundamental analysis of all 
federal departments, programs and activities.
<P>
	Members will also remember that last year we discussed Bill 
C-65, the first legislation on government organization, before 
eventually passing it. This legislation stemmed from a review of all 
the federal government's boards, agencies, commissions and 
advisory bodies. It was the first omnibus bill designed to eliminate 
redundant organizations and to streamline the operations of federal 
organizations and boards, so as to improve effectiveness and the 
quality of services provided to Canadians.
<P>
	The legislation before us today is the second omnibus bill to 
implement the decisions I announced in February of last year in the 
final report stemming from the agency review. The bill also seeks 
to implement other changes deemed necessary following the 
review, while increasing administrative accountability and 
uniformity for 30 organizations by winding up seven organizations 
and restructuring or downsizing 13 others.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Last year's act eliminated 150 governor in council positions, 
wound up 9 organizations and downsized 16 others. The bill before 
us will wind up 7 organizations and eliminate a further 271 
governor in council positions for savings each year of about $2.5 
million.
<P>
	I am also happy to report that as a result of the agency review 
over 400 other governor in council positions are being eliminated 
by order in council, by separate legislation and administratively.
<P>
	In total, the review will see the wind-up of over 80 organizations 
and the elimination of over 800 governor in council positions.
<P>
	I suggest to all hon. members that these results, while not 
insignificant in themselves, are indicative of a much larger issue. 
When we start thinking hard about getting government right, as we 
promised we would do, when we take some clear decisions about 
putting the government's affairs in order, the pay-offs to taxpayers 
and all Canadians can be very substantial indeed.
<P>
	When I say pay-offs I do not simply mean saving tax dollars, 
important as that may be. Like most major western democracies 
facing severe financial pressures, Canada has been seriously 
rethinking the role of government in the modern state.
<P>
	How do we restore the hope and confidence of Canadians in their 
future? How do we reconnect citizens with their government so 
they can see that government is immediately relevant to their daily 
lives?
<P>
	Government itself is critical in answering both questions.

	How then do we reshape the federal government so that it 
focuses on the things that only government can do or can do best? 
Canadians repeatedly told us that they have had enough of big 
government. The message was clear and simple. Government is too 
big, it is too costly and it is not close enough to the people it serves.
<P>
	To give Canadians the government and economic opportunities 
they expect and deserve, we have provided leadership in reducing 
the deficit, rethinking the whole role of the federal government, 
reforming our social security system, making federalism more 
efficient and streamlining government agencies.
<P>
	Clearly the bill before us is an integral part of this government's 
coherent and wide ranging program of government renewal.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Program review was another key feature of our strategy to 
promote job creation and economic growth. This was the most 
comprehensive review of governmental programs and services in 
two generations.
<P>
	The purpose was to reduce government operations to a bare 
minimum, a core of essential services, in an orderly fashion. And 
this is exactly our approach in pursuing the three program review 
objectives: first, to reduce the public administration function of 
federal programs and services, resulting in a leaner and more 
effective federal government providing high priority programs to 
Canadians; second, to modernize Canadian federalism, enabling 
our government to ensure the provision of programs and services 
only when the federal government is the most appropriate level of 
government to do so; and third, to help the government meet its 
financial targets.
<P>
	This essentially entails reviewing all of the federal government's 
responsibilities and determining which of these Canadians can 
afford. Now that positive results are starting to show, I am sure that 
the distinguished members of this House will agree that we made a 
wise decision in taking measured steps. The review was not just 
another bureaucracy bashing initiative. Neither did it reflect the 
latest fad in management styles. And it definitely was not an absurd 
slash and burn exercise.
<P>
	In the past, many studies were conducted on behalf of the federal 
government by the Lambert Commission in 1979, by the Nielsen 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5489"> 5489 </A></B>
<P>
Task Force in 1986 and as part of the Public Service 2000 initiative 
in 1990. We are strongly encouraged to eliminate waste and 
inefficiency within the public service, especially during election  
campaigns. It is obvious however that the review should not result 
only in little squares being moved around on public service 
organization charts.
<P>
	Why is this review different? Simply because our government 
has the political will to act and enough imagination to take 
whatever action is required. This review focuses on the main 
problems we are facing, namely the need to reduce government 
spending and improve the economy in order to promote job 
creation.
<P>
	Another distinctive feature is that this review involved every 
minister and department. Departments are now setting aside their 
secondary responsibilities and merging so that similar programs 
and services can be grouped in a single portfolio. They are 
eliminating costly overlap and duplication and using new 
technologies to reduce the cost of providing services while raising 
standards. Finally, they are funding necessary programs through 
cost recovery and user fees.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I began by suggesting that Bill C-49 is an integral part of our 
well thought out program of government renewal, of getting 
government right. It is the second omnibus bill to implement 
decisions stemming from the review of agencies helping to 
simplify government by eliminating unnecessary or inactive 
organizations and streamlining others.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	The 1994 budget launched this review and its major work is now 
virtually completed. We have no set targets. Rather, we wanted to 
identify sensible and practical changes to make government work 
better.
<P>
	Ministers reviewed the various agencies within their portfolios 
and recommendations for change were made in consultation with 
the agencies themselves and with the Canadians they serve. For 
example, the changes range from eliminating a single governor in 
council position on the International Boundary Commission to 
reducing the governor in council positions on the Canada Pension 
Plan Review Tribunal from 400 to 300 members.
<P>
	Other amendments relate to accountability, standardization and 
administrative efficiency. These affect 30 organizations.
<P>
	Members will notice that the bill improve the governance of 
agencies, boards and commissions in two main ways. First, 
governor in council appointments have been reduced to the 
minimum number necessary for efficient operation. Second, 
accountability has been improved in several ways.
<P>
	One example is the phrase ``remedial and disciplinary 
measures'' in the bill's title. This refers to the fact that several 
statutes do not provide clear mechanisms for those rare cases where 
it might be necessary to undertake remedial or disciplinary 
measures with regard to a member of an administrative tribunal  
appointed during good behaviour. The bill now brings in consistent 
provisions.
<P>
	The bill's provisions clarify the complex accountability of 
persons appointed during good behaviour on the one hand and 
during pleasure on the other. Persons appointed during good 
behaviour may be removed only for cause. This applies to 
appointees of agencies at arm's length where independence and 
impartiality are important. An example is the National Parole 
Board.
<P>
	Where appointments to serve during good behaviour are not 
justified by the need for independence and impartiality, the bill 
amends tenure to serving during pleasure. This means that 
appointees may be removed at the discretion of the governor in 
council.
<P>
	Finally, to clarify accountability, consistent appointment 
mechanisms are being introduced for the chairpersons of 
administrative tribunals.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I think this bill illustrates on a reduced scale our preferred 
formula for rethinking the government's role. Until the basic 
questions are raised, the temptation is to go on as before. On the 
other hand, some are now saying about government that what has 
not been reviewed does not deserve to survive.
<P>
	We are rapidly moving toward some radical changes aimed at 
reducing the size of the federal government so that it can focus on 
national roles, responsibilities and priorities and provide the 
services important to Canadians at a cost everyone can afford.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Programs and services must focus even more on client needs, not 
on jurisdictional hair splitting or administrative needs. I believe 
that national confidence in government can be restored if it is 
involved in activities that properly belong to it.
<P>
	Government in today's world cannot be static. I see a constant 
and continuing rethinking about how we can do better. The results 
will be a more responsive, service oriented and leaner government. 
It will mean more sensible federal priorities concentrated on the 
major social and economic issues. As clients, Canadians want 
services that are speedy, accessible, reliable and responsive.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	As citizens, Canadians want services that guarantee health and 
safety, public security, fairness and equity and economic 
well-being. As taxpayers, Canadians want a government that is 
efficient and cost effective. In other words, Canadians want a 
competent government with political imagination, leadership and 
courage. That is exactly what this government will continue to 
deliver.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
legislation is about administrative tribunals and the dissolution of 
certain federal agencies.
<P>
	As Treasury Board critic for the official opposition, I will first 
address the real financial impact of Bill C-49 and then I will look 
more closely at its administrative and political impact.
<P>
	The minister tells us that all these dissolutions and 
reorganizations contained in Bill C-49 and in a similar bill adopted 
by Parliament in June 1995 will result in savings of about $10 
million a year.
<P>
	What is the use of all these changes which, according to the 
minister, may help us save some $10 million a year when we know 
that, in spite of their red book promises, the Liberals have let the 
public debt grow and have not addressed the problem of chronic 
unemployment. Ten million dollars is just a drop in the ocean of 
debt created by the Liberals. Canada's debt is growing by more 
than $100 million a day, which is ten times more a day than Bill 
C-49 and the other bill adopted in June 1995 will help us save in a 
year.
<P>
	Since 1961, the federal debt has increased twenty-six-fold, and 
the Liberals have been in power during 26 of those 35 years. We 
know who is responsible for this huge debt.
<P>
	In its annual brief presented to federal parliamentarians in 
December 1995, the Conseil du patronat du Quebec asked the 
federal government to set right then a higher deficit reduction 
target than the one it is supposed to meet in March 1997, which is 
$24.3 billion. Reducing the deficit to $20 billion by March 31, 
1997 should be a minimum target according to the Conseil du 
patronat du Québec, which invites the federal government to 
re-examine seriously its spending rather than increase direct or 
indirect taxes paid by Canadians.
<P>
	And a bill such as Bill C-49 will not lead to a serious 
examination and considerable reduction of federal spending. The 
deficit reduction targets are too low and efforts to stop the growth 
of our debt are insufficient.
<P>
	Bill C-49, just like the last budget tabled by the Minister of 
Finance, means the end of the government's efforts to put our fiscal 
house in order. The impact of the budget measures on the deficit 
will be non-existent this year and will total only $200 million next 
year. Can you imagine an impact of $200 million over a two-year 
period on an annual budget of over $160 billion. This is ridiculous.
<P>
	The President of the Treasury Board and the Minister of Finance 
are still trying to make us believe that deficit reduction remains one 
of the major concerns of cabinet, by regularly bombarding us with 
statistics on the debt as a percentage of the GDP and by comparing 
Canada to countries with the worst record concerning deficit  
reduction. Let me remind the minister that there is no glory in 
making such comparisons.
<P>
	In the briefing notes released by the Treasury Board, it is written 
in black and white that the two stages of the agency review will 
only account for $10 million in savings. The Liberals have come up 
with very little after making such a big show of the program 
review, which has not amounted to much. It is, indeed, very 
disappointing.
<P>
	As I said earlier, the President of the Treasury Board and 
minister responsible for this program review has been making a lot 
of fuss these past two years, by bringing forth some very 
impressive figures: 45,000 jobs cut in the civil service, and more 
cuts right and left.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	In fact, we should let the figures speak for themselves. If it were 
not for the estimated increase in revenue of $100 million this year 
and $245 million next year, the budget re-allocation made by the 
minister in charge of the Treasury Board would have resulted in an 
operational deficit of $134 million for this year and of $92 million 
for next year.
<P>
	Why cut so many jobs and affect so many workers and their 
families if just to re-allocate funds to so-called priorities? Not only 
is this exercise bound to result in no gain or even worse a deficit, 
but a slower economic growth than what was forecast could mean 
an even higher deficit in the upcoming years.
<P>
	The government does not keep its word. Furthermore, it wants us 
to believe that it exceeds its own objectives. Fiscally speaking, Bill 
C-49 is nothing but a smokescreen to hide the fact that the Liberals 
are not able to reduce the deficit.
<P>
	All the accumulated effects of this year's budget will have an 
impact of only $1.9 billion by 1999. Do not forget that the 
predicted impact of the 1994 budget was $45 billion over 5 years 
and that of the 1995 budget was $43 billion over 4 years. According 
to the predictions, this year's budget will have a nominal impact of 
$1.9 billion on the debt, which will have increased by $110 billion 
by the end of this Liberal government's mandate.
<P>
	The government is dragging its feet and continuing to estimate 
the impact of its actions over several years because they are 
generally laughable when taken individually each year. And the 
best example of this is Bill C-49 tabled by the minister responsible 
for the Treasury Board.
<P>
	All the important decisions concerning cuts and reductions in 
spending were taken in the 1994 and 1995 budgets. Why then 
propose an administrative overhaul, which will have no real impact 
on government management? In practice, the finance minister 
always tables deferred budgets to avoid the backlash of unpopular 
decisions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5491"> 5491 </A></B>
<P>
	Cuts undertaken in past years coming into effect in 1996 and 
1997 will continue to reduce government expenditures without the 
need for the government to make some new unpopular decisions 
this year and as it approaches the deadline of the elections planned 
for next year.
<P>
	Meanwhile, the President of the Treasury Board is proceeding 
with a few administrative and symbolic changes to show that the 
government is still bent on improving public finances. This is an 
election-oriented strategy and the people is not fooled by it.
<P>
	With regard to the political and administrative impact of Bill 
C-49, we can say without fear of error that the President of the 
Treasury Board set out some fine principles in the backgrounder we 
received recently from his officials, but, in fact, this piece of 
legislation is backward looking when it comes to the administrative 
tools it is proposing and shamefully partisan in its objectives.
<P>
	The Treasury Board's backgrounder talks about streamlining 
disciplinary measures taken by administrative tribunals, 
streamlining the process of appointing chairpersons to 
administrative tribunals, winding up 7 federal agencies and 
revamping or downsizing 13 others, as well as standardizing 
terminology and pay, and several other changes. All these are fine 
principles indeed, but what is Bill C-49 really hiding?
<P>
	Let us take a closer look at the administrative and political 
consequences of this piece of legislation. Bill C-49 makes 
significant changes in the way administrative tribunals operate. 
Several of my Bloc colleagues will take the floor shortly, as critics, 
to tell you about the particular impact of Bill C-49 on each one of 
the 19 administrative tribunals involved.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	I ask the House for unanimous consent for the following motion. 
I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, when Bill C-49, an act to authorize remedial and disciplinary measures in 
relation to members of certain administrative tribunals, to reorganize and dissolve 
certain federal agencies and to make consequential amendments to other Acts, has 
been concurred in by the Liberal majority at second reading, it be referred to every 
standing committee of the House connected with an administrative tribunal affected 
by the said bill.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Dear colleague, if I am not mistaken, you are 
asking for unanimous consent of the House on a motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bélisle:</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> In my opinion, this amendment is not admissible 
at this point. We will go on. To obtain unanimous consent, the 
motion must be admissible and I do not think it is. So you may 
continue with your speech.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bélisle:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	Even though they are not as well-known as superior courts, the 
administrative tribunals have major impacts on the daily life of 
Canadians and Quebecers. Their rulings often have serious 
consequences for the citizens and the country.
<P>
	In fact, the increased importance of administrative tribunals in 
recent years is common knowledge. They have become popular 
decision-making venues where the citizens regularly face the 
government to assert their rights.
<P>
	For more than 25 years now, a debate on these administrative 
tribunals has been going on in Quebec. A project for the reform of 
administrative tribunals has even been submitted to the Quebec 
National Assembly. Fundamental questions like the independence 
and the impartiality of the judges of those tribunals are being 
discussed there.
<P>
	Although they are being debated at the Quebec government 
level, these issues are also relevant at the federal level. Bill C-49 
could have solved the fundamental problem of partisan 
appointments of members of the administrative tribunals. But the 
federal government chose to return to a not so glorious past in that 
area instead of modernizing the appointment process as Quebec is 
about to do.
<P>
	At a time when the public is so cynical about politicians, the 
President of the Treasury Board is implementing even more 
partisan rules, which give political authorities increased control 
over the administrative tribunals.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	The bill establishes a new mechanism to remove from office 
people appointed to administrative tribunals by the governor in 
council. This is in clause 3 of the bill. Also, after certain 
procedures, the governor in council will have the power to remove 
these people from office for cause, as specified in the bill.
<P>
	Only after receiving an inquiry report, will the minister have the 
power to make a recommendation ``to suspend the member without 
pay, remove the member from office or impose any other 
disciplinary measure or any remedial measure''. This is in clause 
14 of the bill. The minister's recommendations are entirely at his 
discretion, regardless of the content of the inquiry report.
<P>
	Chairpersons of administrative tribunals will now all be 
designated instead of being appointed. Such a change makes the 
chairperson very vulnerable to political pressures by the 
government, which can simply designate a new chairman when it 
sees fit. These new measures can even further undermine the 
credibility of administrative tribunals and, moreover, make them 
even more 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5492"> 5492 </A></B>
<P>
dependent on political authority. It is unacceptable to introduce 
measures that seriously attack the independence and impartiality of 
administrative tribunals. It really flies in the face of the 
transparency people want from a modern and progressive 
government.
<P>
	Unfortunately, federal administrative tribunals are constantly the 
object of Liberal patronage. This was true under Trudeau, and it is 
still true under the present Prime Minister.
<P>
	The President of the Treasury Board refuses to discuss these 
important issues because he wants to maintain the power of 
ministers to appoint the members of administrative tribunals. Any 
reform of administrative tribunals should start with the arbitrary 
nature of the process for appointing and renewing the mandates of 
administrative judges. In 1996, political patronage in a 
quasi-judiciary process should no longer exist in a modern 
democracy like ours.
<P>
	Bill C-49 is a direct attack on the independence and impartiality 
of judges. The Liberal government is fully prepared to ignore 
principles that should underlie the work of administrative tribunals. 
With the sword of Damocles that he wants to suspend above the 
heads of members of administrative tribunals, the President of the 
Treasury Board may vitiate the entire judicial process of 
administrative tribunals. In so doing he is subordinating the 
judiciary to political considerations.
<P>
	The president of the Quebec Bar Association was very clear 
about this when she said, and I quote: ``The lack of job security 
may have an unexpected psychological impact on the decisions of a 
person who may be more concerned about pleasing the government 
than rendering a fair judgment''. This quote was taken from <I>Le 
Soleil</I> of July 8, 1995.
<P>
	Members of administrative tribunals might even be reluctant to 
develop jurisprudence that would be favourable to the individual, 
so as not to penalize the State.
<P>
	The Liberals, with their base partisan manoeuvring, are 
attacking the very foundations of a modern democracy. The 
separation of powers has long been a part of Canadian and Quebec 
democracy, and the minister would do well to drop Bill C-49 if he 
does not want to go down in history as the man for whom the 
development and modernization of institutions is a backdoor 
proposition.
<P>
	This government bill is totally unacceptable. It is a direct attack 
on the impartiality and independence of members of administrative 
tribunals. These two principles are seen as fundamental to a 
democratic society, principles that the government prefers to 
ignore in favour of maintaining its power to make partisan 
appointments to administrative tribunals.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	These appointments are a way to reward friends of the party who 
may not always have the qualifications to exercise such important 
duties. The Liberals are simply perpetuating the patronage system 
with which they are so familiar and which has been their trademark 
as a government for a long time.
<P>
	I hope the Minister responsible for the Treasury Board will listen 
to reason and withdraw this retrograde and backward looking bill. 
The minister will have a chance to redeem himself by supporting 
my amendment to Bill C-49, which is as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``this House declines to give second reading to Bill C-49, An Act to authorize 
remedial and disciplinary measures in relation to members of certain administrative 
tribunals, to reorganize and dissolve certain federal agencies and to make 
consequential amendments to other Acts, because the principle of the said Bill does 
not allow for the possibility for any parliamentary mechanism governing the 
appointment or revocation of the appointment of members of administrative 
tribunals.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The amendment is in order.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, perhaps you 
can clarify whether we are talking about the amendment. Is debate 
only on the amendment or can we still talk about the bill, since it is 
the intention of the amendment to postpone the bill.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Let me put it in these terms. 
Technically we are debating the amendment. Of course the original 
motion is always relevant. I will leave that to your interpretation.
<P>
<B>(1605 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the advice. I also 
appreciate the motion by my colleague from the Bloc that says we 
should not be debating this bill. We in the Reform Party do not 
agree with the contents of the bill either.
<P>
	If I can endorse the feelings of my colleague from the Bloc 
perhaps I can give my feelings on Bill C-49 and why this bill 
should be voted down and out. I do not think the government has 
achieved very much other than some grandiose statements from the 
President of the Treasury Board in introducing the bill. It was a 
wonderful speech but when it is analysed he did not have much to 
say.
<P>
	One point that did strike me as being very important was the 
statement that 271 positions had been eliminated. Attached to that 
was the statement that $2.5 million would be saved. When we look 
at the 271 positions that are being eliminated we find that these are 
271 vacant positions. The minister gave no explanation of how he 
was saving $2.5 million by eliminating positions that are sitting 
vacant and were not costing taxpayers anything. I  wonder how this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5493"> 5493 </A></B>
<P>
is going to move the Liberal agenda forward or is it just more 
smoke and mirrors of the type that we have become accustomed to 
over the last three years in this House.
<P>
	Unfortunately, I have drawn the conclusion that it is very likely 
in the realm of smoke and mirrors than an actual advancement of 
policy which is why I think the Bloc's amendment is in order.
<P>
	Patronage has always run long and deep and lies close to the 
heart of members of the Liberal Party. That is why when the 
President of the Treasury Board is touting this as a great new 
advancement I am somewhat sceptical. I looked at some of the 
points he made, such as keeping promises to Canadians, which I 
will talk more about later. The major component of the objective of 
this exercise is to improve the confidence of Canadians in the 
exercise of government. We are talking more government and more 
spending.
<P>
	Reformers have asked the Minister of Finance to cut spending 
but the spending of this government has not changed in three years. 
Interest costs on the deficit have more than offset any decreases the 
Minister of Finance has been able to make elsewhere. The actual 
cost of government is just as much today as it was three years ago 
except that Canadians are getting less for their money as it is used 
to pay interest and given to bankers, lenders, foreign investors and 
all the people who really do not need the taxpayers' money.
<P>
	I listened to the Minister of Finance during question period 
today. He was really getting quite hot and bothered by the Reform 
Party's plan. He tried to defend his own but I did not hear him 
defend how he taxes Canadians, especially poor Canadians and 
young Canadians who are looking for jobs. The money is 
transferred to foreign investors, bankers, money lenders and so on 
who are rich beyond all imagination. This is just because the 
government cannot get its spending act together. These are the 
types of things for which Canadians want answers.
<P>
	Now the President of the Treasury Board stands up in the House 
and gives us a wonderful speech. However, when it is analysed he 
has not said anything. There will be 271 positions eliminated. Is 
that not a wonderful piece of work? When we look underneath we 
find these are vacant positions. He has not axed one single person 
out of the patronage pork barrel. Did he tell us that? No. Did he tell 
Canadians that? No. Did he admit that this was just smoke and 
mirrors? No. This was presented as wonderful leadership by the 
government.
<P>
	The philosophy of appointments by the Liberal Party is 
questionable at best. Merit is certainly not a consideration. When I 
say merit I again come back to the President of the Treasury Board. 
He is the minister in charge of the department that is the employer 
of the civil service. We are trying to introduce merit into the civil 
service to recognize the people who work harder and do  a better 
job, who deserve more pay and to be advanced up the ladder faster. 
Yet we have Bill C-49 which contains 100 pages or so and not one 
single mention of merit in it.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	The President of the Treasury Board is promoting merit but 
supports a bill that completely bypasses merit and favours 
partisanship. The minister has a mandate to renew the civil service 
which he has accomplished through job cuts and the restructuring 
of departments. Yet Bill C-49 offers no such review of 
appointments or an overhaul of the appointment process.
<P>
	The government has eliminated 45,000 jobs in the civil service. 
Not all of them are legitimate eliminations. There are lots of smoke 
and mirrors too. However, the point is there is some serious 
downsizing in the civil service. But no, the government cannot 
touch the patronage jobs. It can eliminate the jobs that are sitting 
vacant, but will not go after its friends.
<P>
	The bill goes on to restructure words. Fisherman is eliminated 
and replaced by fisher. The President of the Treasury Board 
promotes neutrality, accountability and integrity within the civil 
service but does not feel that these qualities should apply to Liberal 
colleagues when they are appointed to the plum patronage posts. 
Smoke and mirrors. As the House will see, Liberal Party claims 
about how much it has done to improve the patronage system is 
really bogus.
<P>
	Let me remind my hon. colleagues on the other side of their 
party's boasts some three years ago in the red book. On page 92 it 
states: ``A Liberal government will make competence and diversity 
the criteria for federal appointments''. I read in the paper this 
morning that with the Liberal convention coming up this weekend 
they are going to publish a document telling us how many of these 
promises they have met. Bill C-49 does not even have the word 
competence in it yet it deals with patronage appointments by the 
hundreds.
<P>
	I wonder how the crafters of this document are going to tell us 
how they achieved their promises in the red book. I am sure they 
will be able to point to one particular appointment where just by 
chance perhaps the guy actually has some qualifications as well as 
being a member of the Liberal Party and hence the promise has 
been fulfilled.
<P>
	Let us remember that a Liberal government will make 
competence and diversity the criteria for federal appointments. 
However in the bill there is not a mention.
<P>
	How strange is it that the best candidate all too often turns out to 
be a Liberal? For example, the current Minister of National 
Defence appointed Marian Robinson, a long time Liberal staffer to 
the National Transportation Agency with a per diem of $500 a day 
without even interviewing her to determine her competency or 
expertise in the field. However, being a  good Liberal and working 
for the minister deserves an appointment courtesy of the taxpayer.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5494"> 5494 </A></B>
<P>
	How about all of these appointments to the Senate in the last 
three years? Many of them came from that side of the House. Not 
one of them was not beholden and committed to the Liberal Party.
<P>
	I have a book here that I got from the Library. It is called <I>Federal 
cabinet appointments handbook: A compendium of Governor in 
Council appointments.</I> You can see how thick it is, Mr. Speaker. If 
the number of pages are counted it might be embarrassing. There 
are a number of pages for each chapter. It is full of the names of 
people, hundreds and thousands of people, each and every one of 
them enjoying the largesse of the taxpayer in order to do some 
political appointment job. There are lists of names under the 
Department of Health, the Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse, 
the Medical Council of Canada, Medical Research Council, 
National Advisory Council on Aging, Patented Medicines Price 
Review Board.
<P>
	Let us move to a different chapter. Under the Renewable 
Resources Board, the chairperson is picked by the governor in 
council with remuneration at $200 to $275 a day. Renewable 
Resource Board, in Sahtu in the Northwest Territories, per diem 
$160 to $250 a day. Under the Department of Industry there is the 
National Economic Development Board, remuneration to be fixed 
by the minister but it does not tell us how much.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	There is the Business Development Bank of Canada and pages of 
names. Remuneration is $200 to $300 a day with an annual retainer 
of $4,000 to $5,000. This one is up. As soon as we put a bank in 
there I guess it deserves more. This is getting expensive.
<P>
	There is the Canadian Space Agency, the Canadian Tourism 
Commission, the Copyright Board. There is Edmonton Northlands, 
in my hometown. There are two people on there. Remuneration is 
fixed by the organization. Directors who are public servants serve 
without remuneration but they look to be local people who have 
served for pleasure.
<P>
	On and on it goes with hundreds of names, thousands of people, 
millions of dollars and no accountability.
<P>
	Going back to the government, the Prime Minister in his 
acceptance speech in 1993 vowed that Liberals were elected to 
serve the people of Canada and not to serve themselves. Is that not 
a wonderful statement? The Liberals were elected to serve the 
people of Canada, not to serve themselves yet when we look at all 
these patronage appointments it is rather interesting.
<P>
	I have a copy of the Monday, October 14, 1996 edition of the <I>Hill 
Times</I>. It contains part one of the Liberal patronage appointments. I 
put the emphasis on part one.
<P>
	Let us take a look at Gerald Allbright who was appointed to the 
Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench. Party: Liberal. 
Background: a well known Liberal supporter.
<P>
	Gary Anstey. Position: Minister of Fisheries, that is the previous 
minister, Brian Tobin, who is now the premier of Newfoundland. 
He was appointed as executive assistant. Party: Liberal. He worked 
for another member of Parliament and later resigned from Mr. 
Tobin's office temporarily until cleared of financial wrongdoings. 
A little shaky there.
<P>
	There is Claire Brouillet, a staffer in the Minister of Transport's 
office. She was an unsuccessful candidate in Terrebonne in 1993 so 
she got a political patronage plum rather than being in this House. 
Talk about political patronage.
<P>
	There is Richard Campbell, Director, Marine Atlantic. Party: 
Liberal. He was the campaign manager for Lawrence MacAulay. It 
carries on.
<P>
	There is Moses Coady, a lobbyist. He is a former aide to Liberal 
Allan MacEachen and is seeking infrastructure dollars. Well there 
you are.
<P>
	There is Dorothy Davey, vice-chair, Immigration and Refugee 
Board, Liberal.
<P>
	That is from part one. I could go on forever. Wait until next 
week's edition with part two.
<P>
	I go back to the Prime Minister's point that in his words 
``Liberals were elected to serve the people of Canada, not to serve 
themselves''. Bill C-49 does not do very much about that. The 
Prime Minister quickly forgot his promise when he appointed his 
longtime ally, Mr. André Ouellet to Canada Post with a salary of 
$160,000 a year, or when he appointed the sister of the Minister of 
National Defence to the bench at $140,000 a year, or the brother of 
the member for Gander-Grand Falls to the board of the Bank of 
Canada at $300 a day.
<P>
	Members may have recalled in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> a couple of 
weeks ago when we were giving the government such a hard time 
about its code of ethics which the Prime Minister refuses to 
divulge. The <I>Globe and Mail</I> had a little article which said that the 
perception of influence has to be avoided as well as actual 
influence.
<P>
	The perception must be avoided yet there are people who sit next 
to the Prime Minister in this House, who move out of this House 
into a $160,000 a year job. Relatives and friends of the Minister of 
National Defence move into $140,000 jobs. A brother of the 
member for Grand Falls moves to the Bank of Canada. The 
perception is downright awful.
<P>
	Canadians are sick and tired of this type of perception where 
friends and who you know is more important than what you know. 
Merit is what Canadians like. Canadians have no problem with the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5495"> 5495 </A></B>
<P>
fact that they have to compete  and work hard today to get ahead in 
this world. When I gave this country 25 years or more, it is what I 
most appreciated about this country. It was not who you are or who 
you know, but what you can do and accomplish that will get you 
ahead. That whole way of Canadian life has been thrown in the 
garbage can and people are losing faith.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	We wonder why people are losing faith in their politicians when 
there are these types of appointments, friends and relatives and 
connections right across the board. There are books in the Library 
of Parliament which contain names upon names upon names.
<P>
	Agencies, boards and tribunals were once an important forum for 
alternative decision making. In most cases they have become 
another arm of the bureaucracy, laden with people in an 
environment where political loyalties rather than merit are the 
criteria for decision making. We see organizations whose functions 
overlap and duplicate the work of the non-partisan bureaucracy, but 
where else would we be able to help our friends?
<P>
	Before I look at the bill in detail, I would like to briefly discuss 
the history of agencies and administrative tribunals in Canada. 
Agencies predate the Confederation of Canada. In 1851 the Board 
of Railway Commissioners was created. Even back then the 
independence of the agency subsequently came into question when 
in 1888 the agency was criticized because its members spent most 
of their time in Ottawa, served only on a part time basis, lacked 
expertise and were becoming subject to the daily political 
wrangling in Ottawa. What is new?
<P>
	It seems that very little has changed over the last 130 years. 
Since that time both the Glassco and the Lambert commissions 
have questioned patronage practices and agency accountability. 
But once again nothing has been done and Bill C-49 continues that 
tradition. The President of the Treasury Board has made grandiose 
statements about change, updating, revamping and eliminating 
positions but really when we look at it, nothing has changed.
<P>
	Clearly we have a problem with the government's vision of the 
roles of agencies and tribunals. The government has lost its focus 
and the lure of patronage has become too great to implement 
meaningful changes. Even where the independence of an agency 
should be respected by cabinet, it is overlooked.
<P>
	The National Parole Board is a perfect example. How often have 
we talked in the House about the problems, the mistakes, the 
incompetence of the National Parole Board that has allowed people 
to walk our streets and commit violent and horrendous crimes 
where the innocent suffer? Tragically, families are ruined all 
because the National Parole Board gets its act wrong. Of course it 
is staffed by friends of the government.
<P>
	The former chair of the parole board stated that the National 
Parole Board had become a haven for dangerously inexperienced 
appointees. I am sure he used the word dangerously advisedly 
because criminals are turned back out on to the streets and what 
happens? They commit another murder, another rape, another 
violent crime when they should be behind bars. These appointees 
have no training yet we literally put them in charge of keeping the 
doors locked on our violent offenders. That job should be given to 
competent, trained people who know how to make the proper 
decisions rather than to friends of the government.
<P>
	Political agencies have corrupted the day to day duties of the 
agencies. When I say corrupt I am not talking about illegalities but 
the whole concept of agencies as an expression of the public will by 
people who are competent and able to do so has been totally 
corrupted by the fact that they are seen as a place to reward friends 
and family. That is the corruption I speak of.
<P>
	That is why politicians are held in such low regard. This 
government has every opportunity to do something about it. It 
promised to do something about it in the red book. The Prime 
Minister promised to do something about it in his acceptance 
speech yet three years later it is the same old story.
<P>
<B>(1625 )</B>
<P>
	Bill C-49 for all its hype changes things such as ``chairman'' to 
``chair'' but does not change the fact that the National 
Transportation Agency is currently staffed by well connected 
former Liberal MPs. Bill C-49 changes the term ``fishermen'' to 
``fisher'' and the term ``salary'' to ``remuneration'', but these 
changes do not renew confidence in the appointment process. They 
are politically correct changes for a politically incorrect practice.
<P>
	Bill C-49 will reorganize the Immigration and Refugee Board, 
but that does not change the fact that Pierre Trudeau's former 
executive assistant is on the board, along with the defeated Liberal 
MP Gary McCauley. We are paying these people $80,000 a year.
<P>
	Let the truth be known. The cost cutting, the 271 positions and 
the whole exercise being proposed by the President of the Treasury 
Board has no teeth. The bill for all its fanfare saves no money and 
offers no innovation. The only innovation is the use of common 
sense that we would propose. Why were these appointments not 
eliminated a long time ago? Why did he wait and take the great 
glory of doing it all at once when the positions have been sitting 
empty for a long time?
<P>
	I have some serious problems with the bill again with what I 
perceive to be the smoke and mirrors concept. Clause 5 of the bill 
proposes that the minister will have to wait for a request by the 
chair of a tribunal or agency in order to investigate or apply any 
disciplinary measures to a member if the chair feels there is cause. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5496"> 5496 </A></B>
<P>
One could  argue that the chair is right there and aware of what is 
happening to the members and therefore it is only appropriate that 
the chair should advise the minister if he perceives any 
impropriety. That is a good argument, but there is nothing in the 
bill which causes the chair to report to the minister if he is the one 
who is accused of impropriety. There is no mechanism to deal with 
that.
<P>
	The bill also allows the minister to hide behind the chair if the 
chair does not report to the minister an impropriety of his 
colleagues. Clause 5 allows the minister to hide behind the chair. 
That is the type of innuendo which we see built into legislation. If 
there is a problem down the road with any member of any agency, 
the minister can say: ``I have not had a report from the chair. My 
hands are tied''. Nothing will be done. These innuendoes in the 
legislation will ensure the smoke and mirrors game which the 
government is so fond and capable of playing.
<P>
	I do not recall the minister talking about this aspect of the bill. 
The CBC and the CRTC for many Canadians are the bastions of 
Canadian culture. The CBC is Canadian owned. It is paid for by the 
taxpayers. It promotes Canadian culture. The CRTC regulates our 
broadcast industry to ensure that Canadian content rules are 
followed. Those are laudatory goals. Bill C-49 allows us to appoint 
non-Canadians to the boards. I scratch my head. I shake my head. 
Are we now going to say that boards such as the CBC and the 
CRTC no longer require Canadian citizens?
<P>
	The only way individuals cannot have Canadian citizenship is if 
they have not been in the country for three years. They have landed 
immigrant status but they have not been here long enough and 
therefore they cannot apply for Canadian citizenship but they can 
sit on the board of the CBC or the CRTC.
<P>
	Even if an individual has been here for three years, they must be 
sufficiently committed to Canada to say: ``I want to be a Canadian. 
I want to be known as being a Canadian. I want to stand up and be 
proud of the country that has adopted me and I want to take out 
Canadian citizenship because I am proud of this country and I want 
to support this country''. No, we do not want these people on the 
board. We only want landed immigrants.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	Bill C-49 says that our Canadian culture, which this government 
and many other governments before it have spent hundreds of 
millions of dollars promoting, can be run by non-Canadians. The 
hypocrisy is beyond belief, that this government, which has just 
gone through a referendum and almost lost the country through its 
incompetence, should now turn around and give us in Bill C-49 
these bastions of Canadian culture no longer requiring Canadian 
citizenships. It boggles my mind. I find it quite incomprehensible. I 
have no idea what this government is trying to achieve.
<P>
	If anybody doubts my word, take a look at clause 38 on page 11 
regarding the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A person is not eligible to be appointed or to continue as a director if the person is 
not a Canadian citizen who is ordinarily resident in Canada or a permanent resident 
within the meaning of the Immigration Act or if, directly or indirectly, as owner, 
shareholder-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	My point is the government has opened it up now to include 
non-Canadians, and that is not just the CBC but the CRTC and 
other organizations. You do not have to be a Canadian to sit on the 
Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.
<P>
	These are things in the bill that the minister made no mention of 
at all. There are all kinds of little things that have been slipped into 
this bill that I find rather offensive and I would have thought the 
minister would have spoken out clearly on them.
<P>
	I am also looking at the page on the Race Relations Foundation, 
clause 68. In clause 68.(1)(a) the objectives of the foundation are to 
undertake research and collect data to develop a national 
information base in order to ``eliminate racism and racial 
discrimination'', a laudable objective again.
<P>
	However, now the government has changed the act. Rather than 
trying to help eliminate racism and racial discrimination it has 
moved it into the pejorative to eliminate racism and racial 
discrimination. I would suggest this is an oxymoron. As long as we 
continue to undertake research and collect data on the number of 
people of various colours, sex, racial origin and so on that we have 
in this country, we will guarantee the continuation of racism and 
racial discrimination. That has been foisted and fostered and 
counted by the bureaucrats and agencies of this government.
<P>
	I could go on at length. There are many situations in here that I 
would like to bring up, which we will do at committee. That is 
flavour of the types of issues that deserve to be properly aired.
<P>
	In his speech the minister said that they want to rethink 
government, reach people the best way possible, that people do not 
like big government, they want government that is close to the 
people it serves. The minister should have been talking about 
decentralization and delegation rather than political appointments 
and so on.
<P>
	I support the Bloc's amendment. This type of bill is not laudable, 
as the minister would have us believe. This bill is not going to 
advance government, as the minister would have us believe. It is 
not going to reduce patronage, as we would believe. It is not going 
to fulfil the red book promises, as the minister would have us 
believe. Therefore the Bloc's amendment is perfectly in order.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Parliamentary Secretary to President 
of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
participate in the debate on Bill C-49, the administrative tribunals, 
remedial and disciplinary measures, act.
<P>
	I would like to comment on the remarks of my hon. colleague 
from St. Albert. As I understand it, to date this government has 
made 2,040 GIC appointments to agencies, boards and 
commissions. Of these, 525 or 25.7 per cent were reappointments. 
These persons, I understand, were there before November 4, 1993.
<P>
	This bill is an integral part of the government's approach to 
getting government right, renewing the federal government and 
restoring the confidence of all Canadians in our national 
institutions.
<P>
	In 1994 a review was conducted of all federal boards, agencies, 
commissions and advisory bodies as one of several initiatives 
aimed at reducing the cost of government and improving the 
efficiency of its operations.
<P>
	The objectives of the agency review were to simplify 
government by eliminating unnecessary and inactive organizations, 
to streamline operations by examining the size of boards and their 
remuneration of members and to ensure that these bodies were 
geared to meet the challenges of today and the demands of years 
ahead.
<P>
	Bill C-49 is the second omnibus bill that has introduced changes 
resulting from agency review. Last year, this House approved the 
first bill, Bill C-65, the government organization act No. 1.
<P>
	Today's bill will improve the accountability and administrative 
consistency of 30 organizations. It will amend the statutes 
governing 13 federal boards, agencies and commissions by 
restructuring or downsizing them. It will wind down 7 
organizations that are no longer necessary. It will eliminate 271 
governor in council positions. By these measures, Bill C-49 will 
save taxpayers some $2.5 million annually.
<P>
	Agency review was conducted under the leadership of the 
President of the Treasury Board. His commitment to cost effective 
and streamlined government is yet another example of what can be 
accomplished by a government that is determined to serve 
Canadians efficiently, honourably and compassionately.
<P>
	Good government means creating jobs and growth, creating 
opportunities for every Canadians.
<P>
	The critical part of the jobs and growth agenda is reshaping 
government so that it is lean, efficient and sensitive. It must 
respond to the needs of Canadians, helping all of us adapt to global 
change and an increasingly competitive marketplace.
<P>
	The bill reflects our commitment as a government. We promised 
good government to Canadians and we are delivering on that 
promise.
<P>
	I appreciate that a 70 page omnibus bill can be somewhat 
intimidating at first glance. However, the changes it introduces are 
quite straightforward and involve twelve types of proposals. 
Perhaps it would be helpful to hon. members if I commented 
briefly on each kind.
<P>
	The first three of the twelve types of proposals deal with 
accountability requirements for governor in council appointees. 
These involve changes in tenure, designation of chairperson and 
remedial and disciplinary measures. These follow from the 
decisions about the accountability in the final report of the agency 
review released in February last year by the President of the 
Treasury Board.
<P>
	The next three types of proposals concern the appointment 
authority of winding up agencies and restructuring.
<P>
<B>(1640 )</B>
<P>
	The next five are housekeeping items and the last type of 
proposal deals with other changes for better management of several 
agencies.
<P>
	Accountability is being improved, for instance, by changes in the 
tenure of some governor in council appointments. The changes will 
allow the government to manage agencies, boards and 
commissions more effectively. Members are aware that governor in 
council appointees serve either during good behaviour or during 
pleasure. Perhaps serving during good behaviour may be removed 
from office only for cause, while persons serving during pleasure 
may be removed at the discretion of the governor in council.
<P>
	In cases where good behaviour appointees are not justified by a 
need for independence and impartiality, the bill amends tenure to 
serving during pleasure. This proposal will affect five agencies, 
including the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation and the 
Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety.
<P>
	I should add that there are transition clauses in the bill so that the 
changes will not apply to incumbents.
<P>
	A related change affects the appointment provisions for the 
chairpersons of several tribunals. Most chairpersons who are 
serving during good behaviour have the status of members, which 
is actually the status that warrants the good behaviour tenure.
<P>
	For consistency, clarity and accountability, the bill modifies the 
appointment provisions in six agencies so that a person will be 
appointed a member first and then will be designated chairperson. 
As a member, he or she will serve during good behaviour; as a 
chairperson, he or she will serve during pleasure. The agencies 
include the Copyright Board and the Civil Aviation Tribunal.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5498"> 5498 </A></B>
<P>
	This appointment provision already exists in a number of other 
administrative tribunals such as the Canadian Radio-Television 
and Telecommunications Commission and the National Parole 
Board.
<P>
	Again, there are transition clauses in the bill so that changes will 
not apply to incumbents.
<P>
	Another element of accountability arises on the rare occasion 
when it might be necessary to discipline or remove a member of an 
administrative tribunal. Statutory provisions for the discipline of 
good behaviour appointees already exist for appointees on the 
Immigration and Refugee Board, the National Parole Board and the 
Veterans Review and Appeal Board.
<P>
	Bill C-49 brings in standard provisions for these three 
organizations and other administrative tribunals.
<P>
	Contrary to some speculation, standardizing these provisions 
will not make it easier for the government to remove appointees. 
One of the standard provisions will ensure that the governor in 
council has the authority to remove good behaviour appointees 
from office for cause, as is already the case in most statutes.
<P>
	The expression ``during good behaviour'' in itself does not 
clearly authorize the government to remove the office holder whom 
it has appointed and who appears to have breached that standard. 
As the law stands now, the government will likely have to seek 
assistance from a court.
<P>
	In order to provide the government clear authority to act on its 
own, some further legislative provision is needed. Therefore when 
Parliament states that a public office holder serves during good 
behaviour, the practice has developed to go on to say that the 
government can remove him or her for cause. This formula is not 
new. It can be traced back to the 1903 provisions that created the 
first federal administrative tribunal, the Board of Railway 
Commissioners.
<P>
	Viewed in this context, the reference to the governor in council's 
authority to remove for cause should not be taken to add any new 
grounds of removal beyond those already included in the concept 
of good behaviour. Nor does it allow the government to avoid its 
duty to act fairly in exercising the removal power.
<P>
	The changes do not prevent and office holder from securing 
redress in a court if he or she had been wrongfully dismissed.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	As the final report of the agency review noted, it is important for 
the government to have the authority necessary to match its 
accountability for managing federal bodies. The bill standardizes 
the appointment provisions of seven organizations so that they are 
consistent with normal practice. For example, the National Arts 
Centre Act is being amended so that the governor in council rather 
than the board of trustees  appoints the director of the centre. This 
is important because the government is accountable for the 
performance of the organization.
<P>
	The provisions of Bill C-49 wind up seven agencies that are no 
longer necessary. They range from the Petroleum Monitoring 
Agency with one governor in council position to the Veterans Land 
Administration with 32. In all, 49 governor in council 
appointments will be eliminated.
<P>
	The bill also restructures or downsizes 13 agencies for a further 
reduction of 222 governor in council appointments. For example, 
the Canadian Polar Commission will be reduced from 12 to 7 
members. The positions of 50 citizenship court judges will be 
eliminated. Members of the advisory committee of the Freshwater 
Fish Marketing Corporation will be elected rather than appointed 
by the governor in council.
<P>
	Bill C-49 standardizes remuneration provisions to clarify that 
full time board members of 13 organizations are entitled to be 
reimbursed for travel expenses only when they are absent from 
their place of work. It also changes the word ``salary'' to 
``remuneration'' for 13 agencies to allow consistent interpretation.
<P>
	The bill standardizes workers' compensation coverage for 
governor in council appointees in 19 agencies. Currently these 
appointees are not covered by the Government Employees 
Compensation Act in case of injury or disease arising out of their 
employment. Nor are they covered by the Aeronautics Act in case 
of flight injury or death as a direct result of a flight undertaken in 
the course of their duties.
<P>
	To conform with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
and to be consistent with the Immigration Act, the bill amends the 
provisions of acts affecting nine organizations to permit the 
appointment of permanent residents as well as Canadian citizens. 
Limits preventing people over a certain age from serving as 
appointees are removed from these statutes.
<P>
	The bill eliminates references to the masculine in the English 
version of some acts, replacing the term such as ``chairman'' with 
the gender neutral term in this case ``chairperson''.
<P>
	Bill C-49 introduces other changes for the better management of 
several agencies. For example, the mandate and financial 
accountability regime of the Canadian Race Relations Foundation 
will be clarified. Provision will be made for the Immigration and 
Refugee Board to hear cases with one member panels. The 
governor in council will no longer be required to approve salaries 
of senior officials of the National Film Board.
<P>
	All these changes, major or minor, reflect the commitment to 
provide Canadians with good government. Bill C-49 makes 
sensible changes in a reasonable way, which is the hallmark of our 
approach to renewing the federal government.
<P>

<P>
	The passage of the second omnibus bill is an important step in 
achieving agency review goals of eliminating over 800 governor 
in council positions and saving the Canadian taxpayers about $10 
million each and every year. I invite all hon. members to join me 
in assuring speedy passage of this much needed legislation.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to speak to Bill C-49, an act to authorize remedial and disciplinary 
measures in relation to members of certain administrative 
tribunals, to reorganize and dissolve certain federal agencies and to 
make consequential amendments to other Acts.
<P>
	This bill was tabled last June 14 by the President of the Treasury 
Board and would rationalize federal organizations, boards, 
commissions and advisory bodies. It affects 46 agencies, of which 
7 will be dissolved and 39 restructured or modified.
<P>
	Bill C-49 provides for major changes in the operation of 
administrative tribunals. These tribunals, which are often less well 
known than superior courts, nonetheless have a major impact on 
the daily lives of Canadians and of Quebecers.
<P>
	These tribunals often hand down more rulings than superior 
courts. In addition, their rulings often have very important 
consequences for citizens and for the Canadian government. In 
fact, there is no longer any doubt about the importance 
administrative tribunals have acquired in recent years. They are 
regularly the site of battles between the government and private 
citizens seeking rulings on the respect of their rights.
<P>
	There is currently a bill to reform administrative tribunals before 
the Quebec national assembly. Questions as important as the 
independence and impartiality of administrative tribunal judges are 
now being discussed.
<P>
	This same problem can also be found at the federal level. Bill 
C-49 could have provided a solution to the fundamental problem of 
partisan appointments to administrative tribunals. The Liberals 
would rather stick their heads in the sand.
<P>
	In an era when the public is so cynical about politicians, the 
President of the Treasury Board would have shown honourable 
courage in tackling the question of political appointments to 
administrative tribunals. Instead, he introduces even more partisan 
rules, increasing the control of the political arm over 
administrative tribunals.
<P>
	Certain provisions in the bill are of particular interest to me. The 
bill contains a new mechanism for removing from office persons 
appointed by the Governor in Council to administrative tribunals. 
Those appointed may, after certain procedures have been followed, 
be  removed from their duties for just cause, by the governor in 
council.
<P>
	The process set out in the Bill can be initiated by the chairperson 
of the administrative tribunal by asking the minister concerned 
whether the members of the tribunal in question ought to be 
subjected to disciplinary or corrective measures. The chairperson 
must cite one of the following reasons: incapacity, misconduct, 
failure to properly execute the office, or incompatibility.
<P>
	After the request is received, the minister may take one or more 
of the following steps, at his discretion: obtain information 
himself, refer the matter for mediation, request an inquiry, and/or 
take no further measures. In the case of an inquiry, the governor in 
council may appoint a judge of a superior court to conduct the 
inquiry.
<P>
	Then, only after a inquiry report has been submitted, can the 
minister recommend that the member be removed from office or 
suspended without pay, or impose any other disciplinary measure 
or any remedial measure.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	The Minister's recommendations are totally at his discretion, 
regardless of the content of the report.
<P>
	The bill standardizes the appointment of chairpersons of 
administrative tribunals. All will henceforth be designated rather 
than appointed. Such a major modification makes the chairperson 
highly vulnerable to political pressures from the government, 
which can quite simply designate a new one, any time it sees fit. I 
shall speak later of the specific situation of the Immigration and 
Refugee Board, which is, as we know, the most important 
administrative tribunal in Canada.
<P>
	These new measures are likely to undermine the credibility of 
administrative tribunals still further and, particularly, to make them 
still more dependent upon political power. Without an in-depth 
reform of appointments to administrative tribunals, measures that 
seriously hamper the independence and impartiality of these 
tribunals should not be introduced.
<P>
	As we all know, the President of the Treasury Board refuses to 
deal with this important issue, because he does not want to give up 
the sacrosanct powers of ministers to appoint the members of 
administrative tribunals. Any reform of or change to administrative 
tribunals must tackle the arbitrary way in which administrative 
tribunal judges are appointed and their mandates renewed. Political 
patronage in a quasi-judicial process should have no place in a 
modern democracy like ours.
<P>
	The <I>Dictionnaire de droit québécois et canadien</I> defines 
administrative tribunal as follows: ``a generally autonomous and 
independent body, which the government has empowered to settle 
disputes between itself and its citizens''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5500"> 5500 </A></B>
<P>
	In 1995, the President of the Quebec Bar Association clearly 
stated in this regard: ``The lack of job security may have 
unexpected psychological impact on the decisions of a person who 
may be more concerned about pleasing the government than 
rendering a fair judgment''.
<P>
	Administrative tribunal members may even be reluctant to set 
legal precedents favouring citizens at the expense of the 
government.
<P>
	I would now like to analyze some provisions of this bill which 
deal with the Immigration and Refugee Board.
<P>
	On March 2, 1995, the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration 
announced the introduction of a bill aimed at reducing from two to 
one the membership of the refugee status determination tribunal of 
the IRB.
<P>
	The bill amends section 69.1 in the Immigration Act. This 
provision provides that two members are usually needed to 
constitute a quorum at hearings on refugee claims. Except in three 
particular cases, any split decision by a two-member tribunal is 
deemed to favour the claimant. Consequently, the claimant needs 
to convince only one member of the validity of his claim to be 
recognized as a refugee under the Geneva convention.
<P>
	This bill will modify this system so that all refugee claims can be 
heard by a one-commissioner tribunal, except in complex cases in 
which the chair may assign more than one member.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	Let us take a historical look at the make-up of this board. In 
1985, at the government's request, Rabbi Gunther Plaut tabled a 
report on refugee status determination in Canada. The basic 
condition of this new system was that a high quality hearing be held 
before a decision maker. Three models were suggested, one of 
which provided for a hearing before a one-member board, except 
where a negative determination were made, in which case the board 
would be made up of three members. It also provided for an appeal, 
where authorized, to the Federal Court.
<P>
	In the fall of 1985, the Standing Committee on Labour, 
Employment and Immigration reviewed the Plaut report. The 
committee did not approve any of the three suggested models and 
decided on a two-member board hearing. In the case of a split 
decision, the claim would be approved. It would also be possible to 
appeal a decision before the Federal Court, if the court agreed to 
hear the appeal.
<P>
	The committee felt it was desirable for decisions to be made by 
two persons. Its rationale was the following: the issue of credibility 
is paramount in processing refugee status claims, as claimants 
generally cannot present oral or written evidence in support of their 
claims. That is why it is better to have two persons determine 
whether or not the claimant is truthful.
<P>
	The committee also suggested that a divided decision be viewed 
as a favourable decision, thereby giving the benefit of the doubt to 
the claimant, which is in keeping with the policy of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, provided of course that 
the claimant's story is credible.
<P>
	This can be a controversial issue. For some, particularly refugee 
advocacy groups, the current system, which requires a favourable 
decision by one member only, greatly reduces the risk of a bad 
decision being made. It also appears that a number of members 
prefer to share the onus of the decision and thus develop a certain 
collegiality.
<P>
	With all due respect for these organizations, I believe that a 
tribunal made up of only one member will cost less, be easier to set 
up and, more importantly, will allow the IRB to hear a greater 
number of cases. This, however, is based on the assumption that the 
board will have more hearing rooms available.
<P>
	It is to be noted that the delays and the backlog in the processing 
of IRB files are considerable and in fact unacceptable. It should 
also be pointed out that no other tribunal in Canada has an initial 
decision process similar to the IRB's, not even those hearing 
criminal cases, where the consequences may be very serious for the 
accused.
<P>
	A one-person tribunal may have the effect of making the 
member more responsible. If the member proved to be unable to 
make decisions alone, he would not deserve to keep his job. In any 
case, there should be a review process, in case the member makes 
an erroneous decision.
<P>
	When the member for York West was the Liberal Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, he was strongly in favour of an 
internal review system at the IRB. In November 1993, he said he 
wanted to amend the refugee determination process, so that 
unfavourable decisions could be appealed within the Board. The 
former minister even said that the lack of an appeal process was a 
flaw.
<P>
	While I agree with the idea of having one instead of two 
members hearing a claim, I wonder about the qualifications of 
some members appointed by this government. The Standing 
Committee on Citizenship and Immigration, of which I am a 
vice-chairperson, reviewed several appointments and 
reappointments.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	In many cases, the appointments are exclusively partisan. In 
fact, there is only one way to become an IRB commissioner, and 
that is to have worked at some time or other for the Liberal Party of 
Canada, or to have friends in the party. And the salary is very 
interesting: $86,000 and up annually. The length of service to the 
party also determines the length of the appointment: one year, two 
years, three years or four years.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5501"> 5501 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to give a few examples of the patronage 
appointments of this Liberal government. It should be noted that 
in the 1993 election campaign the Liberals condemned the 
political patronage of the Conservatives of the time. The Liberal 
Party of Canada was going to be a strong advocate of honesty and 
integrity in government if elected, or so it told us.
<P>
	But now Mr. Interjit Bal has been made an IRB commissioner. 
His previous experience included working for the Prime Minister 
during his leadership campaign and for the Liberal Party of Canada 
during the 1993 election. He was also chair of the ethno-cultural 
committee of the Liberal Party of Canada. He was forced to admit 
to the standing committee examining his appointment that he came 
into Canada illegally. He was therefore obliged to step down from 
his duties as commissioner.
<P>
	I will mention other partisan appointments to the IRB. Auguste 
Choquette, former Liberal member; Raymonde Folco, former 
Liberal candidate in the riding of Laval East; Patricia Davey, 
married to an assistant to former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau; 
Milagos Eustaquoi, former Liberal Party candidate; Janet Susan 
Rowsell, who worked for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	I was an Unemployment Insurance Commission referee from the 
union movement. During the Conservative reign, I often criticized 
the partisan appointments handed out by Brian Mulroney. The 
present government continues to appoint faithful Liberals, often 
very incompetent ones, to chair arbitration boards. The same 
situation can be found in the Bank of Canada, the Senate, the 
Department of Foreign Affairs, the Canadian Pension Commission, 
the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, and so on.
<P>
	It is very important that the initial hearing of a refugee claim be 
of the utmost quality, as I have said here in the past. The board 
members must, therefore, be competent and well informed.
<P>
	On March 3, 1995, in response to accusations of patronage, the 
Minister of Citizenship and Immigration announced the creation of 
an advisory committee composed of a chairperson and four 
members. I have, however, been extremely disappointed with the 
outcome, for the committee continues to appoint incompetent 
board members. It is a known fact that there has been no 
improvement over the way things were before, under the 
Conservatives.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to invite the Standing Committee on 
Government Operations to have the part relating to the IRB 
examined by the Standing Committee on Citizenship and 
Immigration, since this is a highly technical matter and our 
committee has something to say on this. There are organizations 
which want to come and testify before the committee, and the 
chairperson of the Standing Committee on Government Operations 
gave us  the particular opportunity to contribute our opinion on Bill 
C-49.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
for International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my 
20 minute time and my question or comment time with the member 
for Broadview-Greenwood.
<P>
	I am extremely pleased to speak on a bill that some might 
otherwise think is of a technical nature and that is perhaps not as 
stimulating in its subject matter as some others that are vigorously 
debated on the floor of this place.
<P>
	This bill is exceptionally important for a couple of reasons. First, 
it shows that when this government makes a commitment with 
respect to what it wants to do once given the mantle of power by the 
Canadian public, that it is prepared, even if it is not the sexiest or 
the most flamboyant piece of legislation, to put its money where its 
mouth is. We are prepared to go forward and do what we told 
Canadians we would do prior to the last election, rationalize the 
way the federal government acts in all aspects of its responsibilities 
between the provinces, the municipalities and, more important, 
between our boards and our agencies and the people of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	When the Liberals ran in the last election we made a number of 
commitments and the member for St. Albert from the Reform Party 
wanted to speak about that. He was trying to speak in an off-handed 
way about the commitments that this party has made in the red 
book.
<P>
	We had a departure at the beginning of the campaign last time in 
1993. We said that rather than have different people as 
spokespersons for our party going around the country saying 
different things to different audiences, we were going to put it in 
writing. As the Prime Minister said at the time and again the other 
day, you do not have to read my lips, read my record, read my red 
book.
<P>
	In the red book we made certain commitments. The member for 
St. Albert did not want to hear this today but later this week with 
the great Liberal Party, the party that has crafted this fabulous 
country of ours for most of the last 130 years, at the convention this 
weekend there will be a book that will probably be put forward. It 
will indicate the successes and the commitments that we have made 
and we have kept through the red book on behalf of the people of 
Canada.
<P>
	When we deal with restructuring government, we have to 
recognize that over the past number of years, many times when we 
thought that we had more resources than what we had, it was okay 
for governments because traditionally they had a program in a 
particular area to hold it close and not even want to review it to see  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5502"> 5502 </A></B>
<P>
whether there was any modern reason for us to continue with those 
responsibilities or those programs.
<P>
	We said to the Canadian public, after those disastrous two terms 
of the Tory government, the previous administration, that we 
understood that Canadians wanted a parliamentary system, a 
Parliament, a legislative body, that was modern, that was 
responsive, that said what it was going to do and then did it. That is 
exactly what the Liberal Party has proven over the last three years.
<P>
	We started off by coming in and we looked at program review; 
things that were not always easy but things that nevertheless had to 
be done. We were saddled with an enormous debt and deficit and a 
government out of control when it came to spending the public 
purse. That was a right wing Conservative party at the time, 
subsequently replaced by a smattering of Reform Party MPs who 
sit across here and natter at us from time to time.
<P>
	What we set about to do was put a plan in place. We wanted to 
ensure the Canadian public had confidence, that when the Prime 
Minister, the ministers at the front bench or the Minister of Finance 
stood in this place and said these are the programs and these are the 
targets, they did it with credibility, that the Canadian public and the 
business community would know that when we said we were going 
to do something we did it.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance was appointed by the Prime Minister. In 
successive budgets we have shown ourselves capable not just in 
articulating the targets and the programs to reach those targets but 
in surpassing those targets each and every time that we have been 
put up to the measure of the test of the public of Canada.
<P>
	Indeed we have had to do some very difficult things. We have 
had to go about reinventing government. We had to look at what 
made sense in the modern context and where the federal 
government should be, where its programs and responsibilities 
should be. Perhaps it would be better placed either with the private 
sector or with other levels of government.
<P>
	We set out in an unprecedented fashion under the minister 
responsible for government reorganization and government 
operations. We set about an unprecedented task of program review. 
During that program review we looked at each and every area of 
program delivery of the federal government. Where it made sense 
we said we will keep it, enhance it. Where it made no sense we 
decided to look to see first if we should be in that business and 
second if there was another level of government or another 
participant in society, the private sector, that could do it better.
<P>
	We had to shrink the federal public service and that was not an 
easy thing to do. We had to do it in order to put some fiscal sanity 
back into the way we conduct our business as a nation. We did 
some things that were easier to do. We rationalized things.
<P>
	We saw, for instance, that we had a number of fleets plying the 
oceans of this great maritime nation. We had a coast guard fleet. 
Then we had a fisheries and oceans fleet. I am on the harbour in 
Halifax. In my riding we had a coast guard base with a fleet and we 
had a fisheries and oceans base with another fleet.
<P>
<B>(1715 )</B>
<P>
	However, through program review we saw what made sense and 
consolidated both of the fleets together. It made more sense 
operationally, and being good guardians of the public purse, it is 
what we told Canadians we would do if we were given a mandate in 
1993. We said we would try to put this country back on the road to 
fiscal sanity.
<P>
	We have done a number of other things. We looked at the 
transportation sector. The former minister of transportation, the 
Minister of National Defence, had a look at that big monster called 
the Department of Transport and walked in with a critical view. He 
asked what the Department of Transport did and why do we 
continue to do it.
<P>
	At the end of the day it made sense to get rid of the bureaucracy 
at the air transport sector. It made sense to allow local airport 
authorities to be established to make the local decisions so that 
those airports, the wonderful infrastructure that can create real 
sustainable jobs, was put in the hands of local authorities who 
would know best how to manage them.
<P>
	We went even further than that and looked at some of the 
subsidies that had been in place for far too long in the 
transportation sector. Where they did not make sense any longer we 
eliminated them.
<P>
	The other thing was to deal with Canada's marine policy. There 
is a bill currently before a House committee dealing in a 
wholesome and holistic fashion with every aspect of Canada's 
national marine transportation policy. For example, the port of 
Halifax has been saddled for years by a heavy bureaucracy that 
does not allow it to do what it can do best, which is to use its 
location to its advantage, to be competitive and create jobs. The 
government is going to unleash that yoke from around its neck. It is 
going to ensure that places like the port of Halifax, the port of 
Vancouver and the port of Montreal are able to do what they do best 
which is to operate under private sector principles. The government 
is disengaging and disentangling itself from those operations. That 
is what we told Canadians we would do.
<P>
	The substance of this bill is important. A lot of boards and 
agencies are established by the governor in council. Not only do 
they give advice but in many cases as in the case of a tribunal, hand 
down major decisions that have a substantial impact on the lives of 
many Canadians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5503"> 5503 </A></B>
<P>
	Rather than sit back and say that there are 800 or 1,000 
appointments that can be made by governor in council and we are 
going to keep them because they are there, as was the way it was 
done in the past, in 1994 we set out to do a complete review of 
these agencies and boards with the same critical eye that we did 
program review. We found out which ones made sense, which ones 
we continue to need in the interest of public policy and which ones 
should we keep or perhaps streamline or downsize so that they 
are less of a drag on the taxpayers' wallets.
<P>
	As a result of that, this bill will wind up seven federal 
organizations. It will restructure or downsize 13 other 
organizations. Other amendments relating to accountability and 
some housekeeping measures will affect 34 other organizations. 
This bill will eliminate over 271 governor in council appointments 
and will save the Canadian taxpayer over $10 million annually.
<P>
	In the broader course of large federal government expenditures 
this may not seem like a lot but it was a commitment we made in 
our campaign leading up to the 1993 election. We are a party that is 
committed to the details of the promises that we give to our 
electorate. Indeed, we have come through and we now have a more 
streamlined system of boards, agencies and tribunals than we have 
ever had before.
<P>
	My Reform Party friend from St. Albert stood up and started to 
list by name individuals, good, solid Canadians who have given up 
their time to serve on public boards, agencies and tribunals to 
ensure that there is public input and that we do not have 
governments administering programs in a vacuum. He mocked 
those individuals on the floor of the House of Commons. He 
alluded to whether or not they were Liberals.
<P>
	The hon. member would do his party a far greater service, 
instead of taking cheap political shots at individuals who have had 
the good sense to allow their names to stand and to serve on these 
agencies and boards, if he would concentrate his efforts on looking 
at the high calibre of individuals that the government has been able 
to attract and appoint to those agencies and boards for the greatness 
of Canada to ensure that the public policy of these boards, agencies 
and tribunals is executed by those of the highest integrity.
<P>
<B>(1720 )</B>
<P>
	In conclusion, I wish the bill speedy passage. I hope that my 
friends in the official opposition and in the Reform Party finally 
recognize that sometimes as a government we have to appoint 
Liberals. After all, 60 per cent of Canadians claim to support our 
party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak in the House of 
Commons this afternoon on this bill.
<P>
	I would like to begin by acknowledging the work that my 
colleague from Dartmouth has been doing over the  last few months 
as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for International 
Trade. Most Canadians will realize that our export numbers have 
never been this high in Canadian history in terms of percentage 
increases. All too often Canadians do not realize that members, 
such as the member for Dartmouth, when they are not here sitting 
in the House of Commons doing their work, are busy working with 
small, medium and large industries in all regions of the country, 
assisting them and signing contracts that lead to the export of 
Canadian goods and services. The member should be celebrated for 
the work he has been doing on international trade.
<P>
	When I listened to the President of the Treasury Board speak 
earlier in the debate today, I could not argue with him when he 
spoke about the notion that we must have a smaller, modernized 
government, and that we must make sure that the overall financial 
objectives are kept in mind when we are going through the whole 
program review, or as some people have described it, reinventing 
government.
<P>
	In principle, I support all of those objectives. I certainly would 
support the bill today which is tidying up some agencies and 
reducing orders in council which will make government more 
efficient.
<P>
	However, I am concerned that the pathway of reinventing 
government is going too fast and in many cases is too dramatic. 
First is the overall objective of trying to reduce the deficit in a rapid 
fashion. I have a concern that in the process of doing this we will be 
dismantling aspects of the Government of Canada that we will live 
to regret in the not too distant future.
<P>
	The member for Dartmouth talked about the port of Halifax. In 
my city of Toronto, the port of Toronto is something that not only 
serves as an agent for industrial building and policy making, but is 
also a large symbol of the presence of the Government of Canada in 
the major market of Toronto.
<P>
	Fortunately, the bill relating to the harbours of Canada has the 
flexibility that if in certain regions you want to exempt certain 
harbours and still have them in the jurisdiction of the Government 
of Canada, then with enough support it can be done. But my 
concern is the fact that as we cut, dismantle and offload, we will 
eventually get to a point where the levers that the government 
needs from time to time to activate industrial policy will be 
weakened to a point where they will not be effective.
<P>
<B>(1725 )</B>
<P>
	Even though we are on the right pathway, we had better make 
sure that we do not cut off our nose to spite our face because some 
of these instruments are going to be very important for us in the 
future, especially in the whole area of national unity. The presence 
of the Government of Canada in every province is something  that I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5504"> 5504 </A></B>
<P>
personally believe should be maintained in a very vibrant and 
active way.
<P>
	There is another thing I want to mention when we are talking 
about this bill of reinventing or renewing government. I would like 
to see the government as it goes through its program review take on 
the challenge of reviewing the work of the Governor of the Bank of 
Canada. That was a governor in council agency that many years 
ago was offloaded from the Government of Canada. It is almost an 
independent body, other than the fact that the Governor of the Bank 
of Canada is appointed by the governor in council, the Prime 
Minister. Of course the Governor of the Bank of Canada routinely 
meets with the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	For all intents and purposes the Bank of Canada works almost in 
an independent fashion from this Parliament. I believe as we are 
going through program review it would be an interesting exercise if 
we took a look at just how the Bank of Canada operates.
<P>
	I for one believe that the relationship between the Bank of 
Canada and the chartered banks of Canada, the financial 
institutions of Canada, is an area that needs intense scrutiny, 
intense review. As we move forward on this pathway of deficit and 
ultimately debt reduction, if we are not careful we are going to have 
a repeat of what happened from 1987 to 1988 and the first part of 
1992 where the governor, John Crow, essentially put a ratchet on 
inflation to the point where he just broke the confidence of 
Canadians. He broke the confidence of small and medium sized 
businessmen and women in this country. He created a factor of fear 
that essentially tilted the economy. It is very important that this 
agency of government be put under the microscope of program 
review by the Government of Canada.
<P>
	I want to conclude by saying, as the member for Dartmouth said, 
there are many good men and women who over the years have 
served these crown corporations, these agencies of government in a 
very productive way. When the Conservatives are in power it is a 
normal natural process that they would promote the friends that 
helped them get their government elected. It is not any different for 
a Liberal government or a Reform government or whoever it might 
be that is given the trust of the people.
<P>
	Obviously you choose the people to put into strategic and 
sensitive positions who reflect the views that you have been 
mandated to implement. It would be a pretty silly experience to put 
somebody in that did not share your views. With the nature of the 
human being these people might be tempted from time to time to 
sabotage your policy objectives.
<P>
	By and large these people have served these agencies well. I do 
not think anyone in the community or in the country should feel 
that these reductions in orders in council or the dismantling of 
these agencies have anything to do with the quality of service that 
these men  and women have provided on behalf of Canadians over 
the last number of years.
<P>
	I am happy to conclude on this note. It is very important, as we 
continue to go through this program review, because we have been 
going so hard and so fast, that we not dismantle this place to the 
point where the national government no longer has instruments that 
allow it to serve, produce, create or provide the type of role that it 
needs to make sure of the economy and service to the public that 
this place has to provide from time to time. Do not shut it down to 
the point where we lose our effectiveness.
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want 
to thank the hon. member for Broadview-Greenwood for raising 
the perspective of the angle of policy implementation.
<P>
	I would like him to comment on competence and accountability, 
particularly in these senior roles. This was not mentioned by the 
Reform Party. There were the appointments of Perrin Beatty to the 
CBC and the Right Hon. Kim Campbell as Consul General to Los 
Angeles. There have been other examples of non-partisan 
appointments. The competence and the accountability of those 
people and their track records are certainly very important. I 
wonder if the hon. member would like to comment on that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
hon. member for Mississauga South for his question.
<P>
	I have a problem with the appointment to the CBC. I do not have 
a problem with the individual. I have known Perrin Beatty for 
many years. He has served Parliament and this country well. I am 
one of his biggest fans. However, I have a problem with the fact 
that he would be more sympathetic with the general pathway of 
cuts that we are on with the CBC. For me, as someone who has 
been a traditional supporter of the CBC, especially in the outlying 
regions of Canada, I probably would have lobbied to put somebody 
in charge of the corporation who held a more traditional view of 
what the CBC is all about.
<P>
	I applaud Perrin Beatty as an individual. I believe that as 
someone who would be sensitive, of course, but sympathetic to a 
reduction in the presence of the Canadian Broadcasting 
Corporation, the government could not have chosen a better 
person.
<P>
	That is the balancing act that it has to go through. I wish my 
colleague from Mississauga South had not mentioned the CBC. 
That is an example of the point which I was trying to make in my 
remarks.
<P>
	In a major market like Toronto one could argue that there are so 
many options in terms of private sector radio and television, et 
cetera, that maybe we could let the  private sector do it. However, 
remember how this country was built. This country was built by 
ensuring that the outer regions had a shot at the same quality of 
service, in all sectors of the economy, as the people in major 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5505"> 5505 </A></B>
<P>
markets. One area where the CBC has done a terrific job is in the 
outlying regions.
<P>
	I do not know how the CBC will be dismantled. However, we 
must ensure that we do not begin the process of weakening the 
galvanizing forces which held all regions of the country together.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to participate in the debate on Bill C-49. It has been 
mentioned that what started out as a kind of dry, stuffy, sterile 
debate about patronage appointments, administrative tribunals, the 
shuffling of papers and so on has evolved into a more serious 
debate about a vision of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	I have been listening to the speeches from across the way. They 
are right to applaud the reduction in the number of patronage 
appointments that this bill allows for, the reduction of 271 
positions. That is good.
<P>
	We like that part of this bill. It is a good start on a messy 
problem. I like that part of the bill as far as it goes. That is good.
<P>
	As we get talking about these positions and what they represent, 
it becomes really a statement of what type of country we are 
looking for. Is it a country, as the hon. member mentioned earlier, 
that demands a stronger federal government and stronger federal 
institutions, large tax dollars that go with it, big government 
programs that must be administered from a central government in 
order to keep the government together? That is one argument, for 
example, the argument of the CBC and the patronage appointment 
that goes with that.
<P>
	The hon. member mentioned earlier that he did not like the trend 
that is happening with the CBC. I think it is fair to say it does not 
seem to be following on Liberal red book promises. I can see there 
are some dicey problems there for some Liberal members.
<P>
	Really the vision is the two visions of Canada. One is the way to 
keep the country together, the way to keep Canadians happy and the 
way to give Canadians what they deserve from their federal 
government is that whole package of a billion dollars for the CBC, 
a billion dollars for Canadian heritage, a billion dollars for ACOA, 
a billion dollars for WED, a billion dollars here, a billion dollars 
there. Pretty soon we are talking real change.
<P>
	The reason the Reform Party has come out with its fresh start 
vision of Canada-the debate could be entered into here I would 
hope-is that we are trying to show a different vision of where the 
country could go.
<P>
	The Liberal-Tory vision, whether Perrin Beatty or whoever it 
is-it does not really much matter because I  kind of lump them 
together-is one vision of Canada that is lots of money, big 
programs. I could go down the list. The best way to look after 
children is a national daycare plan, a red book promise to expand 
and spend more money.
<P>
	The Reform Party's vision is that is not the best way. The best 
way is to leave money in the hands of families to make their own 
child rearing decisions and leave it with them. Give them 
considerably more resources, increase their personal exemption, 
increase the tax credit available for raising children and let parents 
make the decision on how to raise their children.
<P>
	We have one vision, a Liberal-Tory vision, and a Reform Party 
vision. On the CBC, we say when the original mandate of the CBC 
came through it served a very useful purpose. It was basically the 
only national communications tool. The only way someone could 
get from Frobisher Bay to Vancouver Island and points in between 
was through the CBC. That was all there was. It was basically CBC 
radio to start. Then it expanded.
<P>
	We say again now is the time to check the vision of the country. 
We say that CBC radio is still serving a national unifying force. It is 
not that expensive. It is very well received by Canadians as is 
something like CBC ``Newsworld''. It is relatively cheap and 
provides a service from coast to coast.
<P>
	We are saying that right now in Canada with telecommunications 
being what they are, changing over the last 50 years, we are looking 
at a different vision. We are saying privatize CBC television. Let it 
do the job that B.C. TV does, that CTV does and CKBU and all the 
other channels that compete on the multichannel universe and turn 
a profit.
<P>
	In other words, all these things start to sift out the different 
vision of Canada. I have spoken to members of the Liberal caucus 
about this. They say, for example, that the way to keep Quebec in 
the fold, a happy member of the federation, is to have a stronger 
federal government.
<P>
	That way it would have so much influence in the country, so 
much buying power, so much spending power, so much influence 
on programming and so on that Quebecers just cannot leave. 
Everything from cradle to grave is covered by the federal 
government. The federal government is in every area of their lives 
and they have to stay. We are so pervasive.
<P>
<B>(1740 )</B>
<P>
	The Reform Party's argument is that is a lousy way to keep 
Quebec and the rest of the country together. We should be 
concentrating on the areas we do well in at the federal level. The 
leader of the Reform Party mentioned the other day that it boils 
down to about 10 or 12 areas that the federal government can focus 
its attention on. They are important areas like the Criminal Code, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5506"> 5506 </A></B>
<P>
regulating interprovincial trade, international trade, financial 
institutions, national defence, border patrol, customs and so on.
<P>
	We can focus our energy on what the national government does 
best and then for Quebecers, British Columbians and others we 
should say that much of what is left is in their bailiwick. If 
Quebecers want to promote the French language and culture in 
their province because it is a wonderful language, a lovely culture 
and something we all appreciate as Canadians-but Quebecers are 
naturally most concerned about that-we will not invade that area 
of spending. We will leave that with Quebecers. It should be theirs. 
They should spend money on that as they see fit and we will not 
intrude. We will not muscle in on their political territory. That can 
be theirs to manage.
<P>
	We will not be involved in natural resources. That is a good thing 
for the province of Quebec to maintain, as it is for British 
Columbia. We will not tell Quebec how to spend money on cultural 
events. That is Quebec's bailiwick and other provinces will look 
after their own.
<P>
	In this kind of a bill, although it is a small thing, we see the two 
different visions of Canada. We see one vision that there will be 
2,225 patronage appointments left after this bill. And who will they 
be filled by? They will be filled by good loyal Liberals. There is the 
odd exception. There is the Perrin Beatty exception and so on, but 
let us face the facts.
<P>
	The facts are the longer you are a pedigree in the Liberal Party 
the more likely you are to be appointed to a good position. As the 
member for Broadview-Greenwood said earlier, that is the way it 
has always been done. It does not matter whether it is Liberals or 
Tories, that is just an accepted way. I am not sure how that is 
supposed to make Quebecers feel more at home.
<P>
	I do not know what people from the GTA think about this, but 
how can they possibly think that the way to build national unity, the 
way to build national cohesiveness is to dole it out to Liberal 
hacks?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> What are friends for?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> A member over there asks what are friends for. Can 
they not see what it is doing to national unity, for example?
<P>
	Imagine the Liberals saying to members of the Bloc Quebecois 
that they have 2,225 appointments to make, that some of them are 
very technical and require a good deal of expertise, but the 
crowning criteria for getting the job will be one's pedigree, not 
necessarily as a Quebecer but as a Liberal. When the BQ members 
go home imagine what they will do with that. They will say here is 
the list of appointments.
<P>
	It is in the latest edition of the <I>Hill Times</I>, the paper from 
Parliament Hill, for members' information. I am sure they have 
seen it. There is now a Conservative who is tracking all the 
appointments. She has a list of about 200 names of people who are 
long time paid up Liberal members. I am sure Bloc members take 
that newspaper and say here is the latest dollop of appointments.
<P>
	They rip that page out and back they go to Quebec saying: ``This 
is what your tax dollars are going for. Your tax dollars are going to 
supply Liberals with jobs''. If you were a voter in Quebec-listen 
up because when you are a voter in British Columbia the reaction is 
somewhat the same-you would say: ``I thought these were 
appointments based on merit. I thought this person who was 
appointed was put there because they are the best person for the 
job''.
<P>
	I thought that someone who runs Canada Post would have 
extensive experience in the delivery of mail or delivery services. 
But who is the head of Canada Post but the former minister of 
foreign affairs. How did he get that job? Did he fill out the 
meritorious ``I am the best qualified for Canada Post''? No, of 
course not. He just said: ``I have a long pedigree of service to the 
Liberal Party. What I need is a job within the federal civil service 
based on my pedigree as a Liberal''.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	Why was there a furore over the appointment of our current 
Governor General? The Governor General plays a good role in our 
community. He lends some stability, some long term historic 
reference and so on. The problem was that the job was given 
because of his extensive Liberal pedigree: ``I have a long, long list 
of things I have done for the Prime Minister. I raised money for the 
Prime Minister. I was part of his campaign for the Liberal Party 
leadership. I was his buddy''. His buddy is the one who gets 
appointed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> What is wrong with that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> What is wrong with it is the respect for the 
institution. Out in British Columbia the most respected lieutenant 
governor we have ever had was David Lam. David Lam was 
respected because he did not have a long political pedigree. He was 
revered in British Columbia because he was exactly what this 
government does not understand. He was just a servant of the 
people, not a servant of the party.
<P>
	If the Liberals followed that example, they would raise the 
esteem in all of these positions. Instead what they are doing is 
unfortunately dragging patronage down through the mud and 
casting that kind of stuff on to a position which should be above 
patronage. That is what is unfortunate.
<P>
	It starts at the top. One of the very top patronage appointments is 
to the Senate. In 1990 the current Prime Minister said that within 
two years of the election of a Liberal government, the senators 
would be elected. That is what the current Prime Minister said in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5507"> 5507 </A></B>
<P>
1990. Of course he was in opposition so it was cheap talk I guess. 
That is what he promised.
<P>
	Since the election of the Prime Minister there have been 18 to 20 
Liberals appointed to the Senate in a row, one after the other. These 
were based not on their election to the Senate which was promised, 
based not on their willingness to represent their regional interests, 
but based totally on their ties to the Liberal Party.
<P>
	When I went to the PC convention as an observer what did I 
find? The same thing as I would think I am going to find this 
weekend at the Liberal convention when I go as an observer. I like 
to observe this stuff. The chief fundraiser for the PC party is a 
senator. The chief campaign manager is a senator. The bagmen for 
the campaign are senators. The regional co-ordinators for the 
campaign are all senators. What does this mean? Those who have 
enough friends in the Senate can run their campaign teams on 
taxpayers' money which is exactly what they are doing. That is the 
Tories.
<P>
	It will be interesting to see what is coming up here at the Liberal 
convention but it will be the same. This has been going on for so 
long that they know no other way to run a campaign but to appoint 
somebody who is their chief fundraiser, in this last case, from 
Quebec.
<P>
	What does this do for national unity? The Bloc Quebecois look 
at that appointment and go back home and say to their constituents: 
``Look at this. This latest appointment is going to cost you several 
hundred thousand dollars a year. Who do you think it is? A Liberal 
hack appointed to the Senate''. The people ask: ``What were his or 
her qualifications? Is he or she going to represent Quebec?'' The 
Bloc say: ``Absolutely not. They represent the Liberal Party of 
Canada''. It is no wonder the people of Quebec get mad. They have 
had enough of that. It has been going on for over 100 years and 
enough is enough. It is time to change the system of patronage 
appointments.
<P>
	Just to follow up on another quote or two, the Prime Minister in a 
speech to the House of Commons in 1991 said: ``To meet the hopes 
and dreams of those who live in the west and in the Atlantic, a 
reformed Senate is essential. It must be a Senate that is elected, 
effective and equitable''. I sat here in the House and listened to the 
Prime Minister say: ``I will put people in the Senate who represent 
the Liberal Party of Canada''. He said that right from his chair, now 
that he is in power. It is no wonder that people find patronage 
appointments to be such a cynical display of government power.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	The key appointment of them all from the government side is the 
person in charge of patronage appointments. When I tell people 
that, they cannot believe there is someone in charge of patronage 
appointments.
<P>
	Penny Collenette is in charge of patronage appointments. She is 
a very capable woman. She is  probably very capable at everything 
she does but the job is kind of odious. Her job is to find the over 
2,200 patronage appointments that are available. Then she is to 
scour the country for every single available Liberal she can find to 
put them in there. That is the job. In other words, it is not to scour 
the country for the most capable person, it is to scour the country 
for the most Liberal of the Liberals and put them in a place. That is 
Penny Collenette's job.
<P>
	I do not know how that is to build confidence in the government 
or the confidence from regions of the country that are looking to be 
represented by what they think are democratic means by fair and 
democratic systems. People find out instead that all the key 
positions go on people's pedigrees, their heritage, their political 
ties.
<P>
	In Jeffrey Simpson's book about patronage he says: ``The long 
march towards responsible government in British North America 
was largely the story of the elected representatives' struggle to 
wrest the right to dispense patronage from the British governors''. 
This fight has been going on a long time. It is always the people at 
the top saying: ``We know best and we know who to appoint and 
we, the benevolent dictators of the day, know what you deserve, 
you common folk, better than you know yourselves''.
<P>
	At one time every job in the country was a patronage job. Even 
the local postmaster was a patronage job. Everything was a 
patronage job because that is the way the system was run. 
Thankfully we have moved away from that and you can no longer 
get a job as a postmaster, I do not think or at least I hope not, 
because of your ties to the Liberal Party. But at the top where the 
example is being set, thousands of these jobs are still available.
<P>
	I was in the maritimes during a couple of the byelections. I went 
door to door in Labrador. There is a separatism movement quite 
alive and well in Labrador right now. It is not separation from 
Canada that they want but separation from Newfoundland. They 
are fed up with the way Mr. Tobin is running things. There is quite a 
vibrant separatist movement and you try to calm them down and 
ask them to be part of Canada, to stay here as part of Canada. It is 
the same story we give the separatists in Quebec. Canada can be 
fixed. It can be better.
<P>
	They would say that they would vote for us and some would give 
money, but they were afraid to put a sign on their lawn because the 
patronage system is so insidious in some of these towns that if they 
put a sign up they would go broke.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That is not true.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, they say this is not true but listen to 
what happened.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5508"> 5508 </A></B>
<P>
	A month ago the member for St. John's West reportedly 
demanded of the town council of Placentia, Newfoundland that 
they had to sell their fire trucks as she told them to for $5,000 
or she would make sure that they did not get a $350,000 ACOA 
grant. That was in the papers. That was her communication to the 
people.
<P>
	In other words, it is all arm's length, it is all done on merit, it is 
all above board except that this Liberal says that you do as you are 
told. I am not making this up. It was in the paper. It is all true: 
``Either do as you are told or we will make sure doggone it you do 
not get the $350,000 grant''.
<P>
	Only two councillors showed up for that meeting and the 
member for St. John's West felt very badly. She reportedly said that 
there would be serious repercussions for the town and in her 
position of MP she deserved more courtesy than was shown to her 
and doggone it, they were in a heap of trouble. Why? Because they 
were not Liberal bootlickers. They were told to do as they were 
told, to jump through the hoops-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):</B> That is disgusting.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> It is true. It was in the paper. It is absolutely true: 
``Either you do this, sell them for this amount, or else. That is the 
law. Those are the rules''.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	I heard from across the way that it was necessary that this system 
continue, that it would not matter. It would be necessary that Mr. 
Mulroney's example of appointing his wife's hairdresser to the 
board of the FBDB, that kind of stuff must continue. I do not think 
so. It was said that the number of appointees while shrinking, it is 
still necessary to continue. I do not think so.
<P>
	An ethical standard should be made and the argument has been 
made here today on two things: a different vision of Canada or it 
does not have to be this way. This bill is not the answer to fix a 
patronage system which I think Canadians find offensive.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will begin by saying to the member for Fraser Valley 
East that I believe in patronage. I have always believed in it and I 
am not going to change.
<P>
	The whole notion by the member from the Reform Party is 
gimmick politics. He was quoting Jeffrey Simpson. Can anyone 
imagine Jeffrey Simpson writing for the Toronto <I>Star</I>?
<P>
	We have to understand that the member is suggesting to 
Canadians that when someone is hired in business or the media that 
there is no sensitivity as to whether or not that person shares the 
same values, the same vision, the same policy objectives. The 
notion that when an employer is hiring someone who is anything 
other than sensitive to the direction the employer is heading is just 
crazy. It is like that in life.
<P>
	This is a beautiful opportunity to talk about issues in a 
substantive way. In my earlier remarks I tried to engage the 
member in a debate on the whole notion of a program review of 
what goes on with the Bank of Canada. Members of the Reform 
Party are always talking about a billion dollars here and a billion 
dollars there. There are a few of us who still believe that we should 
spend this money to hold the country together.
<P>
	Why not have a debate on who prints the money. What is 
money? Who is managing it? Who decides how much is printed? 
Who decides on its distribution? I wish the Reform Party members 
would get involved in that debate, then we could really have some 
excitement around here.
<P>
	The whole notion of patronage is going to go on as long as man 
is living, as long as we are social beings.
<P>
	Does the member not think it would be a worthwhile exercise for 
all members in the House to engage in a total program review on 
how the Bank of Canada operates and its links to the financial 
institutions of this country and the way it controls the flow of 
currency which is so badly needed in the marketplace today? How 
about that as a way of reforming or reinventing government?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his question. I 
always feel a little bad for the member that we generally do not 
have a committee of the whole. I have always enjoyed the 
member's ability to debate. He scores some good points. If we 
could get past some of the stifled formalities in the regular debating 
system, we could actually have a good debate. The system as it is 
set up does not lend itself to that very well.
<P>
	Will patronage be around as long as people are social creatures? 
To a certain degree I agree with the member. There are roles for 
patronage appointments that the member I think is trying to 
advocate and which I would agree with. However, he would also 
agree for example that the privy council is not one of those places. 
The privy council raises a group of professional government 
managers that they select early in the process. I hope it is not on 
their political pedigree. I do not believe it is in any event. They 
identify them early in the process. They bring them into the privy 
council and train them. I have talked to the head of the privy 
council and this is my understanding. The privy council office 
trains them, they go back out into another department in another 
role, they come back into the privy council and train some more. 
They select these people and find the best that they can get, the best 
in the system and they rise to the top to become deputy ministers, 
ADMs and so on.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	That is as it should be. It is based on merit. It is based on 
experience. It is based on a professional civil service that bypasses 
patronage. There is no room in there for patronage. Otherwise we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5509"> 5509 </A></B>
<P>
would get our civil service working at cross purposes to the 
government and that system just would not work in a democracy.
<P>
	Where patronage is necessary and where it does make sense is in 
political roles. I would not ask the member opposite or the 
government to find a neutral or an NDP member from some place 
to write the red book. The government needs people who are 
politically astute in what they believe in to take that and put it on 
paper or into television commercials and what have you, try to sell 
it, get their advertising people. Those are all patronage 
appointments that are necessary because patronage is for the 
political process.
<P>
	I do not mind when a minister or member would naturally have a 
researcher in their department. I certainly have someone who 
believes in what I believe in. That is the system that has to work. 
That is for the political realm.
<P>
	However, to run a department should not be a political role. As 
Brian Mulroney did, one should not appoint Mila's hairdresser to 
the board of FBDB.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> He made a great contribution there.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> He made a great contribution. He appointed his 
chauffeur to another patronage position and so on. That should not 
be why one gets the job. One should get the job because of one's 
qualifications.
<P>
	These are two separate things. There is patronage, if we want to 
call it that. I am talking about the political positions that all 
political parties have to have. There are researchers, there are 
communicators and so on who need to be political and necessarily 
partisan. Why would the member think that would extend to the 
head of Canada Post, the head of the Atomic Energy Commission? 
Those are technical jobs that should be outside partisanship.
<P>
	I agree with the member that there could be a really good 
discussion on the Canada banking system but, goodness gracious, 
he is a part of the government. During the review of Canadian 
financial institutions by all means we should study that. Why not? 
Let us open it up.
<P>
	The member for Broadview-Greenwood knows that it is not an 
easy thing to get his members to agree. He could ask the 
parliamentary secretary who spent about a bizillion years in and 
among that feted swamp why he does not encourage that debate 
here in the House of Commons.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member's speech was a very partisan speech. The role of the 
opposition is to deliver blows that would tenderize a turtle and this 
member has delivered blows that would probably tenderize a can of 
Spam.
<P>
	In any event, it is unfortunate that the discussion on the bill has 
reverted to partisanship. I think he has painted all members of 
Parliament with the same brush. I  would like to suggest to him that 
we all get opportunities to refer people who want jobs.
<P>
	As one member of Parliament I can say I do not endorse anyone 
who wants to apply for any kind of an appointment for one very 
simple reason. If I do not know that person personally, if I do not 
have the credentials down to make a reference I will not make that 
reference because it will be a reflection on me.
<P>
	I would like the member at least to acknowledge that the 
performance and the accountability of those people is the most 
important thing and that to give references is a risk to all members 
of Parliament that should not be given.
<P>
<B>(1805 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will concede points in a debate. The 
hon. member makes a good point. Some Liberal members of 
Parliament are not keen on patronage appointments. For example, 
when the list is drawn up of who should be appointed to positions in 
Elections Canada, they do not submit a name. They do not submit 
the name of their campaign manager or someone they have known 
for a long time. They say: ``I am not going to get into that. That is a 
neutral position. It should not be partisan''.
<P>
	I share the member's concern. I do not put forward names for 
enumerators. I do not put forward names for appointments to 
Elections Canada.
<P>
	As a matter of fact, when Mr. Kingsley was before the procedure 
and House affairs committee I asked him a question. We give 
advice to countries around the world on how to run fair elections. I 
asked Mr. Kingsley: ``When we go to other countries to help them 
run their election campaigns, for example, do we tell them that the 
government should appoint all of the returning officers or should it 
be a neutral process?'' His response was: ``When we are overseas 
we do not want the government involved because the government 
has to be at arm's length from the elections''. I thought that was a 
good idea. If we could follow that in Canada we would be much 
better off.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be 
sharing my time with the hon. member for York North.
<P>
	I listened with interest to the hon. member for Fraser Valley 
East. The Reform Party has moved this debate along quite a ways 
today. We started off with the hon. member for St. Albert saying 
that the 271 governor in council appointments were a poor choice 
and in fact do not exist. The hon. member for Fraser Valley East 
said it was a good thing. We can see that there is a great dichotomy 
within the Reform Party itself.
<P>
	The member talked about his fresh start campaign. I was 
shocked to watch this unfold on television the other day. My 
campaign buttons and material in the last federal  election said we 
were the fresh start team. In fact, everybody was met at the door for 
the fresh start campaign in 1993. That gives us an idea of what kind 
of imagination the Reform Party has. It thrashes out old ideas. We 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5510"> 5510 </A></B>
<P>
are on the fresh start team. This is the fresh start team on this side 
of the House.
<P>
	The member for Fraser Valley East talked about their vision of 
Canada. There has been debate going back and forth this evening 
on that subject. The conclusion is the Reform Party would like to 
lead us into a cheque book government. In other words, up here in 
Ottawa all we would do is collect money and send cheques to the 
provinces. That would leave us with some limited responsibilities 
in international trade, the coast guard and so forth, but not much of 
a government. That is not a vision, that is a fragmentation of the 
country. It would lead us into a country of ten separate 
governments.
<P>
	I had a discussion late last week with pharmaceutical companies 
which told me that Canada is very much like the European Union. 
Drugs must be approved by the federal government and then it 
takes another three years to have them approved by the provinces. 
There is a cost to the consumers of Canada. It is one of the reasons 
drug costs are so high.
<P>
	Under the Reform Party's administration we would continue to 
have ten strong decentralized governments, creating ten 
duplications across the nation. We should be moving in the other 
direction.
<P>
	Bill C-49 basically attempts to standardize remedial and 
disciplinary measures in certain tribunals of Canada and to 
standardize chairpersons in administration tribunals. It also winds 
up seven organizations and downsizes another 13 organizations.
<P>
	The object of the exercise is not to make the government smaller, 
although that is one of the results of some of our downsizing 
efforts; the object of the exercise is to do two things, to make 
government more efficient and to make government more 
affordable to the taxpayers of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	The taxpayers of Canada are telling us in no uncertain terms that 
government is too big. It is too big and unresponsive to their needs 
and concerns.
<P>
	This bill is a focus on how our government is reacting to the very 
real concern of the average Canadian. It does reduce certain 
tribunals but, more important, it begs one question. The question is 
who are the customers. Are the customers the bureaucracy or the 
public?
<P>
	The bottom line is by also dealing with the concept of remedial 
and disciplinary action, the government is addressing a very real 
and important issue. People want to see that governments are 
responsive. They do not want them responsive to bureaucrats but 
instead to their concerns.
<P>
	The current issue with tribunals is that it is very difficult to 
remove people from tribunals for wrongdoing. Indeed, it takes a 
legal process and it also has to go before the exchequer court of 
Canada. This bill will make that system a lot easier.
<P>
	There is nothing worse than having a tribunal with people on it, 
possibly giving erroneous advice and making erroneous decisions. 
We want the ability of government to be able to replace those 
people. It is that issue that this bill is addressing.
<P>
	That is very important because throughout government people 
are asking how government is responding to people. There is a 
great parallel to this, small and medium size businesses.
<P>
	Small and medium size businesses have had to learn to work 
smarter. They have had to learn that the customer is very important. 
We have to satisfy the needs of the customer. To not recognize that 
is basically not to be in business at all.
<P>
	Governments in some ways, while not a business, have to act a 
little more like them. They have to be more responsive to the needs 
of people. Let me give an example.
<P>
	In my riding I have Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation. 
When I first got elected I went around visiting all the federal 
institutions in my riding and those that service my riding to see 
what they were doing.
<P>
	I was surprised that a lot of them did not have Canadian flags and 
we are working to make sure they now have. One organization 
struck me in particular, Central Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation.
<P>
	It had just implemented a total quality management system. This 
was totally unlike most other parts of government because it 
required a response time. If somebody phoned, it had to return that 
call within so many minutes.
<P>
	If it was an application for a mortgage loan, it had to be 
answered within a certain timeframe. There were timeframes for 
everything it did. The people were very rejuvenated about what it 
was doing. It was very happy and very focused on executing 
programs that people liked. It recognized that the customer was the 
general public.
<P>
	I have been very happy to work with those people in delivering 
some of their programs to some of the people in my riding. The 
point I am trying to make is that Bill C-49 addresses that issue. It 
allows the government through its various boards and directives to 
replace people if they are not in sync with best interests of people 
generally.
<P>
	This gets us back to accountability in government. Generally 
speaking, people want the government to be accountable to them. 
They are asking for a more clear, transparent system of 
government.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5511"> 5511 </A></B>
<P>
	Once again, this legislation deals with that issue. Remember 
that one of the things we are doing here is reducing the cost of 
government by upwards of $5 million per year. That may seem 
like a small amount of money but it is part of the process.
<P>
	We are doing two things. We are reducing the cost of 
government and making it more efficient. Just because we are 
making government smaller does not mean we are making it worse. 
The bottom line is that we can deliver these programs a lot more 
efficiently using technological advances that we have before us and 
at a lower cost.
<P>
	The services that governments once did can continue at a lower 
cost and with fewer individuals involved in the process.
<P>
<B>(1815 )</B>
<P>
	I notice from time to time the opposition has said that we have 
not done anything in terms of cost reduction. Forty-five thousand 
civil servants have been shed from this process. CN is no longer a 
federal government owned organization. Some of my colleagues 
mentioned the CBC. All of these are real things that affect people. 
People are demanding better service at less cost.
<P>
	I say to the Reform members and others that we are reducing the 
cost of government but at the same time making our program 
delivery more efficient.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened attentively to my colleague from Oshawa. He 
mentioned something that I want to ensure I understood correctly.
<P>
	He talked about the notion that the pharmaceutical industry felt 
that the inefficiencies related to getting their drug systems 
approved were costing it a lot of money, and the fact that it had to 
go through all these regions was a negative situation.
<P>
	Is the member promoting a more reinforced Government of 
Canada national standards for these program approvals? Is that 
what I understood him to say?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Shepherd:</B> Mr. Speaker, to be honest with the member, yes 
it would be.
<P>
	One of the big problems in this country is duplication and 
overlap. However it takes two to duplicate so we are talking about 
provincial and federal jurisdictions.
<P>
	We have to analyse those areas where the federal government 
can be more efficient. It makes sense in the area of drug 
certification that one government, the federal government, should 
provide that service. I have heard some of my Bloc colleagues talk 
about how important it is. I do not think the afflictions that affect 
human beings stop at borders.
<P>
	The bottom line is that from a national perspective we should set 
national standards. We have been all too lax at not doing that and 
letting these things slip away from us. That is part of the reason 
why this country is slipping away from us as well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (York North, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
debates like today's debate on Bill C-49 give Canadian viewers an 
opportunity to really distinguish between the two visions that exist 
in this House. The vision proposed by the Reform Party sees 
government and governance in its most evil way. The vision 
espoused by Liberals is that government and its agencies can be a 
source of positive change for the good of the collective. It is really 
important to note that because it makes people understand the 
difference between the Reform Party and the Liberal Party.
<P>
	As a member of the greater Toronto Liberal caucus I am quite 
happy today to see that <I>Fortune</I> magazine named the greater 
Toronto area as the number one international best city for work and 
family. I am proud of that achievement because in the Toronto area 
since the 1993 election of the federal Liberal government, there has 
been greater co-operation between all stakeholders in various 
communities.
<P>
	There has been a greater sense of purpose. Government has not 
been standing in the way of business but rather it has been a full 
partner in bringing about the type of economic change and 
increasing the viability of businesses, in helping with productivity.
<P>
	I have some examples of positive things the government has 
done. There are programs related to technology partnerships 
Canada, the Canadian television and cable production fund and the 
program for export market development, not to mention the work 
of the Federal Business Development Bank and other government 
agencies that serve the Canadian public very well.
<P>
<B>(1820 )</B>
<P>
	I would like to return to the Federal Business Development 
Bank. I remember a couple of years ago when two of my 
constituents, who were around the ages of 20 and 21, came to my 
constituency office to ask if they could get some advice on how to 
run a business and perhaps access some funding so they could start 
a technology based business.
<P>
	I am very happy to tell the House that a couple of months ago 
these constituents came back to my office and expressed a great 
deal of gratitude for the advice that I was able to provide to them. I 
was happy to find out they were doing quite well. They are brothers 
who are now self-employed in the growing technology industry. 
They told me that this year they will be recording a profit of 
approximately $723,000.
<P>
	Two years ago these two young Canadians, obviously very bright 
and technologically advanced, were part of the unemployment 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5512"> 5512 </A></B>
<P>
statistics of this country. The help came from the Federal Business 
Development Bank  which was able to provide them with the type 
of capital required.
<P>
	Let us look at the function of government in that equation. These 
young people knew that they could approach a member of 
Parliament who has a constituency office and is there to provide 
help in connecting young people or his or her constituents to 
government agencies that are there to help them. This is a perfect 
example of the positive role the government plays, whether it plays 
it in a constituency office or through various departments. 
Nevertheless it speaks to the fact that government can play a 
positive role in the lives of Canadians.
<P>
	Therefore, the anti-government and anti-government agency 
feelings expressed by the Reform Party are based on a very 
simplistic view of the world, not to mention the fact that I do sense 
parochialism based on the bottom line. It is not whether these 
agencies are producing services that are good for people or 
providing young people or small business people with 
opportunities. The only thing it wants to do is slash and burn. Once 
that is done then the Reform Party will be happy.
<P>
	I cannot remember the exact title of their booklet, but in this 
booklet the Reform Party has now changed its tune and wants to 
actually spend more money. The reality is that Canadians have 
learned through the years of Liberal government that a more 
balanced approach, a two track approach where we are reducing the 
deficit, creating jobs and investing in people, is really the route to 
go.
<P>
	Nothing makes me more proud than to be part of a government 
that actually hits the targets it sets. We can look at some of its 
records and listen to the finance minister's announcement that the 
federal deficit for 1995-96 was $28.6 billion. That is $4.1 billion 
lower than the $32.7 billion target for the year.
<P>
	The reason why I am happy and proud to be part of this 
government and this caucus is because I remember sitting on the 
other side of the House when the Conservative government was in 
power. I remember the then minister of finance, Michael Wilson, 
never ever hitting a target on the deficit.
<P>
<B>(1825 )</B>
<P>
	The present Minister of Finance has created a great deal of 
confidence in the economy of Canada. We are hitting the deficit 
targets. The deficit has been lowered. Inflation is low. Consumer 
and business confidence is better than it has been for many years. 
This is the type of role the government has played in the lives of 
Canadians. It speaks to the fact that when a party such as the 
Liberal Party comes into power with a plan and sticks to that plan 
which was endorsed by the people of Canada, then great results are 
achieved.
<P>
	That is why today we are able to stand before Canadians and say 
that the red book plan is working for  them. Unemployment 
numbers are down. Over 700,000 jobs have been created. We are 
investing in our young people more than any previous government.
<P>
	Beside me is the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Human Resources Development who has worked extremely hard to 
make sure that the priorities of young people are looked after by the 
government. That is why the Minister of Finance was able to 
announce an increase in the federal budget by approximately $350 
million toward youth programs, for a total of $1 billion for youth 
programs. That does not include the $2.5 billion or 57 per cent 
increase for Canada student loans which will allow young people to 
access education. Since I am talking about our young people, I also 
want to remind Canadians from coast to coast about the $165 
million invested in education tax credits to further enhance 
opportunities for young people.
<P>
	The bill before us today proposes a style of government that is 
efficient and smaller. But unlike members of the Reform Party who 
basically think that in order to reach a deficit target you need to 
slash and burn, we believe there is a better way, a smarter way to 
bring positive change to the lives of Canadians.
<P>
	As I conclude my remarks, I want to give some practical 
examples of how the government has been able to achieve positive 
ends for people. For example, interest rates have decreased 18 
times over the last 17 months. Between January 1995 and October 
1996 short term interest rates fell to 4.75 per cent. The prime 
lending rate charged by Canada's chartered banks has fallen to 5.25 
per cent, the lowest rate since 1959. I was not even born in 1959.
<P>
	As a member of Parliament who was born in 1960, I am happy 
that happy times are here again and that people can look to the 
future with optimism and a sense of confidence that speaks to 
developing a nation that is once again prosperous.
<P>
	Our achievements are far too many to list in this debate. I can 
talk about the fact that in my area we have the lowest crime rate 
ever, thanks to the measures taken by the Minister of Justice under 
the leadership of the Prime Minister. Businesses are looking to the 
future with a great deal of optimism because interest rates are low 
and consumer confidence is high. People are being equipped with 
the skills required to take on the global economy of the 21st 
century.
<P>
	After having heard this morning that the greater Toronto area 
was the best place in the world in which to live, I can only say it is 
only matched by the fact that I am a part of perhaps the best 
government in the history of this country.
