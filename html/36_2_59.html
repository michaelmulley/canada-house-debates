hepatitis C) and the organizations that represent them to 
identify needs and to seek guidance on designing the various 
components of the new hepatitis C program.

initiatives, and to ensure that Canadians who have been infected 
through blood do not incur out-of-pocket expenses for medical 
treatment.

</H3><P align=left>
<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>FINANCIAL STATEMENT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE 
</H4><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK55">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from February 28 consideration of the motion 
that this House approves in general the budgetary policy of the 
government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to begin debate on the first federal budget of 
the new century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to dedicate this reply to the budget address to a 
new Canadian, Joshua Jacob Kroon, born early yesterday evening to 
our oldest daughter Andrea and her husband Howard.  The baby was 
born on budget day.  When I meet young Joshua I am afraid it will 
be my duty to inform him that according to the budget tabled 
yesterday he already owes $18,600, that being his portion of the 
national debt.  That is bad news for young Joshua.  However, the 
good news is that by the time he becomes of age, Canada will no 
doubt have a new government and the Liberal legacy of high 
spending, high taxes and high debt will be a distant memory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addressing budget 2000, I am conscious, and I am sure all 
members are conscious, that millions of Canadians have hopes and 
dreams for themselves and their children that can be affected by 
the spending policies, the taxation policies and the budgetary 
promises of the federal government.  For example, if the federal 
government wastes taxpayer dollars through irresponsible spending 
it is Canadians who suffer because there are then insufficient 
dollars available to fund those services, such as health care, 
which Canadians value highly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the federal government taxes Canadians too heavily it is the 
take home pay and the bank accounts of individuals, families and 
employers that are savaged and it is Canadian jobs and economic 
opportunities that are killed and exported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the finance minister makes promises and commitments in his 
budgets which are then broken, if the truths asserted in the 
budget turn out to be half truths, which are more dangerous than 
falsehoods because they are more difficult to detect, then it is 
the faith of Canadians in the integrity of the government itself 
which is shaken and eroded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this preamble, allow me to review the federal budget under 
three simple headings:  spending, taxes and integrity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear again from this budget that the highest priority of 
the Liberal government is not tax relief but the increased 
spending of taxpayer dollars.  The budget reveals that the 
government will be spending $4.3 billion more this year than 
provided for in last year's estimates.  In other words, the 
promises in last year's budget to limit spending to $111.2 
billion will once again be broken as the government spends $115.5 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This chronic tendency of Liberal governments to break promises 
to limit spending has been criticized by the auditor general in 
these words: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At issue is more than the mere fact that the government spent 
more than it planned to spend.  How this was done also matters. 
A scramble around budget time to find ways to spend money before 
the year ends is not a process calculated to ensure efficiency, 
effectiveness and economy in the use of public funds.  In fact, 
it differs little from the end of the year spending by the 
departments with surplus funds, except that it involves not 
millions but billions of taxpayers' dollars. 
</UL>

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the end of the year spending binges that have 
often characterized the government's departments has now spread 
to the Treasury Board, the finance department and the government 
as a whole, and this of course is a backward step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Turning to the future, the finance minister projects surpluses 
for the next five years of more than $150 billion.  If the 
government truly believed that these surpluses belong to the 
people, it would give the bulk of them back to the people. What 
is the finance minister's highest priority with respect to the 
use of those future surpluses?  Is it tax relief?  No.  Is it 
debt reduction?  No.  Once again, the highest priority is to 
spend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of the $152 billion in projected surpluses over the next five 
years, the government implies that it will spend $66 billion, 
provide $58 billion in tax relief, apply $15 billion to the debt 
and leave $13 billion unallocated.  Even if one took these 
figures at face value, which we do not, spending is still the 
highest priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The taxpayers and the official opposition also know that the 
government spends unallocated revenue, so that the $13 billion in 
unallocated revenue should be put into spending.  The child care 
tax benefit is a social program not a tax relief program, so that 
should be put into spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxpayers and the official opposition also know that the 
cancellation of bracket creep, with which we concur, is a 
cancellation of future tax increases not a cut for today's 
taxpayer and it should not really be included in the tax relief 
figure.  Even if we just take into account these first two 
adjustments, what the government will do with the projected $152 
billion in surpluses is apply $15 billion to debt reduction, 
provide less than $51 billion in tax relief and spend $86.3 
billion.  Surprise, surprise.  Once again the highest priority of 
the government is spending taxpayers' dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note with interest that the government says on page 12 of the 
budget that it will be supporting more genetic research. When the 
human genome project is completed, perhaps a complete genetic map 
of the Liberal species will become available.  I am sure that our 
scientists will discover that the Liberals possess a recessive 
financial gene.  That gene renders them congenitally incapable of 
saving taxpayers' dollars and compulsively inclined to spend 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether a permanent cure for this disorder will be developed, 
only time will tell.  At present, however, there is only one 
known remedy and that is to remove the temptation and the 
capacity for Liberals to spend taxpayer dollars by removing them 
from office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most shocking and disappointing aspect of the federal 
government's spending program is not the government's 
overspending of last year's budget.  It is not that increased 
spending of taxpayer dollars continues to be the government's 
highest priority.  We expected all that.  The most shocking and 
disappointing aspect of the treatment of federal spending in this 
budget is what can only be described as an incredible omission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to the finance minister's failure to even mention in his 
budget, let alone address, the spending scandal at human 
resources development, a scandal which shakes to the core any 
faith the public might still have in the government's capacity to 
spend taxpayer money responsibly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the government's spending promises and spending plans remain 
compromised as long as the spending scandal at HRD remains 
unaddressed and unresolved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As everyone in parliament knows, the spending of HRD on programs 
like the Canada jobs fund has been suspect for years. The odour 
finally became so bad that this summer the department itself was 
compelled to do an internal audit of 459 files, representative of 
$1 billion in spending on grants and contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did that internal audit reveal?  It revealed that 15% of 
the files reviewed did not have an application on file from the 
sponsor; 72% had no cashflow forecast; 11% had no budget 
proposal; 11% had no description of expected results; 97% of the 
files showed no evidence that anyone had even checked to see if 
the recipient already owed money to HRD or the government; 80% of 
the files showed no evidence of financial monitoring; and 87% of 
the files showed no evidence of supervision.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand that this audit has inspired the CBC to propose a 
new game show called “Who Wants to be a Grant Recipient”, with 
the Minister of Human Resources Development as the host.  It 
would be just like <I>Who Wants to be a Millionaire</I>, except 
the host does not ask any questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of particular concern to parliament, the ultimate watchdog over 
the public purse, is that the gross mismanagement of taxpayer 
dollars at human resources is just the tip of the iceberg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government spends more than $13 billion per year 
under the heading of grants and contributions; the spending 
category under which the HRD funds have been so grossly 
mismanaged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a random audit found that 8% of the files the auditors looked 
at were so bad that they required a forensic investigation and 
perhaps referral to the police, what is the situation in the 
thousands and thousands of unexamined files in that department 
and across the government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Auditor General of Canada has repeatedly warned the 
government concerning the presence and the size of this iceberg. 
This is not something new. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In chapter 27 of his 1998 report he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have reported to parliament on numerous audits of grants and 
contribution programs over the past 21 years.  Many of those 
audits identified similar concerns:  inconsistent application or 
interpretation of government policy on grants and contributions; 
inefficient use of funds and inadequate measures to ensure 
accountability by program recipients; lack of control, monitoring 
and evaluation; and reporting in the estimates and the public 
accounts that was inadequate to facilitate examination and 
year-to-year comparisons by parliament. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These conditions all still exist at human resources, hence the 
spending boondoggle there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general went on to say in his 1998 report that these 
same conditions also exist with respect to the management of 
grants and contributions by the Department of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development, by the Department of Citizenship and 
Immigration, by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and by the 
Department of Industry with particular reference to federal 
regional development agencies, such as the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency, the Federal Office of Regional Development 
for Quebec and the Western Economic Diversification Agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a meeting recently in the Peace River country, I described 
the whole HRD scandal.  A farmer came up to me afterward and 
asked if there was any way that we could persuade the Prime 
Minister to make the human resources development minister the 
minister of taxes.  When I asked him why he would want such a 
change, he said that if she mismanages the collection of tax 
money like she mismanages the distribution of it, that might be 
as good as a tax break.  He said that she might lose his file or 
forget to check whether he owed the government any money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just the Minister of Human Resources Development who 
is implicated in the gross mismanagement of taxpayer dollars 
under the heading of grants and contributions.  The government 
says in the budget that it wants to foster a culture of 
innovation.  However, it is a culture of fiscal irresponsibility 
that permeates this government.  The blame lies with all the 
ministers who have tolerated it or cultivated it for so long, 
including the Minister of Finance and, worst of all, the Prime 
Minister himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the Prime Minister is part of the problem, if not at the 
heart of the problem, can be demonstrated in half a dozen ways. 
Let us look, for example, at the mismanagement of grants and 
contributions to the Prime Minister's own riding, particularly 
through the transitional jobs fund or later the Canada jobs fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are we to conclude from the following:  The Prime 
Minister's statement to the electors of Saint-Maurice in 1993, as 
reported in the Montreal <I>Gazette</I> of October 15,  “When a 
dossier for Saint-Maurice lands on a cabinet minister's 
desk—need I say more—”, he said to gales of laughter during 
a campaign meeting yesterday”.  The taxpayers are not laughing.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The $164,000 transitional jobs fund grant given to Yvon Duhaime

</I></B></P><P align=left>There was the $2.04 million transitional jobs fund grant given 
to companies owned by René Giguère which contributed $4,000 to 
the Prime Minister's personal campaign in 1997 and almost $15,000 
to the Liberal Party of Canada in 1997 and 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was the $2.5 million grant from HRD given to build a 
training centre for new economy jobs in the Prime Minister's 
riding.  This is currently being investigated by the RCMP because 
of allegations that more than $100,000 of that money found its 
way into the pockets of local directors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was the $200,000 grant announced by the federal regional 
development agency for Quebec for building a lighted fountain in 
the Saint-Maurice River in the Prime Minister's riding.  Access 
to information documents reveal that this project was being 
lobbied for by the Prime Minister's office even before a formal 
application had been made by the sponsor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just last week HRD was forced to order a forensic audit into how 
funds earmarked for a project in the Montreal riding of Rosemont 
ended up bankrolling a virtually identical project in Shawinigan, 
once again in the Prime Minister's riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I were describing to the House events occurring in some 
underdeveloped country with a corrupt and dictatorial government 
with no traditions or mechanisms for enforcing political or 
fiscal accountability, hon. members might shake their heads and 
say that it was regrettable but perhaps understandable.  But the 
events I have been describing have been happening in Canada and 
involve the Prime Minister of Canada.  What a shame. What a 
disgrace. What a scandal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about the misuse and mismanagement of taxpayers' 
dollars, taxpayers' dollars which the House holds the Minister of 
Finance accountable for budgeting and managing responsibly.  We 
have the right, indeed we have the responsibility to ask where 
has the Minister of Finance been in all of this and why is there 
not a single reference in the budget to these matters? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister, the would be prime minister, is implicated 
in all of this.  It is now clear from the public accounts 
particularly between 1995 and 1998 that at the very time the 
finance minister was slashing health care funding, he was 
actually increasing the flow of funds to HRD and these programs 
where taxpayers' dollars were being wasted by the millions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the finance minister was withholding funds for hospital 
beds across Canada, he was authorizing funds for hotel beds in 
the Prime Minister's riding.  Not only were the government's 
spending controls dysfunctional, but its spending priorities were 
upside down and the finance minister did nothing to correct 
either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite all of the evidence of gross mismanagement of federal 
spending on grants and contributions—and I have only touched on 
the tip of the iceberg as the auditor general reports make 
clear—I draw to the attention of the House that in the 
minister's hour long budget speech yesterday, in the 350 pages of 
the year 2000 budget plan tabled in the House yesterday, there is 
not a single reference or even an acknowledgement of this 
problem.  Nor is there any comprehensive proposal for remedying 
it and restoring the public's faith in the integrity of the 
government's management of taxpayers' dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an incredible omission.  This is an inexcusable 
omission.  This omission is an insult to the finance committee of 
the House.  It is an insult to the public accounts committee.  It 
is an insult to the auditor general.  It is an insult to the 
intelligence of the whole House.  Most certainly and most 
deplorably of all, it is an insult to the long suffering Canadian 
taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I venture to say that if any large public company in this 
country had a billion dollar spending boondoggle in one of its 
divisions and failed to report it or address it in its annual 
report to the shareholders, not only would its shares be hammered 
on the stock market but its vice-president of finance would be 
dismissed and would face disciplinary action from both the 
shareholders and the securities commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House passed a law called the Canada Corporations Act that 
requires companies to adhere to a standard of financial reporting 
higher than that practised by this government.  How can we demand 
a higher standard from the private sector than we actually demand 
in the handling of public money?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To add insult to injury, the finance minister has the nerve to 
come to the House asking for authority to increase federal 
spending by over $80 billion over the next five years. To that we 
respond in the name of and on behalf of the taxpayers by asking, 
why should the House give the government one dollar more of 
taxpayers' money to spend when it is grossly mismanaging the 
billions of dollars that it has already been given?  Why should 
the House authorize the government to spend more taxpayers' 
dollars when the government's budget does not even acknowledge 
the gross mismanagement or propose any concrete spending controls 
to prevent it from ever happening again? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some taxpayers may actually read the budget.  They may come to 
the heading on page 8, “Sound Financial Management”. Then the 
taxpayers will come to the sentence on page 9, “Let there be no 
doubt, we will control spending”.  When the taxpayers see that, 
they will say, “Really.  You will control spending like you 
controlled it at HRD, like you control it at Indian affairs, like 
you control it in the heritage department.  No thanks”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The spending proposals of the minister and the government 
contained in the budget are unacceptable to Canadians and to the 
House.  They are unacceptable not simply because they propose to 
increase spending and the burden on taxpayers yet again, but 
because the integrity of the government spending is compromised 
and the budget does not even recognize the fact let alone address 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  The taxpayers were paying while you were 
away campaigning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning:</B>  An hon. backbencher across the way 
mentioned the word taxes.  Let us enlighten him on the subject of 
taxes.  It is a great, difficult task to enlighten the hon. 
member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will turn to the other side of the loonie, to the taxation 
aspects of the budget, because for every dollar the finance 
minister and the Liberals propose to spend, there is a tax which 
must first be imposed upon and collected from Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the tax proposals contained in the budget must be 
considered in the context of the government's overall taxation 
record.  That record is one of constantly increasing taxes and 
tax revenue. The official opposition finance critic, the member 
for Medicine Hat, has prepared some instructive charts on the 
government's taxation record which I commend to all members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The one on personal income taxes shows Canada with the dubious 
distinction of leading the industrialized world in terms of high 
personal income taxes.  The personal income taxes extracted from 
Canadians by their governments amount to 13.9% of GDP compared to 
the next highest nation which happens to be the United States at 
10.7%. This is the biggest single reason why Canadians' standard 
of living measured in terms of real personal after tax income was 
$833 lower per person in 1999 than in 1989, while the real 
personal after tax income in the U.S. increased by $2,200 U.S. 
over the same period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to payroll taxes, these charts show that 
job-killing payroll taxes for Canadians continue to climb, with 
skyrocketing increases in CPP premiums more than offsetting the 
token decreases in employment insurance premiums.  When it comes 
to consumption taxes, by 2005 the federal government will be 
collecting almost $30 billion per year from GST, almost double 
what it was collecting in 1993 when the present Prime Minister 
promised to abolish it.  It is the combination of all these high 
taxes which is driving capital, employees, employers and jobs out 
of the country and which has earned the finance minister the 
dubious title of Captain Brain Drain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to establish the fact that contrary to the assertions of 
the Minister of Finance, after this budget Canadian taxpayers 
will be worse off not better off than they were when the 
government took office.  They will continue to be worse off into 
the future unless the government is removed from office and 
replaced with one dedicated to genuine tax relief.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The simplest way to demonstrate this is to look at the 
minister's spending and taxation projections for the next five 
years.  The minister proposes to reduce federal taxes by $51 
billion—and we think it is much less than that—over the next 
five years, $11.2 billion over the next two.  But over the same 
period he proposes to increase the spending of tax dollars by 
$86.3 billion.  Figure it out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget continues the old Liberal shell game that has been 
going on for years and which has characterized every budget 
presented by the minister in which tax relief has been mentioned. 
With the right hand and with great flourish to attract our 
attention, he gives $51 billion in tax relief over five years. 
But with the left hand and surreptitiously through previously 
authorized tax increases, he extracts $86.3 billion from our 
other pocket.  In the end the taxpayer is paying more, not less, 
than the Liberals were taking in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The charts prepared by the finance critic for the official 
opposition show that when the minister's hidden tax increases are 
added to his announced tax breaks over the last six years, 
Canadian families will still pay $703 per family more in taxes 
next year than they did in 1993 when the Liberals took office. 
When the finance minister's hidden taxes are added to his 
announced tax breaks over the next five years, Canadian families 
will still be paying more per family than they did when the 
Liberals took office in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we describe the tax measures in this budget as 
half-baked tax breaks.  We call upon Canadians who want real tax 
relief to examine and support our solution 17 tax relief proposal 
which my colleague, the member for Medicine Hat, will describe in 
more detail later on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just the weakness and inadequacy of the finance 
minister's so-called tax relief proposals that would disturb 
Canadians.  Once again it is the absence of integrity on the tax 
side of the budget that casts a shadow over every tax proposal 
and promise the minister makes.  Unlike the concept of deficit 
reduction or balancing a budget, which is an academic concept to 
most people where the taxpayer has to take it on faith that the 
goal has been achieved, when it comes to tax relief, the taxpayer 
on his or her own is able to determine whether or not the 
promised tax relief has actually been delivered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The taxpayer can look at his or her paystub at the end of the 
pay period.  He or she can compare the deductions of this pay 
period with those of last year or last month and determine for 
themselves whether the take home pay has increased or decreased. 
The family can look at its chequebook and bank account.  It can 
tell whether or not it is receiving real tax relief by whether 
its after tax income is increasing or shrinking.  When real 
Canadian families do that, they find that real after tax income 
in Canada over the last decade decreased by almost $3,000 per 
family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not matter whether the words tax relief appeared in 
every second sentence in the federal government's throne speech. 
It does not matter whether the words occur in every sentence in 
the speeches by the Prime Minister or in the budget speeches by 
the finance minister or in media headlines and reports on the 
budget.  If promised tax relief does not show up on the paystubs 
and in the bank accounts of ordinary Canadians, then it is not 
real tax relief no matter how much PR accompanies it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government keeps promising tax relief year after year but 
it does not show up on the paystub or in the bank account of the 
taxpayer, after a while the taxpayer catches on to the shell 
game. Yes there can be a highly visible tax cut like the changes 
in rates, deductions and credits announced in the budget, 
including the elimination of bracket creep, which we commend. But 
there are also much less visible tax increases, like the 
pre-scheduled increases in CPP premiums which take effect without 
further announcements or fanfare.  The list goes on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Invariably under a Liberal government the increases are greater 
than the decreases so that the total tax load gets heavier and 
heavier.  This has been precisely the Canadian experience and why 
Canadians find themselves paying more in taxes despite all the 
announced decreases than when this government took office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The promise of tax relief is often a half-truth.  The other half 
of the truth is that there is also a tax increase.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When government budgets like this government's budget are 
riddled with those kinds of half-truths, and when promises of tax 
relief are made year after year but no real tax relief shows up 
in the taxpayer's paystub or bank account, we do not have an 
accounting problem.  We do not have a budgeting problem.  We do 
not even have a tax problem.  Once again we have an integrity 
problem, just as real and just as dangerous as the integrity 
problem on the spending side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me get more specific on this subject.  I will read to the 
House some of the promises that the finance minister has made in 
the past to taxpayers concerning tax relief.  Then I will share 
with the House what the taxpayers to whom those promises 
supposedly applied actually experienced.  Then let us see what 
this comparison says about the credibility of the finance 
minister and the integrity of his tax relief promises in this 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Promise No. 1 comes from a statement made by the finance 
minister in the House on October 13, 1999: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On January 1, as indeed on January 1 of every year since we have 
taken office, there will be a reduction in payroll taxes. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that on January 1, 2000, employment insurance 
premiums were adjusted downward, but what also happened as a 
result of previously authorized changes to the Canada pension 
plan was that the combined employer-employee premiums for CPP 
went up on January 1 from 7% to 7.8% of contributory earnings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The payroll tax hike from CPP premium increases is greater than 
the payroll tax reduction through the reduction of EI premiums. 
Thus many workers experienced not a reduction in payroll taxes as 
promised by the finance minister on October 13 but precisely the 
opposite, a payroll tax increase.  Does one wonder why workers 
and employers get cynical when they hear promises of payroll tax 
reductions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Promise No. 2 comes from a statement of the finance minister to 
parliament on December 7, 1999: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At $30,000 of income, Canadians no longer pay federal income 
taxes as a result of the actions taken in the last two budgets by 
this government. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask hon. members opposite to listen to that statement.  The 
finance minister stood in the House and made that bold promise 
and declaration.  Let me read into the record a letter from Paul 
and Fran Darr of Calgary, Alberta, taxpayers.  The Darrs write: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are a retired couple with a total income of $28,000. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If my math is right, that is less than $30,000. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of that the government sees fit to take almost $4,000 in taxes, 
documents attached.  Paul Martin has repeatedly declared anyone 
under $30,000 does not pay any taxes.  Excuse me!  This is 
written proof.  If this is truly the case, we would greatly 
appreciate a return cheque for this amount that we had to pay for 
1998, ASAP. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at promise No. 3.  Mr. Speaker, do you see the 
credibility gap that is developing here?  The finance minister 
makes these statements and promises.  If one goes out to the 
taxpayers to whom they apply and asks if they ever saw that tax 
relief promised by the taxman, they shake their heads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Promise No. 3 is from a budget speech.  We are getting right 
down to promises in the budget.  It is from the budget speech of 
February 16, 1999, at page 4.  The finance minister said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a budget that for the first time in many years offers tax 
relief to every taxpayer and it does so without using borrowed 
money. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax relief for every taxpayer, promised the finance minister. 
Let us go out to the offices, the factories, the stores, the 
union halls, the seniors' homes, the kitchen tables and coffee 
shops where we meet real taxpayers and let us find out about the 
finance minister's promise of tax relief for every taxpayer. We 
ought to be able to grab any taxpayer off the the street and ask 
if they got the tax relief the minister promised on page 4 of the 
budget, that he said they would get.  Has it got there yet? We 
could ask them that.  Let us find out how it is working out in 
the real world.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Shortly after last year's budget I was in Windsor, Ontario, 
where I met a worker at one of the auto plants.  He was a union 
member.  These are highly paid people.  He had a paystub for 
overtime work in which the total deductions were greater than his 
net pay.  He not only wanted to know where his tax relief was 
that was promised by the finance minister.  He wanted to know 
whom he was working for.  He thought he was working for Chrysler 
but according to his paystub he was working at least half time 
for Revenue Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On another one of my trips last year I received a paystub from a 
millwright in Saskatchewan.  His gross earnings for an overtime 
pay period were $2,022, but after paying income taxes, payroll 
taxes and other charges all he got to take home was $1,009. Gross 
pay, $2,022; take home pay, $1,009.  It was less than half his 
paycheque.  On his way home when he stopped to buy gas and a 
winter jacket, the taxman gouged him again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This unsolicited paystub, along with many others I received, is 
an example of the very real tax horror stories of Canadians. They 
are stories which clearly show that the finance minister's 
so-called tax cuts, tax relief for every Canadian, clearly fail 
the paystub test.  They are living proof that the finance 
minister is completely out of touch with Canadian taxpayers.  His 
claims of so-called tax relief are in direct contradiction to the 
actual experiences of many hard working, tax burdened Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To help illustrate this point further last November we decided 
to hold the great paystub rip-off contest.  Hundreds of Canadians 
responded to the contest by e-mailing, faxing and mailing in 
their paystubs and stories to my office.  I want to take this 
opportunity to give the House a sample of some of the paystub 
stories we received and to announce the winner of this most 
unfortunate prize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After I am through, surely even the most obtuse government 
backbencher will understand what I mean when I say that this 
government has an integrity problem on taxation, a problem of 
credibility that comes from promising tax relief to every 
Canadian and then failing to deliver it, and an integrity problem 
that is every bit as serious as the government's integrity 
problem on the spending side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are some of the best entries to the paystub rip-off 
contest.  Here is one called “pay raise rip-off”.  Last year, 
Annalora Horch, a teacher who works for a private school board in 
Medicine Hat, Alberta, got a $1,000 raise.  She was hoping to put 
the raise away for her retirement.  After taxes, however, Ms. 
Horch's $1,000 pay raise left her with exactly $2.67 each month 
to put away for her golden years.  She was promised tax relief 
from the finance minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You are shaking your head.  I agree, Mr. Speaker, that we should 
shake our heads.  Let me read the letter: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Please find enclosed copies of two months of my 
paystubs—September 1998 and 1999 and October 1998 and 1999.  I 
work for a private school board in Medicine Hat.  My board gave 
all the teaching staff a $1,000 raise for this year.  I have 
never been on welfare or received unemployment.  I have worked 
since I was twelve years old and am presently helping to finance 
my son at university to keep his student loans at a minimum.  Any 
increase in pay is appreciated so I can save for my retirement. 
It was with great anticipation that I waited for my increase. 
However, the figures on the stubs tell the true story. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Listen to how taxes kill dreams.  They do not just kill bottom 
lines.  She has the calculation here:  $1,000 divided by 12 
months, she should be getting $83.33 a month.  However, the 
paystubs for September 1999 show an increase of $81 in taxes. 
October 1999 shows an increase of $81 in taxes as well.  She 
writes: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I already pay hefty taxes to the government and now it is 
increased even more.  My much needed raise is not going to me or 
benefiting the school.  It is going directly to the government 
for taxes.  This is a great injustice to an honest, hard-working 
citizen.  It is discouraging.  Please, is there some way this 
continuing burden of increasing taxes can be alleviated for the 
ordinary, middle class worker?  We need help and I am appealing 
to you to help me and all other taxpayers in this area of 
overburdened taxation.

ripped off”.  A Toronto police constable writes:

took home $34,000.

member for Dewdney—Alouette.  This is a fairly lengthy one but 
it is worth reading because it illustrates that taxes are not 
just some accounting device.  They intrude on the lives of people 
when they are too high in ways that destroy people's dreams and 
even destroy their lives.  The letter reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In July of 1993 I found myself the single parent of five children 
who worked as a Special Education Assistant.  I could not support 
my kids off that wage so I got a student loan, the first of many, 
and started university where I hoped to become a teacher.  Five 
hard years later I made it.  I didn't think about the debt 
because I thought I would be able to make enough to support my 
kids and pay the loan back.  I loved teaching.  I was good at it, 
and I got a continuing contract, a permanent position in my first 
year of teaching.  Now, I thought, I'll be OK.  The hard work 
would be worth it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was wrong!  The hard work was worth it because I love what I 
do and I value the education I received and the process of 
getting it, but I can't survive monetarily.  I am a single parent 
although I have only three children still at home.  With the 
level of taxation in this country...I can't make it.  Yes, I make 
a good wage, but after deductions I still can't buy my ten year 
old son winter boots, or my sixteen year old daughter a monthly 
bus pass.  I am being asked by the student loan people to pay 
over $350 per month.  If I did that I couldn't buy any food for 
my kids.  I am not in a better place.  I am only deeper in debt! 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The taxation level in this country is killing me. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a rich person.  This is not the filthy rich the 
finance minister and the Prime Minister talk about as being the 
beneficiaries of tax relief.  These are ordinary Canadians at the 
lower and middle end of the spectrum.  The letter goes on: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The taxation level in this country is killing me.  I have to have 
a part time job in order to survive, but I can't leave my kids 
alone from 7 a.m. when I go to school until 10 p.m. when I would 
get home from my second job! 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I love living in this country because there is so much good in 
it, but how can I see the good when the burden of taxation is 
blinding me?  Something needs to be done for people like me who 
live on one income, be they single parents or families with one 
parent working.  I don't need a national day care scheme.  I need 
tax relief!  I would love to be able to go into a store and buy 
my son a pair of needed shoes without worrying that I will have 
enough money left over so we can eat at the end of the month. 
Some people say I should quit and just sit on welfare, but I 
can't. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my hope that in this new session of Parliament the 
government will see just how the average, low-middle income 
earner in this country is suffering.  I don't want pomp and 
ceremony.  I don't want Senators to get a fabulous tunnel so they 
don't muss their hair in the Ottawa winter.  I need relief from 
the exorbitant amount I pay each and every month for taxes.  I 
need a break. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Please feel free to send a copy of this letter to Finance 
Minister Paul Martin and the Prime Minister.  They obviously 
don't live in the real world.  I do and I don't like it. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we pick a winner from all these?  There are no real 
winners, only hard working Canadians who lose out to a finance 
minister who promises tax relief and then delivers tax increases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that no amount of income is too small to attract the 
attention of the finance minister.  The letter we have selected 
as the winner strikingly illustrates this point.  It comes from 
Mr. Paul Meyer, a structural engineer from Montrose, B.C., who 
worked half an hour of overtime, and listen to what the finance 
minister did to him: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have enclosed a copy of my two most recent paystubs.  I think 
they stand as a good example of how high taxation rates in Canada 
can be a disincentive to productive workers. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government says it is interested in productivity.  Here is a 
letter from a productive worker: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the two-week period ending November 05, 1999, I was paid 
for 80 hours work, while the following period, I was paid for 
80.5 hours of work, having put in a half hour overtime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The half hour overtime increased my gross pay by $19.33. 
Amazingly, this resulted in my federal income tax increasing by 
$20.13.  In effect, I paid the government 80 cents for the 
privilege of working a half hour overtime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize that this is an anomaly caused by “steps” in the 
tax tables, but the very fact that a “step” could result in an 
apparent marginal tax rate of 104% tells me that our tax rates 
are too high.  As a resident of British Columbia with a good 
salary, my actual marginal tax rate is well over 50%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also note that, because it is late in the year, no CPP or EIC 
deductions were made from my salary, as I had already “maxed 
out” on both amounts for the year.  If it were not for that 
“anomaly” my apparent marginal rate would have been over 110%.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Paul Meyer is with us here today.  We congratulate you, Paul, on 
this most unfortunate honour and thank you for sharing your tax 
rip-off story for the benefit of the House and taxpayers across 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is people like Paul who are paying for the $1 billion 
boondoggle at human resources and who are paying for all the 
past, present and future tax increases not mentioned in this 
budget. It is people like Paul who want real tax relief not token 
tax relief, not sleight of hand tax relief, not fake tax breaks, 
but real tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind hon. members that all these taxpayers whose letters I 
have read were promised tax relief in last year's budget, that 
all of them feel abused, not helped by the government and that 
this is just a tiny sample of 15 million Canadian taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government and the finance minister have a credibility and 
an integrity problem on taxation, just as they have the same 
problem on spending.  It stems from the finance minister's being 
totally out of touch with ordinary Canadians, underestimating 
their pain, underestimating their intelligence, underestimating 
their patience and underestimating their desire for real tax 
relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the role of the official opposition to hold the government 
accountable for the management of taxpayers' dollars. We will use 
this budget debate to do precisely that.  Official opposition 
members speaking on the budget are speaking first and foremost 
from the standpoint of the long suffering, long abused taxpayer. 
We are the voice of those taxpayers and we insist that they be 
heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that by the time my colleagues and I have finished 
with this budget we will have demonstrated to the House and to 
any Canadians who are watching that the government is 
irresponsible when it comes to spending taxpayer money and 
irresponsible when it comes to the taxation of Canadians, and 
that lack of integrity characterizes its approach to bothe 
spending and taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition has a second role which is becoming even 
more important in the light of the government's mismanagement of 
public affairs.  And that role is to make sure that a 
constructive alternative is available to replace the government 
when the day comes that Canadians decide to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in the discharge of this responsibility that we have been 
working together with others like-minded to bring into being the 
Canadian reform conservative alliance, or Canadian alliance for 
short. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the time or the place to elaborate on this concept, 
but I mention it in the budget debate because one of the great 
founding principles of that alliance is genuine fiscal 
responsibility; the principle that is missing from the spending 
and taxation policies of the government and from this budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the heading of fiscal responsibility, the alliance policy 
package includes proposals for restoring integrity and 
accountability to federal government spending.  It also includes 
a tax reform that will deliver approximately double the tax 
relief provided in this budget over the next five years.  It is 
characterized by a 17% single rate of federal income tax with 
generous personal, spousal and child deductions that will remove 
more than two million lower and middle income Canadians from the 
federal tax rolls all together and deliver the largest reduction 
in the federal tax burden ever provided to the Canadian people by 
any federal political party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the key MPs who has helped bring this alliance into being 
is the member for Calgary Southeast.  He also happens to be the 
former president of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation and the 
official opposition critic for revenue. 
He has attended and addressed literally dozens and dozens of 
meetings across the country where people have met together to 
discuss uniting in new ways to control spending and get the debt 
and tax levels down.  We should listen to his report on these 
activities.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member of the official opposition who has led the 
development of the alliance's position on federal spending and 
taxation, including the solution 17 proposal, is the member for 
Medicine Hat, the official opposition critic for finance.  On 
these subjects, he has consulted not only his colleagues in 
caucus but also think tanks across the country and supporters of 
the provincial administrations of Premier Klein in Alberta and 
Premier Harris in Ontario, provincial administrations that have 
actually succeeded in delivering real broad based tax relief to 
their people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would urge hon. members and the public to listen to these 
members and other opposition members who are not only devoting 
themselves to holding the government accountable for 
mismanagement of taxpayers money, but who are endeavouring to 
create a constructive alternative to the government.  It is 
members who advocate genuine fiscal responsibility in practice as 
well as in words on both the spending and the taxation side who 
represent the wave of the future, and they deserve our full 
attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to conclude by reflecting for a brief moment on the truth 
of an old saying which applies to governments as well as to 
individuals, the saying that pride or arrogance precedes a fall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been observed that there are two types of arrogance that 
bring down governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first is an arrogance that is rooted, sadly, in ability and 
accomplishment.  It is ultimately offensive to the public and 
will ultimately turn voters against an administration.  But it is 
at least an understandable if not forgivable arrogance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To illustrate, the Liberal administration of Louis St-Laurent 
became infected with this type of arrogance in the early 1950s 
and it contributed directly to the fall of that administration in 
1957. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The wartime cabinet of Mackenzie King contained probably some of 
the ablest individuals ever to serve in a federal cabinet in 
terms of sheer ability and accomplishment, the ability to get 
things done under difficult circumstances with limited resources. 
There is no comparison between King's wartime cabinet and the 
front benches of the present government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Louis St-Laurent, though past his prime by the mid-1950s, was 
an able and accomplished leader.  Ministers like C.D. Howe, who 
had demonstrated enormous capability when he was in the private 
sector and even greater capabilities when he was in charge of all 
of Canada's wartime production effort, had achieved almost 
legendary status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately there is an arrogance that sometimes comes with 
great ability, accomplishments and legendary status.  Howe was 
able and accomplished and he knew it. As the czar of Canada's 
wartime production effort, he was used to getting his way.  He 
was impatient with anybody and anything that got in his way and 
particularly got in the way of any of his pet projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The project which preoccupied him in the mid-1950s was a massive 
pipeline project, the great Trans-Canada pipeline that would 
carry natural gas in huge volumes from western Canada, 
particularly from my home province of Alberta, into the energy 
thirsty markets of Ontario and the American mid-west. My father 
was very much involved, as premier of Alberta, in this project 
and I know this story from the inside out, not just from reading 
books. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A $1 million boondoggle in connection with that project was 
brought to the attention of the great man, C.D. Howe, in the 
House by the official opposition.  Rather than acknowledge the 
million dollar boondoggle and deal with it, in his arrogance, an 
arrogance rooted admittedly in ability and accomplishment, an 
arrogance which by then infected the entire government, C.D. Howe 
dismissed the charge with his infamous line “What's a 
million?”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was that display of arrogance that marked the beginning of 
the end of that Liberal administration.  The public had just 
about had enough and “What's a million taxpayers dollars?” from 
C.D. Howe was the straw that broke the camel's back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another type of arrogance, an arrogance that is also 
offensive and repugnant to the public.  But because it has no 
roots in ability and accomplishment, the public find it even more 
incomprehensible and insufferable.  This is the arrogance of 
people and governments who are neither particularly able nor 
accomplished but find themselves in positions of great power and 
influence anyway.  Their power and influence is largely 
inherited. 
It is built on the abilities and accomplishments of others, of 
their predecessors.  They enjoy safe seats, not so much for what 
they have done but because of what others before them have done. 
They fall into power, not because of their abilities or powers of 
persuasion but because they were at the right spot at the right 
time when somebody else stumbled.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such administrations do not appreciate the limits of their own 
abilities and accomplishments.  They have nothing to be arrogant 
about, as Churchill observed, but they are arrogant anyway.  It 
is the arrogance of inherited position and the power that goes 
along with it.  It is like the arrogance that afflicted the old 
monarchies and aristocracies of Europe who believed in the divine 
right of kings, who believed they had a divine right to govern 
regardless of ability, accomplishment or the impact of what they 
were doing on their own people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the arrogance of a Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, 
lounging around the water fountain at Versailles, completely out 
of touch with the needs of their people but lording it over them 
anyway.  In that arrogance of inherited power, responding to the 
news that the people of Paris have no bread by saying “let them 
eat cake”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To draw a more contemporary analogy, it is the arrogance of King 
Jean I and the member from Grantford lounging around the fountain 
at Shawinigan, completely out of touch with Canadians but lording 
it over them nonetheless.  And in that arrogance, responding to 
the news that the people want real jobs and real accountability 
for taxpayer dollars by saying “let them eat pork”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its arrogance and the mistaken belief that it is governments 
that create jobs, this Liberal administration has conceived a 
pipeline project.  Not a magnificent nation-building project like 
the CPR and the Trans-Canada pipeline, but a tawdry politically 
inspired project to pipe federal government slush funds into 
every Liberal riding, with subsidiary lines into every other 
riding where there is a possibility of buying votes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This time, not a million dollar boondoggle but a billion dollar 
boondoggle, has been brought to the attention of the House by the 
official opposition with the help of the media and the auditors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the House, the minister, who is supposedly responsible, and 
the Prime Minister arrogantly deny that a problem exists, and 
when the denial fails to calm the storm, the same Prime Minister 
arrogantly seeks to dismiss the problem by reducing it from a 
billion dollar boondoggle to $250.  When that does not work, the 
same Prime Minister arrogantly seeks to justify the billion 
dollar boondoggle by maintaining that a Liberal inspired pipeline 
to distribute patronage tainted pork is acceptable as long as it 
winds its way through every federal constituency in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To top it all off, as the supreme act of arrogance—and this is 
the feeling that came to me in the lockup when I went through 
those budget papers yesterday—the finance minister, who is 
supposed to be responsible to parliament and the people of Canada 
for the prudent use of taxpayer money, has the unmitigated gall 
to present a budget statement to the House which seeks 
authorization to collect and spend billions more of taxpayer 
dollars while totally ignoring the gross mismanagement of 
taxpayer dollars already entrusted to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, in a supreme act of arrogance, the finance 
minister presents a budget which, by its glaring omission of the 
issue of the day, says to the House and to the taxpayers not 
“What's a million?” but “What's a billion?”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is that arrogance, not the boondoggle itself, which is bad 
enough, but that arrogance of inherited position and power 
reflected in the misguided belief that the Liberal Party has some 
divine right to govern without any obligation to account for its 
failures or abuses of the public trust.  It is that arrogance 
which when apprehended by the public will mark the beginning of 
the end for this administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is that arrogance which demands that the House respond to 
this budget, not with fawning approval but by adopting the 
amendment which I now place before the House.  I move: 
<A NAME="LINK57">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by replacing all the words after the 
word “That” with the following:  “the House of Commons rejects 
the government's budget statement because it totally ignores the 
gross mismanagement of grants and contributions by the Human 
Resources Development Department, and continues the tradition of 
hidden tax hikes and boondoggle-prone spending that denies 
Canadians real tax relief”.

<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday was a great disappointment for me.  The heart on my 
lapel is not a delayed celebration of Valentine's Day; it is for 
the community groups, the people working on behalf of welfare 
recipients, people without proper housing and others who are 
getting a dirty deal.  A dirty deal particularly because the 
Minister of Finance has neglected them year after year, for 
seven years now, in his budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For some time, particularly in the last two and one-half years, 
the Minister of Finance has had surplus money coming out of his 
ears, but there has been not one measure to meet the needs of 
the least advantaged members of our society. 
Every year, an alarm is raised about the increase in poverty, in 
Quebec and in Canada, a cry from the heart coming particularly 
from community groups and the Front des assistés sociaux in 
particular.  There is absolutely nothing in the budget to help 
them.  There is no great source of pride to be found in 
discussing the budget of the Minister of Finance this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the social point of view, this budget is a total 
disappointment, with the possible exception of the Canadian 
social transfer, which is intended to fund health, post-secondary 
education and welfare, and which will be $2.5 billion over the 
next five years.  That averages out at $600 million a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to re-establish the Canadian social transfer, which has 
been cut systematically every year since 1995, what he would 
have needed to announce, starting this year, is a reinvestment 
of $4.2 billion in the social transfer to the provinces.  This 
would make it possible to meet the needs of those left lying on 
stretchers thanks to the Minister of Finance. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1120"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of that, the Minister of Finance preferred using his 
surpluses for other purposes by ignoring the needs of Quebecers 
and Canadians, sick people and students, and by ignoring the 
broad consensus achieved at two consecutive premiers' meetings. 
On these occasions, the premiers asked that the Canada social 
transfer be restored to its original level, that is before the 
Minister of Finance began making deep, drastic cuts and gaining 
popularity, thanks to the surpluses coming out of his ears. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that regard, the budget is a big disappointment. 
It is also disappointing to hear the Minister of Finance and his 
officials telling us, as usual, that, compared to 1993, there is 
more money in the social transfer for health care, post-secondary 
education and social assistance, and that they are taking into 
consideration the tax points given to the provinces, and Quebec 
in particular, at the end of the sixties, to correct a situation 
that was persisting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That situation was the following. In response to the war effort, 
the federal government had borrowed the provinces' fiscal 
capacities, including income tax. The provinces, including 
Quebec, were given back through tax points the tax field 
borrowed from them in support of the war effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax points have been in use for a long time. They do not take 
anything away from Ottawa and they are not even recorded as a 
type of expenditure or revenue for the federal government. 
It is like asking the former owner of a house sold thirty years 
ago to fix the roof.  In other words, it is no longer any of the 
Minister of Finance's business.  It is not federal money but old 
tax points given away over thirty years ago.  It is none of his 
business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What should grab our attention is the government's cuts to cash 
transfers.  By 2003 it will have cut around $31 billion in 
transfers to the provinces for health, post-secondary education 
and social assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are not small amounts of money.  This year alone, the 
Government of Quebec is out $1.7 billion.  This money could be 
used to hire 3,500 additional doctors and 4,500 nurses this 
year, as well as to invest $350 million in the education sector 
and over $350 million, close to $400 million, in income security. 
This is an extra $40 a month in the pockets of recipients, which 
they are not getting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have people coming into our riding offices who are short $40 
at the end of the month to make ends meet, to be able to feed 
themselves and their children.  The Minister of Finance has 
decided to turn a deaf ear to the pleas from those on social 
assistance and the least well off members of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second big disappointment concerned employment insurance.  We 
thought, or we would have thought, that the Minister of Finance 
had his heart in the right place.  But it is now clear that the 
Minister of Finance is heartless because six out of ten 
unemployed individuals do not qualify for EI and are left on the 
sidelines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance announced yesterday that even over five 
years and despite the fantastic surpluses in the employment 
insurance fund, which the government has not contributed to for 
a number of years, there will be no improvement in the 
employment insurance fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, I heard the messengers of the Minister of Finance 
playing the “there will be parental leave, a great improvement” 
tape again.  They said the parental leave provided by the 
government from the employment insurance fund will be twice as 
long as what the Government of Quebec planned to offer pregnant 
women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, the Minister of Finance had management, unions and 
communities in Quebec saying unanimously that the measure 
proposed was so much showing off, for appearance purposes, an 
improvement on an empty measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, half of the pregnant women will not benefit from this 
plan, because they will not be employment insurance claimants. 
Some will be unable to take advantage of this, because the plan 
covers only 55% of these women's salary.  Drawing only 55% of 
one's salary over a year makes no sense.  Even though the length 
of the program proposed by the Government of Quebec was shorter, 
the benefits were greater, as was the coverage.  In fact, the 
Government of Quebec intended to provide coverage for 
self-employed women as well.

that it is trying to win people over, trying to present people 
with window dressing.  On the surface, that is all very well, 
but when thinking people scratch beneath that surface—and I think 
that the intelligence of Quebecers must not be 
underestimated—they find there is nothing underneath. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's treatment of social housing is a real scandal. 
That sector has had an injection of $58 million. 
Everyone in Quebec and in the rest of Canada has said that, 
right now, the minimum investment required Canada-wide to create 
a minimum of new social housing in order to partially meet the 
requirements of the most disadvantaged in our communities, who 
are paying more than 50% of their income for accommodation, 
would be $1.7 billion, not $58 million.  That would not be enough 
to build even half an entranceway.  This is truly scandalous. 
The Minister of Finance has not heeded the heartfelt cries of 
those in need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I turn now to the tax cuts.  The Minister of Finance is a great 
showman, and it is not the first time he puts on a show for us 
but closer scrutiny reveals it is all smoke and mirrors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do, however, have the honesty to applaud the full indexation 
of the tax tables and the tax structure in general.  Why? 
Because we have been pestering the government, pressuring it, 
for seven years— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Considering the importance of the issue, could you check to see 
if we have a quorum? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>And the count having been taken:</I> 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I see a quorum. The hon. member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot may continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, we applauded the full indexation 
of tax tables, and we continue to do so, because the Bloc 
Quebecois has been fighting for seven years to convince this 
government to end this tax injustice whereby, for 14 years now, 
taxpayers have been paying an extra $3 billion in taxes every 
year. Indeed, without any announcement from the Minister of 
Finance about tax rate increases, the minister was collecting at 
least $3 billion per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We condemned this injustice. In 1995 we even tabled a report 
proposing a reform of the personal income tax system. In that 
report, our first recommendation to the government was the full 
indexation of tax tables to end this systematic robbing of 
taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seven years and $17 billion later—because the federal government's 
inaction has cost taxpayers $17 billion—the government finally 
decided to index tax tables. Let us render unto Caesar what is 
Caesar's. Had it not been for the Bloc Quebecois, no one here 
would have talked about full indexation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year the Minister of Finance would probably have announced 
a $2 billion tax reduction without changing anything to the tax 
structure. In the end, he would have given $2 billion to 
taxpayers while at the same time taking back between $3 and 
$5 billion through the back door. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is thanks to the Bloc Quebecois, the only party in this House 
to raise the issue, if this long term adjustment has been made 
and if, over the coming years, we will be seeing real tax 
reductions, not disguised ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where are the tax cuts that everyone is calling for this 
year?  There are none, or almost none.  The most that the 
government has done is to freeze people's taxes at the same 
level as last year.  That is it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next year there will be minimal tax cuts.  I will give a few 
examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be no tax savings at all for a family of two adults 
and two children with an income of $20,000. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1130"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a single income family of two adults and two children earning 
$35,000, the real tax saving this year will be zero. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a single income family of two adults and two children earning 
$65,000, the tax saving this year will be $700—less than $60 a 
month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the lucky friends of the Minister of Finance and of all his 
colleagues, the folks who earn $250,000 and up, are the real 
winners this year.  Their savings will be $4,796.43. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So much for tax relief. 
As usual, the Minister of Finance makes sure that these tax cuts 
are for those whose income is $250,000 or more this year.  Next 
year it will not be all that different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With full indexing, the tax cuts will happen, but mainly four or 
five years from now.  In my opinion, those tax cuts need looking 
into more closely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance gave us an interesting show yesterday, 
but if we scratch the surface, we can see that the Minister of 
Finance is an expert at making things look good. However, when 
the time comes to take really effective measures, he will 
certainly not be the one to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now for agriculture. 
This is a particularly important sector and one which has in 
recent years been hit with considerable cuts in the successive 
budgets of the Minister of Finance, particularly the cuts to 
subsidies and the measures aimed at the farmers of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After six budgets in which there have been more than 
proportional cuts in the federal agriculture and agri-food 
budget, it seems to me that it would have been a good idea for 
there to have been a little help this year for Quebec farmers in 
the form of subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is all the more important, crucial even, because of the 
impasse in the WTO, where there are no longer any discussions 
about subsidy levels in the United States and Europe, and our 
international competitors receive two or three times what the 
agricultural producers of Quebec do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can there be competition against people who are being 
subsidized up to three times as much as we are?  He ought to 
have restored some of the agricultural subsidies so as to enable 
that sector to be a front-runner on the international level, 
despite this inequity on the international level.  He did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone deplores this now, particularly the president of the 
Union des producteurs agricoles, who said that agriculture had 
been completely ignored in the budget. When agriculture was 
mentioned in the past six years, it was always to announce bad 
news, such as the elimination of certain benefits that had been 
in place until then. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to mention infrastructures. There is unanimity 
against the minister. Again, in today's newspapers, we can see 
that all those who fought for a real infrastructure program to 
construct roads, and for other types of infrastructures, 
particularly municipal infrastructures, will be very 
disappointed. Some of them already are this morning, but those 
who were expecting more from the federal government will be even 
more disappointed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some claim that the opposition can say anything, that its 
members are not taking into account the need to achieve fiscal 
balance, etc. This is not true. Whenever the Bloc Quebecois has 
made proposals, it has always kept in mind the need for fiscal 
balance and sound management of public finances. The same cannot 
be said of the government opposite, given what is going on at 
the Department of Human Resources Development, including the 
scandal about the lost billion, the possibility of bribes here 
and there and the largesse toward friends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We redid the forecasts by taking into account the evolution of 
the economy over the past three months and the most recent major 
criteria for economic forecasts.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recalculated the Minister of Finance's surplus forecasts for 
the next five years and discovered that there will be not $95.5 
billion in surplus, but more nearly $140 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the Minister of Finance we are used to errors in 
forecasting verging on 100%.  Three months ago, he presented his 
economic statement. He forecast a surplus for 1999-00, that is, 
the fiscal year ending March 31, of $5 billion. Yesterday, in 
the budget, the surplus had reached $7.5 billion.  In two months 
and a half, he erred by 21%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is worse to come.  Yesterday, at the time of the budget, I 
took out his own department's latest financial review.  In the 
first nine months of the current fiscal year, the surplus was 
already over $10.9 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance has a real problem.  Either he does not 
know how to count or he does not know how to estimate or he does 
not know how to manage or he does not know what is happening in 
his own department, since the figures he gave yesterday, those 
of two and a half months ago and those of the same day in the 
financial review vary between 21% and 50%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that the Minister of Finance manipulates figures. 
He is a great manipulator.  I will not use any unparliamentary 
language, but we need only look at page 20, first column, table 
1.2 of his budget plan 2000.  It provides for spending in 2000-01 
of $4.4 billion he committed in 1999-00. 
Already we have $4.4 billion that will be spent later on showing 
up in this year's figures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does he do this?  To mislead everyone.  He talked about a $5 
billion surplus.  He realizes that the actual figure will be in 
excess of $12 billion.  He adds $4.4 billion to this year's 
figures that will be spent the following year.  He reduces this 
fiscal's real surplus of $12 billion by a corresponding amount. 
At the end of the year, he will crow that he was right on the 
mark. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is really too bad that we are treated to this sort of sleight 
of hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also could have brought in tax reform.  That is what he did 
for individual taxpayers, but we encouraged him to do so for 
corporations.  He did not follow our advice.  Large corporations 
are carrying forward far too much in unpaid taxes. 
The amounts involved are not small.  Year after year, profitable 
corporations carry forward over $45 billion in taxes they owe 
Revenue Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will mention just one, Bell Canada Entreprises, which has been 
in the news in recent days, which will acquire CTV at a cost of 
$2.3 billion.  This is approximately what BCE owes the federal 
government in unpaid taxes carried forward.  Another example is 
Bell Canada, which owes $2.1 billion.  Seagram owes over $2 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seagram and BCE taken together represent enough in unpaid taxes 
to restore the Canada social transfer, to be able to invest in 
health and postsecondary education and help the poorest members 
of society.  But the Minister of Finance does nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are keeping our eye on him for the rest of this government's 
term of office in order to see that he introduces this reform, 
that he stops arranging things to suit his little millionaire 
friends, that he gives a thought to the most disadvantaged and 
listens to people's pleas.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The amendment to the amendment is in order. 
The debate is on the amendment to the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to begin by saying that it is a great 
pity that Canadians listening to this debate do not have an 
accurate picture of budget 2000. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard some speakers who are mired in the past and 
speakers who are speaking half-truths.  For example, on the 
question of taxation we heard about examples from previous years, 
but did the speaker talk about what this budget actually delivers 
for Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give some examples.  A one earner family of four with an 
income of $60,000 will see its taxes go down by 24%. Did we hear 
that?  I do not recall hearing it. The elimination of the 5% 
deficit reduction tax on income of up to about $85,000 will help 
middle income Canadians.  Did we hear that?  I did not hear that. 
A one earner family of four earning $40,000 will see its net 
personal income taxes reduced by 48%.  Forty-eight per cent.  I 
did not hear that in this Chamber just a few moments ago. A two 
earner family of four with an income of $60,000 will see its net 
income taxes reduced by 27%.  Twenty-seven per cent.  These are 
the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about transfers, the budget fully restores health 
and social transfers to the provinces.  In fact, it moves them to 
new levels of $30 billion annually.  With the equalization 
payments, it moves to $40 billion annually being transferred to 
the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no secret that the province of Quebec certainly with 
respect to equalization payments receives the lion's share. The 
Quebec government receives close to $5 billion in equalization 
payments. The CHST has fully restored the funding on the 
transfers for health, education and welfare. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the Bloc Quebecois member would make a small comment 
on transfers.  Does he have any exact figures, or is this a sort 
of make-believe story? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, we are going to talk of reality, 
not the inflated statements on the Minister of Finance's tape, 
as replayed by his parliamentary secretary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he want to know about tax savings?  A family of two adults 
and one child, with a single income of $65,000, will save $700 
this year, which is barely $60 a month.  That is a lot, is it 
not, $15 a week? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taking the same family of two adults and one child, but with two 
incomes totalling $65,000, they will save $250 this year.  Wow. 
Some tax cut. This is wonderful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I had had the time earlier, I would have also talked about 
the inflexibility of the federal tax system as far as Quebec is 
concerned.  I will give some examples, if I may.  Quebec gives 
tax credits for shipbuilding, but they are then taxed by Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also inflexibility as far as deducting student loan 
interest is concerned. 
Since student debt load in Quebec is less than in the rest of 
Canada, our province is not getting its share regarding that tax 
deduction. This is an example of the inflexibility of the 
federal tax system.

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the deduction for daycare costs. Everyone wants to 
copy Quebec's $5 a day daycare program, but the federal 
government has turned a deaf ear when it comes to making the 
necessary tax adjustments. Some families in Quebec will lose tax 
deductions, because they are claiming less in daycare expenses 
from the federal government. The tab is $70 million. 
I could have talked about this inflexibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, it was announced—and I would have done it earlier if I 
had had the time—that the super deduction for research and 
development the Quebec government—through the Minister of 
Finance, Bernard Landry—had announced in its budget last year, a 
measure similar to what has been done in Ontario for ten years 
with the hundreds of millions received by Ontario businesses 
through federal deductions for research and development, is 
quite simply a thing of the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Businesses did not even have six months to take advantage of 
that deduction, while Ontario companies had ten years to benefit 
from the hundreds of millions of dollars given by the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To those who claim that federalism is beneficial to 
Quebec, I say think again. It was demonstrated again yesterday 
that when Quebec has a good idea, Ottawa turns a deaf ear, 
because the Quebec government would look too good. 
When there is a measure that is good for economic growth, the 
government scraps it, as it did with the excellent Quebec 
research and development deduction.  That is what is meant by 
federal flexibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am tired of hearing about transfer payments being at the same 
level as in 1993.  That is not the case.  They are lumping cash 
transfers and tax points together.  Tax points were transferred 
in the late 1960s.  We wish the government would quit trotting 
out this tired old refrain.  No one takes it seriously any more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth is that provincial governments are out $4.2 billion 
every year, and the Government of Quebec is facing a $1.7 billion 
shortfall in health care funding. 
It is the fault of the federal government that people wait so 
long in emergency rooms and on surgery lists.  It is the fault 
of the federal government that hospitals are closing, because, 
by 2003, it will have cut transfer payments for health, 
post-secondary education and social assistance by $31 billion. 
Members opposite should stop obediently playing the same old 
tapes, and the government should do its job. 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I obviously 
fully support the remarks by my colleague from 
Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot on the economic and social consequences 
of the budget presented yesterday by the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have in my hand an article published today in <I>Le Droit</I>. I 
think with my colleague's expertise we have a good idea how 
federalism is cost effective in Quebec.  The article concludes 
by saying: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even with the natural increase in the performance of the tax 
points, Ottawa's total contribution has increased from $30 
billion to $32 billion in ten years, a miserable increase of .06% a year. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It then says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all, with all transfer payments combined, for each Quebecer, 
cost effective federalism is $1,566 as compared to $1,600 when 
Robert Bourassa left politics ten years ago. This does not 
warrant a speech by the current Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask my colleague if he agrees with these remarks and if 
he can tell us in greater detail how the current budget will 
impoverish Quebec further this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from 
Lotbinière.  What he has just said is quite right.  I will 
simply take one cut to show that Quebec is doing more than its 
share in absorbing cuts and is therefore poorer than the other 
provinces in Canada as the result of the actions by the Minister 
of Finance. Let us consider the cuts decreed in the 1995 budget 
in the Canada social transfer, with which, it must be 
remembered, Quebec was to fund health care, post-secondary 
education and social assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The plan for the cuts, which began in 1995 and will conclude in 
2003, will mean that Quebec alone will suffer of some $16 
billion of the $31 billion in cuts decreed by the Minister of 
Finance.  This is over 50% of the cuts.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec is going to suffer 50% of the cuts to the social 
transfer, while it represents only 24.5% of the Canadian 
population.  Is this fair?  Is this equitable?  Absolutely not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at R and D expenditures—this should be heeded by those 
subservient Liberals from Quebec across the way, because we have 
been saying this for 20 years over and over, and they still 
haven't got it—we have not received our fair share of federal 
government goods and services expenditures and structuring 
expenditures.  We are $2.5 billion in the hole every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Telling us that this system represents enrichment for Quebec 
is false. 
My colleague from Lotbinière has done well to raise this aspect 
of the question. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know that 
Quebec has a very large northern region and I was wondering if 
the member would elaborate on how devastating this budget is when 
it comes to health care in northern areas that depends on 
Medivac. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, by not restoring the transfer 
payments via the Canadian social transfer to their 1993 levels, 
the people whom the hon. member represents will be hard hit, 
because it is already experiencing problems with health care 
funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the population growth that region is undergoing, the needs 
are becoming more and more urgent and pressing.  The Minister of 
Finance has decided to keep the people of the Northwest 
Territories and the Yukon waiting once more, as he has for the 
past two and a half years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must not be forgotten that the surplus started two and a half 
years ago, and the Minister of Finance has managed so far to 
avoid any debate on its allocation, by concealing and disguising 
it, as he has again this year. 
We must not believe that the surplus will be $5 billion, as he 
has announced.  It will be $12 billion instead, this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He could, therefore, have done far more to improve the health 
sector in the hon. member's riding and elsewhere, but has 
decided not to.  At best, he is going to invest $2.5 billion, 
but over the next five years, so that will be $500 million 
yearly.  This figure represents about 12% of annual 
requirements, according to the figures given by the provincial 
premiers and territorial leaders. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to say a few words on this very important budget 
debate today.  I remember the Minister of Finance in London last 
fall saying in his financial update that we were into the age of 
a surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we get into the age of a surplus we can start looking at 
the values of a society in terms of where we want to invest our 
money and in terms of the new fiscal dividend.  It is a new era. 
It is a new age.  It is a new chapter in terms of where the 
country wants to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of that I looked forward to this budget with a great 
deal of interest as the dawning of a new age, a new era, a new 
direction for Canada.  Because we have turned the deficit corner 
what would the fiscal dividend be used for? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We listened to the Canadian people and we heard a great deal of 
optimism about reinvesting in people, health care, education, a 
children's agenda and the farm crisis, all kinds of things for 
ordinary people and bringing down some taxes that affect them 
such as the GST, bracket creep and others as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we go back to 1995 we notice that the fight against the 
deficit was carried out by a radical slashing of social programs, 
the most radical slashing we have ever had in Canada.  It was 
much more radical than any Conservative government under Brian 
Mulroney or John Diefenbaker or any other Tory in the history of 
the country had ever done.  The Minister of Finance slashed and 
burned social programs in Canada to the point where social 
programs such as health care are in jeopardy today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then came last night.  Last night the minister rose in the House 
to present his budget.  I thought for a while I had a health 
problem.  I thought I had a hearing problem.  I kept hearing the 
Leader of the Opposition but I kept seeing the Minister of 
Finance.  I checked with my colleague from Kamloops and he was 
adjusting his glasses.  He was looking around.  He saw the 
Minister of Finance but he thought he was hearing the Leader of 
the Opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we had last night was a very important paradigm shift by 
the government, moving in a sharply conservative direction from 
the past history of Canada, from the past history of the Liberal 
Party. 
We had a very conservative tax cutting budget.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I checked more closely and watched the Leader of the Opposition. 
He was embarrassed.  He was blushing.  He looked very red in the 
face because what the Minister of Finance was saying remained the 
things the Leader of the Opposition had been advocating for the 
last two or three years.  Meanwhile the Minister of Finance was 
boasting and bragging about the new direction in which the 
country was going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A friend of mine has some very appropriate buttons.  I should 
not mention another member's name in the House but I can read 
what the button says:  “Paul Martin for UA leader.  Paul Martin 
for leader of the United Alternative”.  The Leader of the 
Opposition may have competition for the leadership of a new 
conservative party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have seen very importantly is a paradigm shift.  We had 
the deficit fought on the back of social programs.  We expected 
that once we got to a surplus position the social programs would 
be reimbursed, that health care would be reimbursed, that 
education would be reimbursed, and that people who had paid for 
the fight against the deficit would all of a sudden get the 
positive result of a fiscal dividend.  However the opposite 
happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have the smallest government we have seen in the country 
since 1949-50 in terms of government spending and government 
programs.  The 2000-01 fiscal year spending on government 
programs will amount to 11.6% of the GDP.  That is down some 5.3% 
from 1992-93 when government spending was 17.5% of the GDP in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Investment in government programs has dropped by $4 billion 
since 1993-94, the year Brian Mulroney left office and the 
current Prime Minister came into office.  In the budget speech 
the government boasts about this radical downsizing of the public 
sector and federal government programs.  That is a drop of $4 
billion at a time when inflation is gradually increasing costs, 
when government revenues are going up and when the affordability 
is there to expand government programs for health care, 
education, homelessness and farmers.  There is a cutback of $4 
billion in terms of government programs which help ordinary 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a shift in values.  I ask where those good old time 
Liberals are, the Lester Pearsons.  After its start in 
Saskatchewan he started a national health care program that 
brought in the Canada pension plan.  Where is Pierre Trudeau? 
Where is Paul Martin Senior, the national father of many of our 
social programs who boasted about building social programs and 
expanding them when they became affordable?  Where are those old 
time Liberals? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the House today many Liberals are hanging their heads in 
shame as they think back to the legacy of the Liberal Party which 
tried to build some social programs and to invest in government 
policies.  Those programs are now gone.  Where have they gone? 
Some of them are in the Senate.  Others have just gone out of 
politics, but where is the legacy of the old Liberal Party? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had a radical downsize like we have never had before in 
terms of government programs and social programs.  Instead of 
spending about 75% in terms of health care, education, the farm 
crisis, children and senior citizens, in the budget for fiscal 
year 2000-01 about 25% of the surplus is going into these 
programs and 75% will go into tax cutting and cutting back on the 
national debt.  It is exactly the other way around to the way the 
priorities should be.  We should be reinvesting in people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to look at some of the interesting facts.  In the next 
four years they are projecting tax cuts of $58 billion.  The 
spending on transfers to the provinces for post-secondary 
education, health care and other social services will be $2.5 
billion:  a billion this year, a half billion next year, a half 
billion the third year and a half billion the fourth year.  That 
is $58 billion for tax cuts and $2.5 billion for health and 
post-secondary education.  For every dollar that goes to cut 
taxes, some two pennies go into increases in health care.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does that mean? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two days ago I was visiting a person in the Pasqua Hospital in 
Regina.  I talked to some of the nurses about the crisis in and 
the shortage of health care.  No matter where we go, whether it 
is the Pasqua Hospital or any hospital in the country, we get the 
same story about health care being in crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government in the days of Paul Martin Sr. and Lester 
Pearson funded health care on a 50-50 basis with the provinces. 
What is it today?  Today, under the son of Paul Martin Sr., about 
13 cents or 14 cents on the dollar comes from the federal 
government, depending on the province.  It is no wonder that 
Liberals hang their heads in shame in the House today with this 
kind of track record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does it mean in my province of Saskatchewan?  Over the next 
four years this $2.5 billion will mean $80 million to the 
province of Saskatchewan.  That is enough to fund health care for 
one day, two days or three days in those four years.  I suspect 
it will be the same in Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia or 
any of the smaller provinces in the country.  That is what the 
Liberal Party is giving us, funding for health care for an extra 
three days in the province of Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact the effects of this budget will be even worse in 
Saskatchewan.  Because of the changes in the tax system our 
province will be at a net loss in terms of what it receives in 
transfers from the federal government.  There will be an extra 
$80 million in transfers, but a loss when it comes to the change 
in the tax system because our tax system, except for Quebec, is 
piggy-backed on the federal tax system.  It is no wonder there is 
a great deal of shame across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Years ago the Liberal Party would boast about the role of 
government and the public sector in building a strong network of 
social programs to help Canadians who need help.  The Liberals 
are now changing on a dime.  They are intimidated by the Leader 
of the Opposition, intimidated by the Reform Party.  They have 
slashed $4 billion from government spending since they took 
office from former Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no wonder the Canadian Medical Association is saying that 
there is not enough money in the budget for health care.  It is 
no wonder the people are worried about an American style of 
health care, two tier health care coming into the country.  What 
the Minister of Finance did last night was open the floodgates to 
the possibility of the American style of two tier medicine.  The 
federal government is not paying its fair share of the cost.  At 
13 cents or 14 cents on the dollar, when it used to be 50 cents, 
the government is inviting the provinces, in particular Alberta, 
which has the cash, to implement a two tier system of health 
care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that in the United States 48 million 
Americans are not insured for health care.  They are mainly poor 
people, black people, people living in inner cities and people 
living in rural areas.  That is the kind of vision the Minister 
of Finance has in mind for Canada.  It is not the Canadian way. 
It does not reflect Canadian values.  It is not what Canadians 
are telling MPs from one end of the country to the other.  That 
is not the way we want to go in the New Democratic Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need more money for health care.  We need more money for 
education.  We need more money to invest in ordinary people and 
in services for people.  That did not happen last night.  Last 
night there was a shift in the values of the Liberal Party, which 
is adopting the agenda of the Reform Party.  That is why the 
Leader of the Opposition was blushing.  He did not know what to 
say. All he could talk about last night in front of the cameras 
was HRDC and how the government had spent money in those programs 
over the last two or three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I turn for a moment to education and the children's agenda.  A 
number of months ago the Prime Minister spoke of a children's 
agenda.  Where is that children's agenda?  It is not there. Where 
is the extra money for education?  The extra money, except for a 
small portion of that $2.5 billion over four years, is not there. 
It is not there at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to build a stronger country and a more competitive 
country, if we are concerned about the so-called brain drain, 
then the place where we should start investing immediately is in 
the children's agenda, in child care, in early childhood 
development and in post-secondary education so that we can invest 
in human resources, training and education to create in the 
future a workforce that is second to none in the world and one 
which will build this country into a strong country in the next 
century.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the vision and that is the direction in which we should 
go.  Instead, the income gap is widening.  There are more and 
more people living in poverty.  There are more and more kids 
living in poverty, more and more kids without opportunities some 
10 years after we passed a resolution to eradicate child poverty 
by the end of the last century.  Now we have the money.  Now we 
have the surplus.  What does the Liberal government do?  It 
decreases spending in proportion to our GDP rather than increase 
it.  It is the agenda of the Leader of the Opposition and members 
of the Reform Party.  They have intimidated the Liberal Party, 
which has responded in kind by bringing in their agenda, which is 
not the way that Canadians want to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak about the farm crisis.  We have the worst 
crisis in the farming sector in Saskatchewan and Manitoba since 
the 1930s.  We have had protests.  We have had people being 
forced off the land.  We have had bankruptcies.  We have farm 
stress. We have had people committing suicide.  We have had 
people on hunger strikes.  We have had tractor demonstrations. 
We have had questions put by members of this party in the House 
of Commons for the last year.  We have had delegations led by 
Premier Romanow and Premier Doer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all the protest, the lobbying and the questioning that is 
going on, what did we get from the federal government?  We got a 
measly $240 million last week, when all the major farm 
organizations in the prairies were saying that they need a 
minimum of $1.3 billion for Saskatchewan and Manitoba if they are 
to survive, seed crops next year and the year after and maintain 
the family farm.  That is all they got.  There was nothing added 
in the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last night there was nothing in the budget about a long term 
farm program, which prairie farmers are saying should be based on 
the cost of production.  That would give them some guarantee that 
they would get back at least their costs and a decent income in 
the years that lie ahead.  Where was that vision?  That vision 
was not there, despite the fact that European farmers are being 
subsidized to the tune of 56 cents on the dollar by the treasury 
in Brussels and American farmers are subsidized by 38 cents on 
the dollar, while our Canadian farmers get 9 cents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Agriculture has taken the biggest hit next to social programs 
from the Minister of Finance and the Liberal government with the 
elimination of farm support programs and the Crow rate over the 
last few years.  Now that we have a fiscal surplus, what is there 
for farmers?  Mere peanuts for farmers and nothing in terms of a 
long term vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a paradigm shift in Canadian politics.  We are seeing 
the Liberal Party shift to the right and adopt the agenda of the 
Reform Party in terms of fiscal conservatism, in terms of the law 
of the jungle and people having to make it on their own in terms 
of the marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not matter where we look.  Take, for example, the CBC. 
There was not a penny last night for the CBC.  There was very 
little for arts in terms of a vision for our country, taking our 
country back and standing for Canada and our identity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was very little for international development in terms of 
playing a role in the third world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was nothing for parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to mention taxation.  There were some good things done in 
terms of indexing the taxation system and increasing the basic 
exemption.  After our party has been pushing, year in and year 
out, for a fair and progressive move for the ordinary Canadian 
citizen, the Liberals finally listened to this party and to the 
Canadian people and indexed the taxation system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time they had to throw something to their wealthy 
friends.  They are going to change the capital gains system so 
that instead of being taxed on 75% of capital gains, people will 
be taxed on only two-thirds of their capital gains.  Someone who 
is a wealthy person and makes $200,000, $300,000 or $400,000 a 
year in capital gains will get a major tax break compared to the 
ordinary citizen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same with RRSPs.  We can now invest 20% of our RRSPs 
in foreign markets.  That is a considerable expenditure by 
ordinary Canadians, amounting to billions of dollars a year.  Now 
the government, despite what the Canadian people are saying, 
wants to increase that to 25% and then to 30%.  The taxpayers of 
this country are subsidizing people to invest in the economies of 
the United States, Asia or Europe, and yet it is the taxpayers' 
money.  These things are going in the wrong direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the remaining time that I have I want to put a bit of a human 
face on the budget that we saw last night.  We have been in touch 
with a few people this morning and we have heard different 
reactions to the budget.  For example, we spoke with John, who is 
a currency trader in Toronto.  He is one of those guys in red 
suspenders.  He was very happy last night.  In fact, this morning 
he had a bit of a hangover from popping all the champagne. 
He was happily toasting the Minister of Finance because he made 
$200,000 in capital gains.  With that kind of capital gains he 
will have an extra $8,000 in his pocket because of the change. 
It was not a bad budget for John.  It was no wonder he was 
popping the champagne and munching on caviar as he watched the 
Minister of Finance deliver a budget that was good for him 
because of the capital gains exemption.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also heard from Donna.  Donna is not like John.  Donna is a 
high school teacher.  She earns $60,000 a year and comes from a 
one earner family of four.  Next year she will get a tax cut of 
$1,007.  By 2004 she will have a tax cut of $1,477.  What does 
this tax cut do in terms of lost services for Donna?  She has 
children in university.  She sees tuition fees going up, and yet 
there are no increased transfers for education and health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1990-91 the average arts tuition at the university where her 
son went was $1,496.  In 1999-2000 that tuition had gone up to 
$3,370, a hike of 125.9%.  The reason is that the federal 
government has not kept up its transfers to the provinces for 
post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have help from their friends in Ontario, like Mike 
Harris, whom they seem to worship nowadays.  By the way, Mike 
Harris increased spending on government programs at the same time 
that this government decreased spending.  We have a government 
that is even more Conservative than Mike Harris.  Donna is a net 
loser as a result of the budget of last night. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard from André, who is a student.  What is in the budget 
for him?  Nothing at all.  Tuition fees will not go down, they 
will go up.  There is nothing new in student loans for André. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard from a retired couple.  Milfred and David live in 
Kamloops.  They make $30,000 a year.  They will see their 
personal taxes reduced by $546 a year, or $1.50 a day.  Through 
the tremendous generosity of the Minister of Finance, by 2004 
they will be able to go to Tim Hortons to share a couple of cups 
of coffee, if they are small cups.  They would sooner see that 
money invested in the health care system and education for their 
grandchildren than in $1.50 to buy a cup of coffee at Tim 
Hortons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Doug is from my hometown of Wynyard.  He will make probably 
$2,000 or $3,000 next year.  He may get an $8,000 payment from 
the federal government.  He will not be paying any income tax. 
There is nothing in the budget for him.  There is nothing more 
for farmers.  There is nothing for their cost of production. 
There is nothing for him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget is very unfair in the way it treats ordinary people. 
We need a vision in which we invest in people, social programs 
and health care; not a budget and a government which governs for 
the wealthy.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I followed the comments made by my colleague from the 
NDP very closely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He forgot to mention that full indexation of personal income 
taxes will cost the government $6.3 billion, which will go to the 
taxpayers.  He never gave the government credit for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Headlines in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> read:  “$13.3 billion in 
additional spending will go mainly toward health care, research 
and education”.  The Winnipeg <I>Free Press</I> read:  “It's 
payback time:  Martin slashes $58 billion in taxes and puts an 
end to bracket creep”.  Further, former NDP MP, Doug Fisher, 
said: “Finance Minister Paul Martin knows the nation's financial 
situation has been improved under his stewardship”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other point I want to bring to his attention is that he 
mentioned that last week the federal government gave Saskatchewan 
and Manitoba $240 million.  Who is complaining?  The premier of 
Saskatchewan was very happy.  I do not know who speaks for 
Saskatchewan, the premier or the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I did mention 
indexation.  We have advocated full indexation for our taxation 
system for years.  I am glad the government has finally listened 
to the NDP and the ordinary people and has done something on the 
tax side which will help ordinary people in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concern I have is that at a time when the government should 
be investing in people, it is not doing that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Take a look at the government's budget books.  I will only refer 
to the budget in brief because the big budget might be a bit more 
complicated for the member across the way to go through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On page 18 of the budget in brief, we find that in the fiscal 
year 2000-01 the government spending initiative is to be $1.2 
billion.  Its tax cut initiatives are $3.5 billion.  It will set 
aside some $4 billion in terms of contingencies and prudence 
which will probably be spent on the national debt. In the next 
year 2001-02, spending will be $3.1 billion, tax cuts of some $7 
billion and it is setting aside $5 billion for the national debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see what its priorities and values are.  Its values are 
not investing in people, the health care system, education or the

<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to set the record straight. The member 
in his speech made some comments about the Reform Party's 
position on health care.  I point out to him and to anybody else 
who happened to hear those scurrilous statements that they were 
false and what follows is the truth on the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is, has been and I presume will be, a party 
that listens to the people.  We are a grassroots party.  From the 
beginning Canadians have told us by our own membership polls and 
other indicators that we have had from many public meetings that 
health care is priority number one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true it has always been our highest priority.  All one 
needs to do is to look at the literature.  Instead of simply 
spewing back what others have said about us incorrectly, look at 
the actual literature from our various campaigns.  Look at what 
we have actually proposed.  It has always been a high priority. 
We have a great commitment, contrary to what they are saying 
about us, to the health care system.  It is our number one 
priority. We would like to prop up and buy some more equipment 
for hospitals instead of fountains in Shawinigan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to put that on the record.  I do not know whether the 
member wants to comment on it or whether he has another 
scurrilous comment to make.  Unfortunately that is what happens 
in these debates but I wish he would simply stay with the truth 
and recognize that is what our party is about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I remember going to the 
Reform convention as an observer.  I heard them talk about tax 
cuts that amounted to $104 billion over five years when the 
federal Department of Finance was projecting a surplus of about 
$100 billion over five years.  Reform wanted to spend the entire 
surplus on tax cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If one is doing that, we are not even going to keep up to the 
increase in inflation in terms of health care and education.  We 
can see what kind of priority health care is for the Reform Party 
of Canada.  The other thing about the Reform Party of Canada is 
that it supports Ralph Klein in a two tier American style health 
care vision for our country.  The Reform Party of Canada stands 
for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want a single tier national health care system as 
supported and enunciated in the Canada Health Act. Our party and 
the Canadian people stand for that.  We want to fund the national 
medicare program.  We want to bring back federal funding. 
Canadians stand for that and the Reform Party stands on the 
opposite side of that.  It wants two tier American style 
medicare.  That is not what Canadians want. 
<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, is the 
hon. member from the NDP aware of what was brought down yesterday 
in the budget?  When it comes to the CHST, only 2% will be going 
into the total Atlantic region.  Ninety-eight per cent will go to 
central Canada and out west. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People back home put a think tank together. Our people will be 
hit extremely hard.  I will read what was said by the minister of 
finance back home in the province of New Brunswick. 
He said that there is an imbalance in the Canadian federation 
with Ottawa hoarding all the money while the provinces are left 
holding the bag on the country's most expensive program, health 
care. I want to say that when a province only gets 2%, it is not 
even coming up to the 1993 level.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very serious situation which must be addressed by both 
sides of the House.  Was the hon. member aware of that?  Are all 
my colleagues in the House aware of what took place here 
yesterday? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member of the 
Conservative Party makes an excellent point.  I am aware of it. 
I fully agree with her.  The premiers of Atlantic Canada, the 
Liberal premier and the three Tory premiers, have said the same 
thing as the two NDP premiers on the prairies, Romanow and Doer, 
that last night's budget will be a net loser in terms of 
transfers to the small provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my province alone, the transfer will be about $80 million for 
health care over four years.  That $80 million for health care, 
according to the premier in his comments this morning, is enough 
to keep the hospital system going for three days in Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is even worse than that when we factor in the tax changes. 
The tax systems in all of our provinces, and I am talking to the 
member from New Brunswick, are tied to the federal tax system. 
Because there are changes to the federal tax system, there will 
be tax losses in the smaller provinces.  The four smaller 
provinces in the Atlantic, Saskatchewan and Manitoba will be net 
losers as a result of the transfers that were announced by the 
Minister of Finance last night. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a really sad commentary when the smaller and poorer 
provinces are the net losers in terms of the transfers and social 
programs. It is about time we had a new vision that put people 
first, that invested in people first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is far more conservative than any Conservative 
government we ever had under Brian Mulroney or John Diefenbaker. 
We now have $4 billion less in terms of government programs than 
we had in 1992-93 despite the fact that the cost of living has 
gone up and despite the fact that government revenues have 
skyrocketed since 1992-93.  I commend the member for her

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>   Mr. Speaker, I got a letter from a constituent.  It 
says, “I appreciate that the Minister of Finance said that he 
has a significant surplus in this year's budget.  Did he not get 
this surplus by dipping into the EI fund, money that was set 
aside by employees and employers for people who lose their 
jobs?” What is my colleague's view on this question from my 
constituent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's 
constituent in Kamloops is absolutely right on.  The reason we 
have a surplus is that the EI fund has gone into surplus and that 
goes into the general revenues.  What should be happening is that 
the benefits should be expanded. Only about 35% of the people who 
are now unemployed qualify for benefits, under 30% of women and 
15% of young people.  We should expand the benefits like we used 
to have them a number of years ago. 
<P><A NAME="LINK68"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, last 
night when the finance minister introduced his seventh budget 
there was much anticipation about what the budget could do for 
the standard of living of Canadians, for the prosperity of all 
Canadians.  Canadians will be very disappointed with the budget 
once the dust has settled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been seven budgets, we could say seven deadly sins 
from the finance minister.  Again the missed opportunities of 
this budget will hold Canadians back when they should be rushing 
forward to seize the opportunities of the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is big on labels.  The 1998 budget was the 
education budget and the year after that, 12,000 graduates in 
Canada declared bankruptcy. The 1999 budget was the health care 
budget and over the past year, hospital waiting lists have 
continued to grow in Canada.  Canadians remain uncertain about 
the future of health care. They do not believe their health care 
system will be there when they need it.  That was the result of a 
health care budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year we have seen the tax cut budget.  Before this budget, 
we had the highest personal income tax rates in the G-7 and the 
second highest corporate tax rates in the OECD. 
Well, guess what?  After this budget we will have the highest 
personal tax rates in the G-7 and the second highest corporate 
taxes in the OECD.  There is no change because as we take these 
baby steps forward, other countries are taking gigantic leaps 
forward.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is working with a $150 billion surplus.  It says 
it is going to devote $58 billion over five years to tax 
reduction. It is including the elimination of bracket creep and 
the reindexing of tax brackets in that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is this is not a tax cut.  This is a cancellation of 
future tax increases.  To promote it as a tax cut is disingenuous 
at best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are pleased with the reindexing of tax brackets.  We have 
been calling for it for three years.  It was a deficit reduction 
measure and once the deficit was gone we wanted to see the tax 
brackets reindexed.  We are pleased that finally the government 
has taken a page out of our book on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this budget the government continues to look inward when it 
should be looking outward.  The government is ignoring the global 
realities that are occurring around Canada while bragging about 
progress within Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Progress within Canada frankly is in many ways irrelevant if we 
are simply comparing ourselves to our past performance. It has 
nothing to do with the reality of how we are going to build a 
stronger economy and increase the standard of living of all 
Canadians and the levels of opportunities for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this hypercompetitive global environment, we do not write the 
rules, but we ignore the rules at our own peril. Other countries 
have embraced these global realities earlier. In response to 
these global changes, our trading partners have pursued policies 
of lower taxes, less regulation and lower debt. The levels of 
growth have been striking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ireland's real GDP per capita growth has been 92% from 1988 to 
1999.  Corporate tax reductions helped in Ireland because it drew 
capital, entrepreneurs and investors to Ireland to create a 
greater level of economic growth. GDP per capita has increased in 
the U.S. during the same period of time by 18%, and in the U.K. 
and in Germany by 14%.  Yet in Canada our GDP per capita growth 
has only been 5% during the same period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are stagnating while other countries are progressing. While 
citizens in other countries are getting richer, in Canada we are 
getting poorer.  In the 1990s we have seen an 8% drop in our 
personal disposable income or take home pay in Canada.  During 
the same period, Americans have enjoyed a 10% increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this budget the government has opted for baby steps with 
regard to tax relief and tax reform.  The progress that Canadians 
expect to make as a result of this budget simply will not 
materialize because as we take these microsteps forward, other 
countries are rushing forward with much more visionary approaches 
and much more gigantic steps and leaps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians may gain some comfort from seeing the directional 
shift of the government on taxes.  However with the mobility of 
capital and the mobility of people that exist today, we cannot 
afford to be one nanosecond behind our trading competitors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It used to be that high taxes redistributed income.  In the 
current technologically driven global environment, high taxes 
redistribute people.  That is what we are seeing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps one of the most damning barometers of how we are doing 
is the unprecedented level of brain drain in this country.  Young 
people, in particular our best and brightest people, are leaving 
Canada to seek greater levels of opportunity elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over a 10 year period we have seen the number of Canadians 
seeking opportunities in the U.S. grow from 17,000 people per 
year to almost 100,000 people per year.  Some of our best and 
brightest, the types of people we need to build a stronger more 
productive society, are choosing to go elsewhere to seek greater 
levels of opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Capital gains taxes are a major contributor to the brain drain 
because increasingly, Canadians particularly in the high tech 
sector are compensated with stock options.  After this budget is 
fully implemented, effective capital gains rates will still be 
13% higher than the effective capital gains tax rates of the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would cost about $70 million to $80 million, not billion, per 
year for the government to equalize our capital gains tax regime 
with that of the U.S., but it is not doing it.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason why it is not doing it is that the government is 
dealing with perceptions.  It is not dealing with realities.  In 
reality, effectively oppressive capital gains tax regimes will 
continue to drive innovators out of Canada.  When we lose those 
innovators, when we lose that investment, we lose the jobs, the 
growth and the entrepreneurial energy that Canada needs to move 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our tax task force report tabled in January we were calling 
for a reduction of capital gains taxes in Canada to the U.S. 
effective levels by reducing our inclusion rate to 50%, not 66%. 
That step would have put us on a level playing field with the 
U.S. in the very important areas of capital gains and taxation. 
Unfortunately the government in its incrementalism has missed the 
boat again and as a result Canadian entrepreneurs will be held 
back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government also had an opportunity to adjust tax brackets to 
a more realistic level reflecting global realities. Unfortunately 
again it failed to do so.  Moving the top marginal tax bracket 
from $60,000 to $70,000 is a pathetic, tiny step in the right 
direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government could have used the opportunity it had to reform 
and reduce taxes to redefine Canada's middle class. Instead the 
government believes that Canadians making $70,000 should be taxed 
as if they are rich.  One does not hit the top marginal tax rate 
in the U.S. until he or she is making an income of $400,000 
Canadian.  Yet in Canada we are taxing those making $70,000 
Canadian as if they are rich. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that a high tech worker in Vancouver making $70,000 
per year will be taxed at the top marginal tax rate of around 
52%, federal and provincial combined.  A high tech worker in 
Seattle, an hour and a half away, making the same level of income 
will be taxed at a 26% marginal rate.  Do we wonder why these 
people are leaving? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The starting wage for most MBA graduates from Canadian schools 
is over $70,000 in technology driven companies or the financial 
industry.  We are sending those people out of Canada.  We are 
telling them that we do not want their innovation, their brains, 
their sweat, work and efforts to build a better country. However, 
the U.S. wants young Canadians because they are well educated, 
bright, hardworking, the best in the world and will build a 
better country.  Unfortunately that greater country will not be 
Canada because of the government's backward thinking policies. 
That greater country will be the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Don Goodison of the Canadian Certified General Accountants 
Association, said after the budget last night that it was not 
good enough.  If he were contemplating moving south of the border 
this budget would not keep him here.  The current Prime Minister 
has suggested that young Canadians should leave the country if 
they are unhappy with Canada's taxes.  I am afraid that he may 
get his wish.  Sadly, when we lose the best and brightest young 
people, we lose the capital and talent necessary to create a 
greater level of prosperity for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the digital highway of the global economy Canada has fallen 
two years behind the U.S. in e-commerce.  Silicon Valley is full 
of expatriate Canadian innovators who are there not because they 
want to be but because they needed to access the entrepreneurial 
environment and capital necessary to grow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's comparatively high tax regime has driven over $135 
billion worth of investment from Canada over the last 10 years. 
Access to capital is critical in the high tech sector, 
particularly in the incubational stages.  While there are 
Canadian high tech innovators here the government is making it 
very difficult for them to stay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are proud of our new technology success stories like Nortel 
or JDS Uniphase.  We are proud of the new economy startups like 
Versus Technology, Bid.com, Leitch Technology, EcomPark, Imagic 
TV from Saint John that is riding the wave of the future of 
convergence of technology, and Hemosol, a cutting edge biotech 
industry player that is emerging in Canada.  We are proud of all 
these ventures.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that the CDNX can be Canada's NASDAQ or NASDAQ north, 
financing Canada's future and creating greater levels of economic 
growth.  For that to happen, the government has to recognize the 
power of technology and the power of the opportunities facing 
Canadians.  It should stop getting in the way and start helping 
the Canadian technology industry seize the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to do more than simply to retain Canada's best and 
brightest.  We need to develop a high tech industrial strategy 
that attracts innovators from other countries to Canada.  With 
the death of distance as a determinant in the cost of 
telecommunications, with the quality of life advantages in 
Canada, particularly Atlantic Canada, and with the highly 
developed post-secondary education infrastructure in Canada—and 
coming from Atlantic Canada I am very proud of our post-secondary 
education infrastructure—these are advantages we can utilize to 
succeed in the global environment, not just to compete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that Canada can be a world leader, not a world 
trailer.  We can lead the world of innovation if we actually 
start producing policies designed for Canadians well into the 
21st century, instead of merely focusing on policies that may 
give the Liberals a bump in next week's polls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should be striving to develop a tax system as it 
applies to the technology sector that is not almost as good as 
the U.S. system but in fact in some ways is better than the U.S. 
system.  As I mentioned, we are two years behind the U.S. in the 
very important area of e-commerce.  We are now entering a period 
of growth in the biotech industry.  In fact it is a biotech 
revolution.  We still have an opportunity.  I see our health 
critic here.  He is very interested in the future of biotech as 
it applies to the Canadian health care system and health reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This can be an opportunity for Canada.  If we change our 
policies now, we do not need to be a laggard.  We do not need to 
be held back.  We do not need to watch the U.S. and other 
countries move ahead.  We can actually ride the wave of the 
biotech revolution, create jobs and opportunities, and reform our 
health care system at the same time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the debt issue, the finance minister was ignoring warnings 
from economists that Canada needs to set out a more aggressive 
debt reduction strategy to reduce the debt in real terms.  The 
former Liberal finance minister, Donald MacDonald, has asked the 
government to reduce the debt that he helped to create in the 
1970s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This $570 billion albatross costs Canadians $40 billion per year 
in debt servicing charges.  By not addressing the debt issue more 
seriously, the Minister of Finance is forcing future generations 
of Canadians to face the issue he continues to duck.  Debt 
reduction may not be the most politically exciting way to invest 
a fiscal dividend in the short term, but reducing Canada's debt 
in the long term is the best way to ensure that we can continue 
to afford the social programs and low taxes that we value as 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At current levels of debt reduction it would take 150 to 200 
years to eliminate the accumulated debt.  The finance minister is 
crowing that within five years Canada's debt to GDP ratio will be 
down to 50%.  The situation in France and the U.K., for instance, 
has allowed those countries to have debt to GDP ratios of 40% 
now, and we are saying we strive to have a debt to GDP ratio of 
50% in five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of health care, probably the greatest single 
disappointment in this budget is its failure to address the real 
needs of Canadian health care.  At one time the federal 
government shared the cost of health care equally with the 
provinces.  Fifty cents of every dollar spent on health care was 
spent by the federal government.  In recent years, particularly 
under this government and its draconian slashing of the CHST 
transfers, that share has been reduced to 13 cents on the dollar. 
Only 13 cents of every dollar spent on health care in Canada come 
from the federal government.  The $2.5 billion over the next four 
years is frankly a drop in the bucket. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health care expenses in Canada are growing in some estimates of 
upward of $2 billion a year due to inflation, population growth 
and the aging population.  The increases the government is 
promoting do not even keep track with the increase in the expense 
in health care.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This investment hurts provinces like mine in Nova Scotia.  It 
hurts all provinces, but Nova Scotia Premier John Hamm said that 
without full restoration of the health transfers cut in the fight 
against the deficit Nova Scotia health care standards would slip. 
They have already slipped under this government.  We have seen 
the health care system in Nova Scotia and across Canada 
deteriorate significantly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even Brian Tobin, Premier of Newfoundland, wannabe Liberal 
leader on the other side of the House some time and perhaps a 
future competitor for the holy grail of Liberal leadership, is 
saying that the government missed the boat by not reinvesting in 
health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mike Harris, Premier of Ontario, said that we could not deliver 
the quality of health care we are delivering today with declining 
dollars from the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Health Care Association said that the budget's 
announcement of an additional $2.5 billion over four years did 
not recognize the severity of the current health care crisis in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget has virtually ignored the agricultural crisis in 
Canada.  When it talks about the agricultural crisis the 
government believes that if it is not grown in the west it is not 
agriculture anyway.  It is ignoring the plight of farmers in the 
west, but at least it is talking about the agricultural crisis in 
the west.  It does not even talk about the agricultural crisis in 
eastern Canada and we have some real problems in Atlantic Canada 
in terms of an agricultural crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On defence, since 1993 the government has cut 23% from defence 
spending.  The budget's anemic attempt to reinject a bit of much 
needed cash into defence falls far short of what is actually 
needed.  In an increasingly complicated global environment we are 
asking our soldiers to do more and more.  Instead of giving them 
more to do that, we are actually paying them less and less. 
Quality of life issues are paramount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On equipment, we are sending helicopters up in the air with 
baler twine and duct tape holding them together.  The government, 
which is only reinvesting $1.9 billion over the next several 
years in defence, was willing to spend half a billion to cancel a 
helicopter contract for political reasons.  The government is 
more focused on short term politics than on the long term needs 
of Canadians.  Canada spends less on defence as a percentage of 
our GDP than any of our NATO partners except Luxemburg.  After 
this budget Canada will still be spending less on defence on a 
per capita basis than any other country except Luxemburg.  It is 
an embarrassment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On infrastructure, the government's reinvestment in 
infrastructure is an insult to the provinces.  It means that 
highways like highway 101 in Nova Scotia will not be twinned. 
Death traps in some of our provinces will not be addressed.  The 
$100 million this year for the infrastructure program is nothing, 
given the cost of what needs to be done across Canada with the 
municipalities and with the provincial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my disappointments with this budget was that the Minister 
of Finance in the estimates is giving the HRDC minister an 
increase in her blank cheque of $1.3 billion in this budget. 
Instead of cutting her allowance we are giving her more money. 
The Minister of Finance must have been wearing his boondoggle 
blinders when he wrote this budget.  For the past two months 
Canadians have been focused on waste in the HRDC department and 
in other departments.  The minister has ignored this fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could have lower taxes.  We could have better spending on 
health care.  We could have better spending on defence, highways 
and agriculture if the government had the courage to ensure that 
Canadian taxpayer money would be invested carefully instead of 
wasted rampantly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need more vision if we are to lead the way into the 21st 
century.  I believe Canada can do it, but only if the government 
seizes the day and starts to recognize the opportunities and 
challenges facing Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am quite surprised.  The 
member for Kings—Hants is a member of the finance committee and 
I would have thought he might have read the budget.  He covered 
so much terrain and there are many areas in which there is much 
misinformation.  I would like to focus on a couple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, on the CHST and the transfers to the provinces, 
the member cited a 13% increase.  As I indicated earlier and as 
the budget papers clearly portray, the cash portion of the 
transfers, which is only one part of the transfer as there are 
tax points as the member full well knows, is increasing with this 
budget by 25%. In fact, the CHST has been fully restored.  If we 
throw in equalization, it is at a level of about $40 billion in 
transfers to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about making business more competitive. The budget 
reduces the corporate tax rate from 28% to 21% for the highly 
taxed sectors.  That is a pretty bold move. It takes the 21% rate 
and for small businesses applies that immediately for income 
between $200,000 and $300,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about access to capital and incubation of small 
companies.  If he turns to the budget papers, he will realize 
that the budget introduces taxation benefits for stock options, 
the capital gains treatment of stock options.  That will help 
businesses, start-ups and particularly those in the high 
technology sector.  If he read the budget papers, he would 
realize that the government has introduced capital gains tax 
remission for companies that roll over their capital gains and 
put it into small businesses and start-ups and part of the 
invigorating part of our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he actually read the budget, he would discover that the 
capital gains tax inclusion rate has been reduced from 
three-quarters to two-thirds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he read the budget, he would understand that it puts close to 
$2.4 billion into defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on and on but I think the member should read the 
budget before he comes to the House.  Normally he is most 
informed on these issues.  I was surprised today. Has the member 
read the budget? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
non-partisan intervention from my colleagues opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member asked if I read the budget.  I did read the 
budget.  But had he been sitting in the House when I gave my 
speech he probably would have heard a little more clearly what I 
was saying. I did not say 13%.  I said 13 cents. Just to 
reiterate, the government feels it is appropriate for the federal 
government to only pay 13 cents of every dollar spent on health 
care. Clearly that is not consistent with what the Canada Health 
Act has set forth when it was 50%. I expect the hon. member has 
been clarified on that one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about global competitiveness issues I am not 
surprised the hon. member is confused.  As a party that fought 
free trade and thought it was a bad thing, clearly his is not a 
party that can actually put together the types of policies that 
Canadians need to compete in a global environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Corporate tax reduction is very important. After this budget is 
fully implemented, Canada's corporate tax rates will go from 
being second highest in the OECD to being fourth highest in the 
OECD.  That is assuming that over the next five years no other 
OECD countries reduce their taxes. In fact 28 of the 31 OECD 
countries plan to reduce corporate taxes.  We will be just 
catching up in five years to where we should have been much 
earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Five year plans did not work in the 
Soviet Union and they will not work here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  The government is focused on five year 
plans.  As my hon. colleague just mentioned, five year plans did 
not work in the former Soviet Union and they probably will not 
work here either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is constantly playing catch-up and unfortunately 
Canadians are trailing when we should be leading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the capital gains tax regime, the hon. member opposite 
boasted that the government has reduced the inclusion rate from 
75% to two-thirds. If he had been listening to my speech, he 
would have heard me reiterate the PC Party's position of reducing 
it to a 50% inclusion rate which would have provided an effective 
capital gains tax regime equal to that of the U.S.  Instead the 
effective capital gains tax regime after the government's budget 
will still be 13% higher than that of the U.S.

Capital gains taxes impede productivity.  They hurt initiative. 
They punish entrepreneurs and they damage the Canadian economy 
and the potential for us to grow in the future.  And he is

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
colleague is trying to have it both ways.  Let us talk about the 
economic health of the country.  The Conservatives came to power 
back in 1988 and by 1993 the deficit was about $42 billion. The 
debt moved from $170 billion in 1988 to over $400 billion in 
1993.  It is fairly clear as history shows and it is documented 
everywhere that if this government had followed the Tory 
traditions of the late eighties and early nineties, by the year 
2003-04 there would have been a zero transfer payment in the 
areas of health care and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government first had to put the nation's fiscal house in 
order.  It would have to eliminate the deficit.  It would have to 
control the economic situation. It would have to reverse the 
trend of tremendous cuts the previous government had made to 
social programs and the spending of the previous government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have put the nation's fiscal house in order.  We have 
controlled the debt.  We have controlled the deficit. Now we are 
beginning to invest, unlike what those guys have done. Every year 
from 1988 to 1993 the Conservatives said they would reduce the 
deficit and they never once met their objectives or targets.  Why 
should Canadians believe them when they say that they are going 
to do a better job than we are doing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hon. 
member's intervention.  I believe the hon. member was elected in 
1988 during a campaign in which he railed against free trade.  As 
a member of parliament he has subsequently railed against the 
GST.  He has railed against the deregulation of financial 
services, transportation and energy.  He has fought all those 
structural changes that were implemented by the previous 
government.  He fought against every single one of those 
cornerstones of the new economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was an interesting article in <I>The Economist</I> 
magazine's 1998 preview.  It said that credit for the deficit 
reduction in Canada belongs to the structural changes made in the 
Canadian economy by the previous government.  It listed free 
trade.  It listed the GST.  It listed deregulation of financial 
services, transportation and energy.  I would like to know why 
the hon. member when he was in opposition fought against all 
those changes and why now as a Liberal government member he is 
taking credit for the results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal members are the patron saints of hypocrisy if they 
believe they can sit in the House today and attack the 
Conservative record.  Those Conservative changes have enabled the 
present government to eliminate the deficit with the help of 
Canadians who have seen their taxes rise and their services 
slashed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the proposed hockey bailout was 
a significant indicator of the degree to which the government has lost 
touch with Canadians.  At a time when Canadians have seen their take home 
pay drop by 8% in the 1990s and have seen Americans enjoy a 10% increase, $100 
million for hockey was not the right step.  There is a homeless 
crisis in Canada. Children are suffering.  Child poverty is a 
very important issue that has not been addressed by the 
government in the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is appalling that the government wanted to spend $100 million 
on professional hockey.  When we look at it, the hockey players 
and teams in Canada are like the canaries in the old coal mines. 
They would put canaries in the coal mines and if the gases became 
toxic or noxious, the canaries died.  They would then know they 
would have to change the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax system and the oppressiveness of our tax burden is 
killing Canadian industry.  It is hurting the high tech sector 
and the hockey players.  Instead of dramatically changing the 
environment in Canada, rather than this tax tinkering, the 
government is putting gas masks on the hockey players.  The rest 
of us need to breathe and succeed in this country too.  All 
Canadians need broad based tax relief and tax reform, not just 
hockey players. 
<P><A NAME="LINK72"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am especially pleased and 
honoured to participate in the debate on our government's first 
budget of the new millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a budget that builds on the foundations we have put in 
place in past budgets.  It also takes historic new action to turn 
our nation's better finances into better lives for Canadians. 
This budget makes use of hard won surpluses to raise the standard 
of living for all Canadians, to enhance their quality of life and 
to prepare our economy to succeed in the new century. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each of the key measures we have taken directly relate to the 
needs and concerns reported to us by Canadians from across the 
country in the prebudget consultations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They include of course a fourth consecutive increase in funds 
for health care and education, a $2.5 billion increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, a five year tax reduction plan reintroducing 
indexing into the federal tax system reduces the intermediate tax 
rate and, overall, will cut taxes by at least $58 billion by 
2004. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will mean an annual tax saving of 15% on the average, and 
more for families with children: targeted spending to make our 
economy more innovative, and increase help for children and the 
environment. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While many of these measures speak clearly, confidently and 
concretely for themselves, some do not need further advocacy or 
explanation from me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues will focus more fully on the benefits to Canadians 
of our five year tax reduction plan, including the reductions of 
the high tax burden at the middle income level and increased 
support for families and children.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They need to check their facts with the Leader of the 
Opposition.  I think they were living in the 1998-99 era and that 
some of the measures we put in place in 1998-99 were not even 
reflected in some of those figures.  Canadians deserve the facts 
and those are the facts.  Paul and Fran Darr will save 45% in 
federal income taxes by the year 2004. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Others in the House will elaborate on our targeted smart 
investments in health care, our knowledge and innovation and the 
environment.  Others will elaborate on the fact that along with 
last year's budget we have fully restored Canada health and 
social transfers to the provinces which will reach a new peak of 
close to $31 billion in 2000-01. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there are a number of measures I want to highlight 
today.  Some are major and some are less glamorous, but they all 
demonstrate how we are living up to our commitment to keep Canada 
as the best place in which to work, to live and to raise a 
family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me begin with the budget's announcement that we are 
restoring full indexation to the tax system.  I know this is not 
as glorious as the direct tax cut rates that we are delivering 
but it is vitally important.  That is a fact.  It is not just 
partisan politics.  Just ask business groups and tax experts 
across the country.  It is no accident or corporate conspiracy 
that they have universally and consistently called on the 
government to restore the protection against tax inflation that 
was virtually abandoned by the previous Tory government in 1986. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week, for example, the Canadian Institute of Chartered 
Accountants put reindexation at the top of its list of budget 
recommendations.  As a chartered accountant myself, I can say 
that is right on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent weeks just as many commentators and critics were 
warning that our government would not reindex the personal income 
tax system.  They thought that because indexation can be more 
difficult to explain to the public than other types of tax relief 
and because once it is in place and there is no annual political 
bang for the buck, restoring it would not be in our best 
interest.  Now there is political cynicism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe it was not the expedient thing to do but it was the right 
thing to do. That is why I want to especially congratulate our 
Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance for their courage. 
They have put the interests of Canadians, especially low income 
Canadians, such as seniors on fixed pensions, ahead of partisan 
political advantage.  It is something every member of the House 
should be proud of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is restoring indexation the right thing to do?  It puts an 
end to bracket creep and gives people real and permanent tax 
relief.  It protects taxpayers against hidden tax increases 
caused by inflation.  Without indexation, if we were to receive a 
2% pay raise it would just cover inflation. Our real income would 
not have grown at all.  For many low income Canadians that unreal 
raise forces them onto the tax rolls while middle income earners 
find themselves pushed into a higher bracket.  In other words, 
their incomes have not really gone up but their tax bite has. 
That is just not fair and that is why, now that the deficit is 
behind us, we are putting that protection back into the tax 
system and more money back into the pockets of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indexation will also stop the erosion of the value of benefits, 
such as the GST credit, the Canada child tax benefit and the old 
age credit.  Without indexation, these credits, designed to help 
those in real need, are slowly eaten away by inflation year after 
year.  Now these amounts will automatically increase to offset 
inflation keeping their real value and their ability to provide 
real help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the years ahead our decision to restore indexation will leave 
every Canadian better off.  But the ultimate foundation for 
personal prosperity is a good job.  To make sure those jobs are 
there for people we have to make sure that Canadian companies are 
internationally competitive. 
That is why our 2000 budget takes action to make the tax system 
more conducive to investment and innovation.  For example, over 
the next five years the corporate tax rates that apply to the 
highest taxed sectors, such as high technology services, will be 
brought down to 21% from the current 28%.  That means that all 
our different industrial sectors will share a level playing 
field.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget will also reduce the income inclusion rate for 
capital gains from three-quarters to two-thirds and will allow a 
$500,000 tax free rollover for qualifying investments in new 
small business ventures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize this sounds very technical and complex.  Let me just 
emphasize the goal here.  A key to starting up new, innovative 
and high risk businesses is the availability of risk capital. The 
tax free rollover will give such businesses, especially high tech 
start-ups, greater access to capital from what are called angel 
investors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many employers share ownership plans and stock options to 
encourage employees to become participating owners of their 
businesses, most notably in the fast growing high technology 
industries.  Tax rules that apply to stock options and employee 
share ownership plans have been under review to ensure that they 
remain appropriate as the economy evolves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this budget we announced that up to $100,000 in stock options 
granted annually by companies to employees will be taxed only 
when the shares are actually sold instead of when the options are 
exercised. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objective here is a simple one that makes sense.  Stock 
options are one way of encouraging employees to play a greater 
role in the development of the company in which they work.  The 
high tech sector in particular will benefit from this measure, 
which will help it to attract the best innovators and 
entrepreneurs to Canada and keep them here, resulting in the 
creation of jobs for Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example of a budget measure that will make Canada more 
competitive is the new export distribution centre program.  This 
will virtually eliminate the GST and the harmonized sales tax 
cashflow costs borne by export oriented businesses that add only 
limited value to products in Canada.  These businesses will be 
able to import and buy inventory in this country without paying 
the GST or the HST.  For these companies the new program will 
alleviate the cashflow burden because currently they have to pay 
the tax up front and then wait to claim it back when they file 
their sales tax returns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you can understand why, as an accountant and former 
corporate executive, I wanted to highlight some of the tax 
actions that would not normally grab the public eye or the ears 
of the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now want to return to a broader issue and remind the House of 
the fiscal achievements that have made our budget 2000 action 
plan possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just seven years ago, when we came to office, the yearly federal 
deficit was a huge $40 billion.  We needed one-third of our 
annual revenues just to pay interest on the debt that two decades 
of deficits had built.  Now financial results for the first nine 
months clearly indicate that a balanced budget or better will be 
recorded again this year, 1999-2000. That will mark our third 
consecutive balanced budget or better for the first time in 
nearly 50 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This underscores the soundness of the government's fiscal 
strategy using two year rolling budget plans that are based on 
prudent planning assumptions, backed by a contingency reserve, 
but also pursuing strategic investments to support economic 
growth and job creation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our bottom line is clear:  The government is not prepared to 
risk a return to deficits.  The benefits from maintaining sound 
public finances, sustained economic growth, more jobs and higher 
incomes for Canadians will not be put at risk.  In fact, this 
year's budget commits the government to balanced budgets or 
better for the coming two years in the budget track, 2001 and 
2002.  This will mark five consecutive years of balanced budgets 
or surpluses.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Since Confederation there have been only two other occasions 
when the Government of Canada recorded balanced budgets for at 
least five consecutive years:  in the 1920s and again in the 
later 1940s through to the early 1950s, the period of 
demobilization following World War II. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does this fiscal progress stack up internationally? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the accounting standards used by our G-7 partners, 
this year, in 1999-2000, Canada will post its fourth budgetary 
surplus.  No other G-7 nation, not even the United States, has 
accomplished such a turnaround between 1992 and 1999. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say again that by the accounting standards used in most 
other countries, the federal government will post a financial 
surplus for the fourth consecutive year in 1999-2000.  In fact, 
we are the only G-7 country to do so, including the United 
States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me point out that this is not just a federal success story. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The financial situation of the provinces and territories will 
also have improved for the seventh year running in 1999-2000.  As 
a result, the total deficit of the Canadian public sector will 
have dropped to its lowest level in over 20 years.  This means 
that Canada is the G-7 country whose financial situation between 
1992 and 1999 has improved the most. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is this ability to turn around federal finances, thanks to 
the support of Canadians across the country, that now makes it 
possible for us to deliver dramatic new tax cuts and make key 
investments in health, education, children and the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another benefit we are seizing; that is to make 
continuing progress on debt reduction.  Under the debt repayment 
plan, we will again set aside a $3 billion contingency reserve 
each year to ensure that we continue to achieve balanced budgets 
even if economic problems arise.  When the reserve is not needed 
it will automatically go to paying down the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through this approach, total public debt has declined by $6.4 
billion over the last two years, producing a $300 million yearly 
saving in interest costs.  Financial market debt will have fallen 
by almost $20 billion by this March 31. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More importantly, the federal debt to GDP ratio has declined 
each year since 1995-96.  This ratio, which measures the size of 
debt in relation to the economy, is generally recognized as the 
most appropriate measure of the debt burden as it measures the 
ability of the government and the country's taxpayers to finance 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995-96 the debt to GDP ratio reached a post-war peak of 
71.2%.  By the end of this fiscal year it will have fallen to 
61%.  This ratio is expected to decline to 55% by 2001-02 and 
fall below 50% by 2004-05. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Achieving strong finances has not come easy.  It has taken tough 
action, including careful control of program spending; that is 
all federal spending except debt interest charges.  That is a 
commitment we will never abandon.  The proof is in the budget 
figures. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between 1997-98, when we first balanced the budget, and 2001-02, 
the increase in program spending should correspond to inflation 
combined with demographic growth.  This is the standard used by 
most economic observers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, even allowing for the 
measures announced in today's budget, program spending next year 
will be $4 billion less than what it was when we took office. 
Expressed as a percentage of the economy, another key measure, 
federal program spending will continue to drop, reaching 11.6% 
in 2001-02, that is its lowest level in 50 years.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Since we have balanced the budget fully two-thirds of our new 
spending has been on priorities of Canadians such as health, 
higher education, access to skills and knowledge, and innovation. 
Having said that, there are areas where the government has 
responsibilities and obligations within Canada and outside its 
borders, responsibilities the official opposition party clearly 
shirks from.  They include farmers, the homeless, the RCMP, the 
military, our national infrastructure, clean air and clean water, 
just to name a few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The future of Canada and its people is looking brighter all the 
time.  The deficit is eliminated.  The debt burden is falling. 
Our unemployment rate is at the lowest level in more than 20 
years and the disposable income of Canadians is on the rise. 
These favourable economic developments are setting the stage for 
a better quality of life for all Canadians.  Balanced budgets 
have paved the way for tax cuts and increases in the Canada child 
tax benefit.  They have made possible increased transfers to the 
provinces and territories for post-secondary education and 
health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The measures in the 2000 budget will move Canada further along 
the path to greater prosperity, security and opportunity in the

hon. member for Etobicoke North to explain what he means by a 
courageous movement to pay off the country's debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we are speaking, the debt is $579 billion. For the last three 
years of the plan, it will remain at $576 billion. At a rate of 
$3 billion per year, supposing we apply the government's 
provisional reserve for the debt, it will take Canadians 192 
years to eliminate the debt. The debt does not bother the 
federal government too much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What really bothers the federal government is the assistance it 
could provide to the provinces to help them overcome the daily 
problems that confront them. All the provinces agreed that the 
priority was health care. All Canadians, including Quebecers of 
course, need additional resources to pay for health care. 
Everyone agrees that it is the top priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government does not recognize that because, in 
order to carry out this priority, it would have to go through 
the provinces and give them more money to provide the services 
for which they are responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of meeting the essential needs of Quebecers and 
Canadians, instead of meeting them via the provinces, the 
federal government has opted for impoverishing the provinces 
still further by keeping them in a position of dependency, so 
that they will be increasingly unable to act, even in areas that 
are set out as their jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What then are the heroic gestures the federal government has 
taken to meet the essential needs of the people?  Why does the 
federal government not allocate any significant amount to 
solving the problem of Canadians' health?  Is that what the 
budget's generosity is all about?

their income grows, in those cases where it does, they are able 
to carry a higher mortgage 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, we are concerned with the debt, but we are managing the 
debt in the context of a growing economy and the capacity of the 
economy to sustain that debt.  If we suddenly paid down a huge 
amount on the debt it could actually have a dampening effect on 
the economy.  We want to continue the sustained growth in the 
last quarter of 4.3% real growth in the economy of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Finance and further Liberal speakers have been trying 
to tell the House that this budget is a product of a broad 
consultation process, that they went around the country and 
listened to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is true, they might have done a lot of consultation but 
they sure did not listen to Canadians because the overwhelming 
majority of Canadians said over and over and over again at every 
opportunity that they wanted the health care system fixed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This should have been and could have been the health care budget 
that put the wheels back on our health care system, which 
everybody knows is ailing.  We heard instead a paltry $2.5 
billion over four years for health care, education and social 
assistance.  In my home province of Manitoba this represents $20 
million per year for health care, social assistance and 
post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can Liberal members try to say that they have put money back 
into health care and they have done what is necessary to breathe 
new life into our ailing health care system with a paltry 
contribution like that?  That is my comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member like to comment on the source of the 
surplus the Liberals are now spending in various ways?  Would he 
not admit that much of the surplus is actually the EI surplus? We 
have a perverse form of Robin Hood where unemployed workers, who 
used to be able to enjoy the benefits of EI, are having their 
pockets picked so the Liberals can flip it back into tax cuts for 
corporations and capital gains tax cuts for the wealthy.  Will 
the hon. member please try to defend that position? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B>  Mr. Speaker, with respect to the 
budgeting process in Canada it is the most transparent and open 
process that exists.  We implemented cross-country consultations 
where Canadians had the opportunity to come and present their 
views to the Standing Committee on Finance.  The department and 
certainly this caucus reach out to talk to people.  I do not know 
about members opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me just give the House something that came out yesterday. 
This is a press release from the Canadian Taxpayers Federation 
which says that bracket creep is dead, taxes are coming down and 
the Minister of Finance listens to the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the member opposite talks about transfers to the provinces 
and investments in health care, I do not know if he has forgotten 
already but he should recall that in the last budget the 
government made the largest single investment in health care that 
we have ever made of $11.5 billion. 
If we add the $2.5 billion in this year's budget, it fully 
restores and more the CHST levels from 1993 to an all time high 
of $30 billion.  These are the facts.  That includes tax points 
and cash.  I would like the member to read the section on the 
transfers.  It might inform him better.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, for 
the record, transfers are still way down at $400 per person 
compared to 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member stated that Canadians would receive $58 billion in 
tax relief.  I would argue that those figures are wrong. 
Nevertheless, will he acknowledge that almost $30 billion of that 
tax relief will be effectively erased by the hike in Canada 
pension plan premiums, being mindful that what Canadians care 
about is their bottom line, their disposable income?  Will he 
acknowledge that is exactly what will happen and on their 
paystubs Canadians will not see anywhere near the relief the 
government has promised? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B>  Mr. Speaker, when Reform members talk 
about paystubs they should at least have the courtesy of bringing 
into the House paystubs that reflect today's reality.  They bring 
in and talk about paystubs that do not even implement the 
measures we brought in in 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the measures this year, and we do not need to go over them 
all again, the tax reductions are significant.  On average 
Canadians will receive a tax cut of 15% and if that is combined 
with the past budgets it is an average of 22%.  Some Canadians 
will receive a tax cut of 45%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talks about the Canada pension plan.  With respect, 
he still does not get it.  I have explained it to him before and 
he still does not get it, but I will explain it briefly for the 
House.  The Canada pension plan is a funded pension plan with 
employer and employee contributions.  Those funds go into a 
separate pension plan.  They do not come near consolidated 
revenue.  Last year we implemented the measures that will keep 
the Canada pension plan on a sound footing into the future.  The 
member needs to distinguish between CPP and other tax reductions. 
<P><A NAME="LINK76"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is my pleasure to rise today in reply to budget 2000.  I start by 
taking issue with some of the things my hon. friend across the 
way has just said.  It really goes to the point of what I wanted 
to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply have to point out that this budget is remarkable but 
not for good reasons.  It is remarkable in two ways: one for what 
it says which simply is not true and in another sense for what it 
does not say but is critical to maintaining or increasing public 
confidence in government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just a minute ago we were having a discussion about the $58 
billion tax cut.  We all saw the headlines.  The government 
deserves top marks for the PR it has generated in anticipation of 
the budget.  It has been very good for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will happen, and this is really where I want to go with 
this, is that in a year's time when Canadians sit down to take a 
look at their paystubs and figure out what the impact of these 
big tax cuts are on them, they will be very disappointed.  One of 
the reasons they will be so disappointed is because of answers 
like the one we just got from my colleague across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was an empty answer.  I asked him very clearly what would be 
the impact on people's disposable income when they have to pay 
out the CPP taxes against the alleged tax relief the government 
would deliver.  He then went into a long dissertation about CPP 
being off budget, being different, and all that sort of thing. 
The people do not care.  They are not interested in all those 
technical arguments, I say to my friend.  They are interested in 
what will be the impact on their bottom line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we take a look at the $58 billion and start to break it 
down some interesting things happen.  All of a sudden we find out 
that the $58 billion tax cut people are so eagerly anticipating 
is a chimera.  It is not really there.  It is a mirage. 
When we pull it apart, this is what we find.  First, the $58 
billion tax cut, all of a sudden, because of the increase in CPP 
premiums over the next five years, is reduced by about $30 
billion.  What was $58 billion is now down to about $28 billion. 
That is where we are now.  The $58 billion in tax relief which 
the government promised really becomes $28 billion over five 
years when we factor in the $30 billion that we will have to pay 
in increased CPP taxes.  We should remember that this is spread 
over five years.

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, about $7.5 billion of that amount is not really a tax 
cut at all, it is a social program called the child tax benefit. 
The child tax benefit works the same way as all social programs. 
The government taxes everyone in the country, and it does that 
very effectively, and then it gives the money back to some people 
who have children.  If that constitutes a tax cut, then I guess 
old age security is a tax cut.  I guess the guaranteed income 
supplement is a tax cut.  The fact is, it is not a tax cut.  It 
was put in by the government to pad its numbers and to make its 
tax relief look a lot bigger than it really is.  The definition 
of a real tax cut is when money is left in people's pockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third point I want to make has to do with the issue of 
bracket creep.  I applaud the government for following the lead 
of this party and other parties in this place which have urged 
that the government quit taxing people for inflation.  That is 
something for which we have been arguing for a long time. 
Bracket creep is insidious.  It has hurt people.  It has hammered 
low income Canadians.  There is no question of that.  We know 
that is the case and we are glad it is gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that the government be completely honest with 
people about the impact on the government's finances, and more to 
the point, the finances of individuals.  Bracket creep is really 
a scheduled tax increase for the upcoming year.  If the 
government cancels the scheduled tax increases through bracket 
creep over the next five years, is that really a tax cut?  Do 
people have more money in their pockets?  Of course not.  It is a 
bit like the bully shaking down the grade 4 kid for his lunch 
money.  When the teacher catches the kid and says he cannot do it 
any more, the bully turns around and says that he is responsible 
for putting even more money into the kid's pocket. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians will not have more money because the government has 
ended bracket creep, they will just not face yearly tax increases 
because of it.  If we take that out, that is $13.5 billion.  When 
we look at the real tax relief that is being delivered, it is 
about $7.5 billion over a five-year period, or about $1.5 billion 
a year.  It works out to $107 per taxpayer. That is not exactly a 
lot of money.  It works out to about $2 per week.  We might be 
able to buy ourselves a cup of coffee at Starbucks, but that is 
about all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must remember that this comes on top of massive tax increases 
which the government has brought forward over the last six and a 
half years since it has been in power.  At the end of the day 
Canadians will be paying more in taxes than when the Liberals 
took power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would never know that from reading the headline “$58 billion 
in tax relief”.  What is the net impact?  Canadians will still 
be paying a lot more in taxes than when the government came to 
power, about $700 more per family.  That is shameful. 
Congratulations to the government.  It pulled the wool over a lot 
of people's eyes, including some of my friends in the media, I am 
sad to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth is that Canadians will still be paying taxes that are 
far too high.  I think that many Canadians will see that in their 
paystubs as the year progresses and some of these changes are 
implemented.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot put groceries on the table with headlines.  We cannot 
put more money into people's jeans with headlines, and that is 
what Canadians really want.  They want more money.  They want 
more groceries.  They might even want to buy a pair of jeans, but 
they will not be able to do that with this budget because it just 
does not leave them nearly enough money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We argue that instead of giving Canadians a fake break we should 
give them a real break.  I will say a little more about that 
later on when I explain solution 17, the Reform Party's proposal 
to dramatically lower taxes for all Canadians and to ensure that 
middle class Canadians, whom this government is targeting, end up 
with real disposable income in their pockets and not just a 
headline which does nothing for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to touch on something which I mentioned at the outset of 
my remarks.  There is something glaring which the government 
absolutely forgot to mention in this budget.  My leader mentioned 
it earlier today, but I would like to say a few more words about 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out something that the finance minister said in 
his 1995 budget speech.  He said that subsidies to business 
impede growth.  I agree with that.  I just do not understand why 
he, as the finance minister, continues to rubber stamp all kinds 
of subsidies to business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three weeks ago the finance minister gave an interview in Ottawa 
and he said that government cannot pick winners but losers can 
pick government.  Truer words were never spoken.  There have been 
many losers who have not only picked the pockets of this 
government, but, by extension, those of the taxpayers of Canada. 
Yet the finance minister sits in his place every year and rubber 
stamps more cheques.  They go to the human resources minister, to 
the Indian affairs minister, to the industry minister and to the 
Canadian heritage minister.  Too often they are used for things 
which are, frankly, political slush or things which are of such 
low priority that they are laughable.  In some cases they go to 
some of the wealthiest companies in the world.  It makes no 
sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to touch on briefly, for people who have been on another 
planet, what has been going on in the Department of Human 
Resources Development.  Back in January the Reform Party brought 
to light an audit which revealed all kinds of terrible 
mismanagement.  We found that there was absolutely no monitoring 
of files on over $1 billion worth of grants and subsidies.  We 
found that there were many cases where applications were not even 
submitted but grant money was given to people.  We found all 
kinds of unbelievable things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The interesting thing is, instead of acknowledging right away 
that this was a scandal and saying “We are going to bring an end 
to these grants and subsidies”, because of, frankly, the 
political corruption that follows, they said “We are going to 
implement a six-point plan and we will do better”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has happened over the last little while is that the more we 
have dug the worse it gets.  It is spreading like a stain.  Now 
we find that the Indian affairs minister has all kinds of 
intrigues going on in his riding and the police have been called 
in to conduct investigations in the Prime Minister's riding. 
There is all kinds of stuff going on.  This happens at a time 
when the finance minister brings down a budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the finance minister do?  He continues to rubber stamp 
the cheques.  We find that there is even more money in this 
budget going to the human resources minister.  That is 
unbelievable, after that record.  There is no question that she 
should be fired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The $1 billion is only part of it.  The government spends $13.5 
billion a year on grants and contributions.  We were talking 
about health care a minute ago.  The entire time that the 
government was cutting the heart out of health care it maintained 
spending for grants and contributions.  It could not let down its 
political friends or stop funding its pet projects. No way.  It 
would rather cut hospital beds across the country so that it 
could fund hotel beds in Shawinigan.  It is disgraceful, but that 
is exactly what happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say a word about the Liberals' assertions that this 
billion dollar boondoggle created 30,000 jobs. 
Of course when they are challenged on the numbers they cannot 
actually produce any evidence that it produced even one job 
because they did not really keep any records.  It is only a 
billion.  After all, how could they be expected to keep records. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1340"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is true, if they really did create 30,000 jobs, and we 
know they have this big surplus, then why in the world would they 
not clean up all of the unemployment in the country?  There are 
1.1 million Canadians unemployed today.  Why not spend $70 
billion or $100 billion?  We would not have any unemployed in 
Canada any more.  Imagine the revenues that would pour in.  It 
would be unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason they do not want to do that is because they do not 
believe their own arguments.  They know this did not really 
create jobs.  All it did was take money from one group of people, 
the taxpayers, and give it to another group of people who 
happened to be their friends, or in some cases wealthy 
corporations.  Why would they do that except to curry favour and 
buy votes?  The fact is, they do not even believe their own 
arguments.  Otherwise they would be arguing that the amount of 
money should be increased dramatically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say a word about something that was left almost 
unmentioned in the budget.  It is important and it should be 
addressed.  A moment ago my friend, the parliamentary secretary, 
blew off a question from a Bloc member about the debt.  Is the 
debt not an issue in Canada any more?  We have $577 billion of 
debt in this country and the government has absolutely no plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  It has gone down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Oh, my friend says that it has gone 
down.  It has gone down $6 billion.  At that rate, in another 190 
years it will be paid off.  It is going really well.  The fact 
is, Canadians see the debt as an impediment.  They see it as 
something which holds the country back.  When there is debt there 
are interest payments.  In Canada today we pay about $42 billion 
a year in interest payments.  This government has absolutely no 
serious plan to address the issue of debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We argue that the government should take some of the boondoggle 
spending from human resources development, put it into health 
care and education, and put it toward reducing the debt. That is 
what we want to see.  Why does it not do that?  I think Canadians 
are onside with us when we say that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk for a moment about what the Reform Party would do. 
It is only fair that we lay out our plan.  We argue that the very 
first thing we should do is reallocate the wasteful spending that 
has become a symbol of the Liberal Party over the years.  We 
would take that money from its political friends and we would put 
it into things which Canadians care about.  I mentioned health 
care and higher education a minute ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also believe that we should take that $13.5 billion, which 
over the next five years would be about $65 billion, which is a 
lot of money, and put it into things people care about.  We think 
that we need to start to fund lower taxes in a way that really 
does put money into people's pockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  We should be funding ESSO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  My friends across the way sit and 
heckle.  I think I have touched a nerve.  They know, as part of a 
government that has presided over these large cuts to health care 
while continuing to fund boondoggle spending, that it is really 
the party that has cut more hospital beds and— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  I know the hon. 
member for Medicine Hat has raised points which have created some 
interest in the House and the debate is lively, but it is hard 
for the Speaker to hear the words of the hon. member for Medicine 
Hat, which the Speaker is interested in hearing, and I know that 
hon. members will want to conduct themselves accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, you are a wise man.  I 
appreciate that wise intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friends across the way are very sensitive about their role in 
reducing health care to its present state, and well they should 
be, but I will not dwell on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that we have room, because we have a surplus 
approaching $150 billion over the next five years, to reduce 
taxes tremendously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Thank you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  My friend from Simcoe—Grey 
says thank you, but it is really the taxpayers who should be 
thanked.  They are the ones who have borne the burden of the 
deficit fight through higher taxes.  There are incredibly high 
taxes today in Canada, the highest personal income taxes in the 
industrialized world.  We need to lower them.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Our plan would do three different things.  It would increase the 
basic exemption to $10,000, drawing from that big surplus.  It 
would extend a $3,000 deduction to all families with children. It 
would take the 26% and 29% rates and move every rate down to a 
single rate of 17%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would the impact of that be?  It would mean that every 
Canadian would see their taxes go down dramatically.  We would 
see that our country would be the most attractive country in the 
world when it comes to investment.  We would see money come back 
into the country.  We have seen $135 billion flow out over the 
last 10 years under the Liberal government and under the Tories 
before it.  That money would start to come back into Canada 
because this would be an attractive place to invest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More than that, we would see some great social benefits. I want 
to say a word about that.  We would see a tax plan that would 
lift two million low income Canadians right off the tax rolls. 
It is tough enough being poor without having the government tax 
people for the crime of having a low income, but that is what 
happens every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would also end the discrimination against single income 
families, something the government failed to do in its budget. In 
the tax code there is a discrimination against single income 
families.  It continues under this tax plan despite the efforts 
of some members across the way.  Unfortunately it does not sound 
like the government wants to change it.  Under our plan it would 
change.  We would get rid of that discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More important, we would attract a tremendous amount of economic 
activity to Canada.  I want to say a word about why that is 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a situation where the economy is underperforming like it is 
in Canada today where we still have almost 7% unemployment, who 
are the people who are hurt the most?  It is people without 
skills.  It is people without education.  We need to help those 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would do that by having an economy that moved a lot faster. 
If it did, those people would be scooped up.  They would get the 
jobs.  They would get the experience, the contacts, the capital 
and the confidence which would allow them to improve their lot. 
They could maintain their dignity.  They could provide for their 
own families instead of being kept dependent by the government. 
It is shameful that it would allow people to be left in that 
state, but the government does it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Solution 17 will lift Canadians off the tax rolls.  It will 
lower taxes.  It will attract investment.  My friends across the 
way should not let pride get in their way.  They should make sure 
they adopt this plan.  Let them adopt this plan.  Let us get 
Canadians back to work. Let us create some opportunity for 
Canadians from coast to coast.

in my experience for every complex problem there is a simple

introduced and if people at the low end of the tax regime were 
dropped off and the highest income earners who are presently

Would the hon. member not admit that it would be middle income 
Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would be happy to tell 
the hon. member who would pay.  The Department of Human Resources

that garbage any more.  It would be gone and the benefits would 
go to Canadians of all stripes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad my friend across the way asked me the question.  I 
would like to quote from a study done by Dale Orr of WEFA Inc. He 
is the fellow who chaired the finance minister's private sector 
economists and who prepared the documents for the fiscal and 
economic update in the fall.  In talking about our proposals he 
said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax reduction proposals...are well focused on the needs of 
Canadians today.  They expand the economy, and most powerfully: 
personal disposable income, consumption and our standard of 
living.  They create jobs.  By lowering the marginal tax rates 
they are particularly effective in stimulating work effort, and 
stemming the brain drain and other productivity enhancing 
features.  By powerfully reducing the level of personal income 
tax, particularly for Canadians of average and above average 
income, they are well directed at providing a more competitive 
tax environment in Canada relative to the U.S. 
They focus precisely and effectively on “bracket creep”, 
raising the basic personal exemption, particularly affecting the 
lowest income taxpayers, by much more than the rate of inflation: 
By eliminating the current 26% and 29% marginal tax rates, any 
bracket creep relating to these rates is eliminated.  The issue 
of fairness is addressed, not only by the elimination of bracket 
creep, but by honouring the original policy intentions of the 5% 
“deficit reduction” surtax and reducing EI premiums to be 
consistent with EI policy....The tax reduction proposals of the 
Reform Party are affordable.  If all of the tax reduction 
proposals are introduced as a combined package, over the 2000-01 
to 2004-05 period, there would still be a fiscal surplus in each 
and every year.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to ask to my colleague from the Reform Party a 
question.  Every time I hear we should bring employment insurance 
premiums down, but what about those 800,000 workers who have lost 
their employment and do not qualify for employment insurance? 
What about the 1.4 million children who are hungry?  What is the 
position of the Reform Party? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a motion in the House of Commons and it seems that the 
Reform Party does not want to support it. The only thing my 
motion says is to revise employment insurance. The only thing I 
hear from my colleague is to bring the premiums down. I have not 
heard any workers on the streets asking for the premiums to be 
brought down.  They have asked that the benefits be brought up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear his position on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is interesting how 
different people think so differently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would rather see people have a job than an enhanced social 
program.  Families with children need permanent jobs, jobs that 
pay a good salary.  That is what we have to focus our efforts on. 
Why does my friend automatically assume that the best use of 
money is through the hands of a government, to hand it out to 
different people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us give that money back to the job creators in Canada.  They 
will provide the best social program in the world and that is a 
good job. 
<P><A NAME="LINK79"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we are talking about where money might be coming from to 
help out with spending on high priorities in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week Environment Canada and Agriculture and Agri-Food 
Canada made a big announcement that they are going to put up 
$600,000 to put a sign by a farmer's gate to acknowledge that the 
farmer is helping out on environmental issues by the way he 
farms.  Does the member believe that that $600,000 should go 
toward that fence post in front of that farmer's yard or should it 
be going into health care which we really need and want? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, clearly my friend has 
pointed to another example of the idiocy that occurs on a daily 
basis in the ranks of government.  We see good money thrown after 
bad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friends across the way are sensitive and they should be. At 
the same time as that is happening, hospital beds have closed, 
people have left the country because the taxes are too high, and 
people cannot afford tuitions because they have been raised and 
transfers to the provinces have been lowered for those sorts of 
things.  It is time to change that.  Let us change that by 
getting rid of the grants and contributions that go to 
boondoggles.  Let us take that money and put it to good use 
instead. 
<P><A NAME="LINK80"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe—Grey, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
first the hon. member suggested not to let pride get in the way. 
Pride cannot help but get in the way for me because I am very 
proud to be Canadian and very proud to be a member of the 
government that has brought unemployment rates down consistently 
for the last six years.  I am proud of the fact that we have been 
able to manage the finances of this nation and actually deal with 
a surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member seems to want to go to a flat tax system and gut 
health care and social programs. The member talked about 
redirecting funding from HRDC and focusing it on tax reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would he be prepared to come to my riding and talk to the 
Georgian Bay Literacy Foundation that got $29,000?  It helps 
people who are illiterate to get jobs.  Would he be prepared to 
go and meet Tracks Youth Unemployment?  The people who are 
underemployed and unemployed in my riding who need the necessary 
skills so they can go into the job market and secure full 
permanent employment, would he tell them that the Reform Party 
does not care about them because it wants to gut the social 
programs in this country?

beat me to the punch.  They have already gutted health care 
across the way. Congratulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say to my friend that when he initially stood up and said 
he would not let pride get in the way, I thought it was going to 
be because he had no pride.  Apparently he does not after the 
yarn we just heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend across the way should be aware that the Reform Party 
takes a very different approach.  We say that Canadians 
themselves are very generous.  We know that they would come to 
the fore any time they are asked to help out people in need. They 
have proven that year after year after year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Leave the money in their pockets and they will look after their 
friends and their neighbours because they do it every day.  We 
are a generous people.  We do not need my friend across the way 
lecturing people on how they need to be a little bit more 
generous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend across the way has proven through his actions and 
through his government's actions that they are the main culprits 
when it comes to hurting Canadians.  They have done it for the 
last six years.

I rise today to comment on the government's budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I commend the government for following the Reform Party's 
advice and eliminating bracket creep, I believe this budget could 
have gone much further when it comes to tax cuts for average 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder why the government continues to pile money into 
programs rather than health care and education where it is 
needed.  Added transfer payments to the provinces of $2.5 billion 
over the next four years does not come close to meeting the needs 
of our hospitals and schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public is crying out for an end to the waiting lists for 
hospital beds but the government would rather pour money into 
HRDC and Canadian heritage programs which often go to Liberal 
friends and insiders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For every dollar the government is giving back in tax cuts, it 
is still spending $2 on programs.  Has the government learned 
nothing from its billion dollar mishandling of taxpayers' money? 
Canadians deserve better.

Make a Difference”.  This theme was chosen to highlight the

the country in the struggle against violence and poverty, the 
major themes of the upcoming World March of Women in the year 
2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Women's organizations have played a key role in influencing 
government policy to advance gender equality in all aspects of 
Canadian life.  The work to make a difference in the areas of 
violence against women and poverty has impacted on the lives of 
many women and young girls in creating an awareness of these 
crucial issues among decision makers and all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we celebrate International Women's Day, let us remember that 
while we have made progress, women account for 88% of the victims

against women and poverty in society.  Each of us has had a role 
to play in reaching these goals and we will all benefit from 
these efforts.

of an income crisis forced on to them by years of federal 
agriculture mismanagement and compounded by high foreign 
subsidies and bad weather. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This crisis has shaken the agriculture industry to its very 
roots.  Increasingly, distressed farmers are turning to desperate 
measures, including hunger strikes, to try and make this 
government aware of their problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When simply ignoring the problem did not work, the Liberals 
grudgingly announced AIDA, an emergency program that has only 
delivered a paltry 23% of the promised $1.7 billion.  When they 
realized that AIDA was a failure they tried to apply another $200 
million band-aid with no guarantee that any of these funds will 
ever be delivered.  If that was not insult enough, farmers were 
completely shut out of yesterday's budget.

the Prime Minister has almost achieved his objective of burying 
his involvement in the suppression of Canadian freedom of

have to go and testify at the commission because he can reply to 
questions in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two important differences between the House and the 
APEC Inquiry.  First, the inquiry witnesses are under oath. 
Second, witnesses may be cross-examined with direct challenges to 
their testimony. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously the commissioner feels that testifying under oath, 
providing detailed answers and being cross-examined are what the 
Prime Minister needs to do in order to avoid a cloud of public 
suspicion over the APEC inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Understandably, complainants are withdrawing from the process in 
Vancouver today.  The use of the Public Complaints Commission has 
been a smokescreen for the Prime Minister and his office all the 
way along.  The Prime Minister will not testify with the excuse 
that he will set a precedent for future prime ministers.  Well 
the Prime Minister has already set the precedent, one of 
arrogance.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister 
should have been outraged by the billion dollar boondoggle at 
human resources.  Instead, he rewards the minister by giving her 
an additional $220 million of discretionary spending.

spending, the $80 billion to which he refers, I have a lot of 
difficulty.  This is spending for health care, for education and 
for research and development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I have really discovered the answer.  He is not

but he chooses to ignore them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year an internal HRDC audit reveals more waste in the 
management just where?  In exactly the same place.  The Prime 
Minister's response to these warnings is to give the minister 
another $221 million.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Under any normal circumstances a billion dollar spending 
boondoggle would send shock waves through an institution.  All 
departments would be called to account.  The brakes would be put 
on future spending.  Management would be changed but not in this

increases and not one manager has been changed.

that this money is going for a program that was announced in the 
House in December, giving more money for the people who are 
homeless in Canada.  It was requested by the provincial 
governments and the mayors, and we have done it.  He would know 
that this money has been given in order to give more money to the 
students in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have explained.  I will explain again that the 
transfers to the provinces from 1993-94 have increased by more 
than $3 billion this year.  Of all the programs of the 
government, we are still spending $4 billion less than was spent 
in 1993-94. In spite of that, in the transfer to the provinces of 
cash and tax points and equalization payments, they are receiving 
today $3 billion more than when we started.

Mr. Speaker, yesterday when the Prime Minister was questioned 
about an investigation by the RCMP on CITEC, a company in his 
riding, he replied, “As soon as my office was informed, the RCMP 
were informed within minutes”.  However, the former Liberal 
minister of tourism in Quebec, André Vallerand, has stated that 
he waited over a month for the PMO and HRDC to reply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a contradiction.  Who is correct, Mr. Vallerand or the 
Prime Minister?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, as soon as my office was informed, the same day when 
they realized that there was an accusation of that nature, they 
called the RCMP. From there it was the responsibility of the 
RCMP.  If they did not call Mr. Vallerand it has nothing to do 
with my office.  My office acted absolutely properly in acting 
the same day in transferring the problem.

Mr. Speaker, let me try this again. What was the exact date that 
the Prime Minister was made aware of the investigation from Mr. 
Vallerand?  What did they do with that information and when did 
they contact the RCMP? In other words, what did the Prime 
Minister know and when did he forget?

here is another name.  Remember René Fugère, the fellow who 
profited from the famous hotel grant?  Well, it looks like old 
René has been up to his tricks again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In February 1998 the Opitciwan sawmill applied for a TJF grant 
and was told by HRD that there was absolutely no money left in 
the kitty.  That seems kind of strange because along comes 
Fugère—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>   Mr. Speaker, in February 1998 the 
Opticiwan sawmill applied for a TJF grant and was told by HRD 
that there was absolutely no money left in the kitty.  All of a 
sudden, along comes Mr. Fugère, the Prime Minister's buddy. The 
minister's office gets involved and just like magic $300,000 
appears. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that public money follows Mr. Fugère like an orphaned

<P><A NAME="LINK153"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

leader said it is 21 years since the auditor general talked about 
grants and contributions and the need for us to improve our 
administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad to say to the hon. member we are doing just that.  In 
the context of grants and contributions in my department we are 
going to work to build the best system of modern comptrollership 
that is second to none in North America. This is an important 
undertaking and we are going to fix our problem and be the better 
for it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK154"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it wears thin.  I am sure hon. ministers have been saying that 
for 21 years now and we know who was in power then. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a cast of thousands involved here.  Even the current 
HRD minister had her hand in this pie when she was at Indian 
affairs. She wrote a letter approving $200,000 in funding to that 
sawmill right around the same time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was René Fugère who had the magic touch.  HRD officials said 
they had no money for any project, until they realized that Mr.

the premise of the hon. member's question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear here yet again that on this side of the House we 
know that there is a role for the Government of Canada to play in

Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart:</B>  What is clear from the questioning 
from that side of the House is that they do not accept that there 
is a role for the Government of Canada to play. They talk about 
waste.  I point out again and again and again, it cannot be a 
waste to support students with Canada student loans.  It cannot 
be a waste to support parents who want to save for their 
children's education.  It cannot be a waste to support Canadians 
with disabilities so that they can have an opportunity—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques,

Saint-Maurice, received a $1.2 million grant. When that company 
went bankrupt, Human Resources and Development Canada put the 
money into a trust then gave it to the new owner, something 
which goes against the rules set by Treasury Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the minister explain that her own department is 
violating her government's administrative directives?

<P><A NAME="LINK157"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

earlier, before Christmas.  I accepted that there were 
administrative problems with the decisions that the hon. member 
is actually making.  That is why to me it is so important to 
undertake the six point plan, to implement it, to improve the 
administration of grants and contributions in my department 
because it is the foundation for these important contributions 
that the Government of Canada makes in the lives of Canadians.

not want any investigation. Yet, it is a great concern to see 
that the trustee appointed by HRDC was also the lawyer for 
Claude Gauthier, the person who bought the company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this a pure coincidence? Absolutely not. Between 1993 and

<P><A NAME="LINK159"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

reviewed in the House before.  Fundamental in everything here is 
that these questions are old news.  The issue that has been 
raised was raised by us.  The identification that we could do a 
better job in administration was raised by us.  We are going to 
work to improve the system of administration and in so doing 
ensure that the contributions that the Government of Canada makes 
in the riding of the hon. member and every other member of the 
House will be secure, will be strong and will be there in the 
future. 
<P><A NAME="LINK160"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, here are a few interesting facts.  In March HRDC said it 
could not fund the sawmill application because it had zero money 
left.  In July HRDC said, “Look, quit asking.  We already told 
you, all the money has been spent”.  In August the Prime 
Minister's personal representative let HRDC know that it would 
have to deal with him on the sawmill file.  Shortly thereafter 
HRDC mysteriously came up with over $250,000 for the sawmill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is there about the Prime Minister's buddy that forces 
public servants to scramble to do his bidding? 
<P><A NAME="LINK161"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as a result of our undertakings in 
reviewing our grants and contributions, we are looking at all our 
files.  The active files will be clarified and any necessary 
action taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart:</B>  Again I want to remind the House that 
when we are talking about transitional jobs fund grants and 
Canada jobs fund grants, not only are members of parliament 
involved, but the decisions include the consensus of or the 
acceptance by the governments in that jurisdiction, including the 
province of Quebec in this case and other governments like the 
kissing cousins of the Reform Party on decisions made in Ontario. 
<P><A NAME="LINK162"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am just asking about one decision.  Perhaps the 
minister could give a straight answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>HRDC rejected the sawmill application not once but twice. Then 
Fugère showed up and money magically was shaken loose in the 
department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What connections does this man have that he is able to pressure 
civil servants in her department into changing their decisions? 
<P><A NAME="LINK163"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not going to accept the allegations 
made by the hon. member here today.  What I will confirm, as I 
have confirmed over and over again, is that we are reviewing the 
files associated with the grants and contributions in my 
department.  We will continue to make that information available 
and public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  The hon. minister of Human 
Resources Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart:</B>  Mr. Speaker, fundamentally what is 
clear here is that the opposition is caught up in its own 
rhetoric and cannot get moving forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we know to be true is that Canadians understand this issue. 
They know that we are fixing the problem. They are probably 
sitting at home right now wondering why the parties on the other 
side are not asking about the important priorities that are 
facing them today.

<P><A NAME="LINK164"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister 
continues to refuse to put Placeteco under investigation. Yet, 
Placeteco refuses to be accountable to her department, because 
that company no longer feels bound by the grant it received 
through a trust which, incidentally, was not legal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister finally agree that the time has come to launch 
an investigation at the earliest opportunity?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

questions.  That is why last week we tabled the largest volume of 
information the House has ever seen in its history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member asked about an independent review. I say again 
that an independent officer of the House, the auditor general, 
will be doing a full review of the transitional jobs fund and the 
grants and contributions in my department.  That is good enough 
for me.

when the file had not yet been finalized. By the way, no jobs 
were created. In fact, some jobs were even lost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the minister tell us why there is still no investigation,

it?

<P><A NAME="LINK167"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development,

opportunities in an area of very high unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we have said, and as I have talked about before, in this 
particular project administrative errors were made.  They have 
been clarified.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, you 
will remember René Fugère.  He was the fellow who arranged for 
some TJF grants for the Auberge des Gouverneurs and the Auberge 
Grand-Mère .  The trouble was that he was an unregistered 
lobbyist and for his work he got an ongoing investigation by the 
RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why, when this same fellow, René Fugère, came along after the 
HRD minister's department twice rejected the application for 
another grant, was it suddenly manna from heaven and the 
minister's department approved a grant application from the Prime 
Minister's buddy? 
<P><A NAME="LINK169"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in this particular case we will obtain 
the details and provide them to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to be clear that in all of these undertakings the 
intention was to create jobs to support Canadians in an area of 
high unemployment.  In all of these undertakings the province of 
Quebec had to agree with the undertaking, and it did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government was but one partner in these 
undertakings.  There are many others.  Fundamentally, they have 
made a difference in this riding and in so many others of high 
unemployment.  Canadians understand that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK170"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
big question is, why did two applications in a row get turned 
down by the minister's departmental officials in HRD, but when 
Mr. Fugère came along it was pennies from heaven?  That $300,000 
was given even though the application had been rejected twice 
before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the minister is investigating she could look at a memo 
from August 3 which details how Mr. Fugère went on to say to the 
local human resources department in Shawinigan that he had 
another deal that he would like to talk to them about as well. 
Could she tell us what that deal is? 
<P><A NAME="LINK171"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me remind the hon. member again that 
in all of these undertakings the Government of Canada is but one 
partner.  In the context of community development there are 
provincial partners, there are local partners, there are private 
sector partners.  As a result of these undertakings Canadians who 
otherwise would not have an opportunity are working.

my question as well has to do with Placeteco, which is still not 
under investigation at this time, but could be sooner than the 
government thinks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister hired a consultant to review the Placeteco file.

North Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, with respect to 
health care, this budget has been universally dismissed as a half 
measure, a band-aid, anemic, paltry and a morsel.  Canadians can 
see it, patients can see it, health care advocates can see it and 
the premiers can see it.  Why can the minister not see it? 
<P><A NAME="LINK183"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, this is the fourth budget in a row in which the 
government has increased health care transfers to the provinces. 
Last year's budget was the largest single investment this 
government ever made and it was in health care.  Over the last 
two budgets there has been a 25% increase in transfers to the 
provinces for health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the Minister of Health has asked his colleagues to 
meet with him to look at the development of longer term solutions 
within the context of the protection of universal health care. 
When that happens this government will be there. 
<P><A NAME="LINK184"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, what is clear from this budget is that the government 
has replaced bracket creep with privatization creep.  It is 
absolutely clear that the paltry initiative on health care in 
this budget is being interpreted as an open invitation for the 
likes of Klein and Harris to privatize, Americanize and downsize 
our public health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the Minister of Finance or the Minister of Health not see 
that this budget leaves the door wide open to private, for 
profit, two tier health care? 
<P><A NAME="LINK185"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
to lend an air of reality to this discussion the member should 
know that every year public spending on health in Canada is about 
$60 billion.  This government transfers to provinces a total of 
$40 billion, so naturally we are playing a major role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The measures announced yesterday are intended to assist 
provinces with urgent short term needs.  As the Minister of 
Finance has just observed, I want to work with my colleagues in 
the provinces on a long term plan.  A long term plan will involve 
long term financing and this government will be there to do its 
part.

will again read from the letter of recommendation by the

now, the Obedjiwan people have shown a desire to take charge of 
their affairs and to innovate.  In this context, one can 
appreciate the economic impact of creating 100 jobs for these 
people”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a job creation project, such as are to be found in all

I will ask the question a second time.  Not once but twice the 
sawmill was refused a grant by local HRDC officials.  The same 
company used up two lifelines.  Then it called a friend, a friend 
of the Prime Minister, and guess what?  It received a grant of 
$300,000.

created 66.   It gave Canadians in a very remote area the 
opportunity to work and we support it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Paddy Torsney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the

New dollars will enable the government to protect species at

for the province of Quebec.  The project was a good project.  As 
money became available we invested in this very rural part of the 
province of Quebec because the Bloc member said it was a good 
thing to do, the province of Quebec said it was a good thing to 
do and the government felt it was a good thing to do.  Sixty-six

nothing.  I would say that increased transfers to the provinces 
is substantial.  The fact is that increased cultural content on 
the Internet so students can take advantage of it is substantial. 
Nine hundred million dollars for research chairs and teaching 
chairs so the universities can provide a decent education is 
substantial.  Increasing the tax exemption for scholarships and 
bursaries from $500 to $3,000 is substantial.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  Mr. Speaker, a company in my greater 
Saint John area applied to ACOA for $500,000 and it was putting 
up $385,000 of its own money.  It was okayed by the local office 
but when it came here the company was told it had to take $1 
million.  What did Ottawa want it to do with the other $500,000, 
send in a contribution?

the chartered banks under the Liberal administration.  That is 
thanks to the good management of the government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>—a Member may not make material changes in the meaning of what 
was said in the House. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The editors may likewise alter a sentence to render it more 
readable but may not go so far as to change its meaning.  Editors 
must ensure that the <I>Debates</I> are a faithful reflection of 
what was said; 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It then goes on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Substantial errors, as opposed to editorial changes, must be 
brought to the attention of the House by a means of a point of 
order, as soon as possible after the sitting, 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On page 769, it says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Member may correct the record of his or her own statement, but 
may not correct that of another Member. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not be long but I think that the matter is important.  I 
would like to quote, in part, the Prime Minister from yesterday. 
This was in response to my supplementary question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to inform the House of Commons that in the case of 
the riding of Vancouver Island North the riding of the member has 
received $52 million in HRDC grants. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He then goes on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are good programs that we have put in his riding despite 
perhaps his opposition because those people do not want us to 
help the poor and the needy. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>Hansard</I> then says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Wrong riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find no fault in what <I>Hansard</I> said yesterday but what 
bothers me is what came down in the blues.  If you will just bear 
with me, Mr. Speaker, I will make that, I think, clear to you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I would like you to keep in mind that a member may 
correct only what he says but not what somebody else says. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I received the blues yesterday my staff noticed that, in 
the first sentence that I quoted, the words “the riding of the 
member” were not included.  The Prime Minister's statement was 
altered to remove the words “the riding of the member”.  As 
well, the word “his” in the sentence “these are good programs 
that we have put in his riding” was changed to “this”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My staff informed the folk at <I>Hansard</I> that the blues were 
not an accurate reflection of what was said in the House.  What 
was said in the House was quite clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern is that the blues, as we received them, were 
inaccurate and a gross misrepresentation of what the Prime 
Minister said, and if my staff had not been vigilant and had not 
taken the time to read that, an incorrect version of what was 
said in the House would have appeared in <I>Hansard</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That bothers me because I do not think it should be my job or 
the job of my staff to review what somebody else is saying on the 
record in this place and yet it seems that is the case.  I would 
like to know how that error, an error of that magnitude, could be 
made in the blues which we received, because that would have been 
the official record as I understand it if we had not been brought 
it to the attention of House personnel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  As I understand it, the blues are a first 
pass or first cut if you will and notwithstanding the fact that I 
am glad that the hon. member did take the time to make the 
correction, at this point at least I am not sure that the 
correction would not have been made when you put the words which 
were recorded in juxtaposition. 
We have a recording of what was said and we have it on 
television.

<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on a point of clarification on the discussion we 
have just had.  When someone asks a question in question period 
and there is a response, normally the questioner gets the blues 
for the question in his or her office.  Unless we make a special 
request we do not often get the answer.  We just get the question 
the individual asked.  This leads to a potential vacuum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of standard practice it might actually be a more 
suitable arrangement to provide both ends of the dialogue to both 
parties so that there is a natural check and balance on that 
process.  I am wondering if that request would be appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Ordinarily what happens is that when a 
specific member asks for the blues we usually interpret that to 
be what he or she said in the House.  If a member wants extra 
information then I am sure it can be provided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to it being provided automatically, I do not know if we 
should give what is on that page, what is on the previous page, 
or what is on another page.  For greater certainty, I would 
advise that when members ask for their blues, that is what they 
said, they can change or at least clarify what they said.  Then 
if they want the response it should be added to it. In that way 
there would be no question about it.  Most times they just want 
to know that they were correctly quoted in the blues and then 
subsequently in <I>Hansard</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I did not want to turn 
this into a debate.  It was not my intention, but I think what my 
colleague was saying was that vacuum does exist when we only 
receive one-half of a discussion.  It just happened, I guess 
because of the positioning on the paper, that I received the 
transcript of what the Prime Minister said, so that check was not 
there.  It might be helpful, when there is an exchange in 
question period, if both sides were distributed.  If you could 
take that under consideration, Mr. Speaker, I think it might be 
helpful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I am sure the hon. member for Delta—South 
Richmond will revisit what I have just said today.  He asked me 
to take it under consideration.  I am always open to advice from 
any member of the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale—High Park, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for Stoney 
Creek.  I rise today to congratulate the Minister of Finance on 
budget 2000, the first budget of the 21st century and the next 
step in the government's balanced and comprehensive plan to make 
Canada the place to be in the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to use my time to highlight parts of the budget by 
comparing it to the main priorities of my constituents, which 
were elicited during prebudget consultations last year. Prebudget 
consultations have become an annual event in my riding.  Every 
year I meet with local business representatives, community 
activists and members of various community organizations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year I also distributed a prebudget questionnaire in my 
riding and solicited responses through a local newspaper. 
Following the consultations I prepared a report which was then 
forwarded to the Minister of Finance, the Parliamentary Secretary 
to Minister of Finance and to the chair of the Standing Committee 
on Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday the Minister of Finance thanked Canadians who shared 
their ideas and insights with the Standing Committee on Finance. 
Today I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who 
participated in my consultations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When asked what should be the government's main priority in 
terms of investing the projected budget surplus, the great 
consensus among my constituents was a balanced approach. However, 
three major priorities dominated these consultations. First, 40% 
felt that the government should continue to repay the debt. 
Second, 35% felt that the government should renew spending and 
investment in key sectors.  Finally, 25% advocated tax cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Virtually everyone during my consultations felt that some action 
was necessary to pay down the debt.  Every year I am finding 
increased understanding of the debt issue: how large it is in 
terms of the government's overall finances and how much of our 
revenues are eaten up in interest payments.  I am increasingly 
hearing that if we are unable to retire a substantial part of the 
debt during the current relative boom, how will we be able to do 
so when some day we face a recession? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Others have pointed out the riskiness in very deep tax cuts 
while the debt and interest payments are still so high.  Once 
again the concern is centred on the prospects of an eventual 
recession.  If taxes are substantially reduced now, it will be 
politically difficult to raise them again in recessionary times. 
However, no one has suggested that debt reduction should be the 
government's singular priority.  Most people felt that we were 
now in a position to reduce debt, address a host of social needs 
and cut taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did yesterday's budget say about the debt?  The Minister of 
Finance confirmed that we would not abandon the balanced approach 
which the government adopted from the beginning, an approach 
which recognizes that debt reduction, tax relief and spending on 
health, post-secondary education and other priorities are not 
competing claims but complementary components of a fair and 
effective plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that the government inherited a record $42 
million deficit in 1993.  Yet Canada has not just eliminated this 
deficit.  We are one of the few countries that is now reducing 
the absolute amount of its debt and will indeed continue to do 
so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past two years we have paid down the debt by $6 
million, resulting in interest savings alone of more than $300 
million a year each and every year.  The budget also confirmed 
that we would continue to set aside a $3 billion contingency 
reserve to protect against unforeseen events.  In accordance with 
our debt repayment plan we will continue to use the contingency 
reserve fund to reduce the debt when it is not needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's debt to gross domestic product ratio, which measures 
the amount of debt against the size of our economy, has markedly 
improved.  In 1995 Canada's debt ratio was 71%.  Today it has 
dropped to 61% and we predict that it will fall to 50% by 2004. 
Beyond this the downward track must continue.  We are still a 
long way away from the 25% ratio Canada enjoyed in the late 
1960s, which in fact was the last time our books were in the 
black. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second priority of my constituents was increased social 
spending with health care, a children's agenda, the environment, 
affordable housing and eased access to post-secondary education 
being most often recommended.  Several constituents in fact 
pointed out that spending such as this should indeed be looked 
upon as investment in human capital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am delighted to advise my constituents that all their top 
priorities were also the government's top priorities.  In fact 
the very first announcement the Minister of Finance made in his 
first budget of the 21st century was to increase funding for 
post-secondary education and health care.  Moreover the Minister 
of Finance confirmed “these are priorities of Canadians and they 
are ours”. 
That is why budget 2000 transfers an additional $2.5 billion over 
four years through the Canada health social transfers to help 
provinces and territories to address pressing health care and 
post-secondary education concerns.

<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the Minister of Finance acknowledged that 
scholarships and bursaries were an important part of expanding 
our access to higher learning.  Therefore, to ensure that more 
students receive their full value the budget increases the tax 
exemption from its current level of $500 to $3,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The environment was also addressed in this budget.  The Minister 
of Finance has made it absolutely clear that protecting the 
environment is no longer an option.  It is something that we must 
do.  For Canada to be the place to be in the 21st century our lakes 
and air must be clean, our green spaces and diverse habitat and 
species must be protected, and we must deal with climate change. 
Consequently budget 2000 proposes to invest $700 million to 
promote the government's environmental agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget also specifically noted that affordable housing was 
also an essential element of our modern society and critical to 
meeting the 21st century needs of our municipalities.  Moreover, 
the government announced its intention to improve provincial and 
municipal infrastructure in cities by committing $450 million 
over the next two years and $550 million in each of the following 
four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most important commitment made in the budget was to assist 
families and our children.  Assisting families is not only the 
smart thing to do.  It is the right thing to do.  Governments can 
do this in two ways:  through income assistance and support for 
services on which so many of our families rely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Budget 2000 takes action on both fronts.  First, it enriches the 
Canada child tax benefit with another $2.5 billion by the year 
2004, increasing it to more than $9 billion annually.  Second, 
the budget doubles the duration of employment insurance, 
maternity and parental benefits to 12 months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very quickly let us go to my constituents' third priority, tax 
relief.  Although tax cuts were not as widely advocated as debt 
reduction and social spending, it was evident that the need for 
them is growing.  The majority of my constituents advocated tax 
relief for lower income families, especially those with children. 
Employment insurance premium reductions, indexation and other 
across the board tax cuts were also adhered to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again budget 2000 has responded to my constituents' 
concern.  We have delivered a five year tax reduction plan that 
provides an average reduction of 21% to middle and low income 
families with children by the year 2000.  The budget restores 
full indexation to the personal income tax system immediately and 
retroactively to January 1, 2000.  Over the next five years we 
will increase the amount Canadians can receive tax free to at 
least $8,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget also decreases tax rates which have not come down in 
the last 12 years.  Over the next five years the middle tax rate 
will be reduced from 26% to 23%.  Effective July 1, 2000, the 
rate will be reduced to 25%.  In addition, the income level at 
which the middle tax rate begins to apply has been increased to 
$35,000.  Since 1994 employment insurance rates have been reduced 
each and every year from $3.07 to $2.40.  The budget also assumes 
that these rates will continue to fall to $2 by the year 2004. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, I repeat what the Minister of Finance said 
yesterday in his closing remarks: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a budget with many elements, but a single theme: creating 
better lives for Canadians in a rapidly changing world. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the budget may have many elements, it attempts to address 
the main priorities of not only my constituents but of all 
Canadians.  It does so with one major objective:  to translate 
better finances into a better quality of life for all Canadians. 
Let us never forget that the values of our society are reflected 
in the fiscal choices we make.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened 
intently to the speech and was really interested in the 
feedback the member had from people in her riding.  It is 
consistent with what I get from the people in my riding. 
I would like some clarification.  In the last half of her speech 
the member went through her list pretty much in the same order of 
priorities as the finance minister did in the budget speech with 
debt repayment last.  Yet if I heard correctly at the beginning 
of her speech she indicated that the highest priority of people 
in her riding was to reduce the debt.  I think it was around 40% 
and that was the highest rate. I am wondering whether the member 
would confirm that I heard correctly.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to remind all members of the House that the 
debt reduction plan of the government is dismal indeed.  In the 
document I received yesterday the net public debt every year from 
1998 onward to the projection into the year 2001-02 is $576.8 
billion, $576.8 billion, $576.8 billion, $576.8 billion, the same 
number four years in a row. There is no plan for debt reduction 
at all, except there is $3 billion in a contingency fund and if 
we do not find some place to spend it, yes, we will apply it to 
the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the hon. member's comments and clarification on 
what I think I heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member was right.  He did 
hear that 40% of my constituents advocated debt reduction but I also stated 
very clearly that no one in my riding suggested that debt reduction 
should be the government's singular priority.  Most people felt 
that we were now in a position to reduce debt, address social 
needs and cut taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were three approaches and three priorities.  One perhaps 
is a little ahead, but no singular one was there alone.  We 
looked at three priorities and that is exactly what this budget 
addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the debt repayment, the hon. member has said 
that we do not have any plans at all to reduce the debt but that 
is not the case at all. We have reduced the debt by $6 billion. 
In fact yesterday in his speech the Minister of Finance also 
noted that market debt, the debt which is issued in financial 
markets, has fallen even further and by the end of this fiscal 
year we will have reduced it by close to $20 billion. So in fact 
the plan is in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us also not forget what the Minister of Finance said 
yesterday in his opening remarks.  We will not abandon our 
balanced approach, the approach that this government has taken 
since it was elected to office in 1993.  Again we are following 
what we said we are going to do. We are tackling the main 
priorities of Canadians but we are doing it in a balanced and 
comprehensive manner. 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have heard enough from the Liberals today to assume 
that each one of them has been handed a little sheet of paper 
with a message that says if they are asked questions about tax 
transfers and cash for health care, they are to deflect, 
obfuscate and confuse and try to suddenly throw in a tax point 
argument so that Canadians are put off guard and the Liberals can 
somehow finagle their way through this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that all members read page 67 of the budget of 1997 
where it clearly says that what matters for program spending is 
the cash.  The government knows and we know that the cash is 
needed to hold provinces accountable to the Canada Health Act. 
How does the government intend to do that?  If we roll in the 
meagre amount that is in the budget, the federal government is up 
to a 15% share of health care financing in the country.  How is 
it going to hold provinces to account and stop premiers like 
Klein, Harris and others interested in privatization? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte:</B>  Mr. Speaker, first I would like to 
assure the member that I have not been passed any notes by any 
officials of any department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to take this opportunity to tell the member 
and all of my constituents that I actually wrote my own speech. 
I do not read speeches of the Department of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The important thing is when we talk about the budget that we 
also talk about the things we ask our constituents.  In the 
economic update in November, the finance minister asked Canadians 
to join in the debate as to what to do with that surplus. 
What we are going to do with that surplus will determine the 
Canada of the future.  That is what we did.  We went out and 
sought Canadians' input, me in my riding.  With all due respect 
to the member, whom I respect very highly, when she claims that 
we are trying to confuse people with tax points, she is trying to 
confuse people by saying tax points do not play a role.  Where—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Order, please.  If I waited 
for the member to take a breath, we would still be waiting, but 
the hon. member's time has expired. 
<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Stoney Creek, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
certainly a pleasure to speak on the budget today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for Parkdale—High Park indicated, certainly 
members on this side of the House consult with their 
constituencies.  I did on the prebudget consultation. Quite 
clearly what came back from my constituency was the direction to 
essentially focus on the tax file and ensure that Canadians are 
able to keep more money for their hard work and to ensure the 
fiscal management we have provided over the last number of years 
is consistent and to also pay down debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Elk Island often speaks of debt reduction.  On a 
constant basis we do provide that continued reduction of the debt 
certainly on a debt to GDP ratio basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I would like to provide brief highlights in terms of the 
tax file.  I would also like to deal with something specific that 
is in the budget, something which I and others in particular 
sectors have worked on.  That is foreign trade zones, referred to 
as export distribution centres in the budget itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will start with the tax file in terms of what we have been 
able to provide.  We provided some structural changes to the tax 
file.  The reindexing of the tax system is certainly critical. 
Canadians at the lower end of the income scale will certainly 
benefit from reindexation.  We have provided a reduction in the 
middle bracket from 26% to 23%.  We will move to 24% relatively 
quickly.  We will essentially provide a cumulative amount of $58 
billion of tax reduction over the next number of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personal income taxes will be reduced on an average of 15%, and 
over 20% for Canadian families with children.  We targeted the 
Canada child tax benefit.  Most members know that it is the 
government's primary means of helping families.  Some 90% of all 
children in Canada will receive benefits.  Over the past three 
budgets we have invested a total of some $2 billion in this 
particular program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like the Minister of Finance, and I would suspect most members 
in the House, I believe that assisting families is not only the 
smart thing to do but it is the right thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard some discussion about the transfers to the 
provinces.  The budget transfers $2.5 billion in addition to the 
$11.5 billion.  We should make it very clear as members get up 
over and over in the House, as the Minister of Finance got up in 
question period, that the additional $2.5 billion is not the last 
of our commitment to health care.  The ministers of health from 
the provinces are getting together in May.  They need to put 
together a plan that will deal with the health care challenges in 
the country.  Once they do, and if in fact it does require 
additional funding, the Minister of Finance has already said very 
clearly that the national government is certainly going to be 
there with more money for health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As chair of the economic development committee in caucus, we are 
presently studying the electronic commerce and the new economy in 
Canada.  For me in particular I was very pleased to see the 
announcements in the budget concerning e-business or e-commerce. 
Budget 2000 has put Canada in a stronger position to accelerate 
its leadership in the Internet economy and to encourage Internet 
investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the papers this morning the managing director of the Boston 
Consulting Group of Canada commented on the budget.  He is also 
the co-chair of the Canadian e-business opportunities round 
table.  He commented, “It is encouraging to see government 
on-line emerge as a major priority in the budget.  The government 
is dedicating serious money, $160 million over the next two 
years”. He went on to comment about the improvements where we 
have effectively reduced the capital gains tax by taking it from 
75% and reducing it to an inclusion rate of two-thirds and also 
the new treatment of the stock options.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of research, innovation and that sector of the economy, 
members are certainly aware that there is an additional $900 
million put in place with respect to the Canada Foundation for 
Innovation.  There is the funding of the century chairs for 
research excellence.  All of these areas speak to the new economy 
and speak to the brain drain in a lot of ways. Researchers have 
said over and over again that it is research money and research 
grants that will allow them to do the work they need to do in 
Canada and to not exit the country.  That is the kind of 
brainpower we want to keep here in our great country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure members are aware of the Federation of Canadian 
Municipalities and its proposal with respect to the quality of 
life program.  The Minister of Finance has responded with an 
infrastructure program, a quality of life program that deals with 
road infrastructure and certainly deals with affordable housing 
as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my constituency of Stoney Creek there are real demands to 
deal with road construction, road infrastructure, urban 
congestion and certainly to maintain the trade corridors that we 
have been fortunate enough to develop in the province of Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me spend a few moments on what we call the export 
distribution centres.  When we talk about foreign trade zones 
many members certainly associate them with the United States.  We 
in Canada have a geographic location which we need to take 
advantage of.  We need to exploit it in fact.  Our our proximity 
to Europe and to Asia is such that goods that are trying to 
access the North American market can flow through Canada.  We can 
become a gateway to the North American market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are changes proposed in this budget that will facilitate 
and in a lot of ways create the logistics industry that has been 
lacking in this country.  The changes proposed in this budget 
will allow Canadian companies and entrepreneurs to set up shop 
and attract European manufacturers who are looking to access the 
North American market.  They will allow these Canadian 
entrepreneurs to add value, to set up shop and to deal with 
products as they flow through to the North American market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We made some changes back in 1996.  We dealt with bonded 
warehouses.  We dealt with duty deferral programs.  That was 
initially our response to foreign trade zones.  We did not see it 
happen.  We did not see foreign trade zones begin to flourish in 
this country.  With the additional provisions in this budget we 
are now providing to independent Canadian companies expanded 
capabilities to handle goods for overseas manufacturers and to 
add Canadian value and content not only free of duty but also 
free of GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also able to attract foreign manufacturers who themselves 
can establish operations in Canada within a foreign trade zone to 
undertake this value added activity.  What does it mean? It means 
jobs and additional revenue for us as a country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of Canadian firms are already accessing this type of 
provision through U.S. foreign trade zones.  We need to 
repatriate that type of opportunity.  What does that mean?  For 
communities like Vancouver, Winnipeg, Hamilton and Montreal right 
through to Gander, at locations like airports and ports where 
there is a natural infrastructure and a natural gateway to the 
North American market, it means that these areas can take 
advantage of this type of provision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does this really mean?  The export distribution centres 
provision in budget 2000 presents an excellent opportunity for us 
as a country with respect to economic development.  I mentioned 
some cities but that is only to name a few.  We can challenge 
many others to deal with this export development opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a geographical advantage, as I have indicated.  We are 
closer to Europe.  We are closer to Asia.  We need to take 
advantage of that. Combined with the announced tax cuts for small 
business, the general corporate tax cuts, the personal income 
taxes and the improvements in road infrastructure that will take 
place when we finally come to an agreement with the provinces and 
the regional municipalities, we are positioned with these 
provisions to grow a logistic sector and a value added sector in 
Canada.  It will increase jobs.  It will improve the opportunity 
for jobs right across the country, from Atlantic Canada to 
Ontario, right through to the western provinces and certainly in 
Quebec as well.

people are disappointed by this budget, regardless of what the 
hon. member of the Liberal party says. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget contains some slip-ups.  There could have been a 
significant sum invested in the social transfer in order to 
alleviate the burden of the provinces and to be in a position to 
meet the needs of the population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier in his remarks, the member praised our health care 
system, saying that sensitivity to demands in that area was 
required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote him from an article in this morning's <I>Le

expenditures.  He writes:

</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the hon. member headed with this praise of his 
government, saying that it is investing $5.2 billion in response 
to provincial requirements in the areas of health, education and 
social security? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning, I heard what some welfare recipients had to say. 
Social housing was forgotten.  There was an expectation of 
$1.6 billion yearly, for a total of $8 billion, but the figure 
ended up being a pitiful $57 million over four years.  The hon. 
member better not try to tell me that this budget shows the 
government has its heart in the right place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to hear his reply to this. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to 
respond to the hon. member.   When we look at the investment of 
$2.5 billion as an increase in transfers I think we ought to look 
at it in the context of the additional $11.5 billion in the last 
budget.  I said earlier in my speech that the commitment to 
provide additional money for health care is certainly there.  It 
has been made by the finance minister.  It will be incumbent on 
provincial health ministers to come up with a plan that will 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to mention to the hon. member, since she brought up 
the question of transfers to the provinces, that she should not 
forget that the province of Quebec is one of the provinces that 
receives equalization payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know whether this is the correct figure but I am sure 
it is in or about an approximate one.  In the last budget we had 
about a $1.4 billion increase in equalization payments which I 
believe the province of Quebec put to its bottom line.  It 
certainly had an opportunity to continue to run the deficits as 
it always does in that province or to put that increase in 
equalization payments into health care. It had the opportunity 
but it chose to put it to the bottom line.

addresses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the member on the opposite side that due to his 
government's inaction trade with Europe has fallen dramatically. 
We know that it is on the rise, but what it used to be 
historically is not there due to the government's high taxes over 
previous years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member talked about infrastructure.  This budget has 
only committed $150 million toward infrastructure.  We know, and 
everybody knows, there has been a huge outcry because of a need 
for infrastructure investment.  Why did his government not use 
the dedicated taxes it collects and invest them in 
infrastructure?  Why was such a key area not addressed in this 
budget?

the lack of trade or the reduction in trade with Canada was particularly 
due to the high corporate taxes in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the hon. member would like to travel to Europe at some 
time, or I could provide him with some reading material which 
shows that most European countries have higher corporate taxes, 
certainly higher payroll taxes, than we have in Canada.  The

taxes are job killers and reduce the outflow of the economy.  Yet 
he makes reference to Europe.

for the hon. member to go back to his community and do his part 
in terms of trying to increase trade with European countries, to 
use Canada as the gateway to the NAFTA countries, and to ensure 
that perhaps individuals in his community have the opportunity to

pleased to rise in the House today to address the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing that struck me yesterday, both in this House and 
outside—from what we could see and hear—is that Quebecers and 
Canadians no longer trust this government to manage public 
funds, absolutely not. There are a number of reasons for this, 
the main one being, of course, the ever bigger scandal at Human 
Resources Development Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this government gets its hands on public money, what it 
does with that money is far from being for the well-being of the 
general public. 
More specifically, as regards this budget, we can mention three 
major disappointments shared by many people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, there is no real tax relief this year. The 
government had promised to lower taxes. It even boasted about 
it, saying “Yes the tax burden of Canadians and Quebecers will 
be reduced”. Well, it is not the case this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the transfers to the provinces are ridiculously low 
compared to the needs that the provinces must meet year after 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, some claim that this government's heart is in the right 
place. Nothing could be further from the truth, because there is 
absolutely nothing in this budget for the poor and the 
unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will discuss each of these points separately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could talk for hours about these issues. Unfortunately, we 
have very little time. Yet, we could level many criticisms at 
this budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone knows the priorities of Quebecers and Canadians are 
health care and education.  We know.  We hear it talked about 
everywhere.  So what is there in this budget for health and 
education?  Pittance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They talk of an increase of $2.5 billion over four years, when 
the provinces were unanimously calling for $4.2 billion this year 
alone, increasing to $4.4 billion next year and $4.6 billion the 
following year, that is, indexed for the following years.  And 
what will they get?  A mere $2.5 billion over four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance could have done a lot better with the 
surpluses he has.  He talked of $95 billion over five years, when 
we know very well that he will have $137 billion available over 
five years.  The Minister of Finance is playing squirrel again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also learn that the $2.5 billion allocated to the one time 
payment for health and education will be charged to 1999-2000. 
Another game of the hand is quicker than the eye to make the 
surpluses the government has in hand disappear.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is keeping his old, less than transparent 
management practices.  They are camouflaging figures to make us 
believe that Ottawa does not have the means to give back to the 
provinces, and Quebec especially, what it stole from them for 
its election coffers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is worse to come.  Quebecers, who are watching us, and I 
know there are many of them, realize that Quebec is the real 
loser in this political announcement, despite what my Liberal 
predecessor was saying.  After being forced to cut in health 
care, education and social assistance, Quebec will bear over 50% 
of the total cuts to the Canada social transfer. 
It represents 25% of the population but it has to absorb 50% of 
the cuts.  That is what federalism means for Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By including tax points, the Minister of Finance is saying that 
the total Canada social transfer between 1999 and 2004 will be 
$156 billion.  I think the time is long overdue to lay the tax 
point myth to rest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The increase to $156 billion is due solely to the value of tax 
points which, for the same five-year period, will increase from 
$14.9 billion to $17.2 billion.  These tax points are not 
transfers.  They are revenues that belong, and have long 
belonged, to the provinces and to Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the federal government, the Canada social transfer 
constitutes a transfer of cash and tax points. 
But the Canada social transfer does not consist of cash 
transfers alone, because the federal government turned over the 
tax points a good thirty years ago, before I was born. 
Furthermore, the federal government has no say in how these tax 
points are allocated.  So always wanting to include tax points 
in the Canada social transfer is completely ridiculous and 
completely misleading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the Minister of Finance also say?  He says “Canada 
Health and Social Transfer payments will be increased by $2.5 
billion.  This budget announces an additional $2.5 billion in 
CHST support, providing an added $1 billion in 2000-01 and $500 
million a year in each of the following three years. This means 
that the cash component of the CHST will reach $15.5 billion in 
each of the next four years”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cash transfers will not be raised $2.5 billion, because they will 
be put in trust, temporarily at least, until the enabling 
legislation is passed.  This has not happened because of the 
decision by the Bloc Quebecois, in response to the demand of the 
people of Quebec, to ensure that Bill C-20 and all other bills 
introduced by this government are, if not blocked, at least 
slowed down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Returning to this trust, we do not know what this is.  Does 
this mean that the social union is going to apply from now on to 
cash social transfers?  Is this to prepare us a bit in advance 
for the “coast to coast” programs that are the dream of several 
of those ministers and members across the way, who love to spend 
money?  All this is yet to be determined?  We do not know yet? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Returning to the cuts, they are a great little horror story for 
Quebec. 
Between 1994 and 2003, the provinces will have undergone 
$33 billion in cuts under the Liberal administration.  In fact, 
even if the ceiling for the social transfer is raised from 
$12.5 billion to $15.5 billion in coming years, Quebec's share 
will drop from $3.9 billion in 1999-2000 to $3.6 billion in 2002-03. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is Ottawa trying to do?  Ottawa wants the provinces to 
struggle, their heads barely above water, while it is floating 
nicely along amidst a huge surplus.  This is one concrete 
example of the extreme federalism against which Yves Michaud 
spoke out not so long ago.  They want the provinces to be 
nothing more than big municipalities, with Ottawa calling the 
shots and the provinces carrying them out.  What they are in the 
process of doing with the social union is to turn Canada into a 
kind of de facto unitary state.

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This may not be what the texts say, but in fact, with the 
enormous surpluses Ottawa is reaping and the fact that it is 
keeping the heads of the provinces barely above the water line, 
federalism is less and less a fact.  Increasingly, we are 
heading toward a de facto unitarian government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the transfer of funds with the Canada social transfer, 
the provinces' situation is not improving.  The cuts by the 
federal government have hurt very badly, especially in Quebec 
where the per capita shortfall in 1999-00 is $225 as opposed to 
$121 for Ontario and an average of $138 for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, Quebec is being had.  What is even worse is that the 
ministers and Liberal members are saying “Yes, go on, hurt us, 
we like that. 
Go after Quebec, take more money away from it than from the 
other provinces.  Take more, we like that, we are going to stand 
up on our flippers and applaud like seals for the Minister of 
Finance, who comes from Quebec, and does it more harm than he 
does to all the other provinces”.  This is unacceptable, it must 
be made known and condemned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The annual shortfall for Quebec is $1.7 billion.  The effect is 
dramatic.  It means a shortfall of $875 million for health care, 
$375 million for education and $450 million for social 
assistance.  What does it mean specifically?  An additional $875 
million for health care would mean the creation of over 3,000 
jobs for doctors and 5,000 jobs for nurses.  Why do we not have 
them?  Because this government decided to cut health care and 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to compare Ontario and Quebec. Since it took 
office, in 1993, this government did not merely make cuts to 
cash transfers. It also unilaterally—they like that word, across 
the way—decided to change its method of calculation, at the 
expense of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals respond to accusations of having sabotaged health 
care by saying that all the provinces suffered cuts, this in a 
fair manner, and that it is the fault of the sovereignist 
government in Quebec City if things are not going well in our 
province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact—and everyone knows that, as I found out when I recently 
travelled across Canada—all the provinces suffered cuts. The only 
common denominator between all the provinces is the federal 
cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the alleged fairness of these cuts, the federal 
government put in place, as early as in the 1996 budget, a 
mechanism “to reduce current disparities in per capita 
entitlement between the provinces by half by 2002-2003”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mechanism in question would have increased the per capita 
weighting from 10% in 1998-1999 to 50% in 2002-2003. But, in the 
1999 budget, without a word of warning to Quebec, the federal 
government proposed “to completely eliminate these disparities 
in three years, that is by the year 2002”. This means that 
Quebec will absorb 50% of the cuts, when it only accounts for 
25% of the country's population. This is the price to pay for 
federalism; this is the price to pay for not having achieved 
sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal member who spoke before me talked about tax 
reductions. He stressed non-indexation, the fact that the 
government is again indexing tax tables. 
Let us be clear—indexing is not a real tax cut.  With indexing, 
the taxpayer does not pay more, but he does not pay less; the 
effect is neutral. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are most certainly in agreement with deindexing; we have been 
pushing for it for five years and it is time the government 
listened to us.  In fact, I think that if it listened to us more 
often, things would improve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, it could have done more.  It could have 
reindexed the tax tables, as well as making significant tax 
cuts, which it decided not to do.  Even though it is raking in 
surplus after surplus, this year it consciously decided not to 
give the public tax cuts. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1605"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993 when this government took office, the non-indexing of 
tax tables has accounted for between approximately $12 billion 
and $17 billion.  Surely, with the surpluses it has, it could 
have relinquished a small portion of this large amount, but it 
made a conscious decision not to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It proudly announces that it has eliminated the 5% surtax this 
year for incomes under $85,000 and that it will eliminate it for 
all incomes over the next five years, by 2004.  The complete 
elimination of the 5% surtax in 2004 will result in a tax cut of 
approximately $5,600 for the 61,000 taxpayers earning over 
$250,000. Meanwhile, it will be less than $100 for middle income 
earners, who make up the majority of those listening. 
Is this fairness?  Is this justice?  No way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third point I wanted to raise is the lack of any improvement 
to the employment insurance program for the least advantaged 
members of society.  Yet the demands of the Bloc Quebecois were 
very clear.  Our party made itself the spokesperson of a 
consensus that exists, not just within Quebec, but in the rest 
of Canada as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois called for five main points. 
These were: that the employment insurance fund no longer be used 
as a tax on employment; that the administration of the 
employment insurance fund be depoliticized and removed from 
government control, or in other words made into an independent 
fund; that the employment insurance fund conform to the 
objectives of the legislation, which is to ensure the unemployed 
of a decent and fair income during temporary periods without 
work; that priority be given to returning to contributors the 
benefits to which they are entitled; that it retain its role as 
an anticyclical measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet this budget contains nothing for the unemployed, which means 
that, in the aftermath of this budget, six out of ten jobless 
people will still not qualify for employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, this budget contains some measures that are 
specifically anti-Quebec. 
I shall mention four of them. The first one relates to the 
shipbuilding industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal taxation system has just taken back the assistance 
Quebec has given to this industry in decline, assistance that 
the Government of Quebec had been intelligent enough to put into 
place.  I come from the Quebec City region, where the Davie 
shipyard is important for employment. Yet the federal government 
is doing nothing, worse than nothing, for it is taking back part 
of the assistance the Government of Quebec had given to an 
industry that has unfortunately been in decline because of the 
federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the budget tabled yesterday in the House of Commons will 
include retroactive taxation of the super-deduction for R and D 
credits announced less than a year ago by the Government of 
Quebec. 
For about 12 years now, Ontario has benefited from such a super 
deduction. Less than 10 months ago, Quebec set up a similar 
program and guess what happened? The federal government pulled 
the rug out from under the province by ensuring that the super 
deduction cannot benefit people working in research and 
development in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, there is the deduction for interest on student loans. We 
are well aware that Quebec made a conscious choice to have the 
lowest tuition fees in North America, because we feel this is 
the best way to ensure the greatest possible access to 
post-secondary education. That approach has worked. However, 
because Quebec students are paying lower tuition fees and are 
therefore less indebted, they are getting less from the federal 
government. This is unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec adopted a very progressive and modern social measure to 
promote access to university, and what did the federal 
government do? It made sure that students from the rest of 
Canada can benefit a lot more than Quebec students from the 
deduction for interest on student loans. Quebecers are 
supporting students twice, first by paying taxes so that tuition 
fees are the lowest in North America and, second, by helping 
students in the other provinces, because they made a conscious 
decision to have lower tuition fees.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth anti-Quebec measure in this budget concerns the 
deductions for daycare.  Less is paid to Quebec families, 
because they pay less in daycare costs since the Government of 
Quebec established a $5 daycare plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebecers are being penalized once again for creating an 
innovative program, praised by many and the envy of all across 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are four anti-Quebec measures in this budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You are signalling me, Mr. Speaker, that my time is almost up, 
and I want just to respond to the Liberal member who spoke 
before me. He said that Quebec received more than its share in 
equalization payments and so on. 
If so, it is because it does not get its fair share in active 
spending, in structuring spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about all of this.  Quebec got an average of 21% of 
federal purchases of goods and services, 15% of current 
transfers to business, 18% of federal government investment 
between 1992 and 1997.  In 1998, this translated specifically 
into 19.5% of jobs in the public service and 19.1% of jobs in 
the armed forces, whereas Quebec represents 25% of the 
population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec's annual shortfall in federal purchases of goods and 
services, the difference between Quebec's population size and 
the share of federal spending the province receives, is $1.2 
billion.  In the case of current transfers to business, the 
shortfall is $339 million and, for investments, the figure is 
$219 million a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude on this. 
If the federal government gave Quebec its fair share of job 
creating spending, that is, $1.7 billion, over 30,000 jobs could 
be created in Quebec, which would mean a .7% drop in the 
unemployment rate.  The unfair distribution of spending could 
explain as much as 50% of the difference between the 
unemployment rate in Quebec and in the rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the cost of not having sovereignty. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with some interest to my colleague from the Bloc.  I want him to 
know that as an Albertan, as a member of the Reform Party and as 
a member of the House I consider him to be part of the Canadian 
family.  He is a Canadian.  He lives in Canada and he serves in 
Canada's parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard throughout his speech too often that Quebec was not 
getting its fair share.  I have done a little study on 
equalization, which is what he was talking about.  As I recall, 
the Quebec population is now about 24% of Canada's population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The numbers I have over the last 10 years show that of the 
equalization that was paid out to the seven so-called have not 
provinces, which excludes Alberta, Ontario and British Columbia, 
Quebec received in excess of 60% of the money as a percentage. 
Overall in Canada, including all ten provinces, Quebec received 
between 40% and 50%. The peak was around 48% in one year 
according to my records. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With a population of 24% and getting 48% of all equalization 
payments in the country, how can the member say that Quebec is 
not getting its fair share?  It is getting twice the average, 
which seems to me to be inconsistent with his statement.  Before 
I sit down, with that I would like to invite him to stay in 
Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau:</B> Mr. Speaker, the response to his invitation 
is no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the first part of his comment—for which I thank the 
member, who is one of the hardest working members in the House—he 
suggests that Quebec is the spoiled child of the federation and 
that it is receiving more than its share of federal spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to remind him that if Quebec is receiving more than its 
share of provincial transfer payments for employment insurance, 
it is mainly because it is not receiving its share of spending 
to create jobs.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Some spending produces nothing because the money goes to people 
who stay at home, which does not create any jobs, and some 
spending that produces jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec is not receiving its share of the money that creates 
jobs.  I will repeat a few figures that I gave just before 
concluding:  21% of federal goods and services are purchased in 
Quebec, and yet we represent between 24% and 25% of the 
population; 15% of current transfers to businesses, and yet we 
represent 25% of the population; 18% of federal investments 
between 1992 and 1997, and yet we represent 25% of the 
population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec's annual shortfall with respect to federal goods and 
services spending is $1.7 billion.  This represents 30,000 jobs 
in Quebec and an approximate drop in unemployment rates of 1%. 
If, instead of doing all its investing in Ontario, the 
government ensured that Quebec received its fair share, then we 
could talk again. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>]

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
always fascinated when members of the Bloc talk about fiscal 
matters because they certainly are inventive and imaginative 
about the way they restate the books and the public accounts of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I share with the member for Elk Island the frustration that we 
have in constantly having to rise to point out the fact that 
Quebec does quite well by this country.  That does not mean that 
it is favoured or pampered, but Quebec certainly gets its fair 
share.  Having people say that it does not, that it is 
discriminated against, is, quite frankly, untrue and an insult to 
our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about moving toward a unitary state.  There is 
no one who has studied political science or social policy, not 
only in Canada but throughout the world, who would not say that 
Canada is the most highly decentralized federation in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to address the issue of tax points.  The member went on 
and on about tax points.  It was once again creative economics. 
A lot of people do not understand tax points.  Let us say that 
the federal tax was at 40%.  I will use that figure for 
simplicity. The federal government, in agreement with the 
provinces, including Quebec, said that instead of the government 
taxing the provinces at 40%, it should reduce the tax by 3 or 4 
percentage points and the provinces would take that back. 
Individual taxes would be the same.  The federal government would 
reduce its share of direct taxation on individuals and the 
provinces would be able to tax directly.  This was done and I am 
sure the province of Quebec felt it was a wonderful thing because 
it could tax the people directly to raise money for its social 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be very interested in knowing if the member is 
suggesting that we reverse the original concept of tax points and 
have the federal government reoccupy that level of direct 
taxation, with the province of Quebec similarly reducing the 
amount which it taxes Quebecers directly. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I hope I have 20 minutes 
or so to respond, because it is not often that one hears such 
utter nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the unitary state is concerned, yes we are heading 
more and more in that direction, and I trust the hon. member for 
Durham is listening.  His government has implemented what is 
called the social union.  What does social union mean?  That the 
federal government can, merely by notifying the provinces—this is 
also going to interest my colleague from 
Anjou Rivière-des-Prairies—interfere in any provincial area of 
jurisdiction.  What is that all about?  Is this still 
federalism?  According to what I learned in my law courses, any 
federalism requires totally different “spheres of sovereignty” 
for the different levels of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the federal government gives itself the right and the 
power to interfere in areas of jurisdiction that do not belong 
to it, this is no longer federalism, and Canada is moving more 
and more toward a system in which Ottawa dictates to the 
provinces.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nine out of ten provinces are relatively okay with that having 
signed the social union.  Why?  Because for them the “national 
government” is located in Ottawa.  For them the supreme 
representative of their interests is in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For Quebecers, however, whether federalists or sovereignists, 
their national government is in Quebec City.  This is why the 
three political parties represented in the National Assembly, 
including the strongly federalist Quebec Liberals, refuse to get 
involved in such a system, and reject the social union proposed 
by their federal cousins, rightly so, moreover. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one other thing that the hon. member referred to, and I 
am not sure I grasped it properly. 
He talked about occupying tax fields, wondering, I think, 
whether the trend that has existed since 1960 had to be 
reversed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The transfer of tax points essentially stopped in the 1960s, 
unless I am mistaken, after another Liberal government, under 
Pierre Trudeau, decided to take a harder federal line and to 
centralize Canada increasingly rather than remain flexible. 
Flexible federalism does not exist in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With surpluses estimated at $137 billion, the provinces have the 
need, and the federal government has the money.  The federal 
government is very tight with its money, because it refuses to 
give back to the provinces what it took from them, while the 
provinces' needs in health care continue to grow, as my 
colleague from Québec among others pointed out a little earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, I think rightly, the federal government is 
keeping the provinces struggling, their heads barely above 
water, while it is rolling indecently and disgustingly in 
surpluses.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will be sharing my time with my colleague, the member for 
Barrie—Simcoe—Bradford. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a pleasure to support this budget.  It is a budget for the 
21st century, the knowledge century, and that is the element of 
the budget that I will signal in my remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You will remember, Mr. Speaker, the tragedy of the failure of 
the KAON project, launched by a man of genius, Erich Vogt, but 
allowed by a previous government to fail for lack of financing. 
Why did it fail?  The previous government, one, did not 
understand the nature of pure research and its importance for a 
modern society and for a viable economy, but, two, had doubts 
about constitutional power, which on examination were 
unreasonable. “The constitution”, as Lord Sankey said, “is a 
living tree”.  Where the social necessity exists the power will 
follow for rational men and women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The KAON project failed and our first mandate when this 
government was elected in 1993 was to support the successor, the 
TRIUMF project.  It was a period when we had inherited a $42.8 
billion deficit budget from the predecessor government.  We were 
asking for $167.5 million to support the TRIUMF project.  It took 
12 months of discussion in caucus and in the House to explain 
what pure research is.  It is not an esoteric examination of 
subjects fit for angels but for no one else; it is an examination 
of the basic intellectual infrastructure of our society.  It 
meant explaining what is particle physics, why is particle 
physics important to us, that when properly applied in its 
lessons it leads to highly skilled jobs, it leads to an export 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was the demonstration made with the TRIUMF project.  We 
were able to demonstrate $193 million in export contracts in a 
single year in spinoffs from TRIUMF.  So the battle was won, pure 
research, the thing that saved Germany and Japan after their 
devastating defeats and the devastation of their industries in 
the second world war.  Invest in pure research.  The federal 
government has never really looked back from that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, it is perhaps a matter of interest to note that we 
can believe newspapers sometimes.  The Vancouver <I>Sun</I> has in 
some ways jumped the gun and suggested that TRIUMF may be 
refinanced. 
I believe the announcement will come next week, but let us face 
it, TRIUMF was when we turned the corner in the federal 
government and said that research in the areas of science, 
technology and medicine was crucial to our survival as a 
competitive country in the 21st century.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look through this budget and I see the follow-on of this 
distinctive philosophy of the knowledge society being carried 
through.  There is a project in which major intellectual 
contributions were made by Dr. Martha Piper, the president of the 
University of British Columbia, a distinguished research 
scientist in her own right, and Robert Lacroix, the rector of 
the Université de Montréal.  It is the establishment of the 
millennial professorships with 2,000 new university research 
chairs across Canada and $900 million invested by the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we spend this money?  We want to keep these people in 
Canada.  There are Nobel prize winners there already, but there 
are also the Nobel prize winners of tomorrow.  These are the 
people who expand the frontiers of knowledge.  So that is a very 
positive step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look back at the Foundation for Innovation established with a 
billion dollar grant by the federal government, with a further 
$900 million in this budget.  This is to provide for innovative 
research, science, medicine, the equipment of laboratories and 
the basic infrastructure of research in universities.  Dr. David 
Strangway, the former president of the University of British 
Columbia, has been extending this in his administrative talent. 
It is a very vital task. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We took the science minister on a visit to the University of 
British Columbia and told him that we wanted him to see an 
historic laboratory.  We took him to the second floor of the 
science building and he asked what was historic about it because 
it looked like an ordinary rundown university science laboratory, 
with not enough equipment and out of date.  We said that was 
where the last Nobel prize winner from Canada went as a graduate 
student and did his research.  It is still in the same condition 
it was in when he attended 30 years ago.  It needs rebuilding. 
The creative idea for the Foundation for Innovation comes from 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been talk of federal-provincial co-operation.  We 
devised this concept of co-operative federalism.  I look at the 
Canada health and social transfer program, with $2.5 billion for 
that, of which $340 million will go to British Columbia.  We wish 
to co-operate with the provinces, but it is a two-way process. We 
are tired of giving money—and I think even British Columbia may 
feel some guilt here—for education or research and finding that 
it ends up in highways with no end and no beginning, into the 
never never land.  We extend the invitation to the new premier, 
sworn in several days ago in British Columbia, to come and join 
us, to spend this money, this transfer, on education, on 
post-secondary research and on work in the hospitals.  We will 
work with him if we can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at money for forestry research.  It is British Columbia's 
basic industry but it is in some sickness today.  We need 
research in new methods and new technologies.  The $15 million is 
for the three forestry research institutes scattered over Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is $160 million for Genome Canada to advance the study of 
genetics.  It is led by Dr. Michael Smith, the Nobel Laureate in 
chemistry.  He knows both the possibilities and also the prudent 
restraints in the application of this new science to plants and 
to other forms of research.  This is a most interesting aspect of 
the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is $100 million in the sustainable development technology 
fund.  A good deal of this will go to companies like Ballard 
Power, the new fuel cell technology that can revolutionize 
transportation and at the same time reduce to minor proportions 
the problem of pollution that conventional batteries create with 
the power involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If one looks through the budget, there is $5 million for 
geoscience to improve new techniques for mining.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our mining industry needs revitalization.  Abstract research? 
Not on your life.  The jobs of tomorrow are there. They are 
highly paid jobs and vital to our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over this whole spectrum of work we see an imaginative budget 
that looks forward, not backward.  It uses our surplus at once to 
reduce taxes, to stimulate the economy in that sense but also to 
create the knowledge that is the basis of breakthroughs in 
science and technology which are in essence the foundation of our 
industry and of our competitive economy with the opportunities for 
brilliant young Canadians who might otherwise be lured by the 
temptations to go south and follow the brain drain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can keep these people in Canada.  We need them.  We invite 
the provinces to co-operate with us.  It is a two way process but 
the basic foundations are there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a pleasure to assist the adoption of this budget, the 
knowledge budget, a budget for a knowledge based economy.  That 
has been the inspiration of our government, the science minister, 
the finance minister and the Prime Minister since the inception 
of this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It comes to fruition here with a budget with the first big 
surplus.  All the hard work of saving, prudent pruning of 
overstaffed departments and the like comes to fruition here with 
the stimulus we have provided for the economy.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the 
hon. member for Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, Gasoline Prices; the 
hon. member for Mercier, East Timor; the hon. member for 
Cumberland—Colchester, Airline Industry; the hon. member for 
Mississauga South, Foreign Affairs. 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was anxious 
to address the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Budget day is always an important day for Canadians, for people 
in all the provinces, including Quebec, because they want to 
find out what impact the budget will have on their daily lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, Oral Question Period focused on the current scandal at 
Human Resources Development Canada. This is not because the 
budget is not a priority, an important issue for members of 
parliament, including Bloc Quebecois members, but because we 
wanted to show how badly this government has failed, in terms of 
managing programs, of managing one of the most important 
departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the first time. 
I remind members that in 1984 the federal government lost $1 
billion hole through a new tax to promote scientific research. 
That tax loophole resulted in the robbery of the century. Over a 
nine month period the tab climbed to $3 billion, while the cost 
of that initiative was expected to be $100 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering all these losses created over the years by Liberal 
patronage, considering the measly $2.5 billion that will be 
paid, I thought the member would have had a more balanced 
approach, a vision regarding the needs of the provinces in 
health and education— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> I apologize for 
interrupting the hon. member but I must give the floor to the 
hon. member for Vancouver Quadra for his answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B> Mr. Speaker, if we are talking about the 
management of these projects, we are talking about Martha Piper, 
Robert Lacroix, David Strangway, and Michael Smith.  These are 
well known scientists and physicians; we trust their advice and 
judgment.  That is why I strongly supported their appointments. 
I have complete faith in their judgment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
Liberal members on the other side are doing a very good job 
cheerleading and boosting their budget, but I can guarantee 
that not everybody in the country is doing cartwheels in quite 
the same way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have received a series of critical faxes from organizations 
like the Canadian Medical Association, the Canadian Health Care 
Alliance, the Canadian Federation of Teachers and the Canadian 
Chamber of Commerce that point out the irony of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a budget, in which the primary focus and concern was to fix 
health care, we have seen a meagre and paltry $2.5 billion.  I 
remind the hon. member for Vancouver Quadra that in the province 
of Manitoba that amounts to about $20 million per year over four 
years.  This is an amount of money that is almost insignificant. 
It does not register in the total overall health care spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of all the initiatives and the lofty ideas the member had in 
terms of spending and reinvesting in the knowledge sector and 
post-secondary education, what does he suggest Manitoba should do 
with its $20 million for health care, post-secondary education 
and social allowance? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I accept the challenge. I 
think the MPs from Manitoba should do what I have been doing for 
the last six or seven years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no reproach for engaging myself in boosterism.  I 
explained what pure research was in the House.  I explained it to 
my caucus.  I persuaded people.  I and my office staff spent 250 
hours of work on the TRIUMF project.  We had the good fortune to 
have a science minister who, although a very distinguished 
lawyer, was not a scientist in the natural science sense but who 
took the time to understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main thing is that we have made a revolution in Canadian 
society. Our research and advanced education was lagging behind 
in significant sectors.  We went to the Prime Minister and said 
that he must invest.  I make no apologies for that.  I would 
offer the same advice to our colleague opposite who asked the 
question. Go out and fight for knowledge.  He should go out and 
fight for projects he believes in but he should bring reasoned 
empirical arguments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I went to the science minister and said that these were the 
facts, he read the documents, listened to the arguments and he 
approved.  That is the way to do it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Aileen Carroll (Barrie—Simcoe—Bradford, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, at the outset I offer my congratulations to the Minister 
of Finance for crafting a budget of remarkable scope and balance. 
The minister has remained to true to his course and, as well, has 
responded to continued input from the Liberal caucus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spoken in my riding of Barrie—Simcoe—Bradford to many 
groups at various times about how committed the government has 
been to realigning the federal balance sheet, getting our 
finances in order, eliminating the deficit and planning for the 
day when we would be able to return dividends to Canadians for 
their investment in successive Liberal governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians, including my constituents of 
Barrie—Simcoe—Bradford, have invested in this government.  They 
have given us their trust to restore our nation's finances.  They 
have shown confidence in us to build a stronger, more innovative 
economy.  They have trusted us to improve the quality of life for 
them and their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time has now arrived when we begin to repay Canadians for 
supporting our plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A key component of my government's plan is to cut taxes.  This 
will mean more money in the pockets of Canadians, stronger 
economic growth, continuing job creation and the enhancement of a 
more competitive edge for Canada globally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The five year reduction plan that will restore full indexation 
to the personal income tax system is an essential ingredient of 
this budget.  Core tax rates are reduced for the first time in 12 
years.  Personal income taxes are being reduced on an annual 
basis by an average of 15% in 2004-05.  This plan will reduce 
taxes by a cumulative total of at least $58 billion over the next 
five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Full indexation is a fundamental break with the past and is a 
measure requested by many of my constituents.  I am heartened 
that the Minister of Finance has heard those of us who have 
advocated for this tax change, and I thank my constituents who 
persisted in raising this issue on various occasions over the 
last three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Full indexation will stop the automatic tax increases and 
benefit erosion that have taken place under our Canadian tax 
system since the mid-80s.  For the first time the real value of 
benefits, such as the Canada child tax benefit and the GST tax 
credit, will no longer be eroded by inflation.

<A HREF="#LINKT80"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the first time in 12 years a federal income tax, the middle 
tax rate, will be lowered.  The plan reduces the middle tax rate 
to 23% from 26%, starting with a two point reduction to 24% in 
July of this year.  Eventually this will cut the taxes for 9 
million Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is that Canadians will be able to earn more 
income tax free and more of their income will be taxed at lower 
rates.  This is the dividend Canadians have earned for their 
patience and fortitude in supporting the Liberal plan to get the 
federal fiscal house in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The plan enriches the Canada child tax benefit so that by 2004 
an additional $2.5 billion annually will be provided to low and 
middle income families with children.  This measure alone 
provides increased income for more than half of my constituents 
in Barrie—Simcoe—Bradford. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The plan eliminates the 5% deficit reduction surtax on middle 
income Canadians with incomes up to $85,000, and the plan raises 
to 25% this year and 30% next year the permissible foreign 
content of investments in registered plans and RRSPs.  This is a 
measure that I and many of my colleagues have been promoting.  I 
am very pleased that we have seen its accomplishment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For students, I, along with many of my colleagues, was alerted 
by post-secondary institutions and student associations that the 
level of taxation on scholarships did not synchronize with the 
objective of reducing student debt load.  Consequently, the 
government listened and it responded by increasing to $3,000 from 
$500 the amount of tax free income from bursaries, fellowships 
and scholarships, such as the Canadian millennium scholarship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other tax reduction measures include a reduction in capital 
gains from 75% to 65% effective immediately.  In fact, this plan 
is so munificent that the opposition, which has been militant in 
its pursuit of a tax agenda, cannot even come up with a response. 
Even Owen Lippert, spokesman for the conservative Fraser forum, 
complimented the budget and the tax cut plan on this morning's 
edition of <I>Canada A.M.</I>.  Mr. Lippert stated that the 
government must have been listening to him.  If the Vancouver 
based Fraser Institute likes this budget then the opposition 
Reform and Conservative Parties are obviously taking a long walk 
off a short peer as they scramble to take issue with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other equally vital priorities as well.  Canadians 
have reported repeatedly to pollsters, the media and to us, their 
elected representatives, that there must be an increase in 
support for post-secondary education and health care.  The 
government has responded by increasing the Canada health and 
social transfer payments by $2.5 billion.  Next year the CHST 
cash allotment will reach $15.5 billion, a 25% increase over the 
past two years.  This infusion brings the federal transfer to the 
provinces above the original full funding level.  The initially 
removed moneys have now been replaced and enhanced.  The onus is 
now very much on the provinces to ensure that these allocated 
moneys become moneys dedicated to the intended purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An editorial last week in the Toronto <I>Star</I> pointed out 
that the Ontario government, amidst its constant criticism of the 
federal government, has neglected to dedicate the full amount of 
$1.5 billion transferred in last year's budget for health care. 
The Ontario government has still not utilized $700 million for 
health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While Ontario's share of the new money in this year's budget 
will not solve all our problems, distinguished health care 
systems analyst, Michael Dechter, stated again this morning that 
it would be enough to hire thousands of nurses.  We Ontarians 
should therefore be looking for significant improvements in our 
health care delivery system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, the budget reinforces the government's grasp of the 
essentials of research and development and the need for Canada to 
excel in all areas of skills, technology and knowledge.  The 
government created the Canada Foundation for Innovation in 1997 
and we continue to make it one of the cornerstones of our plan by 
infusing the CFI with an additional $900 million in this budget.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the creation of the sustainable development 
technology fund will foster innovation by helping companies 
develop new technologies and bring them to market.  In this 
regard I exhort Canadian companies to follow our lead and 
reconfigure their entrepreneurial spirit which has focused far 
too frequently in recent times on the need to cut costs rather 
than to develop new products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian companies have not invested sufficiently in the 
development of unique products and processes.  As a result Canada 
stands 12th worldwide with regard to company operations and 
strategies.  While Canada sits second only to the U.S. in overall 
connectedness, our businesses are not making optimal use of our 
connectivity.  Canadian CEOs place a greater priority on cost 
reduction rather than on capturing markets in every corner of the 
globe through e-commerce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Minister of Finance said yesterday in his budget speech, 
the private sector must change its concept of risk.  This budget 
assists them in every facet.  It is vital that the private sector 
meets the challenges of the 21st century and meets the bar the 
government and this budget have set. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also delighted that this budget recognizes that our 
Canadian forces have endured severe financial restrictions in 
recent years.  I have promoted the serious need to reinforce the 
programs and resources of our forces, and quite frankly the 
successful result read in the House yesterday was a victory for 
many members of our caucus.  This infusion will allow our 
military to continue to represent Canada with distinction in our 
peacekeeping and peacemaking roles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another victory for all of us is the recognition that the 
municipalities have an enormous role to play in the ever growing 
responsibility of environmental protection.  The green municipal 
enabling fund helps communities assess where their environmental 
needs are the greatest.  The budget also creates a revolving 
fund, the green municipal investment fund.  The administration of 
these two funds will be the responsibility of the Federation of 
Canadian Municipalities, a highly respected organization.  From 
this initiative we hope to generate the best approaches to 
renewable energy, water conservation, waste management and urban 
transit programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have dedicated much of my time since my election to the study 
of environmental degradation and the search for remedies.  These 
initiatives permit immediate implementation of measures that 
communities can activate and thus make practical use of the 
knowledge, experience and recommendations of the environmental 
science and engineering professions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am honoured to be an active participant in the Liberal 
government and to represent the constituents of 
Barrie—Simcoe—Bradford.  I am confident that we will continue 
to enjoy the support of Canadians so that we can further build on 
the frameworks we have structured concerning all these things. 
<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I have 
been listening to the Liberal speeches today with a lot of 
interest.  Obviously Liberal members have bought into the plan, 
and I understand that.  That is part of their party plan.  The 
budget has been presented.  Many Liberal members I am sure 
sincerely support everything in the budget.  I suppose all of 
them will vote for it.  We expect that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member be so bold as to be really candid with us and 
say something about the lack of planning to actually reduce the 
debt?  The debt is standing at $576.8 billion.  The government 
has said it will pay $3 billion a year against the debt out of 
its contingency fund if at the end of the year it has found no 
other way to spend it.  In the event that the government actually 
does not spend it, that means it will take almost 200 years to 
pay off the debt.  Meanwhile we are paying $40 billion a year in 
interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member, in her great candid spirit, tell us what she 
thinks and what members of her constituency think with respect to 
actual debt repayment and reduction of the interest thereby?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Aileen Carroll:</B>  Madam Speaker, debt reduction has 
always been a priority of the government.  We have from the 
beginning addressed it by a 50:50 approach: 50% on new spending 
and 50% on tax reduction and debt reduction.  We have helped to 
create a economic milieu in the country whereby the economy has 
grown.  It continues to grow at such a pace that it factors into 
the debt ratio.  This has declined, as the questioner knows, and 
will continue to do so.  Yes, we have reduced it by $3 billion 
for each of our years. Yes, we continue to set aside a 
contingency fund which most likely will be able to be applied to 
the debt at the end of this fiscal year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In phrasing his question the hon. member made reference to the 
fact that perhaps members on this side of the House were singing 
from a song sheet that someone else prepared.  We prepared that 
song sheet.  We had a finance minister and a cabinet listen 
closely to a caucus wherein we are free to speak of all things 
vital to us, to reflect what our constituents tell us about 
health care, to hear from our constituents and to feed into a 
budget.  This budget is a result of that.  It reflects an open 
caucus where every person on this side of the House feels that he 
or she has been a part in setting the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition, to the best of my knowledge, for a 
party that wants to be grassroots does not run a caucus in any 
way like the caucus of the Liberal government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, it is 
often said that the Minister of Finance is a smooth talker, but 
his glib words are at our expense, and they will not pay the 
bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been listening to the members opposite all afternoon. 
They all agree that they have spent money.  That is true—Human 
Resources Development Canada has been practically throwing it 
out the window, while the Government of Quebec has been 
investing it wisely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the federal government cut tens of billions of dollars in 
health, education, and social programs, the provinces 
unanimously demanded $4.5 billion a year. But all they are 
getting from the federal government is $2.5 billion over four 
years, which boils down to $600 million for Quebec—crumbs. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Aileen Carroll:</B>  Madam Speaker, it is important to 
note that we have restored to 1993 levels and even above federal 
contributions to health care.  Quebec receives about 28% of total 
transfers.  That is quite a bit considering that it represents 
24% of the population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, we have seen the health minister emphasize the need for 
efficiencies.  We are back to a large percentage of the funding 
of health, but there is a need for all provinces to come together 
to make a more efficient system.  It requires all their input.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for 
Winnipeg North Centre and I will take 10 minutes to make my 
remarks regarding the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look at the budget I try to measure and gauge it with 
respect to where it sits in terms of the priorities of my 
constituents.  As a matter of fact I undertook to poll my 
constituents and I did so in January.  I sent them all letters 
and asked them to priorize where they would put the surplus for 
this fiscal year.  I want to share with the members of the House 
exactly what my constituents told me and asked me to tell the 
government with respect to priorities, which my party and I did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one thing almost everyone in my constituency agrees on: 
the restoration of federal health care funding. 
Eighty-three per cent of them indicated that they wanted health 
and education transfers restored and for the government to make 
up for the losses. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1655"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals talk about restoring to 1993 levels.  They have 
taken $600 million out of health care funding in my province of 
Saskatchewan in the last five years and have restored it by $18 
million this year.  We are short $582 million, yet they are 
saying that it is as big as it was in 1993.  They neglected to 
tell Canadians that since 1993 the population of Canada has 
increased by about one or two million people.  I am not sure of 
the exact number, but over one million people, to be safe, and 
they have cut back in terms of health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The number one issue in terms of measuring the budget with my 
constituents' priorities is that it fails the test of what they 
believe is the highest priority of our national government with 
respect to this important social program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the number two priority my constituents also wanted to see 
money for a long term farm aid program until such time as the 
international subsidy war was dealt with at the WTO.  I look in 
the budget and what do I see?  There is not one dime for 
agriculture in terms of a long term program.  We see a short 
term, inadequate amount of $180 million.  We in Saskatchewan are 
grateful for that, but meanwhile the treasuries of France, Spain, 
Great Britain, Germany and the United States of America keep 
subsidizing their farmers to the full extent.  Thereby western 
grain farmers are at a disadvantage being at the lower end of an 
uneven playing field.  They are finding it very difficult to 
compete as a result of the prices being driven down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third most important item to my constituents was a personal 
income tax cut.  Sixty-eight per cent believe they should have a 
GST cut of one point or a modest decrease in their personal 
income tax.  The budget addressed the personal income tax cut.  I 
think that will be a very positive step in the long haul.  One 
out of three is not bad, although my constituents wanted 
something a little more substantial in terms of the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, 66% of my constituents polled believe that we should 
have some kind of additional significant program to the tune of 
over $2 billion to address child poverty.  We see in the budget a 
modest attempt to do so, but neither my constituents nor I think 
it goes far enough.  There is a big gap in terms of differences 
in our priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most important, we sent out thousands of questionnaires and had 
almost 1,000 returns, which was not bad for a mail-back.  Not one 
constituent indicated that we should further subsidize the NHL. 
Yet the Liberal government in the first week in January announced 
a big subsidy program for NHL hockey players.  I wonder what its 
priorities are.  I see the Minister of Industry is in the House. 
I can understand the pressure applied to him from the local 
hockey team and the local supporters, but surely there must have 
been some sense in the budget of the priorities of Canadians 
before this was undertaken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to talk only about my constituents' priorities and 
how they differ from those of the government.  I want to try to 
measure the budget from a fair perspective.  How do we measure 
whether or not a budget is fair?  I confer with my constituents, 
which I have done, and in their view they do not believe this is 
a fair budget with respect to western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real test of whether the budget is fair is whether it is 
providing some progress for Canada.  The true test of progress is 
not in our country.  It is not whether we add to the abundance of 
those who have much but whether we as a government, we as a 
country, provide enough for those who have too little.  Under 
this test the budget does not pass.  It does not provide 
substantial support in terms of tax cuts, child poverty programs 
or health care financing to help those who have too little, but 
it will provide huge tax cuts for the very wealthy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this current fiscal year the Liberals gave millionaire hockey 
players a $16,000 tax cut. 
They gave Canadians zero in this fiscal year.  The next fiscal 
year which is the budget we are speaking on, they are going to 
give the hockey players another $9,000 or $10,000 on top the 
$16,000.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The millionaire hockey players in this country will now have a 
two year tax break of about $26,000. What do we get as average 
Canadians?  What do average Saskatchewan residents get?  They may 
get $250 a year, 20 bucks a month.  That will not not buy a daily 
cup of coffee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view health care has been put on the wait list.  Education 
has been put on the wait list.  We have letters from the 
Saskatchewan school trustees saying that this is an inadequate 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The president of SSTA, Gary Shaddock, in expressing his 
disappointment to the Minister of Finance said, “This was 
supposed to be the children's budget.  Several things outlined in 
the budget are positive for families but the budget did not do 
enough to address the national children's agenda and provide a 
strategy of how Canadians will support their children in the 
future”. For somebody from the SSTA who is a very responsible 
parent, a very responsible citizen of this country, to say this 
about the budget in a non-political fashion in my view condemns 
this budget even further than what we have already outlined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Agriculture is on the wait list.  We have tax cuts in terms of 
personal income tax cuts.  There is some progress there, but in 
this calendar year it is basically the wait list for Canadians 
with small and average size incomes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen no action in this budget on defending our economy 
with respect to energy prices.  I have stood in the House a 
number of times since the House resumed in February to ask the 
government what action plan it has to defend our economy and to 
defend Canadian consumers from international price gouging by the 
refiners and other vertically integrated oil companies.  There is 
nothing in this budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding highways, in Saskatchewan this government takes out 
about $180 million a year in excise taxes.  What was put back in 
this budget for highways?  Not $180 million, not even $100 
million, not even $5 million.  Not one cent in this budget has 
gone to highways in Saskatchewan after the government has taken 
away the transportation subsidies. The roads in our province have 
declined and deteriorated in an accelerated fashion and there is 
not one dime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is getting to the point where we need a government with some 
kind of conscience.  We need a government that believes in having 
a balance to the economic powers that run our economy.  The fact 
is the very wealthy corporations and the very wealthy families 
run the country's economy.  It is the government's obligation, 
duty and responsibility to be the balance to those powers that 
run the economy. One of my constituents said, “Leave the rich 
alone in this budget and help out the rest of the country”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe very strongly that this government has failed in its 
test.  It has wait-listed seniors.  There is no substantial 
support for seniors in their very severe challenges with respect 
to inflation.  It has wait-listed education and health care.  It 
has wait-listed tax cuts.  It has wait-listed agriculture.  It 
has wait-listed an energy plan to defend our economy.  It has 
wait-listed any kind of national highway program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My view and the NDP's view is that the government has failed 
with the most incredibly poor budget we have ever seen in this 
country.  It does not help people.  It helps the very rich and 
the very wealthy families and corporations. As a result, I can 
assure every one of my constituents who have written to me that I 
will stand in the House and I will vote against the budget. I 
think it is the wrong budget for Canadians and for western Canada 
in particular. 
<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I could speak to many of the 
items the member Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre commented on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the federal transfers, as I said earlier the federal 
transfers have gone from $37.4 billion in 1993-94 to $38.6 
billion in this year alone.  We are back to the days of the 1993 
transfers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to Saskatchewan, in 2000-01 the federal transfers 
to Saskatchewan will exceed $1.2 billion.  They will account for 
about 22% of the Saskatchewan government's estimated revenues. 
They will equate to about $1,174 per person and over the next 
five years will total about $6.3 billion.  I think that is pretty 
fair.

<A HREF="#LINKT85"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the income tax cuts, the member should check the 
budget closely because it is targeted to middle and low income 
Canadians.  For example, a one earner family of four with an 
income of under $35,000 will receive more in benefits than it 
pays in the year 2004.  I could go on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the agricultural aid.  We can all empathize with the 
plight of the farmers on the prairies but in the last three or 
four budgets we have put in over $2 billion and $240 million was 
announced recently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member should be more candid and fair in his critique of the 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member comment on the increase in the Canada child tax 
benefit which will increase to $9 billion a year?  Will that not 
help children? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon:</B>  Madam Speaker, I would like to point 
out the facts exactly as the member has asked me to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has taken $30 billion out of health care 
since 1994 and this year it is putting $1 billion back in.  For 
every 30 bucks it has cut, it is putting one dollar back.  And 
the Liberals call that reinstating funding for health care.  That 
is appreciated.  I guess $1 billion is better than no billions 
but the government has cut $30 billion in terms of the total 
losses to health care in the last five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Saskatchewan receives a little over $1 billion in all the 
various transfer payments.  The question I would ask the member 
is how many billions does the government take out in terms of 
income taxes, licences, GST and other fees for the federal 
treasury?  I can say it is a heck of a lot more than $1 billion. 
It is billions more than $1 billion.  We are sharing that with 
the rest of the country.  We are happy to do that and we are 
getting some of it back but not all of it, so let us call a spade 
a spade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a debt in the country.  Every single Canadian, whether 
born this minute or 79 years old, is paying $1,400 a year in 
interest on the Liberal-Conservative-Reform debt.  A family of 
four is paying $5,600 for the Liberal-Conservative-Reform debt 
and the Liberals are giving a $250 a year tax cut.  Are they 
crazy?  I think they are.  It is ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to look at the budget.  I give the Liberals credit. They 
are masters at doing and saying things to make people feel good. 
There may not be any kind of substance to their actions but they 
can do their spinning and promoting.  They have 155 MPs and 
hundreds of millions of dollars as we found out during the last 
month, to do those sorts of things, to make people feel good 
about things that they are supposed to be doing, might be doing 
or may want people to believe they are doing. On every occasion 
it is a feel good approach.  There is never any substance to 
address the hard core issues facing Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final point the member raised was with respect to 
agriculture. Yes, they have paid $2 billion with provincial 
shares into agriculture in the last two or three years. 
Saskatchewan out of $2 billion may have received about $400 
million or $500 million. The vast majority went to Ontario, 
Quebec and Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My final response to the member's question is that the 
government has done a good job for farmers in Ontario. I see my 
colleagues from the rural Liberal caucus in Ontario. They have 
done a good job getting money for their farmers but they have 
failed to address the western agricultural issues and that is 
where we are falling down in western Canada. They should provide 
more money to farmers, whether they are in Ontario, Quebec, or 
western Canada. The government needs to address the huge issue of 
the restructuring of agriculture in western Canada as soon as 
possible.

with the budget.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard a lot today from Liberal members about the 
opposition getting in touch with reality.  I would suggest that 
members across the way on the Liberal benches should stop and 
think just what this budget means in terms of the priorities of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they take a moment to study the facts and determine what the 
reality is, they will hang their heads in shame.  Yesterday a lot 
of folks gathered here.  They represented all kinds of 
organizations, particularly those in the health care field. 
People advocating for patients were here.  People representing 
nurses and doctors were here.  Ordinary citizens were here 
waiting with bated breath to hear what this government would say 
and do about their number one priority, health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reaction in this building in the circles of folks gathered 
together to witness this government's response on that important 
issue was like being at a funeral.  It was like a wake.  People 
were devastated.  One cannot imagine the sense of disappointment 
that was felt yesterday and which continues today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People believed that at least the government would take their 
concerns seriously when it came to health care.  They truly 
believed there would be something significant on health care in 
the budget. One cannot imagine the dismay, disappointment, fear 
and worry among those folks gathered here and all across the 
country when they learned that the response by this government on 
health care was to put in a one time short term allocation of 
funding to be shared by health and education, and maybe even 
other social programs if one reads the budget carefully, over 
four years.  My leader was absolutely right in saying that the 
government is prepared to give two cents for every dollar in tax 
relief.  It is a 2% solution when this country has a health care 
crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was that disappointment yesterday and today that concern 
is reflected in every media outlet. There is without exception 
nothing but absolute opposition and rejection of the government's 
approach to health care.  I challenge members opposite to tell me 
and to point to one patient, one health care organization, one 
advocate, one health minister, one premier who is going to stand 
and say that the government did the right thing on health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at the media.  The finance minister of Manitoba said, 
“This is a band-aid solution”.  Health care advocates in 
Manitoba said, “Health cash a morsel”.  Seniors in Manitoba 
said, “What about us?” Activists from the Council of Canadians 
said, “If I were the health minister I would be resigning”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if he is so embarrassed that he might not be thinking 
about resigning given the way his hands have been tied and his 
efforts have been shackled by this government.  Or is it all one 
big conspiracy and one big plot to ensure that this government 
does not do what is required on health care and allows for the 
dismantling of our public health care system?  Is that the case? 
Is that what we are really dealing with today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CMA said, “Budget health care funding falls short”.  That 
is putting it mildly.  The CLC says as we have all said in this 
House, “The budget just keeps medicare on a waiting list”.  The 
Hospital Employees Union in British Columbia said, “Federal 
budget response to medicare crisis anemic”.  The words go on and 
on.  The critique is absolutely clear.  No one in this country is 
impressed with what was announced yesterday on health care, the 
number one issue of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately that disappointment, dismay and outrage is turning 
into action and a determination to fight back.  Members opposite 
on the Liberal benches should understand what their front benches 
have done, what the Prime Minister is trying to do and be 
prepared to rethink their positions. 
Maybe they will take heed of the call today for a caucus revolt. 
That is what we are all hoping for.  Maybe some of those Liberal 
backbenchers will wake up and realize that they have been 
hoodwinked and they will stand and say “No.  This is not my 
priority and I am not going to stand for it”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we had the ambulances in front of the building.  We had 
the hospital beds clearly depicting two tier health care in this 
country.  We had a call from the Canadian Union of Public 
Employees for a Liberal caucus revolt.  I quote from its press 
release:  “Liberals call themselves the saviours of medicare. 
Well, let's see some action”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those people are looking for some backbone.  They are looking 
for a bit of commitment.  They are looking for a long term 
commitment and a lifelong involvement in the funding of health 
care.  Just as I said in the House earlier today, they are fed up 
with these short term, one time, little supplements that the 
government dishes out to keep people happy.  It is like a pay 
bonus instead of a pay raise.  It is like a one night stand 
instead of a lifelong relationship with medicare.  We cannot 
sustain medicare with that kind of irrational, irresponsible 
public policy making.  It is not even public policy making; it is 
tinkering with the system and it is playing with the fears, 
concerns and passions of Canadians.  I say shame on each and 
every one of them sitting across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that what we saw in the budget really is a 
pittance.  Some would say it is peanuts.  It is a paltry amount, 
two cents for every dollar the government is prepared to give in 
tax cuts for a system that is in crisis because of Liberal cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go back to 1995 and remember the $6 billion the 
government took out of cash transfers.  Let us remember that 
the Liberals are responsible for the biggest bite out of health 
care financing in the history of medicare.  Let us remember what 
kind of chaos they put our system in.  Let us remember what kind 
of obligations they now have to fix the mess and get on with 
building medicare for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot believe that there is not more concern being expressed 
by Liberals in this day and age.  I cannot believe that we are 
hearing this kind of damage control and silly arguments coming 
from the front benches of the government.  Obviously they realize 
that they have made a mistake.  Otherwise we would not be hearing 
the kind of irrational arguments coming from the benches over 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First the Prime Minister stands in the House and says “It is 
not true.  We fully restored health transfer payments”.  They 
fully restored the payments?  Who believes them?  Every premier 
in the country has identified a shortfall of at least $4.3 
billion.  Some would put it even higher.  There is a shortfall in 
cash of more than $4 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then what do the Liberals do?  They say “Don't worry.  You have 
to look at tax points too”.  Today the Minister of Health stood 
in the House and said that this government put in $40 billion. 
Do you know what he has done?  He has put in everything but the 
kitchen sink.  He has put in cash, he has put in equalization 
payments, he has put in tax points.  What else? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B>  Why wouldn't you? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Members opposite ask “Why 
wouldn't you?”  Do they not remember what our medicare system is 
all about and how it stays together?  Do they not know that the 
cash is the glue for medicare, that if we do not have cash on the 
table then we cannot hold the likes of Klein and Harris 
accountable and responsible to adhere to the principles of 
medicare? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why else will Klein stand any day now to unleash his 
privatization forces and announce his legislation to contract out 
hospital services to private companies?  Why else are Premier 
Harris and health minister Witmer saying today that now they have 
the ammunition?  Now they have what it takes to open up the 
Canada Health Act.  As quoted in the Ottawa <I>Sun</I>, “Frankly, 
the writing is on the wall, and it says this: `Go private”'. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members opposite have created the climate for those people 
who want to undo medicare to take hold and take force and shape 
the country.  That should be the argument above all that will 
make the government wake up and realize that if it does not show 
a significant commitment to health care in the country, if it is 
not prepared to start moving toward at least a 25% partnership 
and eventually back to a 50-50 partnership, we do not have a hope 
in heck of preserving medicare and stopping those forces of 
privatization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to hon. members opposite that it is not too late.  It is 
time to act because we are on the precipice.  The very future of 
medicare is at stake.  We must act now. 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
there is no question that health care is the top priority for 
Canadians. 
As has been pointed out many times in the debate today, the 
government has restored the CHST cash and tax point transfers to 
the provinces to the same levels, and in fact a little higher 
than they were in 1993.  That is significant.  Not only have we 
done that absolutely, but we did it at a time when government 
spending is still $4 billion lower than it was in 1993.  By that 
fact alone we have shown that we have identified health care.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the next couple of years there will be additional 
transfers.  The $11.5 billion from the 1999 budget over five 
years, plus the additional amount that was identified in budget 
2000, means that there will be $15.5 billion in each of the next 
four years.  That is a 25% increase in just two years.  Again, it 
is an indication of the commitment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member will well know that the transfers to the provinces 
are not colour coded and are not just for health.  They are also 
for post-secondary education and social assistance.  The member 
will also know that the provinces do not have to spend those 
dollars precisely on the areas in which they are given the money. 
In fact, if we take the example of Ontario alone, it had cuts in 
the CHST of some $800 million, but it turned around and gave a 
$4.3 billion tax cut.  There are the priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member will also know that the National Forum on Health 
identified that there was probably over $11 billion of 
inefficient spending in the health care system, which is under 
the management of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that we have balanced budgets for the current year as well 
as for the next two years and given the fact that the member says 
we should give more money to the provinces, could she tell the 
House where would that money come from the things which are 
provided for in this budget?  How would she finance increased 
transfers for health? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me say that 
what we just heard from the member is exactly what Canadians do 
not want to hear.  The Liberals are blaming everybody but 
themselves.  They will not look at their own public policy and 
make a deliberation on what is important for Canadians and what 
is important for something as vital as medicare.  That is number 
one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Number two, I am glad the member raised the issue that we have 
heard in the last couple of days about not worrying about this 
budget because there might be more money on the table next year, 
depending on how much the provinces co-operate and what the needs 
are.  If that is not evidence of damage control, I do not know 
what is.  First we have this nonsense about fully restoring cash 
payments.  Then they throw in the tax points.  Then they say they 
are going to work on next year to see if there is more money down 
the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious that in actual fact the Liberals are embarrassed 
by the situation and find this budget totally lacking in terms of 
dealing with the health care crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that the hon. member look very clearly at the whole 
issue of cash transfers.  That is the glue that holds the health 
care system together.  That is what is needed to hold the likes 
of Klein and Harris to account.  He should look at the fact that 
with the little cash that has been thrown in with this budget the 
federal government's share of funding for health care is 15%. 
That is what matters.  It is not all the other stuff they are 
wanting to use suddenly to deflect away from this issue, it is 
the cash and the transfers that the government cut in 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer to the member's question is that the government 
should make an absolute and firm commitment to start fully 
restoring the cash transfers that it cut in 1995 and ensure that 
base on a sustained an ongoing basis.  There should be none of 
this one time only, short term band-aid stuff that it is throwing 
out, ignoring the realities of the situation.  That is absolutely 
critical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that he look at the facts, which show that even with 
the increases cash transfers for health and education will still 
not be at the level they were in 1993-94.  In fact, cash 
transfers will remain $3.3 billion lower than when the Liberals 
were elected.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely clear that the federal government is not paying 
its fair share.  The obligation, the responsibility, the mandate 
of the government is to be engaged in health care financing in a

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Chatham—Kent Essex, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, at the outset I would like to say that I am sharing my 
time with the member for Durham.  I am sure that the member for 
Durham and myself are nothing but proud.  We are very proud of 
this budget.  We think this is a great budget, and there is no 
question about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House needs a touch of a history lesson.  I remember in 1993 
when my distinguished colleagues opposite were in the position of 
running a government; a government that was running a deficit of 
$42 billion; a government that in eight short years had tripled 
the debt in this country; a government that had unemployment at 
11.5%; a government that did not know which way to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was so bad that its members divided into three groups.  Some 
members did not want to be called Tories any longer, so they 
decided to be Reform.  Others decided they did not like what was 
happening in the Tory Party, so they called themselves the Bloc. 
The Tories remained with two people in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we stop to look at that historical time, we say thank 
goodness that a reasonable, well informed government came to the 
House to straighten out the ship.  Quite frankly, it was the 
current Prime Minister, the Liberal cabinet and the Liberal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a few short years nobody expected us to eliminate the $42 
billion deficit, but that is exactly what we did.  We did that 
and we did it by doing certain things:  by reducing the public 
service, by cutting spending dramatically and by making sure that 
we were more efficient in everything we did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each and every person in this country knows that if a person has 
a budget, a family, a mortgage and a job, everything cannot be 
done.  Everything cannot be completed in one year.  We tracked 
budget after budget, first, to get the economics right, to get 
the trade moving in the country, to encourage business and to 
encourage programs which help all Canadians.  That is exactly 
what we did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we come to a parting of the way.  We have managed well.  The 
economy, the GDP in this country grew so well that we were number 
one in the G-7 countries last year.  We know there is absolutely 
no question that the tax revenue in this country is high, and we 
are now able to share with Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite frankly, at this point in time I want to say thanks.  I 
want to say thanks to every Canadian who has been supportive of 
us, to every Canadian who has bitten the bullet and to every 
Canadian who has put forth a tremendous effort to make sure we 
were supported in getting this ship going the right way.  That 
has been the case.  Every time I am in my riding there is not an 
individual who says “You guys are not doing a great job and the 
finance minister has not done a fabulous job at finance”.  They 
are all supportive.  They look at the trade missions that our 
Prime Minister has made and the increase in the economy and say 
it is just fabulous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We come to a budget where we, as the Liberal Party, can say 
thanks to all Canadians for biting the bullet and we can return 
to them some of the tax dollars that have been increasing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The indexing of the tax system is a major move which will return 
to low income Canadians, to families with children, a great 
benefit over the next four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, it will not happen in one year.  It will happen over four 
years.  But the reality is that over the next four years those 
Canadian families will receive a 21% tax cut. 
We will see the average Canadian get a 15% tax cut and low income 
Canadians with families in the neighbourhood of 18%. Yes, tax 
cuts are there, but at the same time, not only are we de-indexing 
and putting tax cuts in place, we are moving into programs that 
people in the country have told me are important.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just heard some members going on about health care.  I am 
really surprised that they do not understand what is being done 
with health care right now.  I am really shocked that they do not 
realize that the Minister of Finance's announcement yesterday put 
$3 billion more into health care this year.  This is $3 billion 
more than what was there last year.  Cash transfers last year 
were $12.5 billion.  This year they are $15 billion.  This year 
we will have the highest transfers to the provinces in the 
history of the country.  There is no question about those facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We balanced.  Yes, the $2.5 billion that went into the budget is 
added with the budget last year which put in several billion 
more. This is something that the opposition is not really taking 
into account or dealing with in a fair way.  We have to know the 
facts.  The facts are that we have increased the budget in health 
care by $3 billion in transfers to the provinces this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that the best spin doctor in the country, Mike Harris, 
was really misleading people in Ontario when he had his press 
conference today.  The fact is, Mike Harris is getting more money 
than ever before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The interesting point I noted a couple of days ago was when 
Dalton McGuinty, the Leader of Liberal Party in the Ontario 
caucus, pointed out very clearly that Mike Harris did not spend 
all the tax dollars that he got last year.  He got a transfer of 
$1.5 billion of which he only spent $800 million.  Half of that 
money is still sitting there and he is out complaining.  What a 
deception to the people of Ontario.  What a bad policy decision 
he made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite frankly, I put Mike Harris in exactly the same bracket 
that I put Brian Mulroney.  I will tell the House why.  When 
Brian Mulroney was here he pumped up our debt, pumped up our debt 
and pumped up our debt.  Well Mike Harris in Ontario has pumped 
up the debt, pumped up the debt and pumped up the debt to where 
right now Ontario is $19 billion further in debt than it was 
before.  He is certainly a bad example to speak to Liberals about 
policies and directions that we need to follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have one other issue that I wish to cover and I see that I 
have two minutes to do it.  Something that is extremely important 
to the people in my riding is infrastructure:  infrastructure 
funding for highways, infrastructure funding for municipal 
services and infrastructure funding for low income housing. There 
is no question that when I look at this budget, we are delivering 
those dollars big time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anybody sitting across the way knew that today was the day of 
the budget questions to the finance minister.  What did members 
opposite do?  They shrivelled in their seats.  They were afraid 
to ask the minister questions.  Each question they asked they 
looked pitifully bad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a good budget.  People across the country have said that 
it is a good budget.  The finance minister knows it is a good 
budget.  These guys were chicken to ask questions today on the 
budget.  That is an interesting point. 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
direct my question to the hon. member if he will listen, which he 
does not usually do.  I find it rather interesting that he has 
taken a great deal of time and energy to put the blame obviously 
on a previous government. 
I remember the term Brian Mulroney and the deficit and the rest.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the member would like to talk about where deficits 
really started, where they really came from.  If my memory serves 
me correctly, in 1974 a former prime minister by the name of 
Pierre Trudeau put this country into a deficit position.  Would 
the hon. member like to finally take some responsibility for the 
fact that it was his previous government in 1974 that actually 
started that particular ball rolling? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my speech I will talk about how it was the Mulroney 
government and the Wilson government that actually brought us out 
of that hole and started the process to get his budget balanced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would love to respond 
to the member's question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know he does not have the facts straight because he was not 
here.  When one is not here I guess we can understand how one can 
be fed that garbage in the dark and not understand what really 
happened.  He is right.  We did have a debt of $168 billion under 
previous governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Trudeau started the ball rolling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard:</B>  Under Mr. Trudeau, exactly.  That is 
not a problem.  When we have a mortgage on a house, it might be a 
mortgage of $25,000, which is all right, but we have to realize 
that it was Michael Wilson and the Conservative government that 
took that small mortgage of $168 billion and made it $500 billion 
plus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to realize that in eight short years those turkeys put 
this country's finances down the tubes and they are willing to 
stand here today and blame someone else.  They are the most 
inefficient and incompetent people I have ever seen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sat on the finance committee and talked to them every day. 
They chuckled to themselves.  I remember when they threw Don 
Blenkarn out as the chair of the finance committee because he 
disagreed with what was going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we stop and think about the stupidity that went on, it is 
not hard to say that they have nowhere to go.  All Canadians know 
it.  They sat here and filled this whole side and half of the 
other side.  They had a huge majority government and ended up 
with a telephone booth of two.  They are now trying to come back 
with 10.  Canadians know what they did.  The Reform knows what 
they did too because the Reform called itself a different name. 
The same policy, different name ran west. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Because it is so 
close to Easter, I took the fact that the hon. member called a 
party a bunch of turkeys as a term of endearment.  I suspect that 
was a compliment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am happy 
to share my time with the illustrious previous speaker, the 
member for Chatham—Kent—Essex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to report that I took the time last night to fly back to 
my riding to conduct a morning after exercise with my business 
community.  It was very positive.  The people told me that they 
positively endorse the actions of the Minister of Finance and the 
government.  They were very supportive of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the way to my meeting, I happened to listen to Premier Harris 
blabbing away about what a terrible thing it is and so forth. 
When I got to the meeting I was happy to find the provincial 
member of parliament, who is also a Tory.   I basically said that 
this was not about blaming each other for the problems of health 
care.  I said that health care was a problem but that if it was 
all about money it would have been fixed ages ago.  I said that 
it was about re-engineering the health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not actually control the administration of the health care 
system.  What was agreed on in that room, and I think with the 
government as well, is that we are willing to sit down with the 
provinces, but that we should stop all this nonsense about 
blaming each other.  I think the people of Canada are fed up with 
it.  I think they want us to get on with it.  We have an aging 
society. 
I think we can deal with these problems.  It is a commitment of 
the government to deal with the issue of health care now and in 
the future and it has made a significant downpayment on it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to specifically thank the Minister of Finance who made a 
very bold and brave move in ending bracket creep.  It is a lot 
easier not to deal with this.  It is a lot easier to do interim 
measures that deal with bracket creep as it goes along. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people in our society do not understand bracket creep. 
Bracket creep is a complex tax issue.  It is an insidious tax. 
Although inflation keeps going up, the Bank of Canada tries to 
keep it within one and three percentage points, and it has been 
very successful.  The taxation system is not indexed to address 
this issue.  As a consequence, people pay more taxes but in real 
terms are not making any more money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bracket creep is a very insidious tax, a tax by stealth, if I 
may.  From a political point of view, it is easy to leave it 
alone because people do not understand it.  People sort of know 
it is happening to them but they cannot visualize what it is 
because a lot of them do not fully comprehend inflation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We took the leadership and the wherewithal to reduce bracket 
creep.  It was a previous Tory government which said it would 
reduce the indexation to 3% and shove it to the people and let 
them pay the tax.  This was the Tory government's idea of 
inventive taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This country and our economy is very much poised on the brink of 
a major economical breakthrough.  It is not just me saying that. 
We recently received a report from the Canadian E-Business 
Opportunities Roundtable.  I will cite some of the things it has 
talked about in its report.  It talks about Canada being one of 
the most connected countries in the world.  The Minister of 
Industry, who is with us here today, has been very supportive of 
this agenda.  This think tank of academics and high tech people 
are saying that Canada can be the most connected country in the 
world by the year 2004.  It gives me great pleasure to be part of 
a governmental structure that is putting its money where its 
mouth is to make that happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We realize that over $28 billion in gross revenue will be 
generated from e-commerce, which translates into 95,000 jobs. 
That industry is poised to go even further.  It is poised to 
reach $155 billion in revenue and create 180,000 jobs.  Jobs are 
being created in the high tech sectors and Canada can be a major 
player in this.  We are well on our way to making that happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A couple of things stand in our way.  This roundtable and others 
have made mention of some of the problems that we face. We have 
to invest in research and development.  The NDP talked about the 
medicare system and how we need to put more money into medical 
health care and medical research.  We have done that in this 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States has 7.4 researchers per 1,000 population, 
while Canada has only 4.7.  This tells us right away that we have 
a significant problem to deal with in trying to catch up with our 
major trading partner to the south.   This budget addressed some 
of those things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have set aside $900 million over the next four years for 
research chairs in excellence.  We have set aside $700 million to 
develop environmental technologies and $9 billion more to top up 
the Canadian Foundation for Innovation and genome research.  We 
have made major investments in our research facilities.  We are 
putting a lot of money into those areas where knowledge based 
workers get basic training so that they do not have to go south 
of our border to get opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have all talked and heard about the whole concept of brain 
drain. 
With the brain drain the Canadian taxpayer is really subsidizing 
the U.S. economy.  People might be amazed when I say that, but 
let us look at some of the statistics. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1745"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Twenty to thirty per cent of the graduates of the Calgary DeVry 
institute go to California, Washington, Colorado, Minnesota and 
Texas.  Nortel Networks is telling us that it is losing 300 to 
500 engineers per year to the United States and elsewhere.  This 
is a huge growing industry.  The telecommunications industry in 
Canada is worth $72 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are subsidizing the U.S. economy because of the people 
travelling across the border and going further south.  I say this 
out of specific interest because I have two sons who are studying 
information technology.  They are getting offers from south of 
the border and are thinking about possibly going there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do people leave?  People on the other side of the House say 
it is a simple, that we are taxing people too much and that is 
why they are leaving.  In fact a lot of studies have concluded 
that taxation was about 18th on the list of very important items 
that people identify as reasons for leaving this country with 
their vocations.  Probably one of the most important is 
opportunities to deal with new technologies, to get resources and 
so forth.  It is in those areas we have to compete with our 
southern neighbours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say that we subsidize the American economy because of this. In 
the period from 1982 to 1996 it is estimated that we lost $6.7 
billion by people leaving our country.  Some $3.7 billion of that 
is related to our investment in the post-secondary education of 
those people who leave. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996, 52,608 Canadians became temporary worker immigrants in 
the United States.  This resulted in a loss to our tax base. This 
is the other side of it.  These people are highly taxed people 
because they are making lots of money.  It is why we have taken 
some initiatives to change stock options.  I heard the NDP say it 
was terrible thing and that we should soak the rich. These people 
are not necessarily rich but they want opportunities. Stock 
option plans give them the opportunity to invest in their 
companies and be part of a success story.  We want to be part of 
it as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the budget there is a $500 million rollover for people 
selling stock in small and medium size companies.  High tech 
companies can roll that over without paying capital gains.  That 
is not letting the rich off the hook.  It is just common sense to 
have that money reinvested in our economy to create jobs and 
opportunities for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very happy to be part of a governmental system that has 
provided opportunities to push Canada along the road to success. 
We are getting our corporate tax rates down as well from 28% to 
21% for small and medium size businesses.  That is coming this 
year.  For larger businesses it is over a four year period. These 
are ways to make our economy more competitive with that of our 
trading partners.  I think it a positive and a good thing, and I 
am very supportive of it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK235"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my question 
is for the member who just spoke and it concerns taxes.  As long 
as we have been here I think we have proposed that taxes should 
be cut.  We have proposed that the debt should be reduced, 
thereby reducing interest payments and freeing up more taxpayer 
money to pay for the programs we value.  The economy should be 
kick started by giving substantial tax cuts, not the kind the 
Liberal government keeps giving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is one of curiosity.  Maybe I will speak slowly and 
the member can answer me quietly so that no one else will hear. 
During the run-up to the budget the Minister of Finance and the 
Prime Minister, in responding to questions about tax cuts, quite 
often totally denied that tax cuts were in the works.  The Prime 
Minister on one occasion even said that they would not cut taxes, 
that it was not the Canadian thing to do. 
I would like to know exactly what helped to change their minds. I 
am curious about the process and I am very glad they are moving 
toward reducing taxes.  When we form the government we will go 
the rest of the way and do it right.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very happy to help 
the member.  The process is that we have a democratic party on 
this side of the House, a party that listens to its caucus, a 
party that is interested in ensuring that its members get out and 
talk to their constituents and bring those views to the caucus 
process.  It is very democratic.  We do not see ejection of 
members because they disagree with their leader and so forth.  We 
basically have a very democratic process, so the member is 
actually watching the will of the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned earlier that I was talking to my constituents today 
about the budget.  They are very supportive.  I took the plane 
back to Ottawa and when I got in the Chamber I was surprised that 
members for the Reform Party were talking about the flat tax. The 
flat tax was their argument eight years ago.  I thought somehow I 
had entered a time warp or something when I got on the plane.  I 
thought, my God, what happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only person in North America still talking about the flat 
tax is Steven Forbes who just fell out of the Republican 
leadership race.  No one in North America is still supporting the 
flat tax except those people over there who do not seem to have 
awakened to discover that people do not want it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have 
two or three questions for the hon. member for Durham.  The first 
one has to do with high technology and the people we are losing 
to the United States because the government has never brought in 
a national shipbuilding policy, which is a high tech industry. 
We are still waiting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They do not have to put out a contract for 12 frigates.  They 
can put out a contract for one because high tech is moving and 
changing every year.  We could have a phase in and phase out.  It 
would be something new, different from what my government did. 
They should have done it but they did not do it.  There was not a 
penny for shipbuilding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another has to do with defence.  They will get about $2 billion 
more, but does anyone know that the CF-18 refit will cost about 
$1.3 billion, leaving next to nothing for helicopters to replace 
the Sea Kings?  People have lost their lives with the Sea Kings. 
I am really worried about this budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another is health care.  The budget brought down an increase for 
health care.  Do we know how much the Atlantic region will get? 
It will be 2%.  Ninety-eight per cent of every penny that comes 
in for health care will go from central Canada out west and two 
per cent will go to the whole Atlantic region.  I have major 
concerns about what came down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the formula, unless it will be changed, only 40 
university research chairs will go to the Atlantic region out of 
2,000.  Does the government think it will gain any seats in 
Atlantic Canada?  It has two or three now.  It will not have them 
after the next election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very happy to answer 
the member's questions.  I know she is very concerned about the 
shipbuilding industry.  It is a big industry in Saint John and I 
am aware of the high tech aspect of it.  The member will find 
that there are certain ways we assist the shipbuilding business, 
if not directly then indirectly through the whole concept of 
scientific tax credits that go to some of the home based 
industries which supply that industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the defence issue, I am very aware of the Sea Kings.  I have 
had the fortune or misfortune to be inside them from time to 
time.  Even some of my constituents are flying them.  They often 
send me e-mail messages and so forth. I share the member's 
concerns.  I know the Minister of National Defence does as well. 
I am certain we will free up some of those resources in the near 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About the medical aspect of the budget, I do not believe it is 
all about money.  Money is part of the health care problem, but 
we have a bigger problem.  It is not this budget alone.  It will 
be continuous budgets.  All the health ministers in the country 
have to sit down together and find a holistic way to deal with 
the health care sector.  We have one of the poorest users of high 
technology in the health care sector in the world.  We have to 
deal with that too.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
the opportunity given me today to address this House and share 
my comments on the new budget by the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to indicate that I will be splitting my time with my 
colleague for Brandon—Souris. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After hearing the budget being read, and after examining the 
main thrust, I have reached the conclusion that it smacks of 
pre-electioneering, and I will explain why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the Minister of Finance has missed an excellent 
opportunity to table a budget that could have been a 
best-in-career for him. 
He had sufficient money available to him to ensure that this 
budget was one that would help Canadians get their heads above 
water again, able to catch their breath a bit, particularly 
after the years of austerity we have been through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is, of course, a budget that will please a number of 
people, because there is a little bit for everyone, but it is my 
sincere belief that it is simply smoke and mirrors, throwing 
around some big money.  But in reality, after scrutinizing the 
amounts carefully, we are in a position to judge that, given the 
crying needs of Canadians, only minor reductions are being 
offered in the short term.  The real gains will be felt only 
after several years.  What is more, Canadians will not see the 
fulfilment of most of the promises made in this budget before 
the next election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax relief will depend on the government's ability to manage 
the economy and the money given to it by taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, I must give a good mark to the Minister of 
Finance for fulfilling his promise regarding the Canada child 
tax benefit, which will increase by $70 per child, including 
indexation, in July 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the spring of 1998, I tabled a motion which was supported by 
this House. That motion asked the Minister of Finance to index 
the national child benefit, so that inflation would not make 
children and their parents even poorer. This measure meets my 
expectations, and I am pleased to see that my efforts bore 
fruit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there is a fly in the ointment, I would even say two. 
First, it will take several years to reach the overall amount 
since, as is the case with the majority of the measures in this 
budget, the results will become significant only in 2004. 
Second, the government did not take any measure to prevent the 
provinces from clawing back these new investments from the 
poorest in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have always believed that the best way to help children was to 
help their parents. They are the ones who are in the best 
position to look after the most vulnerable members of our 
society. Therefore, it is important to make sure that parents 
have more money available to them, because it will benefit their 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, in the budget, despite the reductions in income 
tax, which will appear only a few years down the road, low 
income Canadians will continue to pay tax even if they earn only 
$8,000 a year, and believe me, there are a number of them in 
this situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An increase of only $100 the first year would bring Canadians 
only 33 cents worth of relief a week—not much relief for the 
families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This affects me closely, because I am one of those who believes 
that, from an economic standpoint, it is the children that 
replenish an economy's stock of human capital.  Society as a 
whole has a vested interest in ensuring this human capital has 
every opportunity to develop so as to expand the level and 
quality of community life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are going to spread the fulfilment of these promises over 
a long period, I wonder whether we will manage it.  In the 
meantime, a lot of water will flow under the bridges, and we 
never know what can happen in the intervening years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada, right now, if there is one area where the situation 
is alarming, it is that of health care, and all the provinces 
are in the same position, that is, a pitiful situation. It is 
this government that has brought about the current crisis by 
taking $17 billion away from cash transfers to the provinces. 
This was the start of the deterioration of health care in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget provides for a $2.5 billion increase for health care 
and education.  This is a derisory and disappointing sum given 
the urgent and essential needs in this area.  I fully agree with 
most of the provincial governments when they say that this sum 
is much too small.

<A HREF="#LINKT96"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, there is no long-term enrichment of the CHST cash 
transfer floor, which would give the health care system a boost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with my leader, the Rt. Hon. Joe Clark, who said that 
the measures announced by the Liberal government were piecemeal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party has long urged that health 
care funding be restored to its pre-cut level, and that the cash 
component of the CHST be restored to the 1993 level.  Right now, 
the CHST falls more than $4 billion short. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A one-time payment from unused funds will do nothing to help the 
long-term stability so vital to our health care system.  The 
government does not understand, or is simply not listening to 
the demands of the provinces with respect to health funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the Minister of Finance has used the budget to 
try to keep everyone happy:  taxes have been cut a bit but are 
still too high; there is some additional CHST assistance, but 
not nearly enough.  Even with tax cuts, corporations will still 
be in fourth place among OECD countries.  And there are some 
significant oversights in this budget:  there is almost nothing 
for the most disadvantaged members of society, the homeless, and 
social housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a small budget whose positive effects will not start to 
be felt for two years.  Strangely enough, that is probably when 
an election will be called. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK238"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is with a great deal of pleasure that I stand to speak to the 
budget that has been placed before us.  I would certainly like to 
respond to some of the comments made by the member for 
Chatham—Kent Essex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not necessarily have to debate this budget.  Over the last 
four months pretty much everything that was in the budget tabled 
yesterday had already been tabled to the Canadian public in the 
newspapers and by other leaks that happened in the finance 
minister's department. Actually there was only one thing that was 
mentioned yesterday that we did not already know.  I am told that 
a lot of the newspapers had already written their stories before 
the Minister of Finance tabled his budget in the House.  It is 
rather interesting and rather strange that the finance minister 
cannot keep the secrets that his ministry would normally keep. In 
saying that, some things have dribbled out over the last little 
while with respect to the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>May I make a comment to the member for Chatham—Kent Essex.  I 
will try to be rational. Unlike the member for Chatham—Kent 
Essex, I will try to stop the hyperbole and certainly the 
rhetoric and deal with this rationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to this, the government continued to say that there was 
this huge deficit and it had to come in here and be the saviours 
for all Canadians.  I hope the member does not hurt himself by 
patting himself on the back so much, but I would like to put on 
the record the reason the budget is now balanced and why the 
Liberal government can take credit for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From 1989 to 1992 this country suffered through the worst 
recession it has ever suffered through.  Timing is everything. 
The government then in power did its best and it put forward the 
blueprint of which this government is now taking advantage to 
balance its budgets. The blueprint was a control of inflation 
that had been taken out of the realm of possibility by the 
previous Liberal government.  We controlled inflation.  We put an 
interest rate policy in place which was necessary.  We put the 
GST in place which, if memory serves me correctly, was to be 
scrapped before this budget but it is still there.  It was put in 
place so that the dollars generated could retire the deficit and 
it did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, the other thing that was put in place and which took 
us out of a horrendous recession and brought us into the economy 
of North America was the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
The government, even when it took power in 1993, was going to 
scrap that agreement as well. 
That is the backbone of our economy.

<A HREF="#LINKT97"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So the Liberals should take much solace in the fact that they 
are in government today and balancing the budgets because of the 
government that went before them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about the budget.  I would like very rationally to 
tell Canadians not to rush out and spend the horrendous savings 
they will have on taxes.  Do not to spend it now because they are 
not there today.  Let us talk about the tax cuts.  First of all, 
give credit where credit is due.  In this budget, the only thing 
the finance minister did that was not leaked was to stop bracket 
creep. Good for him.  Thank you, finance minister.  I do 
appreciate very much on behalf of Canadians that he went to that 
length. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about the taxes that will be seen by Canadians at 
the present time.  Please Canada, listen very carefully.  In 
2000-01 Canadians will take advantage of some $4.6 billion of tax 
relief.  This does not take into consideration the increase in 
the CPP requirements the government has put in place.  The total 
tax relief that is shown here is not what will be in the pay 
packets of Canadians.  Do not rush out, Mr. and Mrs. Canada, and 
spend that money just yet because it is not quite there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has to wait effectively until 2004-05 to take advantage 
of a full $22 billion of tax relief.  That is five years.  It is 
not today.  When we hear about $58 billion of tax savings, take 
it with a grain of salt Canada because it is not here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, I can live with the taxation the government has been 
putting in place, or the tax relief. What I cannot live with is 
the health care situation that it has caused in the first place 
and is now not prepared to fix for Canadians.  Please Canada 
listen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be $2.5 billion put into health care.  Remember that. 
What we do not know is that it is over five years.  In the 
2000-01 fiscal year there will be $1 billion one time only and 
then half a billion dollars a year for the next four years.  When 
Canadians hear $2.5 billion is going to health care, please 
listen to how it is being distributed because it still is not at 
the same level it was in 1993 when the government took office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our health care system depends on two major factors.  One is the 
inflationary factor and the other is the aging population coming 
into the system.  The dollars presented in this budget do not 
take those into consideration.  No, the Liberals are not doing a 
wonderful job nor are they doing us any favours on health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about a couple of other areas where the government 
continues to pat itself on the back.  Let us talk about defence 
quickly and then agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On defence, a white paper that came from this government said 
that there was a requirement for $750 million just to implement 
the quality of life for our military.  There is $5 billion 
necessary for capital expenditures and equipment such as the Sea 
Kings. I do not know if the EH-101 ever comes to mind when 
mentioning defence.  Certainly the dollars that have been 
presented in this budget do not even come close to what is 
required by the Department of National Defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In agriculture the same is true.  There was one line in this 
budget and by the way, that one line in the budget had been 
announced previously.  It is interesting that the Prime Minister 
would announce a day or week previously that a $240 million one 
time ad hoc payment would go to Manitoba and Saskatchewan in 
agriculture.  What the government did not do was give us the long 
term vision for the industry. There does not seem to be a long 
term vision on anything which was presented in this budget on 
agriculture.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A plank of the Liberal platform in the 1993 election was 
infrastructure for municipalities.  It was dear and close to my 
heart at that point in time.  The member for Saint John was the 
mayor of her city just before that time.  It was a wonderful 
program, but let me tell Canadians about it. With the 
infrastructure program we have right now, it does not mean there 
will be $2.5 billion put into it.  In fact this year, 2000-01, it 
will be $100 million.  Next year it will be $350 million and then 
$500 million from that point on.  It is a five year program for 
$2.5 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say right now that it is not enough.  The government 
takes more than $4 billion a year out of the excise tax on 
gasoline alone and it will put $100 million into an 
infrastructure program for next year.  It sounds like it will be 
an election plank. Canadians are not that silly.  They understand 
the games that are being played. They cannot be bought with their 
own money.  They cannot be bribed with their own money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I like the program, but I am very concerned, because now all of 
a sudden what are the criteria?  We are talking about a green 
infrastructure program. We are talking about programs for health 
that will have more benefits to Liberals perhaps, like the 
present ones at HRDC. I am very concerned as to how those dollars 
will flow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly, there are a lot of good things in the budget, but 
overall unfortunately it falls very short of where it had to be. 
<P><A NAME="LINK239"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member for Brandon—Souris 
talked eloquently about some legacies of the Progressive 
Conservative government.  I would like to talk briefly of the 
other legacies of the Progressive Conservative government that 
this government is eliminating. Try for example the 3% surtax in 
the income tax system and try the 5% surtax which the government 
will eliminate by 2004. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians might be confused by some of the member's comments so 
I would like to clarify a couple of points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, the $58 billion in tax relief that we will 
implement is an absolute minimum.  If the surpluses are larger 
than what we expect, we can actually exceed that number by a 
great deal. The other point is that the tax cuts that we are 
implementing, that we are legislating in this budget are worth a 
cumulative $43 billion over five years. It is not about a promise 
in the future; it is being legislated in this budget.  It is $43 
billion.  The five year plan on personal income tax reduction 
will deliver $39.5 billion in personal income tax cuts.  Of that, 
$35 billion is being legislated in this budget.  This is not a 
promise.  This is not a dream.  This will happen.  In fact, $58 
billion is an absolute minimum and it does deserve repeating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite keep talking about the health and social 
transfers to the provinces.  Let me try, as many of my colleagues 
have tried, to clarify this.  In 1993 the total transfers to the 
provinces were in the vicinity of $37 billion. In 1999-2000 they 
are $38.5 billion and they will continue to rise.  We have 
restored the CHST to the provinces.  With respect to any problems 
in the health care system or education, I think members should 
look to the Tory governments in those provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hon. 
gentleman giving credit where credit is due to the Progressive 
Conservative Party in trying to balance the budget. It was Mr. 
Trudeau, if we go back in time, who took the deficit from $18 
billion to $200 billion.  That is quite a multiple. Certainly, as 
I said, there was a blueprint that was put into place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about the CHST.  In the government's own documents 
that have been tabled, the CHST for 1999-2000 is $29.4 billion. 
It will rise to $32.7 billion with the increase from a previous 
budget of $2 billion and $2.5 billion a year in 2001 and 2002, 
and the $500 million in previous years.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health care system still will have less money in it in the 
year 2004 than it had previously.  It does not matter which 
numbers we look at when we take into consideration the 
inflationary factors as well as the aged in our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member not recognize that we have an aging 
population that will put more demands on the health care system? 
The government says constantly that money is not the necessary 
answer to the health care system.  Possibly, but money is needed 
because there are more people accessing the system.  If only the 
government could understand that perhaps its priorities could be 
put into the right area as opposed to the wrong areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will have an opportunity to sit on that side in the not too 
distant future.  The member for Chatham—Kent—Essex talked about 
the telephone booth and the two members.  In 1984 the Liberals 
had 40 seats.  History does repeat itself. 
<P><A NAME="LINK240"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton—Kent—Middlesex, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will be sharing my time with my hon. colleague from 
Mississauga South.  The budget just presented by the government 
takes action on what matters.  Tax cuts, proper investments and 
supporting our families are just some of the actions we have 
taken in response to the concerns of Canadians, including my 
constituents in Lambton—Kent—Middlesex, about what matters to 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lambton—Kent—Middlesex is a rural riding in the heart of 
southwestern Ontario.  The largest municipality has a population 
of 12,000 citizens.  How will this budget affect my constituents? 
How will it impact on families with children, people who work in 
the fields, in the factories or in our small business sector, the 
lifeblood of our rural economy?  Leaving more money in the 
pockets of families is a pre-eminent method of relieving the day 
to day obligations of the most successful and powerful 
contributor to our nation's future prosperity, the family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The middle class family is a big winner in this budget.  It is 
payback time after the many years of cutbacks and financial 
constraints endured through the efforts of all Canadians.  Their 
contributions to Canada's fiscal success can now be addressed by 
personal tax relief measures totalling $58 billion, including 
restoring full indexation to the tax system retroactive to 
January 1, 2000, lowering the middle income tax rate by 3% and 
raising the middle income tax threshold to $35,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A special emphasis on the needs of families has been shaped by 
this budget in its tax reduction plan.  Increasing the child tax 
benefit by $2.5 billion a year by 2004 to more than $9 billion 
annually means the maximum benefit for a family's first child 
will grow to $2,400 from the current level of $1,805.  As the 
Minister of Finance has stated, providing children with a safe 
and nurturing environment, investing in their health and 
education, and promoting secure families are all critical to 
children's sound development and ability to learn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Relative to the current tax system a family's personal income 
tax will drop by an average of 21%, a significant event after 
many decades of tax increases and lower disposable income.  Our 
senior citizens as well will see all their benefits indexed to 
inflation.  Low income seniors could see a tax reduction of 84%, 
verifying our defence of those who have built this nation and 
provided our solid foundation, our senior citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have entered the era of budget surpluses, never to return to 
the dark and gloomy days of deficits spiralling out of control, a 
dangerous national debt dooming our grandchildren's future to one 
of hostility and lack of hope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I truly believe that this is a watershed budget.  We have turned 
on to the path moving forward with confidence toward a healthier, 
more prosperous future with taxes being reduced and the national 
debt on a permanent downward track.  Collectively all Canadians 
have achieved a financial turnaround of historic proportions by 
eliminating a $42 billion deficit in four years.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Maintaining sound fiscal management, showing value for the use 
of the hard earned taxpayer dollar and showing respect for that 
same dollar is how we are governing Canada.  We are taking action 
on what matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are taking action on health care, which is of critical 
consequence in rural areas.  Lambton county in my riding has the 
fewest doctors per capita in the entire province.  Chatham-Kent 
is also on the list of underserviced communities.  Many residents 
must travel to the cities in the region for specialized care, 
creating burdens on those institutions as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our commitment on behalf of Canadians is to increase transfer 
payments to record levels, $31 billion this year alone and rising 
to $43.7 billion by 2004.  I hope Premier Mike Harris will 
actually spend this new money on health care.  Last year Ontario 
received an extra $1.5 billion in transfers and the premier said 
emphatically that he would spend every cent on health care. 
Unfortunately the premier's actions did not match his words. Only 
about half the $1.5 billion was spent on health care, with $700 
million spent elsewhere, perhaps to pay for tax cuts.  I implore 
the premier to follow the federal Liberal government's lead and 
take action on what matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Infrastructure is also of interest in my riding.  The multi-year 
plan to improve highways and municipal infrastructure will be of 
great benefit.  The former Canada infrastructure works program 
resulted in $23 million in projects in my riding, helping to 
build much needed medical centres and firehalls, to name just a 
few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A major overhaul of Canada's border control is also welcomed. 
Southern Ontario has seen troubling incidents of illegal 
migrants, dozens at a time, using Canada as a conduit for their 
attempts at U.S. entry.  My constituents will be pleased that 
millions of dollars will be invested wisely to help the RCMP, 
Canada Customs, and the Department of Citizenship and Immigration 
with extra resources to monitor the movements of high risk people 
and goods and to improve the immigration and refugee 
determination system by making it more effective and efficient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members of parliament eat at least once a day they are 
supporters of agriculture.  We know that the return of farmers 
from the marketplace is getting lower and lower while the grocery 
stores and the middle men reap the profits from our world-class 
food system.  The extra billion dollars announced in January by 
the minister of agriculture is welcome news.  I look forward to 
further discussions on farm aid as we work toward an appropriate 
national farm safety net system that treats all farmers equally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Factoring in the costs of production as the old GRIP 
accomplished would be right and proper.  Having spoken with Ron 
McDougall, Ken Bee, chairman of the Ontario Soybean Growers 
Marketing Board, Don McCabe of the Ontario Corn Producers, and 
Ron Martin who is with the Ontario Wheat Growers, I acknowledge 
their concerns.  These gentlemen, among others, are urging the 
government to extend the market revenue insurance plan beyond the 
next two years to help in long term financial planning.  They 
have made a number of excellent suggestions as well to improve 
the national safety net program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a recent speech by Philip Shaw of Dresden, Ontario, writer of 
“Under the Agridome” in the <I>Voice of the Farmer</I> 
publication, he points out that a first rate and viable safety 
net is absolutely essential if farmers in Ontario and elsewhere 
in Canada are to sustain a long term agricultural outlook.  I 
agree with him.  Let us work together and put these ideas into 
action on behalf of our primary producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of my constituents I believe the budget sets a course 
for a better future by taking action on what matters.  We are 
resolute in sustaining sound financial management by keeping the 
budget balanced, putting a curb on reckless government spending, 
continuing our prudent approach to budget planning, lowering our 
national debt and offering tax cuts across the board, helping 
families, farmers and rural communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The economic outlook is for continued strong growth with the 
unemployment rate at its lowest level in 24 years, with 
disposable income on the rise, and with consumer and business 
confident, upbeat and optimistic.  Canada is a nation of winners 
and the budget sets Canada on the track for future victories so 
that upcoming generations will build on the success of the best 
nation in the world.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was 
more than a bit interested to hear the hon. member talk about 
rural Canada to some extent.  It was nice to hear but talk is 
terribly cheap.  Unfortunately a lot more about the budget 
neglects the rural and remote areas of Canada rather than looks 
forward to helping rural Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Private Woodlot Owners Association has been asking 
for the last 10 years and has been very adamant for the last five 
years that the federal government find a way to incorporate 
sustainable development of woodlots and sustainable forestry 
practice into the Income Tax Act.  There is nothing in the budget 
for sustainable woodlot management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is absolutely nothing in the budget for the mining 
communities in remote areas of Canada and in the rest of Canada 
in terms of flow through shares.  There is no talk at all about 
flow through shares for exploration companies in the mining 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is absolutely nothing in the budget for real tax relief 
for farmers who need serious tax relief for over $500,000 of 
capital gains.  There is very modest tax relief from 75% of 
capital gains down to 66 and two-thirds, and of that one can only 
claim 50%.  I would say there is a lot more in the budget that 
does not help rural Canada than does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She talked about infrastructure.  For the first time in eons we 
mention wharves and infrastructure which the government decided 
to divest itself of.  Wharves are mentioned but there is no 
mention of how the government plans to put money into wharves and 
put infrastructure money into the ports and harbours of Canada. 
There are a lot more unanswered questions about assistance to the 
rural and remote areas of Canada than questions that are answered 
in the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur:</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
my colleague went through examples of what was missing from 
the budget.  He can rest assured that what was 
written in the budget certainly reflects some of his concerns. If 
we turn to some of the action taken under environmental 
technology in our sustainable practices, some of the concerns he 
outlined in forestry or mining are addressed in the budget in 
dollar allocations regarding new technologies and new research 
and development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to the infrastructure program, it was a great success in my 
riding.  Many of my constituents asked to support their concerns 
in Ottawa about the infrastructure program for firehalls, for 
example, as I have stated.  We had built with the province and 
the municipality a health care centre which would not have been 
able to be built if we did not have that program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a step in the right direction.  Do we have all the dollars 
there that the member is asking for?  I do not think so, but we 
are stepping in the right direction. 
<P><A NAME="LINK242"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened to my colleague's 
comments with great interest.  One of the key features of the 
budget was the commitment to a $58 billion tax reduction package. 
As we pointed out, the personal income taxes of Canadians will 
come down an average of 15%.  If we combine that with the 10% 
which we implemented previously in the last two or three budgets, 
there is a total tax relief package of about 22%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know this will be a very positive development in the ridings 
of all members.  Could the member give us an impression of what 
this kind of tax relief package will do for her constituents?

certainly well received. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I received calls today in my riding office complimenting the 
Minister of Finance once again on the direction he has taken with 
the budget.  I think that was reflected in question period today 
when our hon. finance minister did not have to stand often. 
Obviously the opposition did not have many questions to ask, and 
that is reflective of a good budget.

<P><A NAME="LINK245"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, on February 16 I asked the Liberal government what 
action plan it had put together to defend our economy from the 
OPEC cartel and Canadians from the impact of record energy 
prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the cost of home heating fuel doubling, just heating a 
house this winter will eat up all of the minuscule tax breaks 
Canadians received from the Liberals yesterday.  Record gas 
prices, record diesel fuel prices and the energy component of our 
economy is very, very serious in terms of pricing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I asked my question, the U.S. energy secretary and the U.S. 
president had just announced a series of measures designed to 
help Americans, especially in the northeastern states, to deal 
with the sudden run-up in costs of these essential energy 
commodities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The U.S. president said that he was deeply disturbed by the 
trouble this was causing Americans and that his administration 
was monitoring the situation on a daily basis.  With his energy 
secretary he announced 17 different measures, including 
assistance for low income earners to pay their heating bills, 
loan assistance for truckers and so on.   Moreover, the energy 
secretary held a summit with oil companies, state government 
officials and affected stakeholders in Boston on the very day I 
raised the issue in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The contrast between the U.S. administration and the Canadian 
Liberal government on this matter should be the cause of grave 
embarrassment to the government and to the Minister of Industry. 
Instead of concern, we got partisan scorn.  Instead of caring, we 
got buck passing.  Instead of an answer, we got hogwash. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the industry minister said “If it is so important, why 
do provinces like Saskatchewan not do something?”  Not to defend 
the provinces, but their fuel taxes do not go up when gas prices 
go up or when diesel prices go up or when home heating fuel goes 
up, but federal taxes like the GST and the BST do go up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister really advocates the provinces regulating energy 
prices, he should say so.  Otherwise he is just passing the buck 
again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next the minister suggested that the government had in fact 
already been discussing this issue with the provinces and 
territories.  I checked.  The council of energy ministers has not 
had the issue of gasoline prices on its agenda since the summer 
of 1998.  It was not on that agenda because the federal 
government put it there; it was there at the request of the Yukon 
NDP energy minister in 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, the ministers responsible for consumer affairs agreed to 
fund a study on competition in gasoline pricing, but the minister 
picked the same consultant who wrote a previous study for the big 
oil companies, and now everyone else is boycotting.  Who is going 
to read the study?  Is it going to be credible?  Not likely.  It 
will be taken seriously by no one except the Minister of Industry 
and the Minister of Natural Resources, who are so cozy with the 
oil patch they never even noticed how badly consumers are hurting 
from these price hikes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my question I expressed concern about the potential impact of 
rising energy prices on the inflation rate, a concern echoed by 
many commentators, including, on that very day, the governor of 
the Bank of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that the data for January which was released the 
following week showed the overall or headline inflation rate down 
from 2.6% to 2.4%, but energy costs rose by an annual rate of 
28.5% during that month.  Those costs remain a source of concern 
in our economy, which relies so heavily on energy, which is the 
underpinning of our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of these concerns and because Canadian consumers are 
hurting, I asked what the government's plan was to defend 
Canadians from this crisis.  To its shame it had none.  It was 
barely aware of the problem.  It had no intention of showing 
leadership and finding a solution.  It just passed the buck and 
hoped the problem would go away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the parliamentary secretary today can tell us 
whether his government has finally seen the light.  Can he tell 
Canadians what action plan has been put together to defend our 
economy, to defend Canadian consumers, business people and 
farmers from the OPEC cartel?

embarrassment should be on the provincial governments, which have 
the jurisdiction, if they so wish, to regulate prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister, myself and the entire government are aware of the 
frustration felt by all Canadians concerning gasoline and diesel 
prices, as well as home heating prices.  We are not passing the 
buck.  Let me state from the outset that it was this Liberal 
government which started the task force to look into this issue, 
of which the member is well aware. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister, the minister and the entire government have 
shown great concern on this matter.  That is why the minister 
asked the petroleum industry to meet with him to explain the 
reasons for the recent fuel increases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the hon. member is aware that gasoline pricing is 
under provincial jurisdiction.  He knows that very well.  There 
are specific examples in P.E.I., in Quebec and in Ontario where 
prices have been regulated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to assure the member that from a competition point of 
view we want to ensure that the prices are determined by market 
forces.  If it is found that there is collusion, the Competition 
Bureau, as it has in the past, will step in to rectify the 
situation and take appropriate measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me point out for the benefit of the member what has 
happened.  For the record, crude oil prices were under $11 per 
barrel in 1998 and briefly exceeded just over $30 a barrel in 
February 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hopefully these will be some of the concerns which will be 
addressed at the OPEC meeting in March.

1999, I asked the Minister of Foreign Affairs how he explained 
Canada's slowness in defending the Timorese, 78% of whom had 
voted in favour of their independence on August 30. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada, which sits on the security council, let the Indonesian 
militia and paramilitary plunge this poor region into a 
bloodbath. This is a region where a small people had been 
suffering from a permanent intrusion by Indonesia since 1975, 
when it was abandoned by Portugal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is of concern about Canada's slowness to act was that the 
minister knew since February, because a group of NGOs, including 
the Council of Churches, had met with him and told him that the 
Indonesian police and army were the accomplices of the militia 
and that intimidation tactics were beginning to be used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister knew that the two leaders of the community, Ramos 
Horta and Xanana Gusmao, had called on the international 
community for help, because they knew that violence was about to 
erupt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, during the summer the international community was 
alerted because an intimidation campaign was going on to prevent 
the Timorese from voting for their independence. Opposing forces 
said “If you vote for independence, there will be a bloodbath”. 
Indeed, on September 4, when the results of the referendum were 
released, the carnage began.

my question is a supplementary to the question asked of the 
Minister of Transport.  I direct my question to the very 
distinguished Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Transport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last summer the Minister of Transport announced that there was a 
crisis in the aviation industry.  Not many people knew that, but 
he announced there was a crisis and therefore, by his very 
announcement, it was determined that there was a crisis.  We went 
through a whole lot of turmoil, debate and negotiation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of the announcement that there was a crisis in the 
industry, the transport committee held endless meetings almost 
around the clock hearing from people in all facets of the 
aviation industry:  air traffic controllers, pilots, the airlines 
companies and ticket agents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time we were told that there was no crisis in the 
industry, that there was a crisis in a company in the industry. 
It completely proved that the department and the minister were 
wrong in their interpretation of the situation.  As we know, it 
went on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any case, we ended up by adopting the dominant carrier 
structure that we have now, with Air Canada having virtually 80% 
to 85% of the entire industry totally under its control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister recently tabled legislation that would help control 
the situation and provide protection for different parties in the 
aviation industry both from the consumer's point of view and from 
the industry's point of view.

position of the government on ownership restrictions as far as

</I></B></P><P align=left>What protections are there for the regional airports?  All the 
airports in Atlantic Canada are really suffering now because of 
the reduction in flights, reduction in revenues from landing fees 
and terminal fees.  What protection is there for those airports?

<P><A NAME="LINK252"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

pleasure to respond to at least one of the concerns the 
distinguished member for Cumberland—Colchester has presented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the policy framework released on October 26 I stated that our 
vision for the 21st century is a safe and healthy Canadian 
airline industry capable of competing with the biggest and best 
airlines in the world, serving all parts of the country at fair 
prices and controlled by Canadians for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that context the Government of Canada asked parliamentarians 
for their input on among other things whether increasing the 
current 10% limit on individual shareholdings in Air Canada to a 
new level would contribute to achieving a healthy Canadian 
controlled airline industry.  The Government of Canada has 
benefited from the views of parliamentarians expressed in the 
reports from the standing committees of both Houses in finalizing 
the legislation which we now have introduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has decided to raise the individual ownership 
limit for Air Canada from 10% to 15%.  This increase formed part 
of the exchange of letters outlining commitments that Air Canada 
made to the government in order to gain approval for its takeover 
of Canadian Airlines last December.  Air Canada has stated that 
it is satisfied with the government's decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government believes that this increase will allow greater 
investment while providing Air Canada with the stability it needs 
during this transition period.  This change accords with the 
government stated intention in the policy framework to ensure 
that we have a safe, healthy, Canadian controlled air industry 
that meets our domestic and international requirements and the 
needs of Canadians well into the 21st century.

manpower.  At the beginning of the new century, we should no 
longer be tangled in these quarrels between brothers, which only 
hurt brotherly feelings and do nothing good for the international 
community.  Therefore, I would like to propose that the 
governments and peoples on the two sides of the strait adopt a 
new way of thinking.  Let us show our courage and a sense of 
mission to permanently abandon to the old century those wars and

supported peaceful negotiations and that they will again relay 
that message to Beijing.

appropriate.  I would like to ask the parliamentary secretary if 
he could explain to the House why Canada's response is not a 
stronger response.  We need to defend democracies.  We need to 
defend peaceful nations that do not want war.

its concerns. During a visit to Beijing on February 21 to 24, the 
assistant deputy minister for Asia-Pacific and Africa, Joseph 
Caron, emphasized Canada's concerns directly with the 
vice-minister of foreign affairs in Beijing.  Our ambassador to 
China further underlined these concerns in a separate meeting 
with the vice-minister.  In both of those meetings we stressed 
our concerns about the threat of military confrontation and 
strongly appealed for a peaceful and negotiated settlement. These 
concerns were also reiterated to the Chinese ambassador in 
Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's one China policy remains unchanged.  We do have 
extensive economic, cultural and people to people contacts with 
Taiwan.  We have used our informal channels to convey our 
concerns on this issue to Taipei.
