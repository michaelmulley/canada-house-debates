<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-66, an act to 
amend the National Housing Act and the Canada Mortgage and 
Housing Corporation Act and to make a consequential amendment to 
another act, be read the third time and passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am happy to speak today to Bill C-66, 
an act to amend the National Housing Act and the Canada Mortgage 
and Housing Corporation Act at third reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to begin by congratulating members of the Standing 
Committee on Natural Resources and Government Operations for 
their hard work on this bill.  I would also like to congratulate 
and thank my hon. colleague, the parliamentary secretary, the 
member for Mississauga Centre, for the work she did in leading 
this bill through the House and committee. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 11, my colleague said that the proposed amendments 
support the Government of Canada's efforts to make government 
more efficient and provide better service to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The benefits of this bill are threefold.  Canadians will benefit 
from these changes because CMHC will be able to respond to 
shifts in consumer demand and market conditions.  They will also 
benefit from the availability of low cost funds and access to 
mortgage financing no matter where they live in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, CMHC will be able to better promote Canadian housing 
products and services abroad.  This will result in job 
opportunities for Canadians, here and abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, CMHC will be able to provide better service to Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every one of CMHC's core activities, whether it is 
mortgage loan insurance, assistance for housing for low income 
Canadians, housing research or export promotion, works in support 
of the Government of Canada's objectives for the housing 
industry.  Over the years CMHC has been involved in every aspect 
of housing, from building units, to direct financing, community 
planning, mortgage insurance and now trade development. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The achievements of CMHC have brought enormous benefits to 
Canada and indeed to many of our own families and communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through partnerships among all levels of governments, community 
organizations and the private sector, we work to allow Canadians 
to obtain the shelter they need.

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most important aspects of these amendments is the 
inclusion of the public policy mandate for CMHC's mortgage loan 
insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This change will provide access to mortgage financing at the 
lowest possible cost for all Canadians, regardless of where they 
live in Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This new legislation will remove unnecessary restrictions to 
CMHC's mortgage loan insurance business.  This enhanced 
flexibility will enable the corporation to respond to the housing 
needs of Canadians more effectively.  With these changes CMHC 
will be a more competitive and a more innovative mortgage 
insurer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation will allow CMHC to operate its mortgage loan 
insurance program on a more commercial basis.  This will ensure 
that CMHC is able to compete fairly and effectively with any 
private mortgage insurer, while enabling CMHC to fulfill its 
public policy objectives. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By guaranteeing competition in this sector, we can ensure that 
Canadians have access to the best possible price, and a greater 
number of choices in home financing products.  Furthermore, they 
will benefit from the availability of low-cost funds and access 
to mortgage financing no matter where they live in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the introduction of its 5% down payment program, CMHC is 
already an industry leader.  Originally a program for first-time 
homebuyers, repeat purchasers can now also take advantage of 
this popular program. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give the House an idea of just how many 
Canadians depend on this mortgage loan insurance product to 
fulfill their dream of owning a home.  Since its introduction, 
over 600,000 Canadians have used CMHC's 5% program to buy their 
first home.  Surveys show that 70% of these buyers could not have 
purchased their home at that time without the reduced down 
payment option. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overall, in the past year alone, CMHC has helped Canadians gain 
access to over 300,000 homes with the use of mortgage loan 
insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was done at no cost to the government.  In fact, CMHC 
policy requires that it be self-financing, relying solely on the 
premiums and fees it charges over the long run. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the introduction of CMHC's electronic mortgage loan 
insurance approval system, known as EMILI, most loans can be 
approved in one hour or less and in most cases within minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The EMILI system has now been expanded to include new houses, to 
the benefit of builders, lenders, and consumers alike.  That 
means Canadians can become homeowners much faster and much 
easier. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This automated system is just one example of how CMHC is working 
with various members of the housing industry, in this case 
financial institutions, brokers and realtors, to contribute to 
the health of the sector.  In recent years CMHC has been 
approached to support many innovative and original home financing 
products.  Unfortunately, under the current National Housing Act, 
CMHC has not been able to bring the benefits of some of these new 
types of home financing products to the marketplace. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once the new NHA legislation is in place, CMHC may consider 
products such as reverse equity mortgages.  This flexible new 
product allows older homeowners to use the equity in their homes 
to obtain funds while allowing them to continue to live in their 
homes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that the availability of affordable, accessible 
housing is a critical factor in enabling seniors to live 
independently, and to remain active members of the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CMHC would also be able to develop non-mortgage financing for 
remote areas where the land registry system does not facilitate 
mortgages. 
It would also facilitate similar financing arrangements on 
Indian reserves where restrictions exist on providing land as 
security for mortgages.

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CMHC mortgage loan insurance has not only helped Canadians 
become homeowners, it has also been the key to the health of the 
housing industry in Canada.  By fully protecting lenders against 
default on the part of borrowers, mortgage loan insurance 
encourages investment in residential construction which results 
in the creation of numerous jobs in this key sector of our 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For every $100 million spent on construction, 1,500 person years 
of employment are created both directly and indirectly.  Behind 
every construction worker are many other workers producing 
materials needed to build a home. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this new legislation, CMHC will also be able to better 
respond to opportunities within national and international 
markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These proposed amendments will further increase the 
corporation's success in housing export promotion.  Reaching out 
to foreign markets will mean opportunities for Canadian 
businesses and jobs for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, by working with the housing industry on projects 
such as demonstration homes, CMHC will be able to contribute to 
the industry's marketing efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The timing for these business development efforts could not be 
better.  Around the globe, the total demand for housing is in 
the tens of millions of units per year.  Looking at this figure, 
it is obvious that there is great potential in a number of 
untapped markets. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is where Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation can help. 
These amendments will work to further increase its ability to 
develop international links through its membership in team 
Canada. They will also reinforce CMHC's ongoing commitment to 
provide assistance to foreign countries through the establishment 
of sound housing systems and building practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the help of CMHC through its export promotion role, the 
thousands of firms that make up the Canadian housing industry can 
become even bigger players in international trade.  Canadian 
entrepreneurs will be able to look to CMHC for marketing support 
in projects overseas. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of these amendments, export promotion will become an 
increasingly important component of CMHC's research and transfer 
activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an area that holds considerable promise for expanding 
business opportunities for our housing industry while still 
promoting employment opportunities for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed amendments will enhance CMHC's ability to play a 
role as a promoter, facilitator and adviser in the field of 
export, as well as in the field of housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For more than 50 years, our corporation has played a vital role 
in helping Canadians to become homeowners.  It has made an 
important contribution to the growth of the entire economy and 
the key sector of construction.  It has also been a leader in 
research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons, I urge members to pass this bill so that 
the corporation can grow and develop in this new era of 
globalization, while continuing to serve the housing needs of 
Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today on third and final reading of Bill C-66 with many 
concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government made claim to a bill that was to level the 
playing field between CMHC and the private sector and to make the 
mortgage insurance industry more competitive.  The government 
promoted this bill as legislation which would strengthen Canada's 
housing agency, CMHC, and thereby strengthen its ability to carry 
out its mandate of administering to Canadians' housing needs. I 
feel it has done neither and that this exercise has been all the 
more regrettable because the government had ample input and 
opportunity to make a better piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party opposes Bill C-66 for the following reasons. 
The bill does not accomplish what it sets out to do, namely, 
create a more level playing field with the private sector. Reform 
policy states that where the private sector demonstrates an 
ability, the government should not compete with the private 
sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The testimony of private sector witnesses before the standing 
committee was not acted upon and thereby rendered the legislative 
process ineffective. Further, the private sector's valid 
suggestions and proposed amendments on ways to improve the bill 
were systematically ignored by the minister and therefore the 
government which rendered the democratic process itself 
ineffective. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1020"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, while the bill partially recognizes that housing policy 
would be carried out more effectively by the provinces, it does 
not go far enough.  As a result of being vague about 
responsibility, a clear and concise national housing policy 
continues to be lacking and therefore puts Canada's housing 
policy, particularly on social housing, in jeopardy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now turn to private sector competition or the lack of it. 
The purpose of Bill C-66 as put forward by the government is to 
modernize CMHC by enabling it to respond in a more flexible 
manner to changes in the workplace.  The government also claims 
that Bill C-66 will put CMHC and its private sector competitors 
on a more equal footing thereby levelling the playing field in 
the market of mortgage insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The business of mortgage insurance has been in the hands of 
government for so long that it currently is responsible for 88% 
of the market share.  At this time many consumers rely on the 
stability of the CMHC mortgage insurance fund.  Without question 
Canadians have benefited from this program. Many who would not 
otherwise be able to own their own homes now do as a result of 
CMHC's mortgage insurance activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To say at this time that CMHC should get out of the mortgage 
insurance business would be premature.  However Reform believes 
that we are witnessing a demonstration by the private sector of 
its capability in the area of mortgage insurance.  This is an 
indication to Reform that its policy that governments should not 
compete with the private sector where the private sector can do 
the job is on track. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However given CMHC's long history in this area of activity and 
the necessity to protect the stability of the mortgage insurance 
market, Reform would argue in favour of levelling the playing 
field so that the private sector can continue to demonstrate its 
ability to handle mortgage insurance activities effectively and 
competitively. In this way Canada will begin to create a stable 
mortgage insurance environment within the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe the private sector must be given an equal opportunity 
to capture more of the market share in the mortgage insurance 
business.  This will create true competition, better prices and 
service to consumers and will encourage other private sector 
companies or competitors to enter the market.  Is that not what 
it is about, better prices, better service to the consumer? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-66 does not accomplish the goal of levelling the playing 
field and continues to promote advantages in favour of CMHC over 
the private sector.  It does so in several ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CMHC holds a 100% guarantee by the government on its mortgage 
insurance holdings.  GE Capital, CMHC's private sector 
competitor, has only a 90% guarantee.  Bill C-66 does not change 
this important inequity. Clearly the banks favour the 100% 
guarantee and therefore, despite good service from GE Capital, 
they favour mortgage insurance through CMHC.  This is not a level 
playing field.  This does not promote a competitive environment 
as the bill stated as a goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>GE Capital cannot successfully introduce any new products into 
the marketplace because it does not have a 90% guarantee on such 
products, as is the case with CMHC.  This means that the 
introduction of innovative products and services is prevented 
from entering the marketplace unless they are established by 
CMHC.  This again does not create a level playing field for the 
private sector, nor a competitive environment for consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Bill C-66 CMHC will now fund additional policy reserves 
and commence payment to the government based on capital and 
additional policy reserves.  CMHC claims that it will do so 
because the private sector must do so under OSFI regulations. 
While the intent seems to be correct, the fee will not be 
calculated using the same formula that is used for private 
insurers and is therefore less than the fee private insurers 
must pay. This also does not level the playing field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CMHC and GE Capital are governed by different legislation.  GE 
Capital is regulated by OSFI, the Office of the Superintendent of 
Financial Institutions, as a private insurance company whereas 
CMHC is not.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>CMHC's corporate summary states that it wants to level the 
playing field where it says “CMHC needs to ensure that the basis 
for public private competition is fair, i.e., that CMHC has no 
unfair advantages”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, Bill C-66 fails to accomplish that level playing field 
and therefore continues to promote an inequity to the advantage 
of CMHC.  The failure of Bill C-66 to level the playing field 
between the public and private sector is a clear indication that 
a crown corporation cannot compete fairly with the private 
sector, a private sector that has clearly demonstrated it can 
carry out this kind of activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the government initially filled a void through CMHC's 
mortgage insurance fund, it is clear that there is room now for 
the private sector to assume more of this activity.  It is both 
ready and willing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the value of gradually devolving the government's 
involvement in such activity?  It is that the private sector can 
grow, that the risk to government and the taxpayer is reduced, 
that the costs of government are reduced and that the marketplace 
is thriving on true competition.  This does not mean that 
suddenly the marketplace is free to do as it pleases and that 
consumers are at risk.  There are bodies such as OSFI in place to 
regulate such activity and to protect consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The natural progression must be that government gets out of the 
business of the private sector where the private sector can show 
that it is capable.  How can Canadians realize these benefits if 
the private sector is never given a truly fair opportunity to 
compete on the same level playing field and the government 
continues to prevent it from doing so? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest to the House that clearly the logical path 
toward the objective of levelling the playing field is not to 
continue to broaden the powers of CMHC and to make it more 
commercial.  The logical path is to change our tack, to look at 
the private sector's abilities and in the long term to make the 
market more secure by allowing the private sector to be as strong 
as it can be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the interim we must ensure the market's stability by looking 
at CMHC and the private sector as partners rather than 
competitors.  In this way through the pursuit of public-private 
partnership, governments can benefit from the knowledge of the 
private sector and the private sector can benefit from the work 
that the government has put in place.  Government should not be 
competing with its own private sector.  The government's ultimate 
objective should be to improve the economy by strengthening the 
private sector.  Canadians can only benefit from this kind of 
approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reiterate two reasons why Reform opposes this bill.  The 
testimony of private sector witnesses before the standing 
committee was not acted upon and thereby rendered the legislative 
process ineffective. The private sector's valid suggestions and 
proposed amendments on ways to improve the bill were 
systematically ignored by the minister and therefore the 
government, which rendered the democratic process ineffective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is very good at commenting on CMHC's willingness 
to work in partnership with the private sector, with non-profit 
organizations and non-government organizations but this was not 
demonstrated in the passage of this bill through the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Partnership relies on a willingness to co-operate. The actions 
of this government regarding Bill C-66 do not indicate a 
willingness to co-operate.  The standing committee and members of 
the House outside of committee met with the private sector and 
non-governmental agencies that have a vested interest in ensuring 
that CMHC's mandate is sound and works to the benefit of all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These groups came forward with many concrete ways in which to 
improve this bill and they were systematically ignored by the 
government.  This was clearly demonstrated in committee when the 
suggestions for improvement by GE Capital, the Appraisal 
Institute of Canada and the Co-operative Housing Federation of 
Canada were ignored. Amendments put forward by opposition members 
were also ignored. When opposition members requested more time to 
deal with the bill, they too were ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the record, I wish to summarize some of the important 
suggestions and concerns put forward by these organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Co-operative Housing Federation asked the committee to 
consider the following questions:  Will Bill C-66 impede the 
federal government from acting now or in the future to alleviate 
Canada's housing needs? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1030"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT6"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT6"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1030
<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to point out that some of the considerations 
recently by the Standing Committee on Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development concerned the shortage of housing in Nunavik and in 
the territory of Nunavut which are areas we have so far visited 
and about which we have heard many representations concerning the 
shortage there.  I would add my concern to that concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, is it intended to allow the provincial governments to 
alter existing statutory requirements retroactively?  If not, why 
does the bill empower CMHC to waive existing National Housing Act 
provisions for existing programs and to allow provinces in turn 
to waive them?  These are serious questions which did not receive 
serious consideration.  Yet, today we find ourselves at third 
reading and none of these concerns were acknowledged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the GE Capital Mortgage Insurance Company we heard requests 
made to provide the same level of guarantee to both public and 
private insurance; to extend the guarantee to new private 
insurance products, allowing private insurers to introduce 
products not offered by CMHC; to require CMHC to calculate 
payments to the government using a model comparable to that 
employed by other Canadian financial institutions; and to work to 
ensure that CMHC is answerable to the same restrictions and 
regulations as the private sector.  These were legitimate 
concerns and workable requests that would have improved the bill 
but they were ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the Appraisal Institute of Canada we heard the following 
concern, that CMHC's growing emphasis on speedy approval for its 
lender clients to reflect a more commercial orientation has the 
potential to undermine public policy responsibilities by putting 
the high ratio mortgage insurance at risk.  In particular, the 
Appraisal Institute had concerns about the lack of appraisals 
done by CMHC; their reliance on a computer system that does not 
incorporate actual appraisals by appraisers; and the fact that 
CMHC will now have the ability to vary the price of premiums 
according to the risk, thereby abandoning the policy that all 
Canadians should pay the same price and should not be 
discriminated against depending on where they choose to live. 
Again, these were valid concerns affecting us all that were not 
addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These groups, every single one of them, had constructive ideas 
as to how we might improve the bill, but none of them were acted 
upon.  What it shows us is that while the government is willing 
to promote partnership, it does not always act accordingly.  If 
it did, it would have worked with these groups to make Bill C-66 
a better bill.  Instead, it has been intent only on the bill's 
passage so as to broaden the powers of an already powerful 
agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to state what our final main objection is to 
this bill.  While the bill partially recognizes that housing 
policy would be carried out more effectively by the provinces, it 
does not go far enough.  As a result of being vague about 
responsibility, a clear and concise national housing policy 
continues to be lacking and therefore puts Canada's housing 
policy, particularly social housing, in jeopardy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, let us be clear that CMHC plays a dual role and has dual 
functions.  As well as its commercial activities, such as 
mortgage insurance, CMHC has the responsibility of carrying out 
the government's national housing policy by ensuring that all 
Canadians have access to affordable housing.  Due to the latter, 
CMHC is heavily involved in aspects of social public housing, low 
income housing, residential rehabilitation, aboriginal housing, 
co-op housing and non-profit housing vehicles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here, too, the workings of CMHC would find a balance in a 
public-private partnership arrangement as there are many 
worthwhile organizations in Canada who work within and understand 
the social housing needs of Canadians.  In order to facilitate 
this, however, in the most optimal, effective and cost-efficient 
manner, we must first be clear about which level of government is 
best suited to be responsible for housing in Canada.  Where 
social housing is concerned we have seen the Liberal government 
pulling away from supporting social housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993, no new funding has been put aside for social housing 
needs and, as we have seen, the decline in Canada's housing stock 
through aging and other factors is causing a social housing 
shortage and challenging CMHC's mandate to provide not only 
affordable but quality housing to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite evidence to the contrary, the government will not 
relinquish control of social housing to the levels of government 
that are most directly involved and active in meeting Canadians' 
housing needs.  By way of example of the capability of the 
provinces and their municipal partners, I point to the recent 
reports that have been produced to address the growing housing 
concerns across the country, particularly the issue of 
homelessness. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1035"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT7"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT7"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1035

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I bring members' attention to Toronto's task force on the 
homeless and the British Columbia government's response to 
housing needs.  In both cases these reports demonstrate an 
ability to recognize what is required and the ability to take 
action.  In British Columbia, for instance, a 1992 amendment to 
its municipal act required that all municipalities include 
housing policies in their official community plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At those levels of government we see action on housing issues, 
not more talk.  Despite the work that has been done, the federal 
government responded in its usual fashion according to the CMHC's 
five-year corporate plan: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>CMHC plans to conduct a forum on best practices for addressing 
homelessness.  This forum will bring together experts on the 
homeless, representatives of service providers and various levels 
of government to share information. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a cumbersome and long term approach to a problem that 
requires immediate action.  Surely Toronto's task force does not 
need more time to talk.  It has made its recommendations but it 
is a fact of life with government at the federal level.  The 
federal government does not have the flexibility or the agility 
to act in a timely fashion and respond as well as levels of 
government that are closer to the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians recognize this as well.  That is why Reform's policy, 
supported by the grassroots of this country, states that housing 
should be the full responsibility of the provinces.  The federal 
government is surely making a move in this direction by 
transferring the management of its social programs to the 
provinces but it is doing so very slowly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-66 could have made great strides in this regard. However, 
it did not go far enough in moving housing responsibilities to 
the provinces and in fact confuses the issue by downloading some 
of its social housing responsibilities to the provinces while 
keeping others.  The effect is a gap in social housing policy 
responsibility and a void where a solid national housing strategy 
should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ultimately, the issues and requirements of social housing are 
not being met and Canada's social housing stock is in decline at 
a time when rejuvenation is needed.  Reform would argue that it 
is time the federal government was clear about its role in 
administering a national housing policy and that ultimately one 
level of government should be responsible for it to ensure the 
needs of Canadians are being met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces, with support from their municipalities, have 
demonstrated a better understanding of the social housing needs 
of Canadians and are in the best position to ensure that Canadian 
needs are being met.  It is time they were given the ability to 
move forward in this regard.  Clearly they have demonstrated 
their ability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party regrets that the bill is not all it could be 
and that the government, intent on pushing it through, did so at 
the expense of input from many organizations in which support a 
better national housing policy for Canadians and a more vibrant 
marketplace for homebuyers.  Like them, the Reform Party believes 
that housing is an extremely important and urgent issue, that 
more and more it calls for partnerships and the benefits of 
collective thinking between the public and private sectors. Bill 
C-66 did not promote this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians believe strongly in this country's ability to provide 
affordable and decent housing to everyone and it is a shame this 
government missed an ideal opportunity to create avenues that 
would strengthen housing policy in the country.  It is time that 
a housing strategy, both clear and concise in its intent and its 
objectives, existed in Canada, that responsibilities are defined, 
accepted and acted upon, and that both public and private sectors 
are given the means to work together to ensure we reach our 
objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The belief that making CMHC more commercial is the answer to the 
housing challenges we face in Canada is shortsighted and 
ultimately inadequate.  Pinning all our hopes on one agency will 
not suffice.  We need to recognize the abilities of Canada's 
private sector.  We need to recognize there is a private sector 
out there willing to participate in the housing market.  Its very 
involvement strengthens the economy.  However, by competing with 
a crown corporation its chances of growing stronger are impeded, 
and so too then is the economy.  Is it this government's 
intention to impede the growth of the economy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also need to recognize the value of partnership.  We need to 
recognize that our national housing policy under the federal 
government has not been effective for some time.  We need to 
recognize that there are other levels of government and 
organizations within the private sector willing to strengthen our 
national housing policy.  We need to see that a national housing 
policy will thrive under the benefits of partnership and clear 
the roadblocks preventing those partnerships from working 
effectively.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely, if we have learned any one thing from debt and deficit 
woes it is that the federal government can no longer resolve our 
most important issues simply by opening the federal purse.  The 
housing challenges that face us need much more than money. 
Solutions will require the participation of organizations and 
other levels of government which have the knowledge and 
capabilities of addressing Canadian housing needs.  Yes, the 
needs of Canadians will be better served if those closest to the 
problems are in the driver's seat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to ensure that the housing needs of Canadians, 
particularly our social housing needs, are met then it is time to 
let Canadians build a better national housing policy.  To do so 
will require much more courageous vision and much greater action 
than Bill C-66 provides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government made the claim that Bill C-66 would level the 
playing field between CMHC and the private sector and make the 
mortgage insurance industry more competitive, that it would 
strengthen Canada's housing agency CMHC and thereby strengthen 
its ability to carry out its mandate of administering to 
Canadians' housing needs.  It has done neither. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most regrettable of all, by failing to work with the 
organizations that came to the committee during the review of the 
bill and failing to recognize their knowledge, capabilities and 
expertise, the federal government has missed an ideal opportunity 
to improve housing policy in Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK6"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to Bill C-66. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all due respect, I want to tell the minister right off the 
bat that we will be unable to support the bill. I do not want 
him to take it personally, but, as I will explain later, there 
is in this bill a potential for intrusion into areas of 
provincial jurisdiction. This concerns us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not against the fact that the Canadian Mortgage and 
Housing Corporation will now be allowed to operate abroad. 
The minister wants to give CMHC a really commercial mandate. I 
believe we have already seem it a work in Chile, if I am not 
mistaken. A delegation headed by the minister travelled to that 
country. My colleague from Quebec was a member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand CMHC, and builders, have a role to play in better 
promoting Quebec and Canadian housing know-how. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now sum up the proposed legislation for the benefit of 
those listeners who might have just joined us. Close to one 
million Canadians listen to the House of Commons debates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill contains eight major elements. 
First, CMHC, the main representative of the federal government 
in housing, would be authorized to make housing loans to 
individuals, groups, organizations, municipalities, departments, 
federal or provincial agencies, a bit like a bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some even compared CMHC to a bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CMHC will have new authority to set fees and charges for the 
products and services it provides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a third objective that we support: to allow CMHC 
to participate in research and development of housing 
internationally and to promote the export of Canadian expertise 
and products relating to housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is, I believe, one truly important objective of this bill. 
Allow me to repeat that enabling CMHC to have a greater impact 
on international export markets is one of the positive aspects 
of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another aspect is more problematic.  I would ask the minister to 
take what I am about to say into consideration.  CMHC will have 
the authority to make contributions relating to housing 
payments. 
Powers will also be given to CMHC, not to the minister.  The 
Bloc Quebecois sees this as a legal problem.  These powers will 
concern the provision of funds to individuals, organizations and 
municipalities.  This is another point of concern for us.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister ought to have said in his speech that, when 
transfers to individuals are concerned, those amounts will not 
be subjected to the constraints of the social union the federal 
government has negotiated with all provinces except Quebec. 
When reference is made to transfers covered by the social union, 
if these are transfers to individuals, they are not covered by 
the agreement signed with the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our main concern is the possibility that the federal government 
could transact directly with NGOs, and with municipalities, in 
matters relating to housing, without provincial agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I respectfully submit to the minister responsible for the Canada 
Mortgage and Housing Corporation that the bill is hard to follow 
because, in the throne speech, the federal government promised 
to decentralize a number of sectors of intervention.  They are 
what we called the eight sisters.  There is tourism, mines, 
recreation and housing, as well.  Surely the minister 
responsible for the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation 
remembers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an opposition party, we assumed the government would transfer 
the entire housing sector to the provinces. 
How does the minister explain to the House the claim the 
government made in the speech from the throne that it would 
transfer the entire housing sector to the provinces, and the 
increased powers this bill provides for the government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If all of the prerogatives provided in this bill were 
implemented, the government could establish a housing allowance. 
Does the minister agree, or does he think we are not reading 
the bill properly? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From our reading of the powers accorded under Bill C-66 to the 
minister responsible for housing and more particularly to the 
CHMC, everything hints at the establishment of a national 
housing allowance.  That is a source of some concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have opened the door for the minister. 
We would have liked to support the government, because we are a 
constructive opposition. Whenever we are given the opportunity 
to do so, we are always pleased to support the government, 
provided Quebec's interests are respected. I moved an amendment 
asking that no loan, contribution or money be given to 
municipalities, non-profit organizations or individuals without 
the agreement of the Quebec government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with regret that I inform this House that the government 
took advantage of its majority to reject the amendment. The 
minister will remember that he rose and, without blinking an 
eye, very comfortable in his role as minister, had the Bloc 
Quebecois' amendment rejected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Except for this amendment, we were rather in agreement with the 
bill. 
If the minister wanted to reconsider his earlier decision and 
support—assuming there is unanimous consent—an amendment to the 
effect that no contribution can be made to individuals and 
intermediate bodies such as municipalities in the province of 
Quebec, we would be prepared to support this bill. 
Unfortunately, it is not the case and this is why we will oppose 
this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am taking this opportunity to talk about the housing sector as 
a whole. As we know, and the minister made reference to this in 
his speech, there is a very tenuous but direct link between the 
whole issue of access to housing and the fight against poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a riding like Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, the primary cause of 
poverty is that our fellow citizens must often spend 30%, 40% or 
50% of their income on rent.

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this reason it is important for there to be state 
intervention, in the form of a housing allowance, access to 
ownership and low-cost housing construction, in order to give the 
least advantaged access to housing.  However, we believe that 
the government that should be doing this is not the federal 
government but the Quebec government and the provincial 
governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has committed to transferring $1.9 
billion to the provinces.  If my information is up to date, there 
are now five provinces and two territories that have signed, for 
a grand total of seven. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the minister to get negotiations moving with Quebec.  I am 
familiar with his talents as a negotiator, and I know he is a 
man motivated by a great sense of fairness.  I would, however, 
like to remind him of certain historical facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to take advantage of the distinguished 
presence of my colleague, the hon. member for Bourassa, to 
remind him that the share paid to Quebec by the federal 
government does not take into account either its demographic 
weight or the number of households in urgent need of 
accommodation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind the minister—whose roots in the Liberal family are 
deep and long-lasting, indeed I believe they are ever-lasting in 
his mind—that all of the governments in Quebec, one after 
another, have called for fair compensation from the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might give the example of Claude Ryan, whom we all know is no 
sovereignist. 
Moreover, the Minister of Human Resources Development has worked 
for him.  When he was responsible for the housing portfolio in 
the National Assembly, Claude Ryan called upon CMHC to hand over 
29% of the available funds, but this did not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will provide some figures, which I believe you will find 
interesting.  First of all, total federal expenditures for 
social housing are $362 million.  That is not a trifle, but it 
is not sufficient either.  This amount of $362 million 
represents 18.7% of the total.  In other words, the federal 
government spends 18.7% of its social housing expenditures in 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger:</B> If you manage to spill your water, that too 
will be the fault of the federal government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage to not encourage me to knock over 
my water, because unlike his government, I never thought the 
dollar should be allowed to float. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, 18.7% of federal spending on housing is in Quebec, which 
means that 81.3% is outside Quebec.  In Quebec, 29.3% of 
households are living in poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the minister whether he is prepared today—I would 
even give him some of my time if he would—to instruct the 
federal government's chief negotiator for housing to inform the 
Government of Quebec, Lucien Bouchard and Louise Harel, who is 
responsible for housing in the National Assembly, that he is 
transferring 29.3% of the funds to the Government of Quebec.  It 
is the only one entitled to have a national policy on housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the government will agree that it is perfectly logical 
for the Government of Quebec to intervene in the housing sector. 
This sector is connected with the Civil Code, municipalities 
and land management.  There is no reason why the federal 
government should intervene in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In actual fact, the CMHC directly subsidizes and oversees 44,597 
housing units in Quebec.  The federal government's offer—and 
I am sure the minister responsible for the CMHC was not really 
himself when he made the offer—is $218 million.

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the federal government is proposing less than what the 
Canada Mortgage Housing Corporation spends in Quebec. Indeed, 
the total amount spent by the CMHC in Quebec is $289 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced that the Quebec government would be prepared to 
come to an agreement with the federal government. The minister 
will agree that the current Quebec government is among the best 
and most reasonable ones we ever had. If the federal government 
offered $480 million, I am convinced the Quebec government would 
accept that amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will repeat that for my colleague: $480 million, because this 
is the amount that Quebec is entitled to in the housing sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am counting on the hon. member for Bourassa to get involved in 
this issue. This will be in Canadian dollars. I appreciate the 
member's optimism regarding a possible free trade zone using 
U.S. dollars. The hon. member is more or less acknowledging that 
a sovereign Quebec will be able to hold its own at the 
international level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude, since oral question period is about to begin, 
by repeating that we cannot support this bill. 
We endorse the mandate of the Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation to be more active on export markets. However, we 
think there is a possibility the federal government will get 
directly involved by negotiating with intermediate bodies, and 
this is not in Quebec's best interests with regard to the 
housing sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking the minister to begin negotiations to ensure that 
Quebec gets its fair share. This will be an opportunity for the 
minister to properly serve Quebec society.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York North, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
all members of the House should applaud the vision and foresight 
of the hon. member for Davenport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last night he introduced the endangered species protection act 
which calls for the protection of all endangered species and 
their habitat in Canada.  The bill calls for science based 
identification of species at risk and would make listing 
automatic.  Recovery plans would be required and it would be an 
offence to harm, disturb or kill endangered species or their 
habitat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overwhelmingly Canadians want strong endangered species 
legislation.  In the words of the hon. member for Davenport, 
“this is benchmark legislation for the government to emulate”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
there is an old saying that when you are thirsty it is too late 
to think about digging a well.  When it comes to emergency 
preparedness this principle is no less true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why in support of Emergency Preparedness Week some 
remarkable leadership students from Mount Slesse Middle School of 
Chilliwack, B.C., will hold a safety fair tomorrow to educate the 
community on how to prepare for an emergency, whether a flood, 
earthquake, fire or chemical spill.  Such information is timely 
and incredibly valuable even as the Fraser River threatens to 
overflow its banks in Chilliwack later this month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore on behalf of the honourable House I thank the 
emergency professionals who are giving their time and energy to 
support this event and to help the community prepare for such an 
emergency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of all, I thank and congratulate the students of Mount 
Slesse Middle School for their leadership, their motivation, and 
for helping to teach our community that today's preparation 
determines tomorrow's success and safety.

residents of the Musqueam reserve who just got hit with increases 
of over 7,000%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, did you know there is a clause in the Nisga'a 
treaty that states that if at any time the government signs a 
treaty with any other aboriginal group that is more generous than 
the Nisga'a treaty, it automatically reopens negotiations? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, did you know the Nisga'a treaty allows the banning 
of union certification?  Do you think it will not happen?  The 
Kamloops and Westbank bands both recently did this, claiming that 
it would interfere with Indian self-determination, despite the 
fact that aboriginal workers on the reserves voted in favour of 
certification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some claim the Nisga'a treaty is necessary to end the 
uncertainty over land claims, but the Gitanyow band is now suing 
the government and the Nisga'a, claiming that Nisga'a treaty 
lands are their traditional lands, and B.C. taxpayers will be 
paying the bill for both sides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want treaty settlements and so do we, but the treaties 
have to make sense.  A bad treaty is not better than no treaty at

half million Canadians are looking for work.  Young people are 
particularly hard hit.

<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I do not think it is enough to look at one month or 
another month.  One has to look at the underlying trend.  The 
underlying trend since 1993 has been unmistakably in the 
direction of much lower unemployment and strong job creation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue the efforts that have produced a million and a 
half jobs since we took office.  This will continue. 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
unemployment rate is up, the taxes are up and the brain drain is 
up.  Meanwhile the standard of living is down and confidence is 
down.  In fact everything is going down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why will the government not make what is up down and what is 
down up, cut the taxes and get some Canadians back to work now? 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, one thing for sure is going down and that is the 
credibility of the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it tries to ignore the reality of strong job creation since 
1993 its credibility is totally shot.  We certainly want to 
continue creating more jobs, but we have to recognize that one of 
the factors involved is that more people are entering the labour 
force because of their optimism about future job prospects. 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
they are not in the job force because they were just laid off. 
That is the fact.  No matter which way the Prime Minister looks 
at it, unemployment is up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's jobless rate is now twice as high as that of our 
American counterparts.  If high taxes do not drive our talent 
south of the border, the unemployment rate will probably 
encourage it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians do not want to hear hollow talk.  They want to know 
where they can get a job, and they want to get it here in Canada. 
One of the ways the government could help fix this is to reduce 
taxation levels to the rate of our American counterparts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why will it not do something to help unemployed Canadians? 
Reduce our taxes now.  Let us get some Canadians back to work. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, no wonder the credibility of the Reform Party is down. 
It refuses to recognize that we are bringing taxes down for all 
Canadians with $16.5 billion in tax reductions over the next 
three years.  This will add to the successful efforts the 
government has been making in co-operation with the private 
sector to create more jobs for all Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I've questioned really the wisdom of the dramatic and drastic tax 
cuts in light of deficit financing.  It's not how we would have 
gone about it. In fact, it's not the way we did go about it...We

</I></B></P><P align=left>In order for our justice system to work it must be based on

has been brought up by the hon. member a number of times in the

studying conditional sentencing.  There are a number of decisions 
in which we have to review the intention of parliament in terms 
of conditional sentencing.  I ask the hon. member to assist us in 
the process.  I ask his colleagues who sit on the committee not 
to bring forth other frivolous motions so we can get on with 
conditional sentencing.

the Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, the Ministers of Foreign Affairs adopted general 
principles which ought to lead to a political solution to the 
Kosovo crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since these general principles must become a UN security council 
resolution, what approach does Canada plan to use in order to 
get China not to use its veto against implementation of these 
principles? 
<P><A NAME="LINK94"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as hon. members are aware, the Prime Minister spoke 
recently with the Premier of China about a progressive 
initiative in the security council.  Yesterday, we decided to 
approach the Chinese concerning the proposals contained in our 
agreement with the Russians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that there is now a commitment for real consultation 
with the Chinese in order to ensure that there is agreement in 
the security council, once we have details on the proposal. 
<P><A NAME="LINK95"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it would be most 
desirable for this agreement between the G-8 countries to be 
accepted not only by the Security Council of the United Nations, 
but also by the government in Belgrade.  Does Canada consider 
the principles of this agreement to be negotiable or is it 
prepared to impose them without the agreement of President 
Milosevic? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK96"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as we announced yesterday in the agreement, we will 
be pursuing an article 7 resolution at the security council. An 
article 7 resolution is an authoritative mandatory requirement 
that applies to all UN members.  Through that, we believe we will 
be in a position to have an effective engagement with the 
Belgrade regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, there will be ongoing discussions.  The 
Russians will clearly continue to carry out their own dialogue 
and communications.  The secretary general will establish an 
envoy system.  I think there will be full opportunity for 
Belgrade to respond we hope in a positive way so we can bring 
this conflict to a resolution.

cashed because we know the farmers need the money.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure he joined all members of parliament this morning who 
were both shocked and disappointed to see the reversal in the 
downward trend in the unemployment figures. Was the Deputy Prime

enough for the government to take some steps to bring the 
downward pattern back into play again? 
<P><A NAME="LINK115"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we are looking at the results of one month.  This is not 
enough to establish that the very favourable upward trend since 
1993 has been reversed.  We are obviously watching the situation 
very closely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, the NDP and all Canadians should be ready to 
recognize that the very favourable upward trend has gone on since 
1993 with 1.6 million new jobs being created.  One month's 
results are not enough to say that the trend has stopped.  We are 
going to be watching the situation very closely. 
<P><A NAME="LINK116"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, just three months ago the Minister of 
Human Resources Development said that job prospects for young 
Canadians are brighter than they have been in years.  This 
morning we find that in Ontario more than 50,000 people have been 
added to the rolls looking for work.  More than half of those are 
young people, bringing it up to 15.7%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier today we heard about the summer career placement program 
and the funding it has received. If the government wants to do 
something about youth unemployment, would it consider adding 
funds to that program so at least people coming out of the

improving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over 900,000 jobs have been created in this country since 
December.  Over 15,000 jobs were created in April.  What has 
happened is that the participation rate has gone up. It has gone 
up because the economy is solid.  It has gone up because the 
fundamentals are right.  We have low inflation, low interest 
rates, a balanced budget and declining debt to GDP.  The economy 
is poised to do well.  The help wanted index has gone up and that 
is always a precursor to better job opportunities.  That is what 
has happened.  I would hope the hon. member would take that into

we do not live in the past.  We live in the present.  The

her job because she went to bingos with the homeless.  It has 
been three years since the government announced it was getting 
out of the social housing business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When if ever will the minister responsible for homelessness have

is not the minister responsible for homelessness.  It is nonsense 
to suggest in any way that she is responsible for homelessness. 
She will be responsible for assisting homeless people in Canada.

every summer Revenue Canada uses university and college students 
to deliver customs services at airports and border crossings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister 
of National Revenue.  Is Revenue Canada putting Canadians at risk 
by using students to do those important jobs?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Beth Phinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

</I></B></P><P align=left>Revenue Canada's student hiring policy serves not only to 
provide much needed employment to young Canadians but complements 
and enhances the department's role to provide both quality 
service and protection at the border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998 Revenue Canada helped almost 800 Canadian university and 
college students to acquire life skills and gain work experience 
through our successful customs internship program. Student 
customs officers perform selected routine duties which allows our 
customs inspectors to concentrate on higher risk tasks.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>NATIONAL HOUSING ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK176">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-66, an 
act to amend the National Housing Act and the Canada Mortgage and 
Housing Corporation Act and to make a consequential amendment to 
another act, be read the third time and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK177"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, with your permission I would like to 
split my time with the hon. member for Churchill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise today to say a few words regarding Bill C-66, an act to 
amend the National Housing Act and the Canada Mortgage and 
Housing Corporation Act and to make a consequential amendment to 
another act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The impression we get is that the government is actually doing 
something about housing in the country.  Perhaps this comes as a 
surprise to people.  When we think that the government is going 
to change the National Housing Act and the CMHC act, it could be 
implied that it has decided to take some initiative to improve 
the housing situation in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know, without any question, that there are tens of thousands 
of people in the country who do not have a home, period.  They 
are living on the streets, in parks, under bridges and so on 
around the country.  We heard earlier today the government whip 
indicating that the government had appointed a cabinet minister, 
the Minister of Labour, to co-ordinate some activity to deal with 
this issue of homelessness in Canada. 
We would assume that when we are dealing with Bill C-66, an act 
that deals with housing in Canada, there would be some reference 
or some indication that the government is actually going to do 
something about the homeless situation, but in fact the answer is 
that it is doing absolutely nothing.  This is not a good day for 
the people who are living under bridges and the homeless in the 
country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us agree, among ourselves at least, that to have a housing 
problem in Canada is rather unusual.  We have more land available 
than every single country in the entire world, except one.  We 
have land from coast to coast to coast.  We have billions and 
billions of hectares of land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have trees in every single province and territory.  When we 
fly across the country we see that we have trees from coast to 
coast.  We have millions of hectares of trees, except for Nunavut 
which does not have any trees, but we could always ship a few up 
to those people if they need some.  For most people, we have 
trees coming out of our ying yang.  We have trees everywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Think about it.  Our banks are filled with money.  We have an 
unbelievable amount of land at our disposal.  We have lumber 
from coast to coast to coast.  To have a housing problem, we have 
to work at it.  We have to really work at it.  There is not a 
single reason there should be a housing problem in this country. 
We hardly have any people compared with most other countries.  We 
have housing technology and everything else.  There must be a 
reason for this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is sitting right over there.  That is the problem. 
We do not have a government with any inclination to improve the 
housing situation in this country.  We should take this 
legislation, tear it up, throw it away and say enough— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for Kamloops, 
Thompson and Highland Valleys is an experienced and capable 
member of this House and he knows it is quite wrong to use props. 
Tearing up bills and other papers in the course of his speech is 
surely using the document as a prop.  I know that he is excited 
about the subject and feels passionately about the issue, but 
perhaps he could constrain himself a little and comply with the 
rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is tough to constrain 
myself.  I appreciate the fact that I should not have torn up 
that bill, but I am fed up.  I am fed up with this government.  I 
am fed up with its lack of attention to housing and I am fed up 
when I talk to people who cannot find decent housing for their 
families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about Bill C-66, which would change the housing 
act and the CMHC, but we are not doing anything about housing. 
We are making it worse.  Imagine that.  This bill will make 
housing worse in the country.  What are we doing here?  We should 
all run out of here before this bill proceeds any further, but I 
know we are not going to do that.  We have to hang in here, so I 
will say a couple of words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is so depressing is that governments are elected to serve 
Canadians.  We have a very serious housing problem facing our 
country.  I am looking particularly at a number of groups.  I 
will identify two that immediately spring to mind.  One group is 
the young people of this country; the young people who have 
worked hard to get decent training and education, who have 
hustled to get work, who are working often at two or three part 
time jobs, although some have decent jobs.  They are trying to 
save money.  They cannot afford to put a down payment on a house. 
They cannot afford housing.  One would think that there must be 
some program we could introduce to assist them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is to say nothing about the aboriginal peoples of the 
country.  If there is an embarrassment, it is that.  We should 
hang our heads in shame and say we are disgusted and ashamed that 
we have allowed this situation to develop in terms of aboriginal 
housing in virtually every part of the country.  There is 
something wrong.  It is a disgrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The homeless issue is sad.  There are people living under 
bridges by the thousands in this country.  It is an embarrassment 
in one of the richest countries in the world.  We should be doing 
something about it, but we are not.  We are making it worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not alone in this.  Back in 1993 the government said 
“we're outta here”.  It said that it was out of housing and 
that it would not do anything more for housing, that it would not 
put another cent into housing, that it would not put a new nickel 
or quarter into social housing.  In 1993 that was the big 
announcement.  It was embarrassing that the Liberals cheered this 
announcement. 
They said, “Hey, great news.  We are cutting back on social 
housing”.  I remember that day.  There was applause in here when 
they announced that they were not going to spend any more money 
helping people get into social housing.  Members across the way 
applauded.  I think most members would find that there is 
something very seriously wrong with this picture.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals then said, “We are out of here.  We are not going 
to put another new nickel into social housing.  As a matter of 
fact, we are going to get out of the business completely.  We are 
going to fob it off to the provinces.  We are going to download 
it onto the provinces so that they can carry the can on social 
housing”.  They did download it onto the provinces over the last 
number of years and are still doing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the provinces doing?  Are they any better?  They are 
worse.  They are not doing anything either with a couple of 
exceptions, to be fair.  To our friends here who are representing 
the province of Quebec, Quebec has programs in social housing.  I 
am pleased to say that the province that I represent, British 
Columbia, is doing something in social housing.  As a matter of 
fact it just announced an increase in hundreds of units of social 
housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provincial government alone says, “We are out here all on 
our own.  We get no help from the federal government, not one 
whit.  We need social housing in British Columbia and if we have 
to do it we are going to expand with hundreds and hundreds of new 
social housing units”.  We should be cheering the province of 
British Columbia for at least picking up that initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the province of British Columbia, not only maintaining 
its social housing but expanding its social housing, we have the 
province of Quebec and that is about it. That is all the social 
housing we are seeing by and large across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a serious problem.  That is why we were hoping that when 
we looked at Bill C-66 dealing with housing that we would see 
some initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard some very eloquent speakers before me comment about a 
variety of issues on why they are concerned about this.  I want 
to identify clause 38 of this legislation.  This is a pathetic 
clause.  Under clause 38, it allows the CMHC, the Canada Mortgage 
and Housing Corporation, to waive provisions of existing 
agreements.  What does that mean?  It means that under this 
clause an agreement between CMHC and a housing co-op or 
non-profit corporation could be ripped up and people living in 
co-ops or social housing could see their homes sold out from 
under them. That is what this little clause means about 
provisions regarding existing agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We tried to get a clarification in committee whether this means 
that if the government deems it appropriate it can say to 
co-operative housing organizations across the country,  “Too 
bad, we're getting out of it”.  We have not received a decent 
answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we are opposing this legislation so strongly.  We 
tried it at second reading but it did not work.  We tried it in 
the committee.  We tried to get the Liberals to understand that 
we have to do something about housing.  They said, “No.  We are 
not going to do anything about housing.  We are out of housing. 
We don't even like social housing”.  They probably did not say 
that, but I guess that is what they were really meaning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So here we are at third reading, the last gasp.  We are just 
going down the tube here.  This is it.  At the end of the day the 
government is gone and that will be it for social housing from 
coast to coast to coast.  It will be a sad day not only for 
people who are looking for homes today, not only for people who 
are living in shabby, dastardly housing conditions, but more 
importantly a bad day for Canada generally.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
rise to speak to the third reading of Bill C-66, an act to amend 
the National Housing Act and the CMHC act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my hon. colleagues from Kamloops has mentioned, a more 
accurate and descriptive title for the bill would be an act to 
destroy the National Housing Act or an act to throw Canadians out 
on the street. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been disgusted with the Liberal government's duplicity. 
Homelessness is at a crisis in Canada.  We have just come through 
one of the worst winters ever with homeless people freezing and 
dying on the street.  The Liberal government's policies are 
responsible for this travesty.  It has slashed transfer payments 
to the provinces.  It has abandoned social housing and left 
overburdened provincial and municipal governments to pick up the 
pieces.  It is a disgrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Canadians walk the streets of their communities they see 
this crisis with their own eyes.  The evidence is everywhere. All 
the Prime Minister has to do is walk down the street here in 
Ottawa, just a few metres from Parliament Hill, to see the 
evidence.  There are homeless people pleading for help.  It is 
the same in every city and town in Canada from Thompson to 
Toronto.  The Liberal government is either so out of touch with 
what is going on out there and it does not see the problem or it 
just does not care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been report after report on this issue:  the Golden 
report, the report submitted to the Minister of Finance by the 
New Democratic Party's social policy critic, the member for 
Vancouver East.

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Vancouver East travelled from coast to coast, 
including to Thompson and South Indian Lake in my riding.  She 
has met with people on the front lines of the crisis and people 
who work with the homeless and, unlike the Liberal government, 
actually cares about them as human beings.  However, her report, 
like the Golden report, is sitting on a shelf somewhere in the 
finance minister's office collecting dust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has done nothing, not a thing.  Of 
course, the government says it cares, just like it said it cared 
about victims of hepatitis C and just like it said it would get 
rid of the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The prime minister appointed the Minister of Labour as his 
minister responsible for homelessness.  This minister would not 
even go before the committee studying the bill.  According to the 
Liberals on the committee, housing and homelessness are not 
related.  That is the typical Liberal government logic.  It is 
like saying hospitals and health care do not go together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This raises an interesting question about the Liberal 
government's attitude.  Why do we even need a minister 
responsible for homelessness when there is already a minister 
responsible for housing?  One would think that homelessness would 
be something that the minister of housing ought to be responsible 
for.  After all, he is responsible for making sure Canadians have 
homes.  There must be more Liberal government logic at work here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that the Liberal government has appointed a minister 
responsible for homelessness separate from the minister of 
housing should speak volumes.  It says that the government sees 
homelessness as something that is always going to be there and 
therefore needs a minister to look after it.  It clearly does not 
see homelessness as something the minister of housing can or 
should be doing anything about.  Heavens, no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, the minister of housing brought us this bill to gut and 
privatize social housing.  That is the Liberal government's idea 
of what the minister of housing is for.  Apparently that 
minister's job is to create homelessness so that the minister for 
homelessness has some work to do.  This bill is the last nail in 
the coffin of social housing in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that makes the Reform Party giddy with joy.  The Reform 
Party even brought in amendments to try and get the bill to go 
further.  It is just like the years 1993 to 1997 when it pushed 
the government to cut more, cut taxes and cut dollars going to 
health care and social assistance.  What do we have now?  We have 
a health care crisis.  The Reform Party is now pushing to cut 
social housing even more just to make the crisis for homelessness 
even worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know how members of the Liberal government can say they 
care about homelessness when they are doing the exact opposite of 
what they say.  They have abandoned social housing in seven out 
of the ten provinces.  It may be eight soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know the Liberal government has more or less finished a 
deal with the Conservatives in Ontario.  It is just waiting to 
see whether or not the Conservatives get re-elected so it can dot 
the <I>i</I>'s and cross the <I>t</I>'s in that agreement.  It will 
not make much difference if the Liberals or the Conservatives get 
elected in Ontario.  When it comes to housing, they pretty much 
agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Howard Hampton of the Ontario NDP is the only party that is 
coming out in support of social housing in Ontario.  Then there 
is Manitoba where the Liberal government has already downloaded 
social housing onto the province.  The Filmon government has 
already begun phasing out all funding for social housing.  Every 
cent for social housing will be gone if Mr. Filmon and the 
Manitoba Conservatives get a chance to finish what this Liberal 
government started. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The one shred of good news in all this has been the news that 
co-op housing will not be part of the download in Ontario.  The 
Liberal government has spared the Ontario co-ops.  Of course, 
this does not exactly warrant a lot of gratitude.  That would be 
like being grateful to a mugger for leaving our pocket change but 
taking the rest of our money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government is still downloading non-profit social 
housing corporations and aboriginal housing corporations.  In 
seven provinces that have already been downloaded, the Liberal 
government did not spare the co-ops.  If the Liberals truly are a 
national party, they should prove it by reversing the downloading 
of co-ops in those other seven provinces.  Better yet, they 
should not download any social housing at all.  Housing is a 
national responsibility not a provincial one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-66 takes the Liberal government's attack on social 
housing to new heights.  The bill paves the way for the 
privatization of social housing.  It opens the door wide for 
private for-profit corporations to be recognized as social 
housing providers by the CMHC.  Of course, once we privatize 
social housing it is not social any more.  As the name indicates, 
for-profit companies are in business to make money not provide a 
service.  Social housing is a service not a business. 
It is a service to help put a roof over people's heads.  Housing 
is not cheap and many low income people need subsidized housing 
or they would have no choice but to live on the streets.  These 
people are not living in mansions.  Many social housing units 
barely meet minimum standards, but at least they give people 
warm, dry places to sleep.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the bill do to the National Housing Act and the Canada 
Mortgage and Housing Corporation Act?  It guts them.  It guts the 
acts that govern social housing in this country.  It eliminates 
the minimum standards that were built into the old legislation 
for social housing to be clean, safe and affordable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Logically, what is the Liberal government saying by eliminating 
these minimum standards?  It is saying that it does not think the 
homes of Canadians should have to meet even the most minimal 
standards.  It is saying that Canadians do not deserve even a 
minimal level of safety, cleanliness and affordability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only logical reason for the government to get rid of these 
standards is so that it does not have to live up to them.  That 
is what it has done for years in most first nations communities 
throughout Canada.  It is shocking and appalling that it is 
knowingly and willingly removing minimum standards from homes in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government cannot say it did not know that was what 
it was doing.  My New Democratic Party colleague from Bras 
d'Or—Cape Breton raised amendments at report stage to put these 
standards back into the bill but the Liberal government voted 
them down.  How does the government try to justify this?  The 
CMHC bureaucrats who wrote the legislation say they need 
flexibility.  I am all in favour of flexibility but not 
flexibility without standards.  Flexibility is good, but we 
cannot give bureaucrats and private social housing providers the 
flexibility to reduce cleanliness, safety and affordability of 
social housing below basic human standards.  It is not right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of not meeting basic human standards, let us talk about 
aboriginal housing.  The housing conditions of first nations 
people in Canada, whether one is talking about remote first 
nations or urban ghettos, are a disgrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of Indian affairs has been to a number of remote 
first nations.  She has seen the conditions in my riding and in 
other northern communities.  She has seen the pillows stuffed in 
the holes in the walls to keep out the winter cold.  She has seen 
homes wrapped in plastic to keep them warm and homes without 
running water or toilets.  She has seen all this, but the 
minister of Indian affairs has done nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has done nothing about aboriginal housing 
but make a few token gestures.  Small token gestures are all that 
the government has shown to its gathering strength policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conditions on first nations are so bad that even the United 
Nations has condemned them.  Now we are saying we should keep on 
going and do this throughout the rest of Canada instead of 
improving where we should be.  Watching the decline of social 
housing since the Liberal government took power has been like 
watching one of the ancient Greek tragedies where everyone dies 
in the end.  Every Canadian will lose because of what the Liberal 
government is doing with this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Housing is part of the foundation of our economy.  People cannot 
be expected to get training or to look for jobs and add to our 
economy if they are busy struggling to survive on the streets. By 
giving people a roof over their heads and a chance to make 
something of their lives, social housing provides a boost for our 
economy.  It prevents people from falling through the cracks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will privatize social housing and it will raise rents, 
lower standards and put people on the streets. This bill will do 
more harm than good to our economy and our society.  It is cruel. 
It is short-sighted.  I do not know how the Liberal backbenchers 
over there can sleep at night.  I hope some of them will show a 
shred of conscience and help us in the opposition to defeat the 
bill when we vote on it one last time.

comment and ask a question as a result of the comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After listening to the hon. member's speech, it would seem to me 
that the hon. member mixes up two very important terms:  the 
issues of homelessness and housing.  They are not synonymous. The 
issue of homelessness is a broader issue.  If the hon. member has 
read the Golden report, which I hope she has and recognizes that 
it was sponsored in part by the federal government, the report 
shows that the issue of homelessness is a multifaceted issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the city of Vancouver, where there is a great deal of 
homelessness and the issues of prostitution, urban natives and 
drug addiction, the government has recently put in $5 million to 
coordinate a strategy between three levels of government: between 
the people who live in the area and between the non-governmental 
organizations in the region to be able to work horizontally 
within and between governments and communities to come up with a 
coordinated, comprehensive, holistic response to these issues.

was put in to the urban aboriginal strategy to help aboriginal 
people in cities to work toward a plan of action they can 
administer to find solutions to some of these issues.  It needs 
to be co-ordinated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member understand the difference between 
homelessness and lack of housing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais:</B>  Madam Speaker, anyone who would 
suggest that homelessness does not go in line with housing is 
dreaming in Technicolor.  Certainly there are situations where 
that may not be the key issue, but I can say without any doubt in 
my mind the reason that a number of first nations people leave 
their first nations to go into cities and elsewhere is the lack 
of proper housing in first nation communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government were truly committed to addressing the problem 
of homelessness, why is the minister responsible for homelessness 
not being given a budget?  What is she supposed to do?  Are we 
supposed to look out there on the street and say make it go away? 
It will not happen.  The crisis will get much worse if there is 
not a serious effort to address the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By downloading social housing and not supporting social 
housing programs we are increasing the crisis that much more. 
There will be that many more people on the streets. 
<P><A NAME="LINK180"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique—Mactaquac, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to stand in the House today to debate Bill 
C-66 at third reading.  It is an act to amend the National 
Housing Act and the Canada Mortgage and Housing Act.  It is also 
a sad day for Canadians.  We all know that the bill will pass 
because the Liberals will use their majority to pass it, I 
suspect some time next week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the bill was introduced in committee we were allowed to 
submit amendments to it.  We supplied a few.  One of them was 
with reference to subclauses 18 (1) and (2) on page 7 of the 
bill.  We requested the addition of a subsection (3) which would 
require the government to spend an amount equal to compensation 
paid by CMHC to the Receiver General for Canada in return for the 
federal government's backing of its loan insurance and guaranteed 
operations on social housing.  It was defeated in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me explain what the amendment was all about.  If I lived in 
a rural area of Canada and had a seasonal job, in the wintertime 
I would have to rely on EI to feed my family.  If I wanted to get 
ahead in life, I would try to obtain a loan to put a roof over 
the heads of my kids and my wife. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would go to Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation and would 
be considered a high risk. There is not a bank in the country 
that would give me a mortgage; I would be told absolutely no. 
However, the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation would assume 
this high risk so that I could build a house for my family.  If 
something happened and I could not pay for the house, the 
government would guarantee CMHC 100% of the mortgage insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the bill goes through the government will not guarantee a 
penny to CMHC.  Yet the governments wants the Canada Mortgage and 
Housing Corporation within the next three or four years to give 
it $198 million.  The government wants to take $198 million out 
of the corporation and put it into its general account and waste 
it like it has been doing since 1993 when it came to power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My amendment was defeated in committee.  It was a shame, but 
that is the way it is.  The money is lost to CMHC forever.  It 
could have been used for social housing, but it will be put into 
the general revenues of the government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It could be spent on something like the million dollar plastic 
dinosaur that the government is building in Alberta or the grant 
the Department of Canadian Heritage gave to publish a book of 
dumb blonde jokes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were sent to the House of Commons by Canadians to be their 
representatives.  We have a mandate to fight for the concerns of 
Canadians, to make sure the economy moves well, and to create 
programs so that there will be prosperity in the country and the 
economy will be booming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think spending money to publish a book on dumb blonde 
jokes and creating a plastic dinosaur in Alberta is good for the 
economy.  People are living in shacks.  Families with young 
children are living, eating and sleeping in their cars.  This is 
Canadian society today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the flexibility to offer new products is welcome—and I 
welcome that because we need new products—the changes eliminate 
the advantages of government underwriting.  Forcing the Canada 
Mortgage and Housing Corporation to cover any loss will decrease 
the willingness to finance high risk borrowers such as low income 
people.  It may also make it more difficult for borrowers in more 
remote locations to qualify for mortgage loan insurance.  I am 
not the one saying this; it has been reported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another of my party's amendments concerned clause 25.  We would 
have liked it to be amended by deleting lines 19 to 24 on page 19 
and line 35 on page 19 and replacing it with subclause 6(7). 
Again, for the record, that amendment was defeated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CMHC has a board of directors with a good balance of five highly 
qualified professionals: a chairman, a president, a 
vice-president and two public servants.  It also has five 
political appointees.  Clause 25 in Bill C-66 proposes changing 
the composition of the board so that there would be a majority of 
eight political appointees, with only the chairman and the 
president remaining on the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked on a number of occasions how this change would benefit 
Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation and/or the clients it 
serves.  The only answer was that all other crown corporations 
were doing it.  Is that a logical answer?  To me it is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On three different occasions on the same amendment I asked 
Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation officials in briefings 
what problems existed that needed solutions.  They gave no 
answer.  I asked them how it would improve service to Canadians 
and they had no idea.  I believe this change is totally 
unnecessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At least we have five highly qualified professionals on the 
board who know what they are talking about as far as the 
corporation is concerned and five political appointees.  With the 
new bill some of these individuals will be pushed aside and eight 
political appointees and two highly qualified professionals will 
sit in their place.  Does that make sense?  To me it does not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the new bill the changes would remove any reference to 
fair rents in providing RRAP assistance to private landlords. 
Any provisions for urgent repairs have been removed.  Transfers 
from the governor in council to CMHC authority to determine 
amount of RRAP forgiveness, household incomes, household needs 
and attributing household incomes have been deleted.  Specific 
reference to non-profit corporations has been removed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now go to sections 78 to 83, the public housing section. 
The changes rationalize the flexibility of the 1996 social 
housing transfer agreement by eliminating the need for global 
agreements.  They remove the restrictions on decent, safe and 
sanitary housing.  They remove the low income restrictions. 
Consistent with the changes under other sections of the act, all 
references to low and modest incomes have been removed.  Overall 
the bill is defining social housing out of existence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In section 95 dealing with programs, the definition of eligible 
contribution recipients has been eliminated.  The reference to 
section 27, non-profit status, has been removed.  The social 
housing character of section 95 has been defined out of the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is good in the bill?  I do not see too much in it.  From 
1985 to 1993 under the previous Conservative government funding 
for social housing rose by 73%.  That is how much money was put 
into social housing under this program.  I even have the figures 
to show how much social housing was built by the previous 
government from 1985 to 1993.  From 1993 to the end of 1998 when 
the government took power, the number of units in Canada declined 
by 3%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not in 1993 any more.  We are in 1999.  There is a crisis 
out there.  It is not a problem; it is a crisis.  People do not 
have homes and the government is cutting social housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A couple of weeks ago a new minister for homelessness was 
appointed and was asked a question.  She rose in the House and 
said she was not the minister for homelessness. Last week she 
gave a speech in the province of New Brunswick in which she told 
the audience she was the minister for homelessness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the government or the minister responsible for 
homelessness what is her mandate in this new portfolio.  She does 
not know.  She does not know if she is the minister or if she is 
not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She had a meeting with the mayor of Toronto not long ago.  There 
were articles this morning in the <I>National Post</I> and the 
Toronto <I>Sun</I> in which she was quoted as saying “I went to 
bingos with you homeless people.  I know your problems and I am 
going to make things happen”.   The mayor of Toronto now calls 
her bingo mom.  That is a shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked two questions in the House during question period.  Some 
Liberals screamed that they were not good questions.  I do not 
want to discredit the minister responsible for homelessness.  I 
know her past.  She is from New Brunswick and I am also from New 
Brunswick.  For 25 or 30 years she was very good with the program 
she started.  However I am not a person who lives in the past. 
What I did 20 years ago is irrelevant today.  Now she has a job 
as a member of parliament and has been appointed minister to see 
what can be done to help homeless people and if there can be a 
better housing policy.

Canada with the big population we have cannot afford a social 
housing policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of helping those people, we are cutting social housing. 
This bill is taking everything out of social housing. This bill 
will pass.  The Liberals will use their majority to pass it, and 
when the bill passes there will be no more social housing policy. 
It is the end of this country's social housing policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Liberals were first elected they were on a roller 
coaster ride for two years.  In 1995 they finally realized there 
was a problem with social housing. Instead of tackling that 
problem, facing the problem and taking care of it then, they 
decided to download it to the provinces.  They decided to give 
their problems to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that we are in a crisis the same Liberal government will not 
accept the responsibility.  It blames the provinces, like it did 
with health care and like it did with Mike Harris in Ontario. 
The Liberals cut health care.  They cut the transfer payments by 
40%. Then the provinces had to cut the hospitals. Then the 
Liberal government blamed the provinces for the crisis. Is that 
logical? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not care which party governs, we are here to represent all 
Canadians.  We should throw partisan politics out the door.  We 
should work together as one to make sure that all Canadians have 
a home.  That is a basic need.  I do not see that happening on 
the other side of the House at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will take us into the international market.  I am not 
against that, because it will create jobs here in Canada within 
that market.  The problem is wider than that.  My dad always told 
me that charity begins at home.  We have a problem in Canada. 
Instead of running abroad, we should try to fix the problems 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, we will be opposing this bill because we believe in 
Canada and we believe in its people.  It is time that members of 
this House got together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at our party's record. 
I have a copy right here of the record of the last Progressive 
Conservative government from 1984 to 1993.  It lists the number 
of units built and the amount of money that was put into the 
social housing of this country.  We see a big difference between 
where we were and where we are.  We are going backward in that 
regard but the years are going ahead.  So are we backtracking 
here?

</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been an honour for me to speak about social housing and 
Bill C-66.  Again, my party and I cannot support the bill because 
it has all the wording about social housing taken out of it.  I 
cannot support a bill like that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK181"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to say a few words about housing in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have before us today a bill to make some changes to the CMHC. 
I emphasize that home ownership is a cherished value in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For most of my generation when we graduated from university we 
got married and the first thing we did was plan to purchase that 
first house. It is incredible when I think about it.  At that 
time my wife and I chose to live on one salary.  We decided that 
she would be a full time mom to our children.  We were able to 
borrow the money and make the payments on my income of the day. I 
am sure everyone will be pleased to know and young people will be 
especially pleased to know that my salary when I was first 
working in my profession was a little under $6,000 a year.  With 
that I was able to borrow money and start our first home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A young couple starting today cannot do that.  They cannot 
afford to have their children.  They cannot afford to have a 
house unless they are both working.  Even then with all of the 
taxes and the GST on top of all of that, it is really tough for 
young people nowadays to get started. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bigger issue by far is the affordability of homes in this 
country.  CMHC at least in theory and in its philosophy is 
supposed to support the notion of making housing more affordable. 
Through the CMHC the government, the taxpayer, takes on a certain 
amount of the risk of providing the money to purchase homes. 
That is one of the things government can do but I think the 
government should have done it in the past.  I am talking about 
the governments of the past 30 years.  We will go all the way 
back to 1970. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The governments since then have racked up so much debt and 
increased the payments of interest on that debt.  I would hold 
the Liberal government, the Conservative government after that 
and the present Liberal government accountable for that. Young 
people nowadays have such a high tax load that it is very 
difficult for them to get their own housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am basically supportive of measures that would provide for the 
ownership of homes or that would make it possible for young 
people to own their own homes.  It is a good model of housing 
that we have.  It is quite different from some countries where 
the thought of owning your own home or your own apartment is 
totally elusive.  It is part of the dream, part of the 
initiative, part of the psyche of our country that can help us in 
this ongoing problem of productivity. It motivates us.  There is 
something special about being able to own your own place, to make 
your own decisions on how you decorate it and how you live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some concerns about the bill.  I have some concerns about 
CMHC extending its industry around the world.  I wish we would 
concentrate on the problems in this area within our own country. 
We certainly support helping other nations to a degree through 
our foreign affairs department and through our humanitarian 
efforts around the world. 
However when it comes to something like this, CMHC should 
concentrate on Canadian enterprise, Canadian housing, and not get 
involved in other countries to that extent. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1255"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing that is somewhat troubling is that CMHC expends 
taxpayers' money, or at least it has the potential of doing so. 
It is supposed to be designed in such a way that it turns a small 
profit or operates evenly, but it does have the potential of 
spending public money.  It should always be held accountable 
through the minister and through parliament to the taxpayers. 
This bill falls short in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There should be some amendments made to it so that the Canadian 
taxpayer is protected and we do not give a blank cheque to the 
minister to spend as much money as he or she wishes.  We like to 
think that would not be out of control.  Accountability is always 
important to make sure that does not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude by saying that a bill like this one deserves some 
level of support because there are some good things in it but 
amendments should be made.  I emphasize over and over again that 
our first obligation to young people and young families in our 
country in terms of home ownership is to reduce their taxes so 
they have enough of their earnings left over and they can pay for 
their mortgages and own their own homes. 
<P><A NAME="LINK182"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I am very honoured to speak on the issue of housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It certainly is a wake-up call for a lot of Canadians, 
especially a lot of people in my constituency, to see the effects 
of Bill C-66 on our communities.  It will mean wholesale changes 
in the structure of housing in my communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of the responsibilities have already devolved from federal 
to provincial authority.  There is also concern about on reserve 
housing in aboriginal communities and contributions that the 
federal government has made for the development of communities 
and their infrastructures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one sees social housing coming to an end as a national 
program, Bill C-66 seems to punctuate it. In Canada we have such 
pristine land that gives us natural resources of timber, rock, 
minerals and properties that can provide for meaningful homes, 
that can be designed for a new generation of children to come, 
that can meet the environmental needs, the non-polluting needs 
and sustainable development housing needs of the future. For the 
federal government to abdicate and abandon its responsibility now 
is very untimely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a national vision we should be empowering our youth.  When 
they leave high school are they trained to understand how to 
build a home, the basic need of a shelter?  Can they renovate the 
property they will eventually own as students, workers or 
parents?  What about the maintenance of the heating, cooling and 
electrical systems or the plumbing?  All these are housing needs 
and basic skills that people need to take care of their homes and 
to make them sustainable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a high tech world everything has become a case of calling 911 
when people are in trouble.  People call the plumber when there 
is a leak, the electrician when there is a power outage, the 
computer specialist when viruses are coming down from the online 
system.  We are making people dependent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The social housing program has been utilized by many generations 
of families and individuals.  In future they will have to try to 
find their way through the provincial and local community 
administrations.

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, this bill will abdicate the corporate for profit social 
housing programs.  That is a very dangerous venture for this 
country to go on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that our young people, our homeless people, our 
disadvantaged people require the state to look at these interests 
and to find the means to create opportunities to put before us. 
The state should make the challenges.  It should make them local 
challenges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My first career, coming out of high school, was as a carpenter. 
In 1976 there was a major infrastructure development in northern 
Saskatchewan which included housing.  I learned to build a house. 
Today I am proud to be a carpenter who can still build a house, 
but if it was not for the social housing program that was in 
place in my community I would have not attained that skill or 
that trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, if for profit corporations build social housing in our 
communities, they hire local people at minimum wage for a very 
specific, short period and then they leave with the profits they 
have made.  There is no advantages for trade development or skill 
development.  I guess the bottom line is one of self-awareness 
and self-pride, self-esteem in housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If families can provide homes, if communities can provide for 
the well-being of their citizens and if the country can provide 
for the well-being of its citizens, then we will have self-esteem 
in the country.  With Bill C-66 we seem to be going to the common 
marketplace to look at social housing delivery in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada we have a housing shortage in the middle of the boreal 
forest.  That is a mindless situation.  It is not a housing 
problem, it is a social problem.  It is a sick society when we 
have a wealth of resources in the backwoods of our communities 
and we have a housing shortage.  Young families are starting up. 
Some families have 15 to 20 members living in one dwelling.  They 
have issues of health, discipline and economic plight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Housing is also an industry.  We have to create industries in 
our communities in all necks of the woods, so to speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recently had the birth of Nunavut.  We watched the 
celebrations take place in the capital of Nunavut, Iqaluit. This 
is a growing, young population, the majority of which is under 25 
years old.  They are going to need housing in the future, but 
there are no trees in Nunavut.  There is an abundance of trees in 
northern Saskatchewan, northern Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec and 
British Columbia.  We have to create an economic cycle within our 
own country.  We have to trade among ourselves.  We have to 
prepare ourselves, but we have to take care of our people first, 
before we trade worldwide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take care of Canadians in a responsible way.  I call on 
the government to reconsider its support of Bill C-66 at this 
time.  I call on the government to reconsider in the new 
millennium renovating and rejuvenating our pride, as well as 
renovating this House.  Why not?  This House has a housing 
problem of its own.  We should reassess how we populate it, and 
redesign the House which came from the British form of 
government.  Let us redesign something collectively for the new 
millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole structure and foundation of the government, the 
foundation of the country, is compassion for everyone.  We must 
have compassion for each other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those people who have been using the social housing program for 
years should be the people sitting on the CMHC board of 
directors.  They should be the ones administering the 
bureaucratic structure of social housing.  Why not consider these 
people for positions on the board of directors?  Instead, the 
government, the minister or the prime minister will appoint 
whomever they want.

our environment.  It should consider the use of energy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a major challenge for us to empower and to teach our 
children that in the future we should build our homes in a 
respectful and honourable way, but by no means should the federal 
government abandon its responsibilities to the citizens of this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that a further review of the CMHC is needed for the 
new millennium, but consultations should take place at the 
community level, not at the federal level.  I call on the Liberal 
government not to adopt any past government's ideas of making for 
profit corporations' interests a priority.  The government should 
support the non-profit and co-operative movement that has taken 
place in social housing.  These organizations should be 
financially and politically supported to make it possible for 
people in the future to have houses.

Bill C-393, an act to amend the Competition Act, 1998 (negative

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Before I call for resumption of 
debate, I have received notice from the hon. member for North 
Vancouver that he is unable to move his motion during private 
members' hour on Monday, May 10.  It has not been possible to 
arrange an exchange of positions in the order of precedence. 
Accordingly, I am directing the table officers to drop that item

that my hon. friend has been trying to have passed for some time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will all remember that this process started when a lot of 
Canadians were shocked by the fact that cable television charges 
had been increased and Canadians had not approved the increase. 
They were shocked to find that the cable stations had every right 
to impose a new set of costs and a new range of services.  If we 
do not like what they do, then we have to notify them. 
This seems to be kind of an odd way to go about business.  It is 
certainly in favour of the cable companies.  I remember, and I am 
sure other members remember the incredible response that we 
received as elected members: the faxes, the e-mails, the letters 
and the visits from delegations and all sorts of very disgruntled 
people in terms of wondering how it was that we were allowing 
this to occur.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is:  What do we do about it?  I am therefore 
pleased to speak to today's bill because the hon. member has 
brought forward a proposal that would make this kind of back door 
increase impossible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the second time this has moved through the House.  The 
last time it was scuttled in committee.  I hope this time it will 
have a better chance to pass in the House.  Today is the last day 
of debate.  In a matter of minutes we will have the final round 
of discussion and then we will move to a vote on the bill.  We in 
the New Democratic Party who are here will be supporting it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize this is a private member's initiative and not a party 
initiative.  It is being brought forward once again by the hon. 
member who was quite outraged, as we all were, when he learned 
about the initiative taken by the cable companies.  I am not 
certain if this applies to other organizations or not, but even 
if it does, the fact that the cable companies have misused this 
initiative would probably justify our speaking and voting against 
it because it certainly is not in the best interests of their 
subscribers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This tells us that the cable companies assume that Canadians are 
not very smart and that they really cannot think for themselves. 
It is either that or they are able to be manipulated quite 
easily.  I am not sure what the assumption would be.  However, I 
do not think we can accept that.  We want to say that Canadians 
have the right to decide for themselves, as individuals, as 
families, and so on, as to what combination of programming they 
would like to have.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before this House is not new.  We have seen it in 
various forms in the past.  The government has a number of 
concerns it will raise in committee, if the House decides to

which we share, I reiterate that these concerns should be 
covered by amendments in committee before the bill returns to 
the House at report stage or third reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of these concerns is the effect the bill may have, in its

Competition Act, 1998, which concerns industry.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On first examination, the objective of this bill appears to be a 
praiseworthy one.  But we in the Bloc Quebecois see a number of 
problems in it, particularly the issue of jurisdiction.  The 
bill is intended as an interference in the relationship between 
commercial operations and consumers, which is clearly an area of 
provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill proposed an amendment to the Competition Act, and is 
aimed at prohibiting negative option marketing, which means 
billing consumers for products or services without their express 
consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, it proposes to prohibit such marketing practices by 
banks, trust companies, credit unions as well as 
telecommunications and broadcasting companies.  When reference 
is made to credit unions, of course this refers mainly to the 
caisses populaires, of which there are many in Quebec.  Almost 
all Quebeckers belong to a caisse populaire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the third attempt by the member for Sarnia—Lambton to ban 
negative option billing.  In 1996, the member for Sarnia—Lambton 
introduced Bill C-216, the purpose of which was to amend the 
Broadcasting Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind members that the Bloc Quebecois was opposed to 
the bill for three reasons.  First, it represented interference 
in commercial relations between businesses and consumers, a 
field of provincial jurisdiction.  Second, the bill would have 
required the explicit consent of all subscribers for a new 
channel to be broadcast. Third, the bill had a particularly 
unfortunate effect, not only in Quebec, but in our opinion also 
in other regions with a sizeable francophone population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other place was concerned about this, and amended the bill 
in order to protect francophones.  It died on the Order Paper, 
however, when the election was called. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On November 25, 1997, the hon. member for Sarnia«Lambton 
introduced Bill C-288.  Its goal was similar to that of Bill 
C-216, and its contents almost identical.  But the House did not 
get to vote on this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is now coming back with this legislation. We can attest to 
the tenacity and perseverance of the hon. member for 
Sarnia—Lambton, who insists on presenting a bill, which he feels 
targets broadcasting companies. But this time, the hon. member 
does not seek to amend the Broadcasting Act but, rather, the 
Competition Act. However, the fundamental purpose of the 
Competition Act is not to regulate relations between consumers 
and businesses, but to monitor deceptive practices used by 
competing companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As regards deceptive practices, the Bureau of Competition must 
of course receive complaints. When it is established that a 
company or a business is resorting to deceptive practices, it 
can be subject to stiff penalties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But, in this case, this clearly does not come under the 
Competition Act. 
The objective is different, that is to deal with relations 
between consumers and companies. This, in our opinion, comes 
under the CRTC, which is accountable to the Minister of 
Industry, and the issue should be dealt with at that level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a major flaw in that the proposed change is not aimed 
at the proper act, but at another one, whose objective does not 
have to do with this type of relations.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of the laudable goal pursued by the hon. member, the 
Bloc Quebecois will nevertheless oppose this bill, primarily 
because trade and consumer protection come under the 
jurisdiction of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that this issue should be dealt with by the CRTC, 
which already has the powers to prohibit negative option 
marketing if it deems that it is appropriate and in the public 
interest to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill would reduce the powers of the CRTC and give the 
Bureau of Competition powers that could adversely affect the 
Canadian broadcasting policy, limit consumers' options, increase 
their bills and kill the development of French language 
broadcasting in Quebec and Canada, in regions where francophones 
are present. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will stop here and conclude by saying that we will oppose this

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak today to second reading of Bill C-393, an act to 
amend the Competition Act which deals specifically with negative 
option billing.  My caucus colleague, the member for Markham, has 
already spoken as PC Party industry critic on the bill at second 
reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As most members have noted, Bill C-393 had a previous life in 
the 35th parliament.  In that parliament the member for 
Sarnia—Lambton introduced Bill C-216, which would have amended 
the Broadcasting Act.  The legislation was sparked by public 
outrage at the cable companies imposing negative option billing 
through the addition of specialty channels at the beginning of 
1995.  As such, Bill C-216 dealt solely with cable television and 
passed the House despite opposition from many powerful interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately for the member's efforts Bill C-216 was still 
under review by the Senate when the Prime Minister called the 
1997 federal election.  The bill was effectively killed by the 
member's own government, which was not under any pressure to go 
to the polls only 3.5 years into its first mandate.  There may be 
some, perhaps even the member himself, who would blame the Senate 
for the death of Bill C-216.  This is a misguided view because 
the Senate was playing its constitutionally mandated role to 
review legislation from the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There may have been many occasions in the past several years 
where the Senate has undeniably improved legislation.  Correcting 
errors not addressed on the House side in the Liberal 
government's so-called Pearson airport legislation and more 
recent amendments to the Judges Act are but two examples.  Until 
the Senate is either reformed or abolished we should stop 
attacking its members for trying to perform their mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-216 is history.  We are now debating Bill C-393.  As 
previously mentioned, the bill would amend the Competition Act to 
ban negative option billing in a whole host of sectors, including 
certain financial institutions, broadcasting undertakings, 
telecommunications firms and insurance companies.  In particular, 
Bill C-393 protects the basic consumer right to express consent 
before purchasing a new product or service.  In plain language 
this means consumers cannot be billed for a product or service 
without their clear consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Sarnia—Lambton and organizations such as the 
Consumers' Association of Canada make a compelling case against 
negative option marketing practices.  Indeed I think many of us 
will agree that this type of marketing reverses the traditional 
buyer-seller relationship.  With negative option billing 
customers are offered new products or services and are required 
to opt out or expressly decline these new offerings to avoid 
being charged for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From a legal standpoint negative option billing relies upon the 
concept of implied consent.  By not responding to a solicitation 
the consumer is deemed to have given his or her consent.  Indeed 
it is fair to say that negative option schemes rely on market 
inertia to sell new products or services to an existing client 
base.  It is therefore a justifiable claim that negative option 
billing further concentrates market share with the dominant 
industry players instead of fostering competition in an open 
marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-393 applies to federally regulated businesses such as 
banks and cable and telephone companies.  Under the law selected 
financial, insurance, cable and broadcasting companies would not 
be allowed to use a lack of consumer response to negative option 
billing inquiries as consent to buy. 
The bill wisely allows provincial governments to prohibit 
negative option marketing within their jurisdictions.  Provinces 
such as Quebec have already taken steps in this direction.

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While provincial governments have progressed somewhat in 
addressing these dubious marketing efforts, there is a noticeable 
lack of such consumer protection at the federal level.  Cable 
providers are still using negative option billing in regional 
markets despite previous assurances to the contrary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In August 1996 Industry Canada's office of consumer affairs 
warned that negative option marketing had the potential to be an 
important tool in the financial services sector.  Examples cited 
in the report included the sending of unsolicited credit cards 
and changes in account structure made without the consent of 
consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 the Toronto-Dominion Bank employed a negative option 
technique to deprive bank customers of their privacy.  The 
National Bank reportedly used a similar scheme to sell travellers 
health insurance to existing customers by debiting their accounts 
$9.95 per month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased that Bill C-393 recognizes that there are 
situations in which a consumer benefits from a negative option 
billing arrangement.  However, for this to be the case, consumers 
must be able to make informed decisions and give express consent. 
The bill proposes certain steps to be taken for a negative option 
scheme to be legal and fines for those who contravene the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has received the support of the Consumers' Association 
of Canada, the Public Interest Advocacy Centre and the Insurance 
Brokers Association of Canada.  Although Bill C-393 is strong on 
consumer protection, the PC caucus would like to know the views 
of such organizations as the Canadian Federation of Independent 
Business, the Insurance Bureau of Canada and the Canadian 
Petroleum Products Institute among others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must always be prudent as parliamentarians not to impose an 
excessive amount of laws and regulations on the private sector. 
Our caucus has already brought forward the concerns of the 
private sector regarding punitive measures in the federal cost 
recovery program, which was expanded greatly by the Liberal 
government in 1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the move to more user fees for the private sector was 
initially welcomed by businesses of all shapes and sizes, the 
government's chosen structure has proven to be ineffective, 
incompatible and costly.  As a result this program cost the 
Canadian economy over $1.3 billion from our GDP and 23,000 jobs, 
according to the 1990 report by the Blair Consulting Group.  Let 
us always be careful in bringing in government intervention no 
matter how well intentioned it may seem to be at the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our caucus would also like to verify that Bill C-393 would not 
hinder French language broadcasting in Canada.  This was raised 
in 1997 by the chairwoman of the CRTC.  I am sure all members of 
the House, especially bilingualism's newest friends in the Reform 
Party, would want to ensure that Bill C-393 does not pose a 
threat to French language broadcasting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reiterate on behalf of the Progressive Conservative Party of 
Canada the qualified support of Bill C-393 at second reading. The 
overall intent is extremely positive.  The legislation would 
significantly increase the level of consumer protection in the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members of the House to put aside partisan interests 
and support moving the bill along to the industry committee where 
it can be given closer scrutiny on issues of concern. 
<P><A NAME="LINK191"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Pratt (Nepean—Carleton, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is my pleasure to speak today to Bill C-393, an act to amend the 
Competition Act which relates specifically to negative option 
marketing.  I commend the hon. member for Sarnia—Lambton for 
introducing the legislation once again.  It seeks to protect 
consumers and offer consumers greater choice in the marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-393 deals with the business practice known as negative 
option sales and marketing.  The practice is also known as 
unsolicited marketing and marketing by inertia.  Related concepts 
include the following: bundling, tied selling, automatic renewal 
contracts and misleading advertising and/or deceptive marketing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless of the term or concept, this practice is a perversion 
of the normally accepted rules of contract or sales.  The law of 
contracts insists that a form of offer and acceptance is required 
to make an agreement binding.  It could be argued that negative 
option marketing, in the absence of independent consent, 
undermines the fundamental principles necessary for a valid 
commercial contract. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1330"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Negative option marketing involves a consumer receiving a 
product and a payment request because the consumer failed to say 
no to the offer.  Normally in the context of the rules of 
contract or sales, an offer is made, acceptance is given, the 
service is delivered and payment is required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The framework employed under negative option sales is inverted. 
An offer is sometimes made, sometimes hidden and sometimes there 
is no choice at all.  The consumer accepts the offer not because 
the individual necessarily wants the product but because they do 
not specifically say “No, I do not want this service”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is this practice employed?  It is obvious.  The assumption 
that the consumer desires the product is made in the absence of 
refusal in order to increase revenue.  Practitioners of this type 
of marketing or sales do not seek to meet the demands of the 
marketplace but create what can be termed as a false demand. 
This sleight of hand technique violates consumers' right to 
choice. Moreover approving sales where there is no market is 
synonymous with forcing sales where there is no demand.  It is 
unreasonable to allow the creation of both market and demand 
where neither exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-393 would amend the Competition Act to force federally 
regulated companies to obtain the permission of customers for any 
new service.  Why is it unreasonable to suggest that a consumer 
has the right to say “I know what is offered.  I know the cost. 
I want what is offered”.  It is not unreasonable to expect 
federally regulated companies to obtain a definite and positive 
response before supplying and charging for services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill protects a basic consumer right, the right to express 
consent before purchasing a new product.  Negative option 
marketing or billing relies on implied consent.  In other words, 
by not responding to solicitation the consumer is deemed to have 
given his or her consent.  Rather than foster competition, 
negative option marketing concentrates market share with the 
dominant players in a particular sector.  Any anti-competitive 
practice limits choice for consumers and acts contrary to the 
foundation of the Canadian marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In today's marketplace consumers are inundated with 
communication through various mediums.  It is unreasonable to 
sanction the onerous task of requiring consumers to examine the 
endless amount of communications from customer dealings in search 
of negative option marketing.  Consumer arrangements resulting in 
new products or services being offered that obligate additional 
consumer expenditure should require expressed consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several points should be made clear.  Bill C-393 applies to 
federally regulated businesses such as banks, cable and telephone 
companies.  The provinces are free to prohibit negative option 
marketing within their jurisdictions.  Several have already taken 
steps in this direction.  The time has arrived to enact measures 
at the federal level in order to protect consumers. Bill C-393 
provides the appropriate measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-393 also proposes that steps be taken in order for 
specific negative option programs to be legal.  Why?  Because the 
bill recognizes that situations may exist where a consumer would 
benefit from a negative option billing arrangement.  This is 
supported by a document produced by Industry Canada entitled 
“Negative Option Marketing:  A Discussion Paper” wherein it is 
stated “Negative option marketing takes many forms and in some 
circumstances may benefit consumers as well as industry”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill does not seek to impede successful industry in Canada. 
It does however ensure that consumers are able to make informed 
decisions and express consent before entering into an agreement 
with additional charges.  Moreover, Bill C-393 recognizes or 
provides for exemptions in order that specific enterprises remain 
competitive in their sector of activity while maintaining 
consumer protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill in section 128(1.1) states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Governor in Council may, by regulation, exempt from the 
definition of “service” in section 53 any service that, in the 
opinion of the Governor in Council, should be exempted in order 
to allow enterprises to which this section applies to remain 
competitive in their sector of activity, provided that the 
exemption does not deprive consumers of their right to 
competitive prices and product choices. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This provision would allow any minister or department to express 
concern for services under their purview that might be effected. 
For example, Heritage Canada could propose justification for 
exemption based on concerns relating to heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-393 provides for warranted protection of certain services 
against unfair competition which in turn protects consumers and, 
as in the example given, possible cultural or heritage issues as 
well. 
This provision however does not exclude consumer protection. In 
fact, it specifies clearly that the exemption must not deprive 
consumers of their right to competitive prices and product 
choices.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently the Consumers Association of Canada issued a statement 
with respect to Bill C-393: “It is timely that private member's 
Bill C-393 is being debated in parliament this week prior to 
world consumers rights day.  World consumers rights day 
celebrates eight fundamental consumer rights of which the right 
of choice is paramount.  A piece of legislation that bans abusive 
negative option marketing is a positive step in the promotion of 
consumers' right to choice”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this era of deregulation and government downsizing, it is 
important that we establish a regulatory framework which is 
consumer oriented.  It is my contention that Bill C-393 addresses 
the inconsistency between negative option marketing and accepted 
contract norms.  In doing so, this bill protects consumers by 
offering them a choice of which products they desire while 
increasing the competitiveness of the marketplace. 
<P><A NAME="LINK192"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak to Bill C-393, an act to amend the 
Competition Act with respect to the prohibition of negative 
option billing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to recognize the work of my colleague from 
Sarnia—Lambton on this issue.  I know that he has worked 
tirelessly in the interests of consumers.  I respect any member 
of the House who is prepared to champion an issue despite 
pressure coming from within his own caucus to be a quiet and 
dutiful backbencher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is designed to prohibit the practice of implied 
consent billing by federally regulated businesses such as banks, 
cable and telephone companies. It would restore the traditional 
buyer-seller relationship that relies on the consumer's explicit 
consent before they can be billed for a product or service that 
will prohibit default billing of consumers who do not expressly 
decline a product or service. In other words, it would put an end 
to what has been called negative option billing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before making a decision about supporting this legislation, I 
considered the views of many Canadians about this billing 
practice.  It is clear that this bill has broad support among 
consumers who are frustrated by negative option billing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular, there is frustration with cable providers that 
bill for new programs automatically unless the consumer expressly 
rejects the service.  Consumer groups have cited senior citizens 
as an example of a group who are often unaware that they have the 
choice of opting out of the new service and are consequently 
billed for a program they do not want and cannot afford. This is 
a source of frustration not simply because of the financial 
costs, but because it is deemed to be a violation of an age old 
relationship between buyers and sellers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that consumers are looking for protection from 
negative option billing.  The question is simply how do we 
provide that protection?  Should it come in the form of Bill 
C-393 or can this be achieved through market based reforms?  I 
think a balance must be struck. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-393 had its origins as Bill C-288 which would have 
amended the Broadcasting Act to restrict negative option billing 
by cable companies.  These companies can currently act with 
relative impunity as they are federally regulated regional 
monopolies which are free from the normal constraints of the 
competitive market.  This new version of the bill is broader and 
instead amends competition laws that apply to all federally 
regulated industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decision by the hon. member for Sarnia—Lambton to use the 
Competition Act as a means by which to prohibit negative option 
billing instead of making changes to the legislation which deals 
directly with the perpetrators of this practice is troubling. 
Competition laws can profoundly restrict economic freedom and 
market efficiency and a general move toward strengthening these 
laws should be approached with caution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill should not be seen as a mechanism by which to restrict 
attempts by companies wishing to expand their market share.  We 
must not allow our competition laws to grow steadily more 
intrusive.  We must act vigilantly to create competition through 
deregulation of our industries in the interest of every Canadian 
consumer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The original purpose of this draft legislation in the form of 
Bill C-288 was to amend the Broadcasting Act.  This dealt much 
more directly with the source of the problem and would be the 
preferable course by which to protect consumers against negative 
option billing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Negative option billing is a practice common to federally 
regulated industries because they enjoy market protection such 
that they restrict or limit the consumer's ability to seek out 
alternate providers of a product or a service.  Therefore the 
deregulation of federally legislated industries should be the 
first step to eliminating negative option billing and other 
practices that do not properly serve consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have been much more supportive of an initiative that 
worked to limit government and increase consumer choice rather 
than an initiative which extends the scope of government further 
into the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party supports limited government and free enterprise 
but recognizes the important role of government in creating an 
economic environment with fair and transparent rules which 
protect both consumers and businesses.  However we differ from 
the governing party in that we believe that markets serve 
consumers well as long as competition is permitted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-393 is a band-aid solution made necessary by the 
Liberals' resolve to maintain protectionist policies and regional 
monopolies in federally regulated industries such as cable, 
telecommunications and banking despite the fact that these 
policies hurt consumers. But sometimes a band-aid is needed until 
a disinfectant can be found. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I conclude I want to provide an example that illustrates 
the power of competition to end negative option billing in case 
my colleagues across the way have their doubts.  I am sure we are 
all familiar with Columbia House Records.  This is a company that 
makes its money through negative option billing.  After signing 
up with the bulk music distributor, consumers are sent cassettes 
and CDs on a monthly basis.  If they do not send the selections 
back to the company, they are billed for the merchandise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a pure example of negative option billing because 
the consumer agreed to these billing terms by signing up with the 
company.  However the point that is relevant is that consumers 
were so hostile to this form of billing that Columbia House sales 
began to decline.  Soon a competitor entered the market and 
advertised that it would not engage in negative option billing at 
all.  When faced with this competition, Columbia House very 
quickly reversed its negative option billing practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the drive for profits in a competitive and 
deregulated industry will give more power to consumers to seek 
favourable terms.  It is the invisible hand of capitalism at 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, it is clear that the Liberal mismanagement of 
federally regulated industries has created an economic 
environment in which consumers suffer the ill effects of limited 
competition.  While this bill regrettably increases the power and 
scope of the Competition Act and restricts private sector 
decision making, it should receive the qualified support of the 
Reform caucus until such time as these industries can be 
deregulated.  After this deregulation, competition itself will 
ferret out those businesses that conduct their affairs in a 
manner inconsistent with consumer interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am prepared to call the hon. member 
for Sarnia—Lambton and I advise the House that if he speaks now, 
he will close the debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK193"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia—Lambton, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I want to take this brief period to reply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This marks the end of the third hour of debate at second reading 
of Bill C-393.  We have had a number of speakers on the topic. It 
is clear that this is a business practice that is used not just 
by cable companies.  I want to emphasize that.  It is also used 
by telephone companies and it is used by banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members have recognized that this is a perverse way of doing 
business.  This is a twisting of the normal rules.  The time has 
arrived that we recognize it is a widespread problem in federally 
regulated industries, it is a widespread problem in that it takes 
advantage of consumers in the country, and it is a widespread 
problem in that it reverses the normal rules of business 
practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those reasons the bill should pass second reading and go to 
a committee so the committee can pass judgment upon the propriety 
of the bill.  Then the bill should return to the House so that we 
may legislate in this place for the first time a degree of 
protection, a degree of fairness for consumers in the country, 
something that we have failed to do in this place, particularly 
in the realm of those industries that are federally regulated.
