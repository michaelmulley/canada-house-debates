	<B>Mr. Jim Jordan (Leeds-Grenville, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
International Ploughing Match held this year in 
Haldimand-Norfolk brought together the best the nation can offer 
in the art of ploughing the land.
<P>
	This year a friend of mine, Mr. Lloyd Vandusen, was the clear 
winner in two categories of ploughing. Lloyd won championship 
horse ploughman for Ontario and he scored the highest points of 
the match in the horse competition.
<P>
	Lloyd is the best ploughman in Canada and probably the best in 
the world. I want to personally thank him for the leadership he has 
shown in creating and maintaining a high interest in the art of 
ploughing throughout this nation.

	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Canada pension plan is in a crisis.
<P>
	CPP was originally intended to provide retirement pensions for 
workers and aged survivors. Disability programs were under 
provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	Since 1970 when the first federal disability cheque was issued, 
amendments have increased benefits and made it easier to qualify. 
Now some insurance companies tell clients to apply for CPP 
disability before they collect any  benefits from them. And 
government payments are deducted before the company plan kicks 
in. CPP disability is subsidizing private plans and jeopardizing the 
pension of every working Canadian.
<P>
	That is not all that is wrong. If your disability claim is turned 
down by CPP, just appeal it to a tribunal. In more than 
three-quarters of the cases the original decision is overturned.
<P>
	Let us save CPP for its original purpose: providing retirement 
security for our senior citizens. And let us properly address the 
needs of the country's disabled.

	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the history of my riding has been marked by the Papineau 
family, whose most illustrious member, Louis-Joseph Papineau, 
died 125 years ago this year.
<P>
	This great man and patriot, who owned the Petite-Nation 
seigneury, occupies an important place in Quebec history, as his 
main vocation was to defend the rights of Quebecers. To serve this 
cause, he became a member of Parliament.
<P>
	The town of Papineauville in my riding was named in honour of 
his brother Denis-Benjamin Papineau.
<P>
	Henri Bourassa, Louis-Joseph Papineau's grandson and the 
founder of <I>Le Devoir</I>, was the first mayor of Papineauville, which 
celebrates this year its 100th anniversary.
<P>
	We are proud of this rich history. The people of Petite-Nation 
have inherited these great figures' love for their region. Although 
they died many years ago, Louis-Joseph Papineau, Denis-Benjamin 
Papineau and Henri Bourassa are still present in the lives of the 
people of the Petite-Nation region.

<B><A NAME="4664"> 4664 </A></B>
<P>
accuse the B.C.  government of playing into the hands of the 
right-wingers at the Fraser Institute.
<P>
	The Liberals can speak with authority on the Fraser Institute. 
They have been singing from the Fraser Institute's hymn book ever 
since coming to power in 1993: deficit cutting at whatever cost to 
medicare, the CBC and the fabric of our communities; privatizing 
and deregulating transportation at whatever cost to regions like 
northern Manitoba; attacking inflation but tolerating 
depression-like unemployment. It was all there on the Fraser 
Institute's wish list and the Liberals have delivered.
<P>
	The Liberals have not delivered on jobs, they have not delivered 
on child care, on the CBC, on the GST, on medicare, on drug 
patents, in short on anything that is important to the quality of life 
for hard working Canadians.
<P>
	If the Liberals who still have an ounce of attachment to their old 
tradition of building rather than destroying institutions do not stand 
up to the Fraser Institute interloper who poses as the finance 
minister, the Liberals will erode-

on Canada's leadership in the worldwide campaign to ban land 
mines. I hope we continue to support the efforts of the Canadian 
Red Cross and Mines Action Canada to develop an effective 
international ban.
<P>
	I also urge the government and the armed forces to support 
de-mining around the world. We should make particular efforts to 
develop effective techniques and technologies to remove the 
millions of land mines which kill and maim people around the 
world every day.
<P>
	Expertise on these matters is available in Canada. Land mines, 
like gas and biological weapons, are inhuman and unacceptable in

of Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington. This summer 
the Napanee Midget and Junior Express each displaced over 30 
teams to win provincial elimination competitions and to earn 
places in the Canadian championship playoffs.
<P>
	I am also very proud today to recognize coaches and all the 
volunteers in this organization who provided youth with the 
opportunity to develop skills and a winning attitude.
<P>
	The Napanee Midget Express travelled to Prince Albert, 
Saskatchewan where they achieved silver medal standing. The 
Napanee Junior Express came home from their national playoffs in 
St. John's, Newfoundland with gold.
<P>
	During the midget eliminations which were held in my riding I 
commented that while winning is wonderful, the real joy resides in 
playing the game. Well, winning is sweet too.
<P>
	I believe that only once before have two of the winning Canadian 
championship teams come from the same town. Look what can be 
done when dedicated volunteers and energetic youth combine their 
talents. Please join me in extending well deserved congratulations.

five greatest schools by <I>Today's Parent</I> magazine.
<P>
	This recognition is indeed a great accomplishment. Clearly it is 
proof that our public education system is a model of excellence. In 
communities all across this country our public schools are staffed 
by dedicated professionals and volunteers truly working to make a 
positive difference in the lives of our young people.

	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, last 
week, the UN carried out a mid-term review of its new agenda for 
Africa. This five-year program is aimed at helping the 47 nations 
on that disaster-stricken continent, including the 35 poorest 
countries in the world. Canada maintained only a discreet presence 
at this rather important meeting to deal with the pressing poverty 
problem.
<P>
	Eliminating world poverty is one of the priorities of Canada's 
foreign policy. Despite this and although Canada has always 
favoured international forums, the government did not see fit to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4665"> 4665 </A></B>
<P>
send a ministerial representative to this meeting to debate these 
vital issues.
<P>
	It just so happens that the Minister of Foreign Affairs is in New 
York this week for the opening of the 51st session of the UN 
General Assembly. In light of the major differences between the 
two Canadian delegations, we question the government's real 
commitment to a priority it set itself. We hope this is only an honest 
mistake and not a decision to turn away from Africa and even from 
the UN.

	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, many 
Canadians are concerned that we are being culturally and 
economically Americanized. Why is this? Could it be because 
there are fewer obstacles to doing business with the United States 
than with other Canadian provinces?
<P>
	This government has talked a lot about its commitment to 
removing internal trade barriers. That is good. However, its actions 
have been weak and ineffective. This government's complacency 
has led to recent conflicts between provinces. New Brunswick and 
B.C. are fighting over job poachers, Ontario and Quebec over 
construction jobs, and Quebec and Newfoundland over Churchill 
Falls.
<P>
	These disputes which could have been settled with a strong 
agreement on internal trade are instead pitting province against 
province and harming national unity.
<P>
	This government's ineffectiveness in removing internal trade 
barriers is eroding our national identity and is tearing our country 
apart.

	<B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Oakville-Milton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to correct a false impression that was left in the minds of 
Canadians as a result of an article that appeared in a national 
newspaper on July 23. The article implied that the government is 
spending more on the Francophone Games of 1997 than we spent 
on the Olympics in Atlanta. This is false.
<P>
	In fact Sports Canada provided $615,000 to send our team to 
Atlanta, but it also provides $20 million annually toward the 
athletes' preparation programs and more than $7 million in direct 
assistance to our carded athletes.
<P>
	Since 1992 the government has spent almost $115 million aimed 
at Olympic sports organizations and their athletes. That is over 40 
times the amount we are spending on the Francophone Games.
<P>
	The upcoming games in Madagascar are also an opportunity for 
our athletes to start preparing for the next Olympics. That is what 
happened in 1994 in Paris where Bruny Surin won the gold medal 
in the 100 metres and Donovan Bailey won the silver.

	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Quebec 
separatists seem determined to do away with Montreal and its 
people, whom they hold responsible for the successive referendum 
reverses they have suffered.
<P>
	Besides appointing the token minister responsible for Montreal 
and making vague commitments to work toward national 
reconciliation, the Parti Quebecois has not done a thing for 
Montreal. It is standing by as the city slowly but inexorably loses 
its investors, its jobs and its brains.
<P>
	As if to speed up Montreal's collapse, Quebec separatists have 
decided to unilaterally re-open the language debate to please a 
handful of radical militants.
<P>
	In terms of a strategy for Montreal's recovery, we have seen 
better, we have never seen worse. The Parti Quebecois and its 
separatist allies are deluding themselves and other Quebecers with 
this idea that Montreal has to be weakened for their plan to achieve 
independence to succeed.

condemned.
<P>
	How can any connection be made in this Parliament between the 
leader of the Bloc Quebecois and Mr. Villeneuve, when the hon. 
member for Roberval was the first political leader to dissociate 
himself from and condemn these remarks, saying that they did not 
reflect the views of any member of the sovereignist movement in 
Quebec.

	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday the disabled vessel <I>Alexis le Trotteur</I> declared an 
emergency in 100 kilometre plus winds and two storey waves off 
the coast of Nova Scotia. First a Hercules and then an Aurora 
maritime patrol aircraft arrived but high winds and rough seas 
prevented rescue. Even a nearby container ship was unable to 
respond.
<P>
	When the Canadian forces search and rescue helicopter arrived, 
the size of the <I>Alexis</I> and the rough seas forced them to abandon 
their usual procedure. A crewman jumped into the huge waves and 
swam with a lifeline to hoist four men and women, one at a time, to 
safety. This 40-minute dangerous rescue left the <I>Labrador</I> at 
critical fuel levels so they flew to St. Pierre and Miquelon.
<P>
	This is yet another example of exemplary performance and 
heroism by a Canadian forces search and rescue team. Their 
dedicated teamwork, training and bravery made possible their 
success. Despite ancient and severely limited equipment, their 
professionalism shone through.

Mr. Speaker, the list of individuals and organizations condemning 
the separatist threat as a major cause of Quebec's economic 
instability is getting longer.
<P>
	Yesterday, it was the mayor of Montreal, Pierre Bourque, who 
raised the issue of economic uncertainty generated by the 
sovereignist threat. The mayor said: ``It goes without saying that 
we need stability. We need confidence. The economy is largely 
based on a climate of confidence''.
<P>
	Montreal, which is still referred to as Quebec's economic 
engine, can no longer put up with the adverse socio-economic 
impact of the PQ and the Bloc Quebecois' separatist obsession. 
Montreal and the province of Quebec need political stability, but as 
long as the separatist threat hangs over Quebec, no socio-economic 
summit and no minister from Montreal will be able to put a stop to 
this sad decline.

<P>
	Although Terry's cancer prevented him from finishing his

the hearts of all who participated in the Terry Fox run this year in 
Canada and around the world. They have taken up his quest for a

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, a few months ago the federal government was backing 
lawyer Guy Bertrand in his bid to have the last Quebec referendum 
declared illegal by the courts. At the time, the federal government 
justified its action by saying that the government of Quebec was 
also taking an active interest in the Bertrand litigation.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	Now we learn that the federal government is preparing to go it 
alone from here on and ask the Supreme Court to rule on what the 
government calls the legal issues surrounding Quebec's possible 
secession. In other words, the government is deciding to take up the 
crusade begun by Guy Bertrand.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister admit that, by taking the issue of 
Quebec's sovereignty to the Supreme court, the federal government 
is implicitly admitting that it has lost the political battle and is now 
trying to set up legal obstacles to prevent the people of Quebec 
from making their own decisions about their future? In a way, the 
government is trying to get the judges to do its work.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government has not officially taken any such decision. 
When we are ready, we will so inform the House.
<P>
	A ruling by the Quebec Superior Court raised some very 
important questions to do with Canadian constitutional law as well 
as with international law.
<P>
	Even the Leader of the Opposition said in an interview that the 
international law aspect should one day be clarified, and obviously 
one day it will be.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government's whole approach consists in asking the 
judges of the Supreme Court for a ruling on a Constitution.
<P>
	So how can the Prime Minister invoke a Constitution that is 
silent on the rules for entering and leaving confederation, a 
Constitution that has no political legitimacy in Quebec, because it 
was imposed-he should know something about that, it was his 
doing-it was imposed and has never been agreed to or signed by

<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member should know that the Canadian 
Constitution dates from 1867 and that it was a law of the British 
Parliament. So, even back then, parliamentarians were unable to 
vote.
<P>
	It has only been since 1982 when we patriated the Constitution, 
so that Canadians would finally have a Canadian Constitution, that 
we could change Canada's Constitution to reflect the wishes of the 
people of Canada. I know that the members of the Bloc Quebecois 
would have preferred to see us remain a colony of Great Britain, 
legally speaking.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, one thing is certain in Quebec and that is that since 1982 
nobody has wanted his Constitution, that is clear.
<P>
	We know that the federal cabinet is divided on the question of 
whether or not to refer this matter to the Supreme Court and I can 
understand, because I want to ask the Prime Minister to give us and 
the members of his cabinet an explanation, and perhaps then he will 
be able to bring about unity.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister explain that Canada's justice 
minister has flatly contradicted himself twice in this matter, first in 
September 1995, when he declared that, in his view, this was not a 
legal question but a political one, and for the second time in May 
1996 when he said that he was intervening in the Bertrand case only 
because the government of Quebec was doing so, and that 
otherwise he would not? By becoming involved now, the Minister 
of Justice will have contradicted himself twice since his initial 
statement.

<P>

department?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I stated yesterday that we have confidence in the 
leadership of the armed forces at this time. This period of 
reductions is a difficult time for the armed forces. The fact that 
there is a public inquiry which will analyse all the operations of 
national defence, something which has never happened before, is 
delicate and complicated for everybody.
<P>
	I urge members of Parliament to let the commission look into all 
matters and report to the people of Canada. After that we will make 
the proper decisions. At this time General Boyle, the minister of 
defence, General Baril and all the others are working to make sure 
that the armed forces are ready for the tasks they have to do today, 
tomorrow, next week and next year.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, fortunately for the rank and file people in the Canadian 
Armed Forces, Generals Cox and Baril are not going to put politics 
before the morale.
<P>
	According to General Cox our soldiers are worried about a 
lingering cloud that follows them around because of the actions of 
a few. They want the cloud to pass. The only person who can make 
that cloud go away, especially the cloud at the top, is the Prime 
Minister.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister get rid of the cloud that is hanging over 
our soldiers by appointing a new chief of the defence staff and a

either.

good morale, to try to find something else to talk about.
<P>
	It is very easy for me to answer. I said that I have full confidence 
in the Minister of National Defence. Why? Because the previous 
administration had seven ministers in nine years. That was the 
cause of the drop in the morale of the armed forces.

	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday the Minister of Canadian Heritage told us without 
blinking an eye that francophones in western Canada would be 
better served by a one hour national newscast than by four 30 
minute regional bulletins. What she was saying was that an hour is 
more than 120 minutes.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Minister of Canadian Heritage. 
Does the minister apply this kind of arithmetic to Radio-Canada's 
radio stations in Vancouver, which will experience cuts totalling 45 
per cent, in Regina and Edmonton, with 50 per cent, and finally in 
Windsor, Ontario, with 60 per cent?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, it is a fact that these cuts 
will create problems in all regions in Canada.
<P>
	Management at Radio-Canada in Montreal worked on this with 
the president and the board of directors and has decided how far 
these cuts should go. I know it will be difficult. I never denied that. 
Today we hope francophones in western Canada can have an 
around-the-clock service through RDI, which is in fact happening 
now.
<P>
	It is also true that cuts hurt everyone. However, if we consider 
Radio-Canada's total budget, after these cuts it would still be $300 
million, which is $100 million more than TVA, for instance.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is clear the minister remains insensitive to the needs of 
francophones outside Quebec and needs of Acadians.
<P>
	By imposing new cuts at Radio-Canada, which will have the 
effect of restricting local broadcasting in French to a few hours a 
day, would the Minister of Canadian Heritage agree that this is very 
similar to what was done by the Government of Ontario in 1912, 
when it passed Regulation 17, which restricted French to one hour a 
day?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, these are the crocodile 
tears of an opposition that referred to francophones outside Quebec 
as paraplegics in wheelchairs and said that, after a referendum, 
they would disappear just like that.
<P>
	I would like to draw your attention to what was said by someone 
who ought to know what he is talking about, and who said, in 
referring to francophones outside Quebec, and I quote: ``The 
Government of Quebec does not do enough, the Péquistes do not do 
enough. The federal government has certainly done more than 
Quebec, and I am prepared to acknowledge that''. These comments

<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr.

the bill that was passed Monday by this House is aimed at 
preventing a new service from being introduced as soon as a 
subscriber objects to it. It is not the same thing at all in Quebec.
<P>
	The Liberal members who voted for this bill did so against the 
advice of the minister and her government, who are aware of its

matter to the Standing Committee on Finance which heard from a

legal issue that was in question.

consistent with justice advice given over the years from whichever 
government was in office. It also heard evidence from which it 
concluded that the officials from revenue acted in good faith.

	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, over the 
last two weeks there was a very serious lobbying effort by the 
heritage minister and her department on behalf of the cable 
companies with respect to the private member's bill that was before 
this House.
<P>
	Does she deny that there was this lobbying effort? We need a 
simple answer, yes or no.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it has been brought to my 
attention by a number of opponents of negative option billing that 
when this issue was raised by a number of members on the 
government side of the House almost a year ago, unfortunately the 
Reform Party did not even think it was an issue.
<P>
	Luckily its members have caught on. They understand that 
negative option billing is not in the interests of any consumer. 
Hopefully with the work of all members of the House, we will have 
a package that will ban negative option billing forever.
<P>
<B>(1455 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
member has become very familiar with the non-answer. She did not 
answer the question. Was there a lobby or was there not?
<P>
	The fact is that <I>Canada AM</I> on Monday, September 23 quoted 
from a document dated September 17 from her heritage 
department, and again it was quoted in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> today. I 
simply ask her how in the world can she deny the existence of a 
lobby by either her department or her office?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, advice is given and 
people lobby on every occasion. The member opposite right now is 
lobbying in the House for his particular perspective.
<P>
	The fact is that on Monday last there was a vote in the House 
which enshrined a principle to oppose negative option billing. This 
government opposed negative option billing last year. It opposed 
negative option billing this year. It will oppose negative option 
billing next year. As long as we are the Government of Canada 
there will be no negative option billing.

	<B>Mr. Ian Murray (Lanark-Carleton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food.
<P>
	Some 4,000 public servants could be affected by the 
government's move to create a new federal food inspection agency. 
These employees are concerned about  their future. As the 
transition to the new agency takes place, what assurance can the 
minister give these public servants that they will be treated fairly?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the new Canadian food inspection 
agency is an exciting new innovation in government operations 
which is widely approved and supported throughout the agriculture 
and agri-food sector.
<P>
	The new agency will involve some new innovations in its human 
resources regime to provide the necessary flexibility for the agency 
to function effectively. But of course the core values of the public 
service will be incorporated into the operations of the new agency. 
Fair treatment of employees will be paramount in the transition 
process that we, of necessity, have to go through.
<P>
	I would add that also paramount is our absolute determination to 
ensure that Canadians will continue to benefit from the safest and 
highest quality food supply in the world.

	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Industry. Under Bell Canada's latest 
proposal concerning business rates, phone bills will be higher for 
businesses located in regions, as opposed to those located in large 
centres. This gap could result in businesses moving to large urban 
centres.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Industry realize that his current competition 
policy will have the effect of adversely affecting regions, and if so 
what does he intend to do about it?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western

Speaker, as a matter of principle, this telecommunication service 
should be available to all Canadians, wherever they live in Canada.

competitive telecommunications system, so that we can attract 
investments to create other opportunities for Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, given what 
the minister just said, does he not realize that the rate increases

<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the answer is in the question, in that it is primarily an 
issue for the CRTC, which deals with services provided in Canada's 
rural areas and urban centres.
<P>
	As I just said, it is necessary to have a very competitive system, 
because it is not easy for us to find investments, including in rural 
areas of Quebec, without a telecommunications system that can 
face the U.S. competition.
<P>
	We must accept the fact that technology is changing, and so are 
the ways of delivering telephone services.

	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
according to the Halifax Chamber of Commerce, if the 
government's GST harmonization deal goes through in Atlantic 
Canada, housing prices will go up 5.5 per cent, municipalities will 
be forced to raise taxes, the sales tax on books, of course, will be 
doubled and the tax in pricing policy will wipe out profit margins 
for small businesses and gut jobs.
<P>
	Will the government finally admit to Canadians that this was 
nothing but a desperate backroom deal to weasel out of its broken 
election promise on the GST? Will it save Canadian taxpayers a 
billion dollars by deep sixing it now before more damage is done to 
the Atlantic Canadian economy?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the one thing that the 
Canadian people agree on is that the GST harmonization with the 
provincial retail sales taxes are good for business and good for the 
people of the country and not harmful. The Atlantic provinces 
agreement is just the first step in moving to a harmonized retail 
sales tax across the country.
<P>
	We hope that the hon. member will support us in this, if he is 
interested in business, if he is interested in developing the 
economy, if he is interested in this country at all.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, even 
the Liberal premiers are now saying that a billion dollars is not 
enough to cover up the bad smell from this deal.
<P>
	Nova Scotia Premier John Savage says: ``Ottawa can tax books 
as they do at the moment. We do not tax books and we will not''. 
That sounds like a deal breaker to me.
<P>
	Since the premiers are now saying they will walk away from the 
deal, will the finance minister admit that his deal is starting to 
unravel because the government does not know how to keep its 
word?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is interesting to 
listen to the members of the Reform Party talk about this, 
especially when it was the Reform Party that said in a minority 
report on the GST that a harmonized tax would do it.

through.

they want to know the facts about the likely future of single desk 
agencies in the 1999 trade talks.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food 
who yesterday told us he had been at a Cairns group meeting where 
he took no farm representatives. There appears to have been no 
record of the proceedings of what went on.
<P>
	Will he in future include wheat board advisory members as farm 
representatives and will he make available the record of such 
discussions so that all farmers may assess what is really going on, 
given that New Zealand and Australia, his two believed allies, tell a 
different story about 1999.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, contrary to what the hon. 
gentleman has just said, in preparation for the Cairns group 
meetings there were discussions between representatives of farm 
organizations and myself, including the Canadian Federation of 
Agriculture and others.
<P>
	The reports of the Cairns group meetings were published at the 
conclusion of the meetings and broadly carried in the international 
press.
<P>
	May I just re-emphasize for the benefit of the hon. member and 
others, any future decisions to be taken about our marketing 
institutions or anything else having to do with Canadian agriculture 
will be made in Canada by Canadians for our own good Canadian

question is for the Prime Minister and it has to do with the Somalia 
inquiry.
<P>
	I want to make a constructive suggestion to the Prime Minister 
today. I think he will acknowledge that this inquiry has deeply 
affected the morale of Canadian troops and that there will be a very 
long delay between the report and the proceedings. We also know 
that there are two different sets of events here, the events in 
Somalia and what happened afterward.

<P>
	Given these circumstances, will the Prime Minister not do the 
sensible thing and ask for an interim report?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the inquiry has a mandate to look into what happened in 
Somalia when the Progressive Conservative Party was in 
government and it has to finish its job.
<P>
	The question of an interim report or no interim report is not for 
me to ask. It is for the commission to decide. I hope that it will 
complete the work as quickly as possible. It will be in the interests 
of the armed forces and everybody that the file be completed, the 
report be handed in and the government act on the 
recommendations, if need be.
<P>
	An interim report will not deviate from the reality that when the 
inquiry goes into the second phase there will be discomfort for 
some people because nobody likes to have an inquiry. It is the first 
time in the history of the armed forces that there has been a public 
inquiry. I understand that it is difficult. In the meantime the

much earlier, in fact in the month of June this year, before the

with the Journals Branch on September 19, I was advised that 
nothing has been tabled concerning the Airbus affair.

to proceed.

	With regard to your specific point of order, a request that a letter

would ask the hon. member if he would appeal to the minister when 
the minister is back in the House and see if we can get some

	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of the Environment, Lib.)</B> 
moved that Bill C-29, an act to regulate interprovincial trade in and 
the importation for commercial purposes of certain manganese 
based substances, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, I am pleased that this House is giving 
final consideration to Bill C-29, the manganese based fuel 
additives act, because this is an important piece of legislation that 
should be dealt with on the basis of both merit and good common 
sense.
<P>
	I would ask my colleagues to view this legislation in the larger 
context. That context is as large as the great Canadian outdoors and 
as important as the air we all breathe.
<P>
	This government has made clean air a priority. We have already 
introduced tougher standards for vehicle emissions for the new 
model year that will help bring cleaner air to all our cities and 
towns.
<P>
	These new tail pipe emission standards for cars and trucks 
represent reductions over present standards of some 30 per cent of 
total exhaust hydrocarbons and 60 per cent of nitrogen oxide.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4680"> 4680 </A></B>
<P>
	The MMT legislation before us at third reading today is another 
important stepping stone in the prevention of air pollution. This 
should not be interpreted as the end of our campaign for cleaner air. 
We will be making more announcements on this issue in the days 
and weeks to come.
<P>
	When all these regulations and standards come into effect, 
Canadians will see the difference, smell the difference and breathe 
the difference.
<P>
	Furthermore, this package of government initiatives will result 
in billions of dollars in health benefits saved to Canadians and for 
our health care system. They will help prevent the pain and 
suffering of choking and gasping attacks on the young and the 
elderly when bad air days shroud our cities with a dirty blanket of 
pollution, which happens too often in many of our cities, 
particularly during the summer.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	Right now we have Bill C-29 before us, which I hope and trust 
will receive third and final reading from the House in a rather 
expeditious manner.
<P>
	I think it may be easier to wrap our minds around the common 
sense of the government's position than it is to wrap our tongues 
around the pronunciation of what MMT actually stands for. MMT 
is the commonly used acronym for a more tongue twisting name 
which simply put is a manganese based fuel additive. This additive 
is used to increase the octane rating of gasoline.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	MMT was first considered an alternative to lead in gasoline. It 
has been used in Canada since 1977. As the hon. members are 
aware, lead was gradually phased out of almost all fuels before 
1990.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The phase out has brought considerable improvement in our 
urban air quality. Today, almost every Canadian motorist uses 
MMT simply because Canadian refiners use MMT. The exact 
amount of this additive may vary from one batch of gasoline to 
another. In general, though, premium grade gasoline contains a 
higher volume of MMT than regular grade gasoline.
<P>
	However, it should be understood that MMT has always been 
controversial. In 1978 it was prohibited for use in unleaded 
gasoline in the United States because it was suspected then that the 
substance damaged emission control equipment.
<P>
	MMT is certain to have no place in the higher tech, cleaner fuels 
of the future. So Canada in a certain sense is compelled to confront 
the problem of MMT not because of some new environmental 
threat that has just emerged on the horizon, but because our fuels 
and monitoring devices used to counter environmental threats are 
simply getting more sophisticated. Cleaning up our air involves 
using cleaner fuels as well as having cleaner cars and trucks.
<P>
	While research has continued on the products that we put in our 
gas tanks it has also continued on our hardware, the engine that 
burns the fuel and the control equipment that lowers the emissions. 
Technological advances have steadily cut the harmful emissions 
coming  out of our tailpipes. In fact, since the early 1970s and the 
advent of national standards, over 90 per cent of the most noxious 
tailpipe pollutants have been removed.
<P>
	Now we have taken another major step forward with the 
introduction of sophisticated on board diagnostic systems.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	These systems are of great environmental significance. They 
control vehicle emissions and warn the driver of any operating 
defect so that the necessary repairs can be made.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	When used properly, they ensure that cleaner burning engines of 
today and of tomorrow operate as designed. They will also help 
warn drivers about proper maintenance needs that will result in 
decreased tailpipe emissions and improve fuel economy.
<P>
	This is a very important technology, but even more important is 
that it work, that it does its job properly as originally designed. 
That is where the problem arises when we talk about MMT. The 
automobile industry strongly warns that gasoline containing MMT 
clogs and jams up the operation of sophisticated on board 
diagnostic systems.
<P>
<B>(1540 )</B>
<P>
	Like many of us in this House, I have listened to the arguments 
and the debate from every conceivable side of this equation. I have 
read the science as well as the reports. The arguments and the 
debate for this legislation as well as against it, I suppose, would 
essentially fall into four distinct categories.
<P>
	First, there is the importance of a healthy environment. Second, 
there is the issue of Canadian fuels in the larger North American 
context. Third, there are the issues of consumer protection. Fourth, 
there is the economic impact of the proposals underlying Bill C-29.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	But for me, as Minister of the Environment, the driving force 
behind this bill is that a fuel additive with the potential to hinder 
the proper operation of pollution control systems will have indirect 
negative effects on the health of Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We cannot take chances with people's health. We cannot take 
chances with the air we breath. This is a precautionary principle 
that I and our government stand by strongly. This brings me to the 
main argument of my first point concerning the need for this 
legislation, the health of Canadians and a healthy environment.
<P>
	Transportation, specifically the automobile, is the single leading 
source of air pollution in our communities. When 21 auto 
manufacturers are convinced that MMT  clogs their pollution 
monitoring 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4681"> 4681 </A></B>
<P>
equipment, including on board diagnostic computers which alert 
the drivers to problems and pollution dangers, and when those 21 
auto makers petition and warn the government and members of 
Parliament about their concerns, it becomes clear for me and the 
government that we must heed that message seriously and respond 
in a responsible manner.
<P>
	Let us all remember there are some 14 million cars on Canada's 
roads, each pumping out over four tonnes of pollutants every single 
year it is on the road.
<P>
	Do we want to gamble with pollution monitoring devices in the 
backdrop of those kinds of statistics and facts? I think not. Nor does 
the government, especially when we realize that air pollution is 
linked to some health issues that are deadly serious.
<P>
	As for the additive MMT, we have received support and 
representations from a wide spectrum of Canadians and 
organizations, and not only the environmental organizations, 
legitimately so, that I happen to represent as a constituency. The 
spectrum has been much more varied than that.
<P>
	For instance, we have heard and been petitioned by the Canadian 
Institute of Child Health, the Asthma Information Association, the 
Learning Disabilities Association of Canada, the Ontario Public 
Health Association and the cities of North York and York public 
health departments and a litany of environmental organizations 
across the country.
<P>
	We have also received international letters of support and 
requests from south of the border and other origins as well. All of 
them advocate discontinuing the use of MMT in our gasoline 
because, simply put, the margins of safety are just too narrow.
<P>
	What are some of these groups saying? I read one letter from the 
Canadian Institute of Child Health and I was moved by one 
paragraph: ``It would be both scientifically and morally 
irresponsible to repeat our country's past experience with lead 
additives''.
<P>
<B>(1545 )</B>
<P>
	The Learning Disabilities Association of Canada noted with 
apparent anger that the corporation that fought against removing 
lead additives years ago is the same corporation fighting against 
removing MMT from gasoline.
<P>
	The Canadian Automobile Association said that MMT damages 
catalytic converters and coats oxygen sensors. The list goes on, as 
does the debate.
<P>
	We need to ask ourselves one fundamental question: what is the 
point of pushing for new technology? What is the point of the 
government pushing for new national emissions standards from our 
auto makers so that the air that Canadians breathe can be protected, 
if it is then going to allow the wrong fuel to be put in the tank? This 
fuel could gum up the technology and not reach the  standards that 
the government has set for the auto makers and that has been set for 
a modern, dynamic and caring kind of society?
<P>
	As I have already indicated, any potential health threat is and 
should be of prime concern to the government. For example in 
Toronto, the city that I have the honour of representing, in 1994, the 
last year for which statistics and full figures are available, there 
were about 40 days when the air condition at the very best was 
moderate and at the very worst was poor.
<P>
	As members of Parliament we hear about this. We may also have 
people in our families who feel these things. During such days 
asthmatics and especially asthmatic children because they breathe 
quicker than we adults are especially vulnerable. In fact the public 
health department in the city of North York said that it is especially 
concerned about the health of children because it knows from 
scientific evidence that children take in more manganese oxide 
than adults and eliminate it more slowly.
<P>
	Is it any surprise that we were shocked to read news reports this 
spring which noted a 20-year study by the health department of the 
Government of Canada had found that in the metropolitan Toronto 
area when pollution levels are high-for instance one of those 40 
days during 1994-two to three more Canadians died from heart 
and respiratory diseases.
<P>
	Environmentalists and others who extrapolate figures from 
government reports have estimated that air pollution, mostly smog, 
which comes in large measure from our automobiles and trucks, 
adds and extra $1 billion every year to Canada's health care costs.
<P>
	We have debates in this House about health care and we talk to 
Canadians who are worried about the affordability of health care. 
Are we to be indifferent to air quality when it has such a profound 
effect on Canadians and then it translates into $1 billion a year on 
our health care system? I hope not and I believe Canadians feel the 
same way.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Fifteen per cent of hospital admissions of infants for respiratory 
conditions are linked to ozone and sulphate pollution. We are living 
in an age when dangerous atmospheric pollutants, rather than 
hormones, are poisoning babies.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Consequently, if there is a possibility that MMT can cause 
problems with the technology that helps prevent pollution and 
sickness, put quite simply we cannot ignore such a threat. After all 
it was the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment that 
agreed on the need for cleaner vehicles and cleaner fuels.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4682"> 4682 </A></B>
<P>
	In fact, the CCME, not my department, issued a report on cleaner 
fuels and cleaner vehicles which recognized  that fuels and 
emission control technologies should be treated as an integrated 
system to reduce motor vehicle emissions.
<P>
<B>(1550 )</B>
<P>
	I believe very strongly that Bill C-29 is consistent with the 
approach laid down by all the governments and ministers of the 
environment. I urge all my provincial counterparts, in the name of 
positive and progressive harmonization, not blind harmonization, 
and for the sake of moving toward cleaner fuels and renewable 
fuels, to follow the lead of Canada's national government.
<P>
	Clearly this point should be put on the record. The approach 
represented by MMT legislation, brought forward today at third 
reading, is in keeping with a policy designed to encourage the 
development of renewable fuels such as ethanol. I am proud of 
being in a party that has championed ethanol. I am proud to be in a 
caucus with colleagues who would not give up the battle until they 
saw that the alternative became a reality.
<P>
	It is the government's national public policy and Canada's 
sovereign right to encourage alternative fuels, renewable fuels and 
cleaner fuels. It is a policy that the government will pursue 
aggressively and without any apology to anyone or any 
corporation.
<P>
	The second point that should be made concerns the United States 
situation and putting Canadian fuels and additives in a larger North 
American context. There has always been an argument that 
Canada's MMT legislation should be in harmony with the 
legislation in the United States and that the two should be a level 
playing field. It makes good economic and trade sense, in addition 
to common sense, that automobiles and trucks should be built with 
emission controls that work across the continent.
<P>
	Let us make no mistake. The trend for cleaner fuels in North 
America is away from the additive MMT not toward MMT. It is 
important that everyone understands that despite a recent United 
States court ruling on a technical procedural point and not one of 
substance that ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to 
allow MMT to be marketed as a gasoline additive in the United 
States, at least 15 of the largest petroleum companies in the United 
States have said that they do not intend to use MMT. That list 
includes almost every major petroleum producer: Amoco, Anchor, 
ARCO, BP, Chevron, Conoco, Exxon, Hess, Marathon, Mobil, 
Penzoil, Philips, Shell, Sun and Texaco. They will not use MMT.
<P>
	As well, health tests, as mandated by the United States 
regulations, will also continue on MMT. Again, on a health basis, 
the jury, despite the court ruling on a procedural technical aspect, is 
still out. If we do not believe we have enough evidence, about 
one-third of the United States market will use what is called 
reformulated gasoline, especially in areas that suffer from acute air  
pollution. Under the U.S. clean air act, MMT is not allowed in 
reformulated gasoline. It is prohibited by law.
<P>
	Finally, the state of California, a recognized trendsetter when it 
comes to emission controls, expressly prohibits the use of MMT 
additives in fuels. What does this mean? It means that the playing 
field is still not completely levelled. It also means that level 
playing field is just around the corner. There will be both 
MMT-laced and MMT-free fuels in the North American market.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	When all is said and done, currently the American market is 
approximately 85 per cent MMT-free. It is very obvious to this side 
of the House that when we talk about the larger North American 
context that MMT is going the same way as leaded gasoline. The 
legislation in Bill C-29 is in keeping with that trend. This is unlike 
my friends on the other side who want legislation which would 
somehow buck the trend toward alternative and cleaner fuels for 
our cars and trucks.
<P>
	The third point to remember in this debate is consumer 
protection.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We in Canada are faced with a conflict between two major 
industrial sectors: the automotive manufacturers and the petroleum 
industry. The automotive industry claims that MMT damages their 
products and forces solutions on them which might increase their 
price to the consumer.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	When the onboard diagnostics are gummed up by MMT, it is not 
the guys producing the automobiles in Windsor or the petroleum 
industry but the Canadian consumers-our constituents-who 
would have to carry extra warranty expenses. The auto dealers 
association spoke very clearly in its expression of similar concerns 
about MMT and car warranties.
<P>
	Aside from the cost factor of added trips to the garage for 
Canadian constituents, there will also be the perception that 
Canadian autos do not work well because the warning lights will 
always be blinking, not because of a malfunction, but because of a 
gasoline additive.
<P>
	Not only is there a health cost to be paid by Canadians if we 
continue to use MMT, but car owners will also be dipping into their 
pockets and into their purses a lot more often because of 
malfunctioning maintenance systems. Canadians do not need these 
unnecessary economic burdens foisted on them and this legislation 
will certainly help to prevent that from occurring.
<P>
	My fourth point concerns the overall economic impact that Bill 
C-29 would have on our country and on our refiners. The petroleum 
industry claims that MMT reduces nitrogen oxide 
emissions-perhaps the opposition critic will quote that-by up to 
20 per cent. I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4683"> 4683 </A></B>
<P>
say quite categorically that this figure is subject to much  dispute 
and much debate. In any case, alternatives to MMT exist.
<P>
	This legislation will allow the emission monitoring and control 
equipment to freely operate as it was designed: to prevent 
unnecessary vehicle maintenance. In this regard, it was not a study 
from my department but a study commissioned by the Canadian 
Council of Ministers of the Environment which concluded that the 
impact on Canada's refining industries would not be overly 
excessive. The study estimated that the cost for refiners to remove 
MMT for all of Canada would total $150 million in capital 
expenditures plus $50 million a year in added operating expenses.
<P>
	I would be prepared to admit that this will lead to an increase in 
the cost of gasoline and not a decrease. In pennies this translates to 
an increase in operating costs of .2 cents a litre for the refiners.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	Let us carry on that conversation. If we take an average Canadian 
motorist, statistics tell us that the motorist will travel 20,000 
kilometres in any given year, at a fuel consumption rate of some 10 
litres of gasoline for 100 kilometres travelled. The average 
motorist in a year will use about 2,000 litres of gasoline.
<P>
	If we apply what the refiners have told us it will cost them, .2 
cents a litre, and multiply that by the number of litres that an 
average Canadian motorist uses in a year, it translates to an extra $5 
per motorist per year.
<P>
	I would submit, with all due respect, without underestimating 
the costs that Canadians have on all sorts of things, that a $5 
increase per year for an average motorist is a reasonable price to 
pay for doing the right thing for their health and their environment. 
What does $5 mean?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It is a bargain.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchi:</B> A member says it is a bargain. He is absolutely 
right. On Labour Day weekend, when Canadians were getting into 
their cars, their trucks or on to their motorcycles going to close the 
cottage or visit family and friends, the average increase in gasoline 
prices at the pumps was anywhere between 2 and 4 cents per litre. 
If a person's mother-in-law lived far away they would almost make 
up the five buck increase in one weekend. It happens every holiday 
weekend. It will probably happen Thanksgiving weekend. It will 
happen at Christmas and New Year's. People grumble and 
complain and ask why the gasoline goes up when people are on the 
move the most.
<P>
	The hon. member from London is absolutely right when he says 
that $5 is a fair price. He is also right when he says, in contrast to 
other increases at the pumps, that it actually becomes a bargain for 
Canadians when we think of environmental and health issues as 
well.
<P>
	When we talk about the economic impact, there are also the 
financial benefits which one has to work into the equation. It is not 
only the negatives that the petroleum industry talks about, although 
as our mathematics show it is not as negative as that. We have to 
work in the financial benefits. The petroleum industry oftentimes 
conveniently forgets about the benefits.
<P>
	In the 1994 study commissioned by the CCME, it estimated 
health benefits of up to $31 billion over 23 years if cleaner fuels 
and more stringent vehicle emission standards were put in place. 
Put another way, the cost to Canadians in extra health costs, in pain, 
suffering and death, could be pared down by almost $1.5 billion a 
year, depending on whatever comes out of the tailpipes of our cars 
or trucks.
<P>
	If this debate were only an economic ledger sheet, which it is 
not, the economic plus in taking MMT out of gasoline is clearly 
and convincingly a lot higher than the economic minus in leaving it 
in.
<P>
	As Liberals we know that the ultimate decision underlying Bill 
C-29 is not just about economics, even though the economics 
comes out on our side, for Canadians expect us to do what we can 
to protect their health and to preserve the environment. They also 
expect us to protect consumers and Canadian automotive 
technology.
<P>
	I am surprised at the indifference of the Government of Ontario, 
which locates the big three, which suggests that it is on an air 
campaign, which talks about the IJC and the air coming from the 
United States. I am flabbergasted that the province of Ontario and 
that the new minister in Ontario have been absolutely silent on this 
issue. It prefers to sit on the fence rather than take the right 
decision. If one could be allowed to boast about Ontario's 
economy, the reliance on our automotive industry, I think it was, as 
my colleagues say, a shame for the indifference and the silence that 
the Government of Ontario has demonstrated.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	It is for all those reasons, a healthy environment, the need to 
promote cleaner fuels and alternative fuels, the trend to North 
American harmonization, consumer protection and the economic 
pluses, that there is little doubt as to why this legislation is 
necessary. The absolute bottom line is that Canadians want to 
breathe their air. They do not want to chew it. They do not want to 
filter it. They do not want to cleanse it. They certainly do not want 
to scrub it. They want to breathe it and they want to breathe it 
freely.
<P>
	This bill will most definitely help in this basic desire. I urge all 
members of this House to give speedy passage to what is a good 
bill in the interests of all Canadians.
<P>

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
once again we are considering the bill to regulate interprovincial 
trade in and the importation for commercial purposes of certain 
manganese-based substances. The purpose of this bill is to prohibit 
the use of MMT as a fuel additive.
<P>
	Bill C-29 before the House today is a reincarnation of Bill C-94, 
which died on the Order Paper when Parliament was prorogued. 
The government nevertheless found a way to resurrect a number of 
bills, including Bill C-29, which has now come back to us for third 
reading. Bill C-94 did not make it through all stages during the 
previous Parliament because someone put on the brakes. For some 
rather vague, unspecified reasons, the Liberals decided not to pass 
this bill at the time. Today, the Liberals, headed by the Minister of 
the Environment, have brought the bill back to the House without 
providing any further clarification of those reasons. The same 
doubts remain, the same questions persist and the same issues are 
being raised.
<P>
	One wonders about the real reason why the Minister of the 
Environment insists on passing a bill that arouses such controversy. 
You may be sure that the lobbies from Ontario are a major factor in 
the minister's decision. If that is not the case, he should come out 
and say so.
<P>
	This bill has two major industries warring against each other. On 
one side we have the Ethyl Corporation, which produces MMT, 
supported by the oil industry, and on the other side the association 
of automobile manufacturers.
<P>
	The lobbying done by these two players is considerable and 
unceasing. Both groups are leaving no stone unturned to win their 
case. The minister was exposed to all this lobbying and seemed to 
be at a loss at what to do so far. And today, he brings back C-29. 
The minister probably feels he should show up from time to time. 
So far, however, his legislative menu has been pretty meagre, and 
the same applies to what he has achieved.
<P>
	We can hardly say the present minister is handling major issues 
these days. The environment is losing popularity, and the minister 
seems to be increasingly isolated within cabinet. Aside from a short 
visit to the Gulf of St. Lawrence this summer to watch the 
refloating of the <I>Irving Whale</I>, the minister is not seen very often, 
because he has no important issues on his plate. So to make an 
appearance in Parliament and not disappear altogether, the minister 
brings back Bill C-29.
<P>
	If you ask me, this is not the way to go about increasing one's 
visibility. The minister would do well to go back to the drawing 
board and do his homework on the whole MMT issue.
<P>
	The former Minister of the Environment, which she was in name 
only, in my opinion, if we consider her very mediocre record, made 
a present of this rather hot potato to her successor.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	And he is no surer of his fact than his predecessor. That is the 
problem with this bill.
<P>
	The government is not sure that banning MMT is a good thing, 
whether in environment, economic or legal terms.
<P>
	The fault here rests mainly with the former minister, the minister 
of broken promises. At the time, the minister had asked both 
industries to work together to find a solution to the MMT problem, 
indicating-which was not very clever-that in the event a basis of 
agreement could not be found, she would put forward a bill to ban 
MMT.
<P>
	From then on, it was clear that the negotiations were strongly 
biased and would be unproductive. So much for the former 
minister's fantastic skills as a maestro.
<P>
	Another rather surprising aspect of this issue is the need for a 
Minister of the Environment to pass legislation regarding a given 
commercial product, in this case MMT.
<P>
	If the minister firmly believes that MMT is a health hazard, why 
does he not just ban this substance under the Canadian 
Environmental Protection Act? Why take this roundabout way, 
through commercial or trade legislation?
<P>
	There is no scientific evidence that MMT in fuel constitutes a 
health hazard. Studies on the neurotoxicity of manganese have 
been conducted and indeed show that a health risk exists. However, 
these results were obtained for major exposure to manganese, for 
workers exposed to very large concentrations and for prolonged 
periods.
<P>
	It is therefore difficult to see the connection between the effect 
of overexposure and the effect of manganese emissions from car 
exhaust, the amount and concentration of which are not 
comparable.
<P>
	The former Minister of the Environment, whose departure was 
noted-almost as a relief-by the Canadian Council of Ministers 
of the Environment, had used harmonization with the U.S. as an 
argument to justify introducing this bill. Since then, and as early as 
first and second reading, this argument has taken a dive. While the 
product had been banned for more than 15 years south of our 
border, the Ethyl Corporation, involved in a long-standing battle 
over this issue, was winning its case to have the product 
reintroduced in several American states. All this to say that 
harmonization with our neighbours to the south does not weigh 
very much in the balance.
<P>
	We could ask ourselves the following question: What would 
happen if MMT was produced in Canada? What  would happen 
with Bill C-29, which does not ban the use of MMT per se, but does 
ban its import? If MMT were produced, say in Ontario, would the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4685"> 4685 </A></B>
<P>
minister take the same action? He could certainly not ban the 
import of MMT. Would he then prohibit the product itself?
<P>
	This is the point I made earlier about the strange way the 
environment minister is targeting this additive. He is attacking the 
sale of the product, not the product itself. And what about the 
prohibition against provincial trade in this product?
<P>
	You will agree that the minister is acting in a strange manner on 
this issue. His predecessor did the same and she goofed in many 
other issues.
<P>
	This bill is clearly in response to the representations made by the 
automobile industry, which claims that the MMT additive hinders 
the functioning of anti-pollution systems, including the OBD-2 
system. The purpose of the OBD-2 is to detect any malfunctioning 
in the exhaust systems. The automobile industry claims that MMT 
can trigger the illumination of a red light on the panel, thus 
indicating the existence of a problem, when in fact there is no 
problem.
<P>
	Consequently, the car owner would have to go to a garage to 
have a non-existent problem corrected, which has generated 
unnecessary costs to the consumer. The red light that comes on for 
no reason was one of the automobile industry's last arguments. 
Before that, the industry had claimed that MMT had an adverse 
effect on oxygen probes, spark plugs, catalysts, etc.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	In fact, none of the points raised by the automobile lobby are 
supported by scientific evidence. The auto industry was never able 
to come up with serious studies supporting its claims.
<P>
	Based on our information, the automobile industry is currently 
conducting tests to see if, indeed, MMT has all these negative 
consequences for anti-pollution systems. Would it not be better for 
the minister to wait for the results of these tests, so that car makers 
can finally support their claims?
<P>
	Car makers have also threatened to impose on Canadian 
consumers a $3,000 increase in the cost of automobiles, to reduce 
the coverage provided by the warranty, and to simply disconnect 
the OBD-2 detection device. This pressure exerted on the minister 
has paid off. However, it should be noted that they have more to do 
with economics than with health or environment concerns.
<P>
	Ethyl Corp. is the only one to have provided the results of tests 
conducted on its product. The company conducted serious, 
independent tests, in co-operation with the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency, the EPA. The results of these tests totally 
contradict the claims made by car makers. In fact, the EPA itself  
recognized that the concerns of the automobile industry regarding 
the clogging of anti-pollution systems are not justified.
<P>
	Given the results of serious tests conducted by one party and the 
unfounded claims made by the other, you will agree that it is 
difficult to support this bill. The MMT lobby was the only to 
provide data. We are anxiously waiting for the automobile lobby to 
do the same. In the meantime, is it appropriate to pass this bill? If 
the tests of the auto lobby revealed that MMT does not cause the 
claimed effects, will the environment minister change course and 
remove the ban on MMT?
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is definitely concerned about this metal that 
is being added to gasoline. We are not indifferent to the issue. We 
too, of course, want to see 100 per cent clean fuel and cars that do 
not release emissions into the air we all breathe. In this regard, if 
the automobile industry truly wants to produce cars that are 100 per 
cent clean and emission free, why does it not build cars that use 
electricity or, better yet, water?
<P>
	You will agree that it is somewhat difficult to follow the logic of 
the automobile industry regarding MMT when the automobile 
itself uses fossil fuels and is therefore one of the greatest sources of 
pollution on the planet. While we are at it, the automobile industry 
should be true to its own logic and also ban the use of gasoline in 
cars.
<P>
	I would just like to digress briefly at this point to talk about the 
Liberals' failure in this area. Members will recall that in 1994 
Senator Kenny introduced a bill to reduce smog and greenhouse 
gas emissions. This bill was passed in June 1995 and concerned the 
entire government fleet of vehicles.
<P>
	The bill requires the government to phase out these vehicles with 
vehicles using an alternative fuel, such as propane or natural gas, 
and, by April 1997, that half of new vehicles bought must use 
alternative fuels.
<P>
	The results to date are nonexistent. The Liberal government has 
not implemented this bill. Furthermore, the Senate recently 
denounced the government's slow progress in converting its 
vehicles. What is the environment minister doing about this? Can 
he not get his own government to do its duty and thus set an 
example?
<P>
	I would like, if I may, to cite a passage from the report of the 
Senate committee that looked at the progress made in the 
implementation of Bill S-7. I quote: ``The committee is of the 
opinion that one of the obstacles to the rapid conversion to vehicles 
using alternative fuels in automobile fleets is that members of the 
federal cabinet do not seem to be leading the way. Ministers should 
preach by example and have their cars converted. In fact, all 
ministers received offers of conversion from methane and propane 
suppliers. To date, only three have taken advantage of these offers. 
The 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4686"> 4686 </A></B>
<P>
committee urges the  others to follow their example in order to 
underscore the importance the government attaches to this bill''.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	In light of such comments, it is difficult to detect any real resolve 
on the part of the Liberals with respect to air pollution. I find it 
paradoxical to say that MMT must be banned because it is a source 
of pollution, and yet do nothing oneself to reduce this same source 
of pollution. That is Liberal logic for you. Hard to follow, you will 
agree.
<P>
	I draw your attention to the environment minister's press release 
from last April 18, in which he announces that the bill will be 
tabled again. In the fourth paragraph, the minister states, and I 
quote: ``Of importance to me, as the Minister of the Environment, 
are the potential harmful effects on air quality of the interference of 
MMT with automobile diagnostic systems monitoring exhaust 
emissions''.
<P>
	What strikes me in this paragraph are the words ``potential 
harmful effects''. Let us admit that it is hardly a strong case for 
legislation. Can a bill seriously be tabled using words like 
``potential''?
<P>
	In this business of MMT, where we must base our decisions on 
scientific data, the minister's choice of words is vague to say the 
least. This shows the government's spinelessness and hesitation 
where this bill is concerned.
<P>
	This press release goes along with an information sheet in which 
we are informed of the five key points on which the minister has 
based his decision. The first concerns the automotive industry. Of 
course, the minister rehashes all the same old stuff from the 
automotive lobby about the harmful effects of MMT on pollution 
control devices, particularly the diagnostic systems commonly 
called OBDs, and about how this in turn results in increased 
atmospheric pollution and health hazards.
<P>
	All of these real impacts end up as mere statements. At the end it 
is written down in black and white that the automotive industry is 
so convinced of the negative effects of MMT that it is currently 
involved in a test program in the U.S. at the cost of $10 million, in 
order to obtain definitive proof to back their position.
<P>
	That statement takes some of the wind out of the sails of the auto 
lobby, and of the minister as well. No test completed as yet, no 
definitive proof either. I am not the one saying this, the Minister 
himself is. How, then, can the minister table Bill C-29 while the 
auto lobby cannot as yet, as I have just said, prove its argument? 
We must admit that this is not a very effective approach for a 
Minister of the Environment to take.
<P>
	This is a source of concern, for the minister and the government 
are showing that lobbies hold more weight for them than concrete 
evidence, verified facts, and definite results. That is not, however, 
any real surprise.  We all know how those people across the way 
operate, and where their motivation comes from.
<P>
	We have seen how, in many other sectors, the most powerful 
lobbies gain the upper hand over their little Liberal buddies. The 
minister has also been pressured by another group in this matter: 
the Ontario Corn Producers Association. This group wrote to the 
minister on April 24, as follows:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``The Ontario Corn Producers Association with a membership of 
21,000 Ontario farm families congratulates you for your decision 
to reintroduce proposed legislation to ban the importation of MMT 
for use in Canadian gasoline''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Further on we read that other, more environmental octane 
enhancers exist, including ethanol. As you know, ethanol is now 
being used and is produced from corn, hence Ontario's eagerness to 
congratulate the minister and to see MMT prohibited. Imagine the 
size of the new market for ethanol if MMT were to disappear.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	I would say this is of major importance for Ontario farmers and 
the processing industry that would develop as a result.
<P>
	If I remember correctly, in December 1994, the former Minister 
of the Environment and the Minister of Agriculture launched a 
development program to encourage the production of ethanol from 
biomass material. In fact, the major projects for the construction of 
plants to produce ethanol from corn are all in Ontario, if I am not 
mistaken. And as the ministers said on December 21, 1994, in a 
press release, ethanol offers an excellent opportunity to diversify 
the economy and stimulate economic growth. It opens up a vast 
market for agricultural products, thereby increasing the incomes of 
farmers and making them less dependent on farm income 
protection programs.
<P>
	I would not want to question the motives of the present minister 
nor those of the former minister, who resigned and has just returned 
to the House, saved by the voters of Hamilton East, but there are 
some strange coincidences in this dossier. The two main economic 
lobbies, automobile manufacturers and corn ethanol 
manufacturers, are from Ontario, and the two ministers who have 
been involved in this issue happen to be from Ontario as well.
<P>
	Is there a connection? As I said earlier, the Liberals are very 
sensitive to lobbying. Unfortunately, there is still no product like 
SPF 35 sun cream, for instance, to protect us from lobbying. Also it 
is becoming increasingly clear that both ministers have met the 
expectations of lobbies from their own province. We need look no 
further.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4687"> 4687 </A></B>
<P>
	For instance, under key item 5 of the minister's information 
sheet, which is headed: ``Possibilities for cleaner fuels'', it says 
that the withdrawal of MMT from gasoline will create 
opportunities for the introduction and use of ethanol and other 
substitutes that may become a major component of a 
comprehensive national policy on the nationwide production and 
use of renewable energy sources. This policy, we read, would 
reflect the commitment made in the red book of the Liberal Party 
of Canada to an agricultural policy that would eliminate MMT, 
and it would be in line with U.S. federal policy designed to create 
new markets for renewable fuels such as ethanol.
<P>
	No need to look any further to see what the Liberals have in 
mind. Ontario will be the great beneficiary of the withdrawal of 
MMT. That is crystal clear. The minister also indicated that this 
will be in line with the promises made in the red book. So now we 
have a political decision.
<P>
	I agree that ethanol seems to be a useful additive. But ethanol 
produced from corn also bears a major economic and 
environmental cost. From the environmental point of view, corn is 
a crop that causes considerable pollution and soil depletion. 
Economically speaking, the cost of production is high. Consider 
that today, the federal government provides an excise tax 
exemption of 8.5 cents per litre on ethanol sold on the market to 
make this product competitive. Some provinces have followed suit, 
including Onta-rio.
<P>
	These negative aspects are never mentioned by the Minister of 
the Environment. A crop that causes pollution and depletes the soil 
should give the Minister of the Environment some cause for alarm. 
I think the minister should consult people on these negative aspects 
of using corn. Can you imagine a Minister of the Environment 
being in favour of a crop that pollutes?
<P>
	This bill still raises a number of questions. But instead of finding 
the answer to these questions, the minister prefers to blindly 
accommodate the lobbies from his province. What will the minister 
do when automobile manufacturers who, I may remind him, want 
gas that is 100 per cent pure, ask him to prohibit ethanol as an 
additive? Will he come and tell us that ethanol is a hazard to our 
health and that it contaminates antipollution systems in cars? The 
withdrawal of MMT as an additive will indeed have certain 
consequences.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	According to the Ethyl Corporation and the oil industry, there 
will be three major consequences, which I will list for you without 
blindly considering them. We in the official opposition have some 
reservations about the lobby group's arguments. We certainly 
would not want to fall in the same trap as the minister, who, 
influenced by the other lobby group, has lacked foresight and 
rigour in this matter.
<P>
	First of all, according to Ethyl, MMT reduces smog-causing 
nitrogen dioxide emissions by 20 per cent. If MMT really reduces 
urban smog, why would we want to remove it from gasoline?
<P>
	Of course, the auto industry tells us that cars will pollute even 
less in the future and that improved performances will more than 
make up for the loss of current MMT benefits. Of course, 
department officials told us that the urban smog problem was not as 
bad in Canadian cities. But who is telling the truth?
<P>
	Another consequence of MMT's removal is that refineries will 
require costly modifications. According to the oil companies, these 
adjustment costs combined with other operating costs will raise the 
price of gas at the pumps. The oil companies' assessments show 
some $100 million in capital costs and tens of millions of dollars in 
operating costs. Can we ask the oil industry to make such changes 
to their refineries to respond to the other party's claims, which are 
not based on any scientific evidence?
<P>
	Can the minister seriously initiate all these changes simply to 
increase his visibility and respond to the pressures exerted by his 
province? I know that the Minister of the Environment and his 
Liberal colleagues, who are blindly following him in this matter, 
will accuse us of being impertinent, of being anti-health, of 
objecting to the reduction of air pollution. They can shout 
themselves hoarse and say whatever they want about us, we do not 
care.
<P>
	If MMT is so harmful, the Liberals should ban it as a hazardous 
product. The Liberals are saying that MMT is harmful so they 
should act accordingly and ban the product itself.
<P>
	The third consequence we must look at has to do with the oil 
refining process. MMT increases the octane level in gas, thus 
requiring less oil refining. We know that refining causes pollution. 
So, if MMT is removed, the oil companies will have to do more 
refining in order to increase the octane level and will therefore 
cause more pollution. Is the minister ready to contribute to the 
increase in direct pollution caused by refineries? Are the Liberals, 
who are trumpeting their health concerns, ready to increase 
pollution?
<P>
	The question the Liberals should ask themselves is whether it is 
more important to create a market for Ontario corn or to consider 
the economic, agricultural and environmental impact of this bill 
seriously and rigorously. They should carefully determine if the 
expected benefits will indeed be achieved, check and quantify these 
benefits, and align them in two columns for comparison purposes. 
At present, the Liberals are going nowhere. It may be for the best, 
but it is not very responsible.
<P>
	These are claims made by the MMT lobby that still raise 
questions, and these questions warrant the  minister's undivided 
attention. But the minister prefers to bury his head in the sand, just 
like the Deputy Prime Minister did before him. The minister keeps 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4688"> 4688 </A></B>
<P>
repeating that MMT is a health hazard, while Health Canada 
assures us that it does not represent a significant hazard to human 
health.
<P>
	In the September 12 issue of <I>La Presse</I>, the Minister of the 
Environment was quoted as saying the following. ``But the 
Government of Canada can act as well to protect the environment 
and public heath.'' I will remind the minister that, on December 6, 
1994, Health Canada published the results of an independent risk 
assessment based on new epidemiological studies and data on 
exposure in Canada entitled: ``Risk assessment for the combustion 
products of MMT in gasoline''.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	Health Canada's study concluded that there was no health risk 
for any segment of the Canadian population associated with the use 
of MMT in fuel. More specifically, it was reported that: ``Airborne 
manganese resulting from the combustion of MMT in 
gasoline-powered vehicles is not introduced in the Canadian 
environment in amounts or under conditions that would pose a 
health risk.''
<P>
	The study also concluded that no relationship exists between 
ambient air manganese levels and MMT sales or its use in unleaded 
fuel, regardless of the region or the time of year.
<P>
	What else does the Minister of the Environment want to tell us 
about the adverse health effects of MMT, when Health Canada says 
that there are no adverse effects? He should consult his colleague, 
the health minister, provided of course he is not even more isolated 
than he is believed to be in Cabinet. The Minister of Health could 
run over the findings of theses studies for him, to refresh his 
memory so that he can finally tell us why he really wants this bill 
passed.
<P>
	There is no shame in backtracking for a minister. Again, his 
colleague could remind him of his own experience with the famous 
issue of cheese made from raw milk.
<P>
	To fuel the controversy about this bill, on September 10, the 
American parent company Ethyl Corporation gave notice of its 
intention to file a complaint and have the Government of Canada 
pay the company US$200 million under NAFTA for damages 
sustained by its subsidiary Ethyl Canada.
<P>
	Ethyl argues that Canada is not fulfilling its obligations under 
the North American Free Trade Agreement. According to Ethyl 
Corp., Canada does not comply with Articles 1110, 1106 and 1102, 
which deal respectively with expropriation, compensation, 
performance requirements and national treatment.
<P>
	Ethyl Corp. is seeking US$200 million US in compensation, and 
the minister seems to take it lightly, saying that the government of 
Canada has the right to take measures to protect the environment 
and public health and that the company is entitled to its opinion. If I 
were the minister I would quickly put Bill C-29 on hold, at least for 
a while, and I would have in-depth discussions with my legal 
advisors, to make sure that Canada is in a strong bargaining 
position and can win its case.
<P>
	The minister seems rather casual and nonchalant about the 
company's intention to sue. At a time when cuts are being made to 
the health, welfare and UI sectors, the minister should ask himself 
whether Canada has the means to throw away US$200 million. 
Should Canada lose its case before the arbitration tribunal, how 
would the minister justify his bill, which looks more and more like 
a measure designed to favour a specific interest group? Would he 
send the bill to car makers, or to corn producers in his province?
<P>
	Canadian taxpayers have a right to expect fair and rigorous 
decisions on the part of their ministers, not partisan choices that 
could cost them a great deal.
<P>
	NAFTA is not the only agreement that would be violated by Bill 
C-29. The whole issue of interprovincial trade is also affected, 
since Bill C-29 prohibits such trade. Some provincial ministers feel 
this is a case of federal interference. Bill C-29 would also 
contravene the federal-provincial agreement on trade in Canada.
<P>
	In fact, no less than six provinces openly oppose this measure. 
Can the minister turn a blind eye to the provinces' appeals, when 
his cabinet colleagues are extolling the virtues of the federation and 
of co-operation in this country? Is the Minister of the Environment 
that isolated in cabinet, when it comes to this issue?
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	The minister's decision to go ahead with Bill C-29 has no solid 
basis. His arguments are not supported by any scientific evidence. 
The minister naively but willingly relies on the claims made by car 
makers, and on the hope that the anticipated income growth of his 
province's corn producers who, coincidentally, account for three 
quarters of Canada's corn production, will materialize. The 
minister's decision is also a source of concern for the future. It is 
not reassuring, for the future and for the environment, when an 
environment minister who has access to all the tools of a 
department is so lax regarding a major issue.
<P>
	I will conclude by tabling an amendment to the bill. I propose:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the word ``That'' and 
substituting the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``Bill C-29, An Act to regulate interprovincial trade in and the importation for 
commercial purposes of certain manganese-based substances, be not now read a 
third time but that it be read a third time this day six months hence.''</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4689"> 4689 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The 
amendment is in order. Resuming debate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak on Bill C-29 but it is also 
unfortunate in many ways.
<P>
	I thought this bill would have been terminated in the last 
Parliament because there is so much contention surrounding this 
issue. Contrary to what the hon. minister said today, there is ample 
evidence to support that banning MMT in Canada is really a 
spurious attempt to do something that should not occur. MMT has 
not been proven to be damaging to onboard diagnostic devices, the 
health of Canadians or the environment. I will discuss this a little 
later.
<P>
	This bill is very interesting. I will destroy the credibility of the 
government with regard to this bill. I will demonstrate that the 
comments made today by members of the government, both in 
question period and in debate, conflict greatly with what they have 
said previously and with what they really believe on this matter.
<P>
	The banning of MMT is supported by a strong automaker lobby 
group in the previous Minister of the Environment's constituency, 
and that is the real driving force behind the bill. It is not based on 
scientific fact. It is not based on any fact at all; it has been done on 
a whim. The minister has been lobbied strongly for this by the 
automobile manufacturers and it is obvious the auto manufacturers 
have won.
<P>
	It is my impression that Bill C-94 was not drafted in the same 
manner as other bills. Rather, it was drafted on a whim.
<P>
<B>(1645 )</B>
<P>
	The previous minister did not give a comprehensive analysis to 
all the stakeholders, especially the hapless consumer. The previous 
minister had no conclusive evidence whatsoever that MMT was 
harmful to cars or to humans. All she was going on were the words 
of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors, the big three. It is a sorry 
state of affairs when the big three, the industry, can actually push a 
bill through this House.
<P>
	After the bill's introduction, the previous minister proceeded to 
hold a press conference where she informed reporters that the 
reason for banning MMT was because it caused problems with 
onboard diagnostic systems to all new automobiles. However, this 
was not the only reason the minister proceeded to ban the trade on 
MMT. She stated that Canada was one of the only countries in the 
world to still be using MMT in unleaded gasoline and that this 
should change.
<P>
	As a member of this House and as a representative of Canadians 
in my riding, it is important that we weigh and pursue every 
available option to come up with accurate  and scientific based 
conclusions before we create legislation on any topic. What is 
needed on these technical matters is the best that science can offer. 
The Liberal government can call itself responsible, but I ask 
whether it is really responsible to take the words of a few 
automobile manufacturers over the words of hard, scientific 
evidence which demonstrates that MMT does not pose a health 
hazard to Canadians? What I will demonstrate later on is that it is 
going to do the exact opposite.
<P>
	We know that the bill was introduced last year and MMT was 
still not permitted at that time in the United States. The minister 
has stated today quite unequivocally that his goal is to harmonize 
gasoline with the situation south of the border. That is a very 
reasonable thing to do, but why are we attempting to harmonize our 
gasoline by banning a substance that is being reintroduced in the 
United States? Does this make sense? No, it does not make sense.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchi:</B> That is false.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> The minister is 
saying this is false, yet he knows full well that the United States, I 
think it was in October 1995, stated unequivocally that MMT does 
not pose a health hazard to people, is not damaging to onboard 
devices and therefore ought to be allowed. In fact, this proves that 
it is going to actually improve the environment by limiting the 
amount of nitrous oxide emissions in the air.
<P>
	I would be very interested to know the evidence the minister has, 
if he has any, to prove contrary to what I am saying in the House 
today.
<P>
	To look at the history, in 1977 Congress made some amendments 
to the clean air act, which the minister referred to earlier today. One 
amendment dealt with the emergence of catalytic converters in 
automobiles. I want to read what the courts stated about the effect it 
would have on MMT. As catalytic converters could not be used 
with leaded fuels, their adoption had led to a sharp rise in the use of 
MMT as an octane booster and Congress responded to the concern 
that it and other fuel additives might harm the effectiveness of 
these converters. That was their belief back in the 1970s.
<P>
	Congress however directed the EPA to grant a waiver once it was 
determined that the additive would not cause or contribute to the 
failure of an emission control device or system. The EPA 
deliberately stalled on making a decision until the courts instructed 
them to do the testing. On November 30, 1993 the EPA found that 
MMT ``did not cause or contribute to the failure of emission 
control systems''. However, not wanting to be outdone by the 
courts, the EPA denied the waiver on the grounds that the 
manufacturer, Ethyl, had not yet established an absence of health 
effects, another very reasonable conclusion.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4690"> 4690 </A></B>
<P>
	The courts wrangled until about October 20, 1995 when the 
United States Court of Appeal in the case of Ethyl Corporation 
v. the Administrator of the United States, EPA, ruled: ``We order 
the EPA to register MMT for use as an additive in unleaded 
gasoline as of November 30, 1993''. Therefore, they proved that 
MMT did not show any adverse health effects. That is a very 
important point.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	What is significant with this ruling is not that Ethyl won and 
MMT could be sold in the U.S. in unleaded gasoline by the year 
end, but rather it is the process which was undertaken by Congress 
and the EPA. They did not approve of MMT in unleaded fuels until 
it was proven that MMT was not a health risk and that it was not 
damaging onboard devices, which are the two concerns the 
minister expressed today. They are the same concerns which we 
have in the Reform Party. They are the same concerns which have 
been disproved by studies undertaken in the United States.
<P>
	When the bill was introduced in May, both the environment 
minister and the industry minister said that eliminating MMT from 
our gasoline was essential in order to achieve a North American 
harmonization of fuel. Yet as I have previously said, the United 
States has now brought MMT back into play.
<P>
	The minister said that 85 per cent of the fuel in the United States 
was MMT free. That is probably so, but let us not forget that MMT 
was banned until the end of 1995. One could also say that from the 
end of 1995 until now, MMT has been reintroduced into the 
American fuel system and has occupied 15 per cent of the total 
volume.
<P>
	Both ministers were confident that the ban on MMT would 
remain in the United States. In May 1995 the environment minister 
was asked during question period about the fact that the courts 
would probably rule in Ethyl's favour. The Deputy Prime 
Minister's response at that time was: ``I advise the hon. member 
that last week when I had the opportunity to speak with Carol 
Browner, head of the EPA, she reaffirmed the U.S. commitment not 
to allow MMT. She decried the fact that there is only one country, 
Canada, that still allows MMT and we intend to change that''.
<P>
	The Minister of Industry has in fact gone further than his 
colleague. He said last April during question period that the key is 
to have uniformity of standards between the U.S. and Canada. He 
said: ``The member will know that MMT is not permitted in the 
United States by legislation. It is crucial that we have uniformity of 
standards''.
<P>
	If we are trying to create uniformity of standards, why are we 
banning MMT which is now being reintroduced in the United 
States? We are in fact going backward in time to create disharmony 
in our fuel.
<P>
	The Minister of Industry also clearly stated on the record that it 
is important for U.S. and Canadian gasolines to have the same 
composite harmonization. I would suggest we have proven today 
that the government is very confused in what it means by 
harmonization.
<P>
	When the EPA attempted to ban MMT it mistakenly believed it 
was harmful. The Liberal government wants to ban it not on 
substance, but rather on the basis of importation and 
interprovincial trade. Why can it not be banned in Canada? The 
reason it cannot be banned in this country is because it is 
understood that MMT is not a health hazard to people.
<P>
	If we were going to be genuine about banning this substance, if 
we truly believed it was a substance which was harmful to 
Canadians, then we would ban it under that premise. The 
government is not pursuing that course because it understands that 
the scientific facts demonstrate very clearly that MMT is not a 
health hazard. Therefore, the government is taking this roundabout 
way of trying to ban the importation and interprovincial trade of 
MMT. It is very disingenuous.
<P>
	The minister had every opportunity to let this bill die yet did not, 
even knowing full well that there was an extensive amount of 
opposition within his own party, in the backbenches, and even 
within cabinet. In a moment I am going to reveal a very interesting 
letter from the Minister for International Trade.
<P>
	The Minister for International Trade sent a letter to the Minister 
of the Environment which was dated February 23, 1996. The letter 
reads:
<P>
<B>(1655 )</B>
<P>
	``Dear Minister of the Environment: I understand that you are 
considering the reintroduction of Bill C-94 in the upcoming 
session. My department continues to have certain reservations 
concerning this measure which I wish to draw to your attention.
<P>
	``One of the original arguments that favoured the ban on MMT 
was that the U.S. already prohibited its use as a petroleum additive. 
Recently the U.S. Court of Appeal overturned the U.S. ban.''-And 
this is very important-``This has effectively removed 
harmonization arguments in support of Bill C-94''.
<P>
	I will repeat that because it is what the Minister for International 
Trade said to the Minister of the Environment: The U.S. Court of 
Appeal has overturned the ban and it has removed the 
harmonization argument that the Minister of the Environment has 
been speaking about at length today.
<P>
	The letter goes on to say: ``An important prohibition on MMT 
would be inconsistent with Canada's obligations under the World 
Trade Organization and the North American Free Trade 
Agreement. It would constitute an impermissible prohibition on 
imports particularly if domestic production, sale or use is not  
similarly prohibited. It could not be justified on health or 
environmental grounds given current scientific evidence''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4691"> 4691 </A></B>
<P>
	The Minister for International Trade has told the Minister of the 
Environment that MMT cannot be banned because it is not a health 
hazard and MMT cannot be banned because it does not prove to be 
a risk to the environment and that it will not harmonize gasoline in 
North America.
<P>
	In conclusion the minister said: ``Let me stress my department's 
belief that Bill C-94 should not be reintroduced as it could have 
many adverse implications for Canadian trade without 
compensatory environmental benefits''.
<P>
	What the Minister for International Trade said is completely 
contrary to what the same minister said today in question period. 
Today he is supporting the bill giving an argument exactly counter 
to what is stated in his letter to the Minister of the Environment. 
That is hypocrisy. It cannot be both ways.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Order. It is my 
duty pursuant to Standing Order 38 to inform the House that the 
questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as 
follows: The hon. member for Rosedale, Canada pension plan; the 
hon. member for Bourassa, Immigration and Refugee Board.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> CEPA was designed 
specifically to ban harmful substances. In order to add a substance 
to the schedule of banned substances under CEPA, it must be 
shown by Health Canada that the substance is hazardous to the 
health of Canadians, but it has been shown that it is not a health 
hazard. Health Canada reports that its analyses indicate that the 
combustion products of MMT in gasoline do not represent an 
added health risk to the Canadian population, period, end of story. 
MMT is not harmful to Canadians according to Health Canada. I 
would be very happy to share that report with the minister if he is 
interested.
<P>
	From the very beginning we in the Reform Party have 
unequivocally stated that we would support banning MMT if the 
government could prove through independent scientific studies that 
MMT was harmful to Canadians or to the onboard diagnostic 
systems in cars. We have not seen that evidence and therefore we 
can only conclude that MMT should not be banned.
<P>
	When the petroleum companies appeared before the committee, 
they suggested that they would have a tremendous amount to lose 
should MMT be removed from Canadian fuels. In their testimony it 
was suggested that the removal of MMT would result in an increase 
in manufacturing costs, as much as $69 million per year. Refineries 
would have to burn more crude oil in order to achieve the high 
octane levels needed for today's automobiles, without any 
economic benefit.
<P>
	The refineries would be forced to burn a greater amount of crude 
oil in order to achieve different octane levels, but in the process, it 
would produce greater emissions through the burning of crude oil. 
<P>
Therefore, it would increase the cost of energy for the 
transportation sector and would be a direct tax on jobs and 
ultimately a drag on the economy.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	When this bill was introduced to the environment committee, 
one of the questions raised had to do with the possible alternatives 
to MMT. According to the auto makers, the octane of gasoline can 
be increased through changes to the refining process as well as 
through the addition of other octane enhancers such as MTBE, 
ETBE and ethanol.
<P>
	The former environment minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, 
once made a comment that she did not need to conduct independent 
testing because the big three auto makers had said MMT was 
harmful. Who are we to dispute the big three auto makers?
<P>
	On October 18 Rod Raphael, chief of monitoring and criteria in a 
division of Health Canada, appeared before the environment 
committee and said the following about MTBE, a possible 
alternative to MMT: ``We have concerns with respect to MTBE and 
the fact is that MMT could prove to be carcinogenic and that the 
evaluation of MTBE is still out''.
<P>
	Why would we consider using MTBE when it has shown to have 
a potential negative effect on the health of Canadians? Why are we 
replacing something that has been proven to not be harmful to 
Canadians?
<P>
	There is also data to show these alternative fuel enhancers have 
lower mileage rates, so much more that more gasoline has to be 
burned with more nitrous oxide emissions into the environment 
with a negative effect.
<P>
	Bear in mind that nitrous oxide is one of the greatest contributors 
to pollution through smog. This bill has been brought through 
various stages. I want to make it clear and point out that at every 
stage we in the Reform Party have made every attempt to put this 
bill on hold until conclusive proof has been found that it 
demonstrates a negative effect on the environment or to Canadians' 
health.
<P>
	It is clearly beyond me why this government continues to pursue 
this bill, showing as it were that it has not shown to demonstrate 
any negative effects on the health of Canadians.
<P>
	Furthermore, the banning of MMT may prove to be deleterious 
to Canadians' health by increasing nitrous oxide levels within the 
environment. There is no disputing that the presence of MMT in 
unleaded gasoline actually reduces smog, and therefore banning 
MMT means an increase of nitrous oxide, and replacing it with  an 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4692"> 4692 </A></B>
<P>
alternative would result in an increased negative effect on the 
environment in a number of different ways.
<P>
	As politicians we are very familiar with polls. One poll says this 
and another one says that. If we want a polling company to get a 
favourable answer, it is very easy to do that. That is what we have 
seen here in this case.
<P>
	The same thing happened with MMT, with Ethyl having its 
studies to prove its case and the auto makers doing their studies to 
prove their case. It proves absolutely nothing. I must say, though, 
the studies done by Health Canada are conclusive and flow exactly 
contrary to what the hon. minister has been saying in this House.
<P>
	I do not understand why the hon. Minister of the Environment is 
choosing to ignore studies that come out from the Ministry of 
Health that fly completely against his conclusions.
<P>
	Other studies done, for example by Kilbourn Inc., show that the 
removal of MMT as a reduction of sulphur content in gasoline 
would result in an increase in capital costs of nearly a billion 
dollars and an increase of $200 million in annual operating costs.
<P>
	These large costs, though, are sure to cripple many refineries in 
the country and force a lot of Canadians out of their jobs, in the 
order of thousands I might add.
<P>
	Since the beginning we in the Reform Party have pushed for 
independent testing. If the minister were honest in his intentions, 
he would do that.
<P>
	This need not have ever come to the House, not last Parliament 
or this one. Ethyl Corp. and the auto makers were dealing with this 
themselves. They were almost going to have a conclusion to it 
when the government stuck its big foot in. It has now completely 
polarized both these groups. Now it comes to our purview here.
<P>
	We are wasting taxpayer money in this House by even discussing 
this bill which could have been dealt with in the private sector in a 
very effective and efficient fashion.
<P>
<B>(1705 )</B>
<P>
	The negativism about this bill comes not only from within 
cabinet, not only from the government backbenchers, but from 
provincial ministers across this country. Throughout 1995 
provincial environment ministers submitted letters to the Standing 
Committee on the Environment with regard to MMT. I am going to 
read some of these to make it perfectly clear what these provincial 
ministers are saying.
<P>
	Ty Lund, Alberta's minister of the environment, states: ``This 
unilateral federal action on a non-toxic component of gasoline will 
likely only serve to draw valuable resources away from consensus 
efforts to improve Canada's gasoline and deliver real air quality 
benefits. Canadian petroleum refineries may be dealt a legislative 
disadvantage if MMT is banned in Canada and allowed in the 
United States''.
<P>
	The former New Brunswick minister of the environment, 
Vaughn Blaney, stated that the province of New Brunswick raised 
concerns regarding the negative environmental impacts of 
proceeding with this plan, including the potential increase of 
emissions of greenhouse, toxic and acidifying gases from motor 
vehicles. The exact opposite intent of what the minister wishes to 
have is going to happen if MMT is banned. We are going to make 
our environment not cleaner but dirtier. To use the minister's 
words, nobody wants our air needed to be scrubbed, chewed on or 
otherwise. We want it cleaner, but banning MMT is not going to 
effect that change.
<P>
	Wayne Adams, Nova Scotia's environment minister, stated: ``We 
understand that the position taken by the federal government on the 
effect of MMT on vehicles equipped with advanced emission 
control technologies resulted from claims to its effect by the 
automobile industry. We also understand that they were not able to 
substantiate those claims with sound technical documentation. 
Further, there is proof that the removal of MMT from gasoline will 
cause increases in nitrous oxide emissions by up to 20 per cent. 
Therefore we cannot support Bill C-94''.
<P>
	Bernhard Weins, Saskatchewan's minister of the environment 
and resource management, stated: ``In our view the scientific data 
on MMT do not indicate a net environmental gain that will result in 
the passage of this legislation. In addition to the cost implications, 
increased greenhouse gas emissions as a result of intensified 
refinery processes required to replace MMT and increased vehicle 
tailpipe emissions of smog forming oxides of nitrogen would also 
occur''.
<P>
	These are not people who are in the camp of Ethyl Corporation. 
These are not people who have any particular axe to grind other 
than the safety of Canadians and the health of Canadians. Why are 
these people opposing Bill C-94 on the basis of sound scientific 
data to show that banning MMT is not going to make our 
environment cleaner but rather will make our environment dirtier?
<P>
	Guy Chevrette, Quebec's minister of state for natural resources, 
stated the bill will have a major impact on the competitiveness of 
Quebec's refiners. It goes on and on. There is a list of these 
statements. The words of these provincial ministers and the 
statements made by the Montreal Board of Trade clearly speak for 
themselves.
<P>
	I ask the Minister of the Environment to please rethink his 
position on this bill. His provincial counterparts are not standing 
behind him. Part of cabinet is not standing behind him. I would 
venture to say that a large number of the backbenchers in the 
Liberal Party are also not standing behind him.
<P>
	This bill should be dropped. This bill should never have come 
forward in this Parliament and it should be scrapped. I suggest the 
minister start to address the wide  variety and number of significant 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4693"> 4693 </A></B>
<P>
environmental hazards that are in our midst today which have 
simply not been dealt with by this government.
<P>
	There are a litany of environmental problems that are affecting 
Canadians from coast to coast which in the three years since we 
have been here are simply not being addressed. Included are 
deforestation, salinization of soil, the damage to our wetlands, 
desertification, pollution in the Arctic.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	Colleagues in the House here today, my friends from the Bloc 
Quebecois, friends from the Liberal Party, went to the Arctic and 
heard increasingly disturbing evidence of carcinogens, teratogens 
and toxins increasing in the Arctic. They are increasing through the 
food chain with dramatic, disastrous and deleterious effects for the 
health of the people who live in the Arctic.
<P>
	I have not seen one thing come into this House since that 
meeting earlier this year to address that factual graphic evidence of 
the damage that has been done to our environment in the Arctic. 
The damage that is taking place among the people who are living in 
the Arctic is silent and is killing. I know the minister is very 
interested in this and I hope to see action on this.
<P>
	On the endangered species legislation we have seen nothing. 
While we talk in this House at least two species are being 
eliminated from the face of the planet every single day, and Canada 
is no exception. We have dozens of species on the endangered list. 
We have dozens on the threatened list. CITES, the convention on 
the international trade in endangered species of wild flora and 
fauna, has repeatedly said interestingly and sadly enough that 
Canada has the ignominious reputation for being one of the top ten 
conduits of illegal animal parts in the world.
<P>
	I did not know that, and I am ashamed to say that we in this 
country are a conduit for some of the most threatened and 
endangered species on this planet, species that are never going to 
be in existence again if things are not done to protect them: the 
black rhino, spotted cats, a wide variety of bird species.
<P>
	In Canada we have the problem of bears being poached for gall 
bladders and other parts. We have the grizzly bear situation in 
British Columbia. This is only the tip of the iceberg. Correct me if I 
am wrong, but I have not seen a single piece of legislation that has 
come forward in the House to address endangered species. While 
we speak habitat is being destroyed and species in this country are 
being wiped off the face of the planet.
<P>
	It would be very productive if we saw in this House efforts put 
from the government on endangered species legislation, on habitat 
protection, on habitat reclamation and on using novel ways of 
actually reclaiming habitat that has been destroyed by industry. 
Having the polluter pay is a sensible way of doing that without 
burdening the taxpayer and putting onerous demands on the already 
limited budget the minister has to work with.
<P>
	Co-operative efforts with industry are going to improve habitat 
and perhaps expand the amount of habitat that we have, that we 
need, to protect our endangered species. In Canada, as in every 
other part of the world, habitat destruction is the single most 
important reason for the decimation of species.
<P>
	There are novel ways to protect our parks. Our parks are under 
threat in a number of ways. The primary reason they are under 
threat is financial. You cannot blame anybody for this because that 
is the financial reality we all live under, but there are novel ways of 
doing that.
<P>
	I think it is interesting for us to look at what other parts of the 
world are actually doing to preserve their wild spaces. There are 
interesting co-operative efforts that can be done with industry so 
that the parks themselves can earn revenues. Those revenues can be 
reinvested within the parks to hire enforcement officers, to increase 
the amount of protected spaces they have for education, for 
research and scientific study.
<P>
	In doing that we would give the parks the ability to generate the 
revenues so they will be there for us in this House, for our families, 
for Canadians from coast to coast and for the generations of 
Canadians to come. It is a legacy that we have inherited. It is a 
legacy that is on our shoulders to give to future generations.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	These issues have to be dealt with. I plead with hon. minister to 
bring forth good constructive suggestions and to work with other 
members to address the critically important environmental issues 
that affect us from coast to coast, not the banning of MMT which 
has not been shown deleterious to the health of Canadians.
<P>
	Could he please bring his skills and those of his ministry to bear 
on these important environmental issues, on the pollution that is 
taking place in our oceans as we speak, to develop new ways to 
work with the Minister of Transport, to develop new co-operative 
ways with the municipalities and the provinces, to deal with 
alternative means of transportation.
<P>
	The European experience is very interesting. Look at what they 
have done with respect to train travel and electric travel for mass 
transit. Even in relatively small communities of 60,000 to 70,000 
people, they have established interesting transportation 
mechanisms which have led to a decrease in the utilization of cars, 
thereby decreasing the amount of auto emissions.
<P>
	Co-operative efforts like that along with the use of non-electric, 
non-petroleum modes of transportation such as bicycles can be 
utilized very effectively. We might be put to shame by looking at 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4694"> 4694 </A></B>
<P>
the European experience. We  could take some of what they have 
done and apply it to some areas in this country.
<P>
	The hon. minister comes from the city as I, Toronto. It is sad to 
see the environmental degradation that has taken place in this very 
fine city. I am sure he shares the concerns of everybody in this 
House who lives in urban centres about the environmental 
degradation they have seen.
<P>
	Now is the time for this government to show and take a 
leadership role in developing cost effective, scientifically sound 
methods to decrease the pollution we have in our midst to improve 
our environment not only for us but, most important, for the 
Canadians of tomorrow.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Essex-Windsor 
will be sharing her time with the hon. member for Halton-Peel.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex-Windsor, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to be here today to participate in this debate. The passing of 
this bill will benefit all Canadians and fulfils another red book 
promise made to Canadians.
<P>
	I would like to express my sincere thanks to the Minister of the 
Environment for reintroducing this legislation and for pursuing its 
passage. The Liberal Party agriculture policy paper released on 
September 24, 1993 stated: ``Liberals are committed to banning the 
use of MMT in Canadian automotive fuels''.
<P>
	The rationale for this legislation is twofold. It deals with the 
health and the environmental risks and the need for harmonized 
standards to ensure jobs and investment in Canada that flows from 
our integrated North American automotive industry.
<P>
	Everyone in this House must know that the Canadian automotive 
industry accounts for 465,000 direct and indirect jobs across the 
country. The industry represents approximately 7 per cent of 
Canada's GDP and has invested more than $15 billion in Canada 
over the last decade.
<P>
	As a result of the North American approach to vehicle 
manufacturing under the 1965 Auto Pact, more than two million 
vehicles were manufactured in Canada in 1993, of which 85 per 
cent were exported for sale in the United States.
<P>
	In Windsor Chrysler, in partnership with the University of 
Windsor, recently opened the Automotive Research Development 
Centre. It invested $20 million and the federal government 
contributed $4 million.
<P>
	Initially the centre will conduct a road simulation project, 
advanced engine design and alternate fuel research, creating 16 
jobs for new researchers, placements for up to 20 co-op students as 
well as ongoing employment for 100 individuals in the design area. 
MMT will continue to be tested in Windsor.
<P>
	If Canada is to attract these major research centres and maintain 
the strong presence we have in the automotive industry, we must 
keep harmonized sectoral standards.
<P>
<B>(1720 )</B>
<P>
	However, harmonized sectorial standards require MMT free 
fuel. Contrary to the information others have spoken before us 
today, MMT is not widely used as a gasoline additive. Until last 
year Canada was the only OECD country that allowed MMT to be 
added to unleaded gasoline.
<P>
	Although a recent narrow technical court ruling in the United 
States has forced the EPA to grant a waiver to allow Ethyl 
Corporation to use MMT, it is still prohibited in one-third of the 
American market, as it is still banned in 37 states including 
California, which I am surprised my colleague from British 
Columbia was not aware of, and in many major U.S. cities that 
require reformulated fuels under the U.S. clean air act.
<P>
	As well, many of the larger petroleum companies, including 
Amoco, Anchor Gasoline, ARCO, BP, Chevron, Conoco, Exxon, 
Hess, Marathon Oil, Mobil, Penzoil, Philips, Shell, Sun and 
Texaco, have all stated they do not intend to add MMT to unleaded 
gasoline.
<P>
	Although emission control equipment and monitors have been 
designed to perform in real life conditions, they do not function 
properly if they are exposed to metals and other contaminants in 
gasoline such as MMT. Experience in Canada has demonstrated 
that MMT interferes with the engine and vehicle emission systems.
<P>
	In a recent correspondence to members of Parliament, the Motor 
Vehicle Manufacturer's Association states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Automakers' concerns about manganese based gasoline additives, such as MMT, 
have been supported by third parties. Leading manufacturers of spark plugs, 
Champion Spark Plug Inc., and Robert Bosch Corp. corroborates vehicle 
manufacturers' findings that MMT in gasoline causes significant deterioration in the 
life of spark plugs, EGR valves, oxygen sensors and catalytic converters, which are 
integral to the advanced emissions control systems on all new 1996 model vehicles 
and essential to reducing exhaust emissions from cars and light trucks.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<I>Ward's Engine and Vehicle Technology Update</I> of February 1, 
1996 devoted a recent article to problems associated with MMT 
use in gasoline: ``Auto Industry Leery of MMT Gasoline 
Additive''. Ward's quotes James Kranzthor, a senior product 
engineer at Chevron in San Francisco, as saying ``Chevron 
discontinued use of MMT in our gasoline sold in Canada last year 
due to spark plug fouling and because of concerns of Canadian auto 
makers''.
<P>
	General Motors of Canada Limited has also written:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We would like to be able to offer a new technology, second generation ``On Board 
Diagnostic'' system in Canada. This technology, now on all U.S. cars, senses when a 
vehicle is beginning to demonstrate certain conditions (such a minor misfires) which 
may lead to higher emissions. This allows the customer to have the vehicle serviced </BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4695"> 4695 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>before there is an emission  problem. Unfortunately, MMT impedes the effective 
operation of OBD-II systems and there is no way we know to design around it.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I am aware that for the first time since 1978, MMT will be 
allowed to be added to fuel in some U.S. states. However, this was 
based on a very narrow court ruling on the grounds that as MMT 
had been used in the U.S. before, MMT could again be employed in 
the U.S. before long term health risk studies are complete.
<P>
	However, I would like to point out that in the United States the 
major auto makers, General Motors, Ford, Chrysler, Honda and 
Toyota, are now undertaking a $10 million research program with 
the U.S. EPA to provide the necessary evidence for the U.S. courts 
to have MMT banned again.
<P>
	I would also like to quote from the head of the U.S. agency, 
Carol Browner, commenting earlier this year that the EPA believes 
that the American public should not be used as a laboratory to test 
the safety of MMT.
<P>
	I would like to discuss the health risks associated with MMT. Dr. 
Donaldson, one of Canada's top neurotoxologists, was one of the 
scientists selected by the National Research Council of Canada to 
participate in its mid-eighties study entitled ``Manganese in the 
Canadian Environment''. Dr. Donaldson testified to the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I believe that manganese is an age accelerating neurotoxin and I believe this is the 
answer to manganese's ability to produce biochemically, pathologically and 
clinically the picture which is very similar but not identical to Parkinson's Disease.</BLOCKQUOTE>
He also explained on CBC Radio on November 23, 1990:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>One of the things which attracted me to manganese-was essentially its ability to 
induce neurological damage almost identical with Parkinson's Disease. And this is 
why I started to address how this metal line could possibly produce symptoms of 
Parkinson's Disease and also brain damage which was similar to Parkinson's 
Disease.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	Ms. Ellen Silbergeld of the Environmental Defence Fund served 
on the EPA peer review panel on the EPA's health assessment 
document on manganese. She testified:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Regardless of the effects of MMT on emissions control, there is no dispute that 
manganese is neurotoxic to humans. It is on this basis that EPA should deny this 
waiver. Particularly since Ethyl has yet again failed to provide evidence on two 
critical points. One, that the use of MMT will not affect human health and two, that 
the use of MMT will not measurably add to the environmental loading of manganese 
in critical compartments directly related to human exposure.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We cannot ignore this evidence. We must act with prudence. I 
am equally concerned that we must act now rather than regret our 
inaction later.
<P>
	Finally, I would like to take issue with the recent action taken by 
Ethyl Corporation to attempt to file a  $201 million claim against 
Canada, trying to argue that under chapter 11 of the NAFTA this 
environmental legislation has violated its rights as an investor. This 
is clearly not the case. The president of the Canadian Automobile 
Association stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Bill C-29 is not about trade and commerce, it is about environmental protection 
and improvement. It would eliminate manganese based octane enhancers (such as 
MMT) from gasoline sold in Canada, regardless of their origin. Most gasoline sold in 
the United States and Mexico does not contain manganese based additives, so 
Canadian practices will be harmonized with our trading partners as a result of Bill 
C-29.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Bill Roberts, a lawyer for the U.S. Environmental Defence Fund, 
stated in reaction to Ethyl's claim:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For Ethyl to ask Canadian taxpayers to pay for lost profits on a product that could 
cause neurotoxic damage to millions of Canadian citizens is remarkably callous.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Finally, my message to Ethyl Corporation is that this 
government does not respond to corporate threats and it is the 
Government of Canada that sets policy in this country, not U.S. 
corporations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton-Peel, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
methylcyclopentadinyl manganese tricarbonyl is what we are 
talking about this afternoon. There have been a lot of myths and 
purported evidence delivered in this debate today.
<P>
	I want to pay tribute to the Hon. Ralph Ferguson, the former 
member of Parliament for Lambton-Middlesex, who actually 
spearheaded the process of getting oxygenates into gasoline and 
MMT out. This process began long before I had the honour of 
being elected to the House. This bill should be attributed to Ralph 
Ferguson because of the work he did and the evidence he produced. 
He started the ball rolling and elicited the enthusiasm of this 
member, at least, to get on the ball to discover that we could 
actually do something positive with motor fuel.
<P>
	It is not the question of whether manganese is toxic. There is 
some evidence which shows it is, but our health ministry has not 
declared it to be a toxin. What appeals to me about phasing out 
MMT is that the replacement that can be used probably provides 
for us the largest single window of air quality improvement that we 
are going to have during this session of Parliament.
<P>
	By replacing MMT as an octane enhancer with oxygenates we 
will reduce the carbon monoxide emissions from all our 
automobiles, whether they have good emission controls or no 
emission controls, by 30 per cent and we will reduce carbon 
dioxide by approximately 15 per cent. The previous speaker, my 
friend from the Reform Party, talked about nitrous oxide emissions 
being increased, possibly up to 20 per cent if that were to take 
place.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4696"> 4696 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	If the member will look at the evidence he will find that there is 
also evidence which demonstrates there is no increase in nitrous 
oxide emissions. But if there were 20 per cent, 20 per cent of 
practically nothing is practically nothing. I would suggest to him 
that some of the evidence which was brought before the committee 
really pushed the envelope.
<P>
	Thirty-nine cities in the United States have mandated fuel which 
contains oxygenates for the simple reason that they are concerned 
about ground level ozone. Anybody who lives in a metropolitan 
area in Canada, and particularly in metropolitan Toronto, will 
remember last summer and the summer before that during the hot 
weather ground level ozone warnings were being issued on a daily 
basis. Ground level ozone now has been studied to the point where 
we can predict by its intensity how many additional admissions 
there will be to hospitals. We can predict how many additional 
deaths from respiratory failure there will be because of ground 
level ozone. Does it not make simple sense to do everything we can 
to reduce those occurrences?
<P>
	Getting rid of the manganese in gasoline and getting oxygen in 
its place is exactly what will accomplish that, whether evidence 
may show whether it is toxic or not. At this time we can leave that 
debate to one side.
<P>
	There is overwhelming evidence from a health point of view and 
from the positive possibilities that are presented-
<P>

	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ)</B> moved that Bill C-246, 
an act to amend the Criminal Code (sexual exploitation of children 
outside Canada), be now read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, the subject of my bill, child sex tourism, 
has already been debated in the House last June, during second 
reading of Bill C-27.
<P>
	When I tabled my bill on November 30, 1995, the government 
was not yet talking about sex tourism. It was only in April, 5 
months later, that the government finally moved and tabled its bill 
to amend the Criminal Code in order to be able to take legal action 
against Canadian citizens who travelled abroad and exploited 
children in countries other than Canada.
<P>
	Since last spring, topics related to the exploitation of children 
have often been in the news.
<P>
	There was the Stockholm conference, where representatives 
from aound the world analysed the problem of the sexual 
exploitation of children and the best ways of combatting it.
<P>
	There was the Dutroux case in Belgium; everyone was horrified 
to learn the details of the activities of this man and his accomplices. 
The newspapers carried stories of a very active pedophile network. 
Can we think for one instant that such a network exists only in 
Belgium? Can we imagine that we are safe from such events in 
Canada or in Quebec?
<P>
	There is the current campaign by Mrs. Anne-Claude Girard, the 
mother of a family in Jonquière. Her young daughter was the 
victim of a well known pedophile in Quebec who had been 
sentenced for several crimes against children. Mrs. Girard is 
circulating a petition calling for a number of actions in order to 
ensure that society is protected against pedophiles and that there is 
adequate assistance for their victims. I believe that Mrs. Girard has 
collected over 15,000 signatures in various ridings in Quebec, and 
she will be circulating her petition in other parts of Canada.
<P>
	There is the investigation now under way in South Africa, where 
the police and the FBI are investigating a case similar to the 
Dutroux affair. A pedophile is apparently linked to the 
disappearance of five young girls, who it seems were assaulted in 
Pretoria or ``exported'' to other regions in Africa.
<P>
	There is another case in Peru, where a man presumed to have 
raped and killed 12 young girls was recently arrested.
<P>
	There is the retired Greek, who has just admitted raping 30 
teenage girls.
<P>
	There is the Austrian network dismantled early this month: 70 
Czech and Slovak minors were being exploited in this network.
<P>
	There is the case in Romania, where the police have just 
questioned a 60-year old man accused of committing depraved acts 
on six young girls.
<P>
	There was also the case in Poland, a favourite new site for 
pedophiles, where over 400 people, including numerous foreigners, 
were sentenced last year for having sex with minors under the age 
of 15.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	There is Italy, where minor girls are forced into prostitution by 
networks, some of them Albanian. There is Argentina, where 
authorities are worried about an upsurge in prostitution among poor 
children.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4698"> 4698 </A></B>
<P>
	You will note that this perversion of adults having sex with 
children confronts us everywhere. Sex tourism, of course, is just 
one aspect of an environment that includes incest and other forms 
of preying on children.
<P>
	The purpose of my bill, which is designed to protect children, all 
children, is to make it possible to take action against adults guilty 
of such behaviour abroad as well as in Canada and in Quebec.
<P>
	The so-called tourists who travel to other countries to take 
advantage of children are pedophiles. <I>Le Petit Larousse</I> defines 
pedophilia as: ``Sexual attraction of an adult for children''. When a 
man goes to Bangkok to pay a low price for the sexual services of a 
child, be it a boy or a girl, he is engaging in pedophilia. Cases 
updated over the summer have established a very explicit link 
between pedophilia and the networks built up by pedophiles in 
order to be able to act freely.
<P>
	These networks operate primarily in the area of pornography. 
For example, a German was arrested in Romania after obscene 
videos featuring children between the ages of five and ten were 
discovered. The same scenario was repeated in Poland, where two 
men are now on trial for films involving boys aged 12 or 13.
<P>
	Early this month, an article in <I>Agence France-Presse</I> reported 
that, in Seville as well, the legal system is worried about images 
appearing on the Internet, an offence for which two men have 
already been sentenced to jail in England.
<P>
	In Quebec, the head of the sexual offence section of the Montreal 
Urban Community police department declared this summer that 
pedophile networks are now rampant in the city and that the advent 
of the Internet, which allows pedophiles to obtain pornographic 
material and to seek out children anywhere in the world stands to 
contribute to the spread of the problem.
<P>
	The experts at the Stockholm conference on the sexual 
exploitation of children evaluated at one million the number of 
pornogra-phic images and at 40 million the number of Internet 
pages now devoted to child pornography. Forty million pages.
<P>
	Those same experts reported that more and more pedophiles 
armed with video cameras film their relations with children across 
the world and sell their pictures on the Internet to pay for their 
trips. Sex tourism becomes a vicious circle, as it were.
<P>
	Pedophile networks are therefore active in the area of sex 
tourism. The same article reported that this activity, already 
widespread in Asia, is increasing in countries like Brazil, Cuba and 
South Africa. It refers to various charges that have been laid for sex 
tourism. One case involved two men from the Netherlands guilty of 
having sexual relations with 16 year-old minors in the Philippines. 
Another concerns a 69 year old Swede, sentenced to three months 
in prison for sexual assault of a 13 year old Thai girl.
<P>
	In my speech last June, I gave a few examples of this practice. I 
will not elaborate on these now. I also analyzed the various ways 
those who participate in sex tourism try and justify their abject 
behaviour. I will not elaborate on that either, because I am short of 
time. However, we know that the phenomenon exists, that it is 
becoming increasingly widespread and that it is unacceptable.
<P>
	I was very pleased last April when the government tabled a bill 
with basically the same purpose as mine. I also listened carefully to 
statements by the Minister of Foreign Affairs about the present 
government's intention to work with other countries throughout the 
world to put an end to this shameful practice.
<P>
	Since the government tabled its own bill and since that bill is 
very similar to mine, I decided against asking the House to vote on 
my bill. However, in order to improve our chances of achieving the 
purpose of the legislation, I suggested an amendment to the bill 
introduced by the Minister of Foreign Affairs. This is what I would 
like to see amended.
<P>
	My bill contains provision for the conviction of persons who 
either directly or indirectly encourage this kind of behaviour.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	I am referring more specifically to carriers, travel agencies and 
advertising agencies. We do not find this provision in the 
government's bill, and I find that disappointing.
<P>
	The government will probably reply that the general 
interpretation provisions contained in the initial sections of the 
Criminal Code are broad enough to allow for legal action against 
peripheral intervenors such as carriers and travel agencies. That 
may be. It may be true from a strictly legal point of view. However, 
I could give a few examples where Parliament was less reluctant to 
elaborate on ``being a party'' in the case of other offences.
<P>
	In this respect, there are two definitions that might help us. The 
first one is the definition of being a party to an offence, provided 
under section 21 of the Criminal Code, according to which being a 
party includes actually committing an offence, doing or omitting to 
do anything for the purpose of aiding any person to commit it or 
abetting any person in committing it.
<P>
	The second definition, in section 22, is that of counselling 
someone to commit an offence. Counselling is defined so as to 
include procuring, soliciting or inciting. Finally, the definition of 
accessory after the fact is given in section 23.
<P>
	Why then, if the presence of these general principles is 
sufficient, for example, to charge persons involved in the 
commission of an offence, was the text of section 240 concerning 
``an accessory after the fact to murder'' passed? Could section 23 
not be used? 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4699"> 4699 </A></B>
<P>
Perhaps it was  judged that the offence was of a serious enough 
nature to assign it special status.
<P>
	Why, then, do we find in section 245 the words ``everyone who 
administers or causes to be administered to any person or causes 
any person to take poison''? Why could sections 21 or 22 not be 
used to obtain a conviction?
<P>
	Why does section 212 specifically punish a person who, and I 
quote ``procures, attempts to procure or solicits a person to have 
illicit sexual intercourse with another person''? Here again, could 
the sections previously referred to not have been used to obtain a 
conviction?
<P>
	It is a pretty sure bet that, if one were to go over the Criminal 
Code with a fine toothcomb, one would find other examples where 
the legislator felt it wise to repeat certain elements, in order to 
clarify his intent. It is recommendable, in my opinion, for the same 
thing to be done in the case of those indirectly involved in sex 
tourism involving children.
<P>
	I would also like to add that my bill is similar to that passed in 
Australia in 1994. In addition to the clients of sex tourism 
involving children, those who promote, organize or profit from it 
are covered expressly by the new Australian legislation.
<P>
	I know that legal systems differ from one country to the next, but 
Australian criminal law is, nevertheless, based in large measure on 
Common Law, as is the Canadian system. If Australian law has 
been able to accommodate a clarification such as the one I am 
proposing, perhaps Canadian law could do the same.
<P>
	Perhaps protection of children is worth a few concessions by the 
legal purists. While grateful for the government's having reacted 
within a reasonable length of time, I am inviting it to reconsider my 
proposal with the greatest of care.
<P>
	Individuals, all individuals, involved in the sexual exploitation 
of children need to know that they will be brought to justice and 
punished in a manner suited to the odious nature of their act. We 
have promised to join the war against the exploitation of children. 
Now we must use all of the tools available to us as fully as possible.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to begin by commending the member for Quebec as 
I know of her commitment to the issue. I am also very pleased to 
speak to Bill C-246, an act to amend the Criminal Code (sexual 
exploitation of children outside Canada).
<P>
	The government continues to have concerns regarding the sexual 
exploitation of children and this bill gives us one more chance to 
express our repulsion at the kind of behaviour involved in the 
sexual exploitation of children. These are the same concerns that 
have already led the  Minister of Justice to introduce Bill C-27, 
which addresses child sex tourism as well as child prostitution, 
criminal harassment and female genital mutilation.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	I will not, however, be supporting the amendments contained in 
Bill C-246, as presented by the member, because either they are 
overly broad or they cover what has already been covered by Bill 
C-27.
<P>
	Bill C-27 passed second reading on June 10. It has been referred 
to the justice and legal affairs committee. The committee will hear 
witnesses and deal with any proposals to amend the bill before 
reporting it back to the House on completion of its review.
<P>
	Members will know that Bill C-27 extends the jurisdiction of 
Canadian courts to prosecute Canadians and permanent residents in 
this country who will have used the services of prostitutes under 
the age of 18 while abroad. This is a significant departure from 
what our criminal laws usually do in that acts committed outside 
Canada can be prosecuted.
<P>
	There is more. Our law permits that sex tour operations acting in 
this country be prosecuted. I believe that these measures will assist 
considerably in deterring Canadians and permanent residents from 
engaging in activities thinking that they are shielded from criminal 
liability because of their belief, whether true or false, that this 
behaviour is tolerated abroad. Whether it is or is not tolerated 
abroad is irrelevant; it is not tolerated in this country.
<P>
	The amendments contained in Bill C-27 concerning child sex 
tourism will meet the international commitments that the 
government has undertaken with a view to improving the situation 
of children throughout the world. For instance, at the ninth UN 
Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of 
Offenders which took place in Cairo in 1995, member states were 
urged to adopt effective measures against practices harmful to 
women and children. Bill C-27 goes in that direction clearly.
<P>
	Canada has ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights 
of the Child and this bill will help to fulfil our commitments, as set 
out in the convention, to protect children from all forms of sexual 
exploitation and unlawful sexual practices. These concerns extend 
to the prostitution of children whether in or outside Canada.
<P>
	On August 29, 1996 in Stockholm, Sweden, 125 states, including 
Canada, adopted the declaration and agenda for action prepared by 
the World Congress against commercial sexual exploitation of 
children. Canada pledged its best efforts to promote and achieve 
the goals of the World Congress, as reflected in the declaration and 
agenda for action. The extraterritorial amendment on child sex 
tourism proposed in Bill C-27 fulfils one of the most significant 
commitments of the declaration and agenda for action.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4700"> 4700 </A></B>
<P>
	Bill C-27 also acts on the commitments made by the 
government in the February throne speech, namely the protection 
of the rights of children as a Canadian priority. This bill proposes 
further amendments to the Criminal Code to enable the criminal 
prosecution in Canada of Canadian citizens and permanent 
residents who travel abroad to engage in the sexual exploitation 
of children for money and other considerations.
<P>
	The practice of child sex tourism can only be stopped by 
international commitment and collaboration. Bill C-27 recognizes 
this commitment and sends a very strong message internationally 
about Canada's intolerance of such practices.
<P>
	With this amendment Canada will join 11 other 
countries-Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Belgium, 
France, Germany, Australia, New Zealand and the United 
States-which have already enacted similar legislative measures.
<P>
	As I have said, young people matter a great deal to us. It is 
important to send a strong message of social disapproval with 
respect to the abuse, exploitation and prostitution of children. 
Young people of all nations deserve our respect and need our 
protection.
<P>
	Bill C-27 is important for all Canadians. It is in keeping with the 
ideals of Canadian society, a society which does not tolerate 
violence against children.
<P>
<B>(1820 )</B>
<P>
	Bill C-246 deals essentially with child sex tourism. However, the 
bill presents some significant problems and the member made 
reference those problems. If the bill seeks to address the use of 
young prostitutes abroad, it does not do anything other than what 
Bill C-27 does. If it seeks to stop sex tourism operations in this 
country, let it be known that the law already prohibits these 
activities.
<P>
	The Criminal Code in section 212 already addresses certain 
aspects of sex tourism. In addition, parties to the offence of using 
the services of young prostitutes abroad after the passage of Bill 
C-27, such as those who aid and abet, are also guilty of the crime of 
procuring. Therefore, I believe that the amendment proposed by 
Bill C-246 in this respect is not necessary.
<P>
	The real problem with this private member's bill is that it 
overshoots the mark. For example, it would apply not only to 
Canadian citizens and permanent residents, as Bill C-27 would do, 
but it will also apply to any person who ``is present in Canada after 
the commission of the act or omission''.
<P>
	In international law, the nationality principle which is the 
principle used to extend jurisdiction of our courts to offences 
committed abroad makes it possible for a country to extend its 
jurisdiction over offences committed by its nationals abroad. This 
principle can also be relied on to establish extraterritorial 
jurisdiction over permanent residents. But this principle would not 
allow  us to extend jurisdiction over any person who happens to be 
present in or passing through the country, which is what Bill C-246 
permits.
<P>
	People who have no connection whatsoever with Canada could 
therefore be prosecuted for offences that have no link with Canada: 
the young prostitute is not Canadian and the customer is not 
Canadian and the offence is not committed in Canada. These cases 
are deserving of extradition, not of prosecution in this country.
<P>
	It is essential then that Canada abide by the principles of 
international law when it seeks to exercise jurisdiction for offences 
committed abroad. We must also be practical. Do we want the 
provinces which are tasked with prostitution related offences to 
have to prosecute cab drivers in foreign cities that would have 
transported customers where they have no grounds to believe the 
prostitute would be under the age of 18? This is what this bill 
allows and I do not think it is the kind of statute the House wants to 
or should pass.
<P>
	The House needs to fight sex tourism as proposed in Bill C-27, 
which has received second reading. I share the concerns of the 
member for Quebec. Fortunately the Minister of Justice has taken 
the steps noted to address the issue.
<P>
	I cannot support Bill C-246 because I believe that the bill the 
Minister of Justice introduced to deal with the same issues, Bill 
C-27, represents the best approach to the serious problem of child 
sex tourism.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
is a private member's bill brought in by the member for Quebec.
<P>
	For Canadians who are watching these proceedings, this is one of 
the privileges that members of Parliament have. If we see a matter 
or an issue that deserves a legislated approach or solution and we 
do not see the government bringing one forward, then we can draft 
and table our own legislated solution for the consideration of the 
House.
<P>
	I commend my colleague from Quebec and all members who 
take the time and trouble to listen to Canadians, to discern what 
issues are on their minds and what needs to be addressed and to 
bring forward legislation and proposals which will address those 
concerns.
<P>
	It is very interesting that although very few private members' 
bills are actually passed by the House, we had an exception this 
week which encouraged a lot of members of Parliament both from 
the backbenches of the governing party and also the opposition 
benches. It is fair to say that very few private members' bills are 
passed in the House.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4701"> 4701 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	There is another very positive side benefit to these private 
members' bills and the work that goes into them. Quite often they 
encourage or force the government or bring about a situation where 
the government brings in its own legislation to deal with the 
problem that raised by the private member's legislation. As elected 
representatives we guard and appreciate very much the privilege of 
being able to bring these initiatives forward.
<P>
	Bill C-246 is an attempt by one of the members of this House 
from the Bloc party to address the issue of child sex tourism or 
sexual exploitation of children. That is an issue which has been 
more and more on the minds of Canadians. The sexual use and 
abuse of children is repugnant to Canadians. It is a terrible abuse of 
the innocence and the trust of young children. There is no question 
but that it should be dealt with by the full force of the law.
<P>
	Every Canadian, and we believe every human being, has certain 
fundamental human rights, one of which is safety of the person, 
safety from being exploited, abused and degraded. Certainly sexual 
exploitation of children is one that we should take extremely 
seriously and that we should address with every possible means.
<P>
	I commend the member for Quebec for her concern about this 
issue, her concern about children, not only in Canada but across the 
globe and her attempt to deal with this situation.
<P>
	As the previous speaker pointed out, the government, possibly as 
a result of the member for Quebec's initiative and the raising of this 
concern, has chosen to take some steps to deal with this issue in a 
bill that we will be debating soon, Bill C-27. It came out after this 
private member's bill. It covers most of the same issues. Again, we 
commend the government on doing that.
<P>
	Unfortunately there are some reasons why this bill is not one that 
I can support. Although its intent is good and although we 
recognize that it deals with a very important issue that needs to be 
addressed, there are some real difficulties with the way this bill has 
been drafted.
<P>
	I will point out some of the concerns why I will not be able to 
support this bill even though I am very much in sympathy with the 
motivation of the member who is putting it forward.
<P>
	First, it attempts to legislate in Canada for problems in other 
countries. That is really beyond the jurisdiction and scope of our 
law. There is a Latin term for it, that it is outside of the scope of the 
Canadian Parliament to legislate problems in other countries, 
although we would often like to do so.
<P>
	My recommendation is that we not just throw up our hands and 
say there are countries where exploitation of children for sexual 
purposes is a real problem but that we  work vigorously through 
diplomatic channels to work with the other countries to promote 
their efforts to clean up this terrible situation. We should be good 
citizens of the world and good neighbours of these countries that 
are trying to deal with these issues. We should encourage them, 
help them and if necessary push them into doing so.
<P>
	For our legislators to reach beyond our borders to deal with these 
situations, repugnant though they are, is really not a very effective 
or appropriate way to try to deal with this.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	Another problem is that since the crime that would be created in 
Bill C-246 would take place in other countries, there is a real 
problem in gathering sufficient evidence even if prosecution were 
desired in this country.
<P>
	There are different police methods, for example, in other 
countries. The method of gathering evidence in other countries 
may not be acceptable to our courts. They may violate charter 
rights or processes that would render evidence invalid. There are a 
number of difficulties getting the proper evidence from other 
countries. It would be very expensive to do this.
<P>
	When people think about the exploitation of children in this way, 
they would very much like to say that costs should be no object in 
trying to stamp out these terrible practices. The fact is there are 
reasonable limits that have to be put on the use of our justice 
funding.
<P>
	As members know from some of the debates that have taken 
place this week, when we were talking about expanding some of 
the rehabilitation measures in our prisons, when we talk about 
longer incarceration for violent and dangerous criminals in this 
country along with other measures that Canadians are asking for, 
we have to bear in mind there is a finite amount of funding, money 
and tax dollars to support these things.
<P>
	To send investigators, to have witnesses coming and to have 
evidence brought in from around the globe is not as practical as all 
of us wish it were and would like it to be.
<P>
	Clause 1 of this bill really wants to go after everyone who has 
committed an offence by sexually exploiting children outside the 
country. The previous speaker mentioned the situation that could 
very well arise when a citizen of another country may be visiting 
Canada.
<P>
	Do we capture everybody who crosses our borders who is 
alleged to have these offences and then prosecute them? To some 
extent, Canadians are saying we are not being very successful in 
holding our own criminals in Canada accountable.
<P>
	If we are trying to make people accountable from across the 
globe who happen to visit here, we will expand the load on an 
already overburdened justice system in a way that will make us 
lose protections and effectiveness in other areas.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4702"> 4702 </A></B>
<P>
	We need to be, again, very temperate, very moderate and very 
balanced in our expectations of how much our system can handle 
and what our priorities are going to be.
<P>
	There is another question. These are issues in no particular 
ranking. I noticed that if convicted under this act, the conviction 
would only be a summary conviction. In other words, this would be 
as opposed to an indictable conviction. Summary convictions are 
thought of as lesser offences.
<P>
	Considering the terrible and repugnant acts and violations of 
young children involved with the subject matter of this bill, I am 
rather puzzled to know why we would go to all this trouble only to 
have at the most a conviction on a summary basis, which would 
draw a penalty of two years maximum and very often less, 
particularly with our early release provisions and that sort of thing.
<P>
	It seemed to me that if we were going to all this trouble and 
expense to really want to stamp out this terrible practice by the 
measures this member is suggesting, we should certainly give the 
courts a lot more leeway to impose heavy penalties than is in this 
bill.
<P>
<B>(1835 )</B>
<P>
	A very important political statement, a statement of intent, has 
been made by this bill. However, in my view the measures set out 
in this bill will be very difficult if not almost impossible to 
implement. There are things we need to do to deal with this, but I 
do not believe this bill is sufficient.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am happy to speak today on Bill C-246, An Act to amend 
the Criminal Code (sexual exploitation of children outside 
Canada).
<P>
	I wish to recognize at the outset the generosity of the honourable 
member for Québec, who introduced this bill. We are dealing here 
with a situation involving to some extent the export of crime. Since 
our society does not tolerate this type of activity, which we want to 
prevent by passing this bill, some people will go to other countries 
to commit the acts in question.
<P>
	My personal opinion is that this bill tries to prevent a certain 
form of imperialism.
<P>
	This bill is characteristic of Quebec's and Canada's position in 
general regarding respect for children and people and it also 
reflects the fact that we cannot ignore the reality of such an activity, 
especially since as a society we are exporting it because we do not 
tolerate it on our own lands. There is at the moment a sort of silent 
acceptance, which must absolutely be dealt with.
<P>
	The Government has already proposed in Bill C-27 measures 
comparable to the objectives of this bill. Its objective, I repeat is to 
amend sections 7 and 211 of the  Criminal code so as to prohibit 
obtaining, for consideration, the sexual services of a person under 
the age of eighteen years outside of Canada; transporting people to 
common bawdy-houses outside Canada for the purpose of having 
sexual relations with persons under the age of eighteen years; and 
certain acts of procuring committed outside Canada in relation to 
persons under the age of eighteen years.
<P>
	I wish to congratulate the member for Québec, who introduced 
this bill.
<P>
	We can see that the government has finally decided to follow suit 
with Bill C-27. The two bills are quite similar on the principle but it 
appears that Bill C-27 needs to be reinforced because we are in an 
area where we have a responsibility to act, even if we are dealing 
with extraterritorial actions, since fundamental human rights are at 
stake. We are not discussing relations between corporations, as 
with the Helms-Burton act, we are discussing fundamental rights. 
It seems to us that the government bill, based on an interesting 
principle, similar to the one put forward by the member for 
Québec, also needs to be strengthened.
<P>
	First of all, we must make it more specific in order to give it real 
legal authority to go after these people. As the bill now stands, a 
principle is stated, but we do not really have the means to 
prosecute. Furthermore, the wording should be changed to meet the 
needs in this regard. Let us take an example. The clause suggested 
in Bill C-246 states that it is about anyone who ``takes, transports, 
directs, or offers to take, transport or direct, any other person to a 
common bawdy-house''. These are very precise and concrete terms 
ensuring that every person implicated in such a criminal act may be 
prosecuted. They really allow for the control of such acts and show 
the people who could be tempted by sexual tourism that Canadians 
or Canadian residents cannot indulge in that kind of activity, under 
threat of penalty.
<P>
	Now, another shortfall of the bill is precisely concerning the 
people targeted in it. Presently, only Canadian citizens and landed 
immigrants are targeted.
<P>
<B>(1840)</B>
<P>
	There are however people who live in Canada for a while and are 
not targeted by that kind of bill, although they may precisely be 
those who travel the most. I am thinking about refugees and asylum 
seekers. I think it would be in our interest to specify who is targeted 
in Bill C-27 to make sure that legal proceedings can be taken 
against any individual in such a position.
<P>
	The bill introduced by the member for Québec contains another 
recommendation that is much more significant.
<P>
	While the government bill treats this simply as aggravated 
assault, the member for Québec-I support her on this one and I 
invite all members to consider how wise her recommendation 
is-suggests that the sexual exploitation of children outside 
Canada be made a separate offence so that legal action could be
<P>

<B><A NAME="4703"> 4703 </A></B>
<P>
taken directly instead of more globally under a section of the 
Criminal Code dealing with several activities. It would be good to 
be more specific.
<P>
	There is another more technical element. The government bill 
will make an exception for surgical procedures. According to the 
advice we received from doctors, it does not seem advisable to 
allow people to obtain, in a roundabout way, what is prohibited by 
law. In other words, managing to legally perform sexual mutilation 
as a result of a physician's broad authorization. We believe that 
right now nothing can justify such an exception and we think it 
should be removed.
<P>
	Another thing, the bill provides that sexual mutilations would be 
allowed on a consenting adult. This seems somewhat nonsensical. 
Do we authorize adults to commit suicide or mutilate their own 
body in various ways? Why should it be allowed in this case, 
especially as people in a different cultural context may be subject 
to specific pressure? Such a thing is not desirable. This kind of 
action is no more acceptable when it involves an adult instead of a 
child, and we believe it is important for Bill C-27 to be improved in 
this respect.
<P>
	In my view, this piece of legislation will have an impact abroad, 
outside Quebec and Canada, but also internally, because it reflects 
an important principle found in many other areas of human activity, 
namely the fact that we will not tolerate the export of criminal acts 
abroad because of the wealth of our society. Similarly, in the 
environmental sector, we cannot tolerate the export of economic 
activities that cause pollution because we do not want them at 
home.
<P>
	In this area, this is also not acceptable, and what is proposed by 
the hon. member for Québec allows us to target a crime that the 
Quebec or Canadian society would not accept. They would not 
tolerate that people living in Quebec or Canada, citizens or landed 
immigrants in our country, or refugees or asylum seekers could 
commit such crimes abroad.
<P>
	Therefore, the bill proposed by the hon. member for Québec is a 
step in the right direction. It even suggests to the government ways 
to improve the situation which we do not find in the government 
bill, and this is why I would ask unanimous consent to put this bill 
to a vote.
<P>
<B>(1845)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Since no more members wish to speak 
and the motion was not selected as a votable item, the time 
provided for consideration-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête: </B>Mr. Speaker, on a point of order please.
<P>
	At the end of my speech, I introduced a motion requesting 
unanimous consent of the House to determine if the bill was 
votable.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent for this 
motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There is no unanimous consent of the 
House. Therefore, the order is dropped from the Order Paper.

<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADAPENSIONPLAN">CANADA PENSION PLAN</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Bill Graham (Rosedale, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in June I had 
the opportunity to ask the Secretary of State for Multiculturalism 
and the Status of Women how the government intends to ensure 
that the special needs of women will be considered in the reform of 
the Canada pension plan. I am happy to be able to follow this issue 
up this evening because it is an extremely important one.
<P>
	The pension needs of women are different from the pension 
needs of men. Several of my constituents have brought this to my 
attention on many occasions, but particularly during the time of the 
recent cross-country consultations led by my colleague, the 
member for Winnipeg North Centre.
<P>
	I often have the opportunity when I am in my riding to meet with 
women, particularly elderly women who are living alone, to 
discuss with them the problems they have in meeting their needs 
and surviving in increasingly difficult circumstances in many 
cases.
<P>
	When the CPP information paper was released, it was criticized 
for failing to include a gender analysis of the various options 
presented. The importance of pensions to women cannot be 
understated. The majority of the senior population is presently 
female, and this proportion is presently on the increase. Therefore 
the issue of women's economic independence and security in their 
later years will take on even more importance.
<P>
	During the consultations on the CPP, women's groups strongly 
supported the CPP system saying that it has worked well for them 
and is a vital concern to them. My understanding is that the CPP 
offers a number of advantages for women not found in private 
sector pension plans. For that reason it seems to me that gender 
analysis reform to the CPP system is crucial.
<P>
	When we reflect on the change in patterns of work and in the 
contribution that women today are making to the workforce and 
their ability to be flexible in that contribution, it is most important 
that we should concentrate on the needs of the pension system to 
<P>

<B><A NAME="4704"> 4704 </A></B>
<P>
reflect both the needs for that new flexibility and for the needs  that 
women will have as they increasingly become employed in the 
workforce.
<P>
	That is why I would like to ask the parliamentary secretary to 
update the House on how this aspect of the reform process has 
progressed. During the CPP consultations, women's organizations 
advised the federal and provincial governments against reducing 
the number of dropout years, of deindexing pensions or raising the 
age of entitlement. They noted that these types of measures would 
impose a disproportionately onerous burden on women.
<P>
	It was pointed out that any reform of survivor benefits should 
recognize that many women have low paying jobs. There were also 
some calls for a homemakers pension plan.
<P>
	These points, it seems to me, all have merit. Can the 
parliamentary secretary comment on them?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Maria Minna (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank 
the hon. member for Rosedale for raising this important issue in the 
House. I too have been involved with this issue for some time now 
and have been very interested in it. I had some discussions in my 
own riding and across the city of Toronto on the issue.
<P>
	While financial issues around the CPP are certainly of concern to 
all Canadians, our ultimate objective is of course to ensure the 
well-being of individuals in their retirement years.
<P>
	We know how important the Canada pension plan is for women. 
Women on average live longer than men, earn only 70 per cent of a 
man's dollar and have less access than men do to private or 
employer sponsored pension plans. As a result, their retirement 
income is limited.
<P>
<B>(1850)</B>
<P>
	Particular features of the CPP such as the child rearing, drop out 
and survivor benefits provide recognition of the essential and 
invaluable but unpaid work contributions that women make to our 
society.
<P>
	Women's full economic contribution must be recognized. 
Women are now the main breadwinners in 25 per cent of families 
and their income is increasingly important to all families. In 
addition to this paid work however, women continue to perform the 
majority of unpaid child care, elder care and household work; work 
that no society can do without.
<P>
	As the Secretary of State for Multiculturalism and the Status of 
Women stated in her original response, the government is aware 
that women and men have very different patterns of employment 
and earnings. For that reason Status of Women Canada with the 
Caledon Institute held a round table to specifically look at the 
gender implications of CPP reform. This round table was held as a 
part of the consultation process led by the hon.  member for 
Winnipeg North Centre and the findings were conveyed to federal, 
provincial and territorial finance ministers who are responsible for 
the Canada pension plan.
<P>
	This is part of the government's policy of undertaking gender 
based analysis as set out in the federal plan for gender equality. Our 
commitment to gender equality means equally valuing similarities 
and differences between women and men and the varying roles 
which they play.
<P>
	The minister is very committed to ensuring that gender analysis 
is done and that it is considered and taken into account when the 
final results on the CPP are announced. I hope this helps the hon. 
member and I look forward to discussing the issue with him.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on May 14, 
1996, I asked the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration a 
question concerning Philip Chrysafidis, a member of the 
Immigration and Refugee Board in Montreal. He was appointed by 
this Liberal government on February 24, 1994. His term of office 
comes to an end in February 1997.
<P>
	In May 1996, five criminal charges were laid him. He was 
accused of the illegal harassment of a female hearing officer at the 
IRB and of her husband, also an employee of the IRB. A few days 
later on, Mr. Chrysafidis purportedly threatened the man with 
physical harm or even death. He is also accused of deliberately 
intercepting private communications. Finally, he was caught 
carrying a prohibited weapon.
<P>
	Because of these accusations, Mr. Chrysafidis has been 
suspended since May 7, but he is still receiving his full salary of 
$86,000 a year. Therefore, he is being paid for not working. I 
wonder how long he will receive $86,000 a year. As you know, the 
trial could go on for months and even years. The accused will only 
appear before the court on September 30 for his preliminary 
hearing.
<P>
	Given the substantial sum of money involved and the state of our 
public finance, I wonder why the chairman of the IRB did nothing 
to put an end to such abuse and also why the Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration is not acting in a more responsible 
way and demanding an administrative inquiry in this matter. All the 
more so since three employees of the board are involved in this 
case, whether as perpetrators or as victims of alleged acts.
<P>
	When the accusations against Mr. Chrysafidis were made public, 
IRB officials refused to comment on this case. They explained it 
was more of a private case. The courts should then be left to do 
their job.
<P>
	However, I think this embarrassing situation for the IRB may 
have the effect of staining its reputation. It is also damaging its 
<P>

<B><A NAME="4705"> 4705 </A></B>
<P>
credibility. I believe this situation is  damning and unfortunate 
enough for the minister to intervene in this case.
<P>
	Certainly, the commissioner in question is presumed to be 
innocent. But the relevant authorities must make the administrative 
decisions that are necessary in this case. How long will this 
commissioner receive his full salary when he is not performing his 
duties?
<P>
	Furthermore, I wish to mention that at least 11 complaints 
against commissioners have been processed or have been the 
subject of an inquiry since the complaint processing mechanism 
was created at the IRB in January 1995. It must also be noted that, 
in the past, 35 hearing officers had signed a petition criticizing 
commissioner Chrysafidis' behaviour.
<P>
	I invite the minister to exercise more diligently her role as 
minister responsible for the IRB.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Maria Minna (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I must admit I 
find the persistence of the member for Bourassa in pursuing this 
question a little puzzling. He knows full well that this matter is 
currently before the courts and that it would be inappropriate for 
the minister to comment at this time.
<P>
	The hon. member of the opposition has suggested that the 
minister should actively intervene and remove this individual from 
the Immigration and Refugee Board. As he well knows, the IRB is 
a quasi-judicial tribunal which operates at arm's length from the 
Department of Citizenship and Immigration. It is important to 
maintain this arm's length relationship if we want to preserve both 
the impartiality and the perception of impartiality of IRB decisions.
<P>
	The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration does not casually 
meddle in IRB affairs, particularly affairs concerning human 
resources. This is an area over which the board's chairperson,Ms. Mawani, has complete authority.
<P>
	I would like to remind the hon. member that one of the 
fundamental principles of Canadian law is that someone is innocent 
until proven guilty.
<P>
	At this point, this is all the minister can and is prepared to do in 
this case.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Colleagues, the House stands adjourned 
until tomorrow at 10 a.m.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.55 p.m.)
