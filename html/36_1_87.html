<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>NATIONAL PARKS ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK3">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from April 2 consideration of the motion that 
Bill C-38, an act to amend the National Parks Act, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to participate today in the debate at second reading of 
Bill C-38, an act to amend the National Parks Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will not necessitate a lengthy debate as it contains a 
single clause adding Tuktut Nogait National Park in the 
Northwest Territories to the list of national parks in Schedule 
I to the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The added Part XII specifies the boundaries of the new park, 
which covers 16,340 square kilometres or 6,310 square miles. 
Future negotiations may result in park boundaries being expanded 
to include land that is currently part of Nunavut and 
traditional Sahtu Dene and Metis territories, which would 
increase the total area covered by the park to 28,190 square 
kilometres. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995, the Government of the Northwest Territories, the Inuit 
of Nunavut and the Sahtu Dene and Metis agreed to leave the area 
to ensure the interim protection of the future location of the 
national park once the project has been completed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The name of the park will be Tuktut Nogait National Park, which 
means “caribou fawn” in the Siglik dialect of Inuvialukton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As indicated in the press release from the secretary of state 
responsible for Parks Canada announcing the tabling of this 
bill, this is a most appropriate name since the new park will 
protect the calving grounds of the Bluenose caribou. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The park is located in Melville Hills, east of Inuvik, in the 
Northwest Territories. It represents the natural region of 
tundra hills in the Canadian national parks system. Melville 
Hills consist of tundra vegetation, rolling hills and deep 
canyons. Its rich biodiversity is uncharacteristic of Arctic 
regions and comes from the variety of microhabitats it 
incorporates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The many cliffs and ramparts provide ideal nesting areas for 
birds of prey. 
Moreover, the lush vegetation of the hills and the valleys 
provides an excellent habitat for caribou and musk sheep. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The closest inhabited place is Paulatuk, where we find a 
Inuvialuit community of about 300. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The park protects a natural site blessed with impressive tundra 
landscapes—spectacular canyons, many caribou, musk sheep, 
wolves, birds and other wild species from the North—as well as 
archaeological sites which confirm that there was a human 
presence thousands of years ago. These natural lands will enrich 
Canada's natural parks network, whose reputation is already well 
established around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The territory covered by the park has a great cultural and 
economic importance for the region's population. Tuktut Nogait 
also has many features that are of interest to the scientific 
community. 
The high altitude areas escaped glaciation and served as a 
refuge to the biota during the Wisconsin glacial stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only comparable zone in all of the Arctic's continental 
regions is found in northern Yukon. The park has a number of 
pingos, which are steep, ice-cored mounds. It also has one of the 
largest population of eagles and falcons in the Northwest 
Territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From a scientific point of view, it is interesting to see signs 
of a human presence throughout the region. Contrary to what one 
might think, a large area of the park was inhabited a number of 
times during the last millennium. The interpretation of 
archeological sites raises important questions about the culture 
of Thule Inuit in that area, and about the origins of Inuit 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The region provides visitors with an opportunity to discover 
untouched Arctic landscapes, and to observe wildlife and plant 
life. Activities include hiking, camping, birdwatching, nature 
watching and photography. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among the points of interest, let us mention the spectacular 
canyons along the Hornaday and Brock rivers, the impressive 
LaRonciere Falls, and the abundance of birds, wildlife and wild 
flowers. Visitors can also familiarize themselves with the life, 
culture and history of northern peoples.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first European to visit this part of the Arctic coast was 
Samuel Hearne, of the Hudson's Bay Company.  He descended the 
Coppermine River in 1771 in search of copper deposits, the 
abundance of which had been considerably exaggerated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Tuktut Nogait region was not visited again until over 50 
years later.  Between 1821 and 1852, the royal navy renewed the 
search for the Northwest Passage.  Many explorers, including 
John Franklin, surveyed the coastline.  After 1900, eminent 
researchers such as Vilhjalmur Stefansson, R.M. Anderson and 
Diamond Jenness, studied the region and its people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreement creating the park was signed in 1996 by Canada, 
the Government of the Northwest Territories, and four 
representatives of the Inuvialuit: the Inuvialuit regional 
corporation, the Inuvialuit game management council, the 
Paulatuk community corporation, and the Paulatuk committee of 
hunters and trappers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the agreement creating the park was to fulfil the 
commitments made by the federal government to the Inuvialuit 
native peoples when it passed the Western Arctic (Inuvialuit) 
Claims Settlement Act in 1984.  This legislation implemented an 
agreement that conclusively settled Inuvialuit claims over 
certain lands in the Northwest Territories and the Yukon 
territory that they traditionally used and occupied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As compensation for the extinction of their ancestral claims, 
rights, titles and interests, the agreement provided that 
certain lands would be granted to or set aside for the 
Inuvialuit, and upheld their right to hunt, fish, trap and 
conduct commercial activities thereon, subject to certain 
limitations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreement was intended to give the Inuvialuit a way to 
retain their cultural identity and values within a rapidly 
evolving Nordic society, while making them full participants in 
that society and its economy.  The agreement contained the 
requirement to protect the fauna, environment and biological 
production of the Arctic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Creation of the Tuktut Nogiat park is, therefore, an offshoot of 
the Convention recognized in the Western Arctic (Inuvialuit) 
Claims Settlement Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This becomes obvious when the objectives of the park's creation 
are examined.  They are: to protect the Bluenose caribou herd 
and its calving and post-calving habitat; to protect in 
perpetuity a natural area in the Tundra Hills region, and 
encourage the public to understand and appreciate the region in 
such a way as to leave it intact for coming generations; to 
encourage collaboration between the Inuvialuit, the Government 
of Canada and the Government of the Northwest Territories with 
respect to the planning, operation and management of the park; 
to encourage and support the creation and maintaining of jobs 
and businesses in the region, by encouraging subsistence use of 
the park; to encourage greater understanding and respect of the 
cultural heritage of the Inuvialuit and their natural 
environment; to create an 
environment suited to long-term research into its ecological and 
cultural heritage; and to preserve the ecological integrity of 
the park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The park board will be responsible for reconciling these various 
objectives of preserving nature, economic and tourism 
development, and the respect of aboriginal traditions.  This 
body will have a membership of five, two appointed by the 
Inuvialuit, two by the federal government, one of these on the 
recommendation of the Government of the Northwest Territories, 
and a chair to be appointed with the agreement of all parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation proposed today will provide this national park 
with complete protection according to the limits set out in the 
1996 agreement under the National Parks Act and regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if we are in agreement with the principle of this bill, it 
seems we are being called upon to deal with it rapidly.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill was introduced at first reading on Monday, March 30, 
and here we are today, April 3, at second reading.  The 
documents relating to the analysis of this bill, a press release 
and a briefing note, are still warm from arriving in such a 
hurry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note that the government is assuming the 
park will be created.  On page 102 of Heritage Canada's 
estimates, Tuktut Nogait appears as one of the three Northwest 
Territories parks.  And yet, Bill C-38 has not been passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it would have been wiser and less presumptuous to add 
the word “planned” beside the name of the park. 
It would take little for us to question whether this was not a 
breach of the privileges of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will approve this bill in principle at second reading. But we 
reserve judgement until we have had time to read the agreements 
that led to this bill and until we hear the witnesses interested 
in this bill in the course of the public hearings that will be 
held by the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with great interest to the comments about 
this bill by my colleague from the Bloc Quebecois. As he 
indicated, Bill C-38 does establish the boundaries for a new 
national park in the Northwest Territories.  Last night the 
critic for parks from the official opposition, my colleague for 
Saskatoon—Humboldt, spoke at some length about this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the opportunity to raise a similar issue out of concern 
for the Porcupine caribou herd.  This is another herd of caribou 
in the far north that happens to be in the western end of Yukon 
and its calving grounds overlap into Alaska.  I raised that issue 
on September 29, 1995.  I think it is quite appropriate that the 
government has moved to protect the Bluenose herd east of Inuvik. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is supporting this legislation.  Comments from 
the Bloc member indicate his party is supporting this legislation 
which is moving very quickly through the process so the very 
fragile environment up north can be protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the concerns I have is to achieve a balance between the 
economic interests of the nation with protecting the environment 
and specific species of plant and animal life.  This is 
especially relevant in the far north where those conditions are 
very fragile. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am reminded of a couple of recent events in northern British 
Columbia.  One was when the B.C. government moved to establish a 
provincial park in an area known as Tatshenshini-Alsek region in 
the northwestern corner of British Columbia. There was a 
projected $1 billion mine that was going to go into that region. 
That ultimately was cancelled once that region was turned into a 
park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the background research for this park in the Northwest 
Territories some exploration rights had been granted earlier in 
error to a company called Darnley Bay Resources.  Fortunately it 
did relinquish its exploration rights for that part that was 
included in the park.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member believe that there is a necessity to 
achieve a balance to include all the stakeholders, the industry 
and the people who derive their livelihood from the land, whether 
it be trappers or hunters or tourists, to ensure that it is not 
only in the best interests of the environment of the country but 
so we can achieve that balance between environmental protection 
and the protection of our economy? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK6"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my 
hon. colleague for his edifying remarks on this bill and the 
creation of this national park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe I said in my speech that the bill of course contains 
provision for protection of the park's ecosystem.  Accordingly, 
I think my colleague would agree that, in protecting the unique 
ecosystem of the Tuktut Nogait park, we will be able to turn the 
park into a tourist site unique in North America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I indicated that the only similar or comparable site is to be 
found in the northern Yukon. 
In addition to the tourist activities that should not only 
continue but increase and involve the native populations of the 
territory, I also referred in my speech to the fact that we 
should involve local populations in the region's commercial and 
economic development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that the bill excludes the possibility of 
economic and commercial development of the territory, far from 
it. It simply aims to provide a framework for protecting the 
ecosystem and the cultures and values of the Inuvialuit that 
live there.  It also makes provision for economic and commercial 
development, outside of this protective framework.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Madam Speaker, I listened attentively to my 
hon. colleague's reply.  He may have missed the point I was 
trying to make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When provinces or the federal government establishes parks there 
will no longer be any development within those boundaries.  A 
case is the recent mining activities in the Northwest Territories 
and the new found wealth with the diamond mining activities in 
jobs and increased economic activities.  What I was trying to get 
the hon. member to comment on is that once the park boundaries 
are formed, we exclude those types of activities.  We will not 
have mining within the boundaries of that park, no matter what is 
eventually found in the way of underground resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he believe that before we establish parks across the 
country all the necessary research be done so that the country 
and the people understand very clearly what they may be giving up 
when we establish the boundaries and exclude industrial activity? 
I am not denying that this is necessary in this case to protect 
the calving grounds of the Bluenose caribou herd. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> Madam Speaker, I think I now understand 
better the hon. member's question, and I thank him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are indeed faced with a dilemma as to whether we should give 
priority to the protection of our ecosystem, at the expense of 
possible industrial development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very real dilemma. A more in-depth study of the bill by a 
committee and the hearing of witnesses will help us see just 
what the implications are.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the bill still allows for development of the land for 
economic purposes. We have to determine how far this development 
can go. Is this national park subject to the same restrictions 
as Canada's other national parks? All this will have to be 
closely examined in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I should remind the Reform Party member that the 
objectives pursued by such a bill include some basic elements. 
Fundamental issues are at stake, including the protection of the 
region's ecosystem, which is unique in North America, and that 
of the culture and heritage of the people who live in that 
territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, as I pointed out earlier, there are extraordinary 
opportunities for economic development that must also be taken 
into account in assessing the benefits and the drawbacks for 
local people, when they give up, as the hon. member mentioned, 
certain rights for the establishment of a national park.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, on behalf 
of my colleague, the member Churchill River and the NDP parks 
critic, I am very glad to speak on Bill C-38, an act to amend the 
National Parks Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this bill is to establish the boundaries for a 
new national park in Canada's western Arctic called Tuktut 
Nogait. New Democrats support Bill C-38.  Tuktut Nogait national 
park is an important step toward the completion of the Parks 
Canada objective for national parks, to protect for all time 
representative natural areas of Canadian significance in a system 
of national parks and to encourage public understanding, 
appreciation and enjoyment of this natural heritage so as to 
leave it unimpaired for future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our system of national parks and national historic sites is one 
of Canada's, indeed the world's, greatest treasures.  This noble 
effort began a century ago with Banff National Park and continues 
with Tuktut Nogait today.  This vision for the preservation of 
Canada's natural spaces rests on a fundamental principle to 
protect a representative sample of each of our special 
landscapes.  Canada was divided into 39 distinct national park 
natural regions with physiology and vegetation as a basis for 
policy to achieve this goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To date just over 60% of this goal has been completed.  A great 
deal of work and political leadership is required to complete the 
vision.  Unfortunately it is not expected that the noble effort 
of the national park system will be completed by the Liberal 
government by the year 2000, another failed promise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tuktut Nogait national park is representative of the tundra 
hills, a unique region of the Canadian shield.  This tundra 
landscape includes spectacular river canyons, areas of scientific 
interest, archeological sites and abundant wildlife.  Elevated 
areas within the park's boundaries are designated as refugia.  A 
refugium is an area with a population of organisms that can 
survive through periods of unfavourable conditions.  Northern 
Yukon is the only other comparable area of the mainland Arctic 
with similar biota. Canadians will recall that this government 
abandoned a glacial refugium in Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this park evidence of human use and occupation over the last 
millennium exists.  Protection of the hundreds of archeological 
sites is imperative.  The knowledge garnered from these sites 
will provide answers to questions on the development of Thule 
Inuit culture in the regions and the origins of Inuit society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Visitors to the park will experience a pristine Arctic 
wilderness.  The wilderness, birds and vegetation cover the 
spectrum of northern species.  Abundant caribou, musk ox, wolves, 
birds and other northern wildlife will be protected by the 
national park designation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a community idea to protect this area, a portion of the 
Melville Hills east of Inuvik in the Northwest Territories, which 
led to a community prepared conservation plan in 1989. The 
primary goals contained in the 1996 parks agreement were to 
protect the Bluenose caribou herd and its calving and 
post-calving habitat and to protect for all time a representative 
natural area of Canadian significance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Paulatuk, the closest community to the park, recognized the 
importance of this area and acted upon the community wishes to 
preserve this integral part of its history, culture and 
livelihood.  On behalf of the New Democrats I would like to 
commend Paulatuk for the initiative, dedication and perseverance 
to establish Tuktut Nogait. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seven years of consultation and discussions led to the consensus 
decision of 1996.  The boundaries are set out in Bill C-38 in 
accordance with the 1996 agreement signed by the Government of 
Canada, the Northwest Territories, the Inuvialuit Regional 
Corporation, the Inuvialuit Game Council, the Paulatuk Community 
Corporation and the Paulatuk Hunters and Trappers Committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The boundaries for Tuktut Nogait are unique for several reasons. 
I ask my colleagues to pay attention to what I am about to say on 
this point.  It is important that we understand the very complex 
origin of this national park to better appreciate the incredible 
levels of co-operation and consensus building which led to the 
bill before the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tuktut Nogait lies within three land claim agreement areas:  the 
Inuvialuit Settlement Region or ISR, which encompasses 
approximately 58% of the park area; the Nunavut Settlement Region 
including about 36% of the area; and the Sahtu Dene and Metis 
claim area including about 6% of the park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call upon my colleagues to imagine the consultation, 
discussions and negotiations that evolved across the years 
between the different parties united in a common purpose to 
protect this significant natural area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tuktut Nogait national park includes over 16,000 square 
kilometres.  The parties came together around the absolute 
necessity of protecting the core calving ground vital for the 
Bluenose herd's survival.  The parks name, Tuktut Nogait, means 
caribou calves in the Siglik dialect, a direct reference to the 
park's purpose.  I also note at this time that this area is 
important to the Bathurst herd in addition to the Bluenose herd. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason for explaining the significance of the consensus 
forming is relevant when one considers recent efforts to change 
the boundaries of the park.  It is an issue that will arise 
during committee submissions and will contribute to the final 
decisions on the ratification of Bill C-38 boundaries as outlined 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleagues are no doubt aware, there is a magnetic anomaly 
that straddles the Tuktut Nogait's western boundary.  This 
anomaly is said to rival the Voisey's Bay discovery and, if 
developed, could be a source of jobs and fiscal rewards to the 
region and of mineral extraction interests.  Some 80% of the 
anomaly is located outside the park boundaries.  In 1994 Darnley 
Bay Resources Limited of Toronto voluntarily relinquished 
exploration rights to the remaining 20%, the area within the park 
boundaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the developers have changed their minds and Darnley Bay 
launched a recent effort to delete an approximate 415 square 
kilometres from the park boundaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This may not seem like such a big concern, especially when to 
most observers looking at a flat map the proposed area the 
developers wish to delete appears insignificant when compared to 
the overall scope of the park.  Nothing could be further from the 
truth for several reasons.  First and foremost, the thought that 
it is okay to shrink a national park boundary to permit mineral 
development is reprehensible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be hypocritical for the government to chastise our 
American neighbours regarding development impacts upon the 
Porcupine herd calving grounds in Alaska's Arctic National 
Wildlife Reserve while allowing development to harm the Bluenose 
herd calving grounds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second reason is that the location of the proposed deletion 
is crucial to the overall biodiversity of the park.  The deleted 
area includes a section of the Hornaday River, critical char 
spawning habitat and acknowledged in company reports as part of 
Paulatuk's summer and fall fishing areas.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third reason is that it is the summer and fall caribou 
harvesting area.  A founding principle for the degrees of 
co-operation exhibited by all participants during the consensus 
process was the need to ensure the continuing provision of 
traditional sustenance and subsistence for the Inuvialuit, the 
Sahtu Dene, the Gwich'in and Metis people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also the proposed deletion includes the most probable main entry 
point to the park. Does a mining interest wish to dictate access 
to the park or collect gate fees?  The proposed deletion area is 
located in the Inuvialuit settlement area.  They are in agreement 
with the developers and the territorial government for exclusion. 
The Sahtu Dene and the Gwich'in are opposed to the deletion. They 
fear the impact such development may have upon the core calving 
and post-calving grounds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As parliamentarians it is our duty to question the abrupt change 
in direction, a switch from the preservation of lands and 
heritage to a wish for development and its impact upon future 
generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why the sudden need for a deletion, an exemption by one 
participant that runs counter to the continuing process and 
perseverance of the other participants?  Are extracted ores more 
valuable than the survival of the 100,000 strong Bluenose caribou 
herd? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For centuries this herd has helped support northern peoples 
across Canada's Arctic, spanning thousands of kilometres and 
dozens of communities.  Does one mineral discovery merit the 
impact upon all native northern peoples? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why the sudden need to change the boundaries after seven years 
of consensus building?  Will the addition of an approximate 20% 
in development areas increase southern investment in the project 
for the benefit of those lucky shareholders involved? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take this moment to state clearly that the New Democratic 
Party is neither anti-mining nor anti-development.  We believe, 
though, that the development can occur and support projects that 
are environmentally, socially and economically sustainable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to recent decisions by the Liberal government such as 
the Cheviot decision where a federal minister okayed the 
destruction of fish habitat, the NDP fully support the 
sustainable development principles as described by the Brundtland 
commission in 1987: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Development that meets the needs of the present without 
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own 
needs. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the principle of sustainable development is the reason 
Paulatuk set out to protect this area in 1989 and led to the bill 
before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call to the attention of my colleagues that this is not a 
recent discovery or find.  The first clue to the anomaly was 
identified in 1955, over 40 years ago.  In 1969 the geological 
survey of Canada described the Paulatuk find, titled the Darnley 
Bay gravity anomaly, as the strongest gravity anomaly in North 
America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The following year a magnetic anomaly was identified coincident 
with the gravity anomaly.  I am not a geologist, obviously. 
However I can understand the excitement in the mining industry 
during the early 1990s when sampling of basic sills identified 
minor amounts of copper, nickel and platinum group elements.  At 
that time things were looking pretty good for extraction and the 
environmental implications on the Bluenose core calving grounds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After decades of speculation about a significant mineral find 
surrounding Paulatuk, exploration permits were awarded to Darnley 
Bay Resources.  In 1994, after the sampling results were 
favourable to extraction, Darnley Bay voluntarily relinquished 
those permits within the park boundaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why the change?  Is it the depressed metals markets?  What 
became of the founding principles for the co-operation to protect 
critical wildlife habitat and to preserve a representative 
example of the Tundra Hills natural region? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the questions and answers we still have to discuss at 
committee.  They are some of the questions and answers we will 
face as parliamentarians as we defend the 1996 boundaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the government for displaying a rare instance of 
intestinal fortitude and moral conscience in an environmental 
matter.  The minister of heritage has changed direction on park 
commercialization levels on occasion.  The lack of Liberal 
foresight and planning and a lack of respect for Jasper National 
Park, a world heritage site, resulted in an international 
condemnation and a terse letter from UNESCO regarding the Cheviot 
decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberal ignorance in habitat protection through the Cheviot 
decision evolved into legal challenges and Canadians learning 
about another international embarrassment via their morning 
newspapers and televised news conferences. 
Canadians are continually learning about poor Liberal habitat 
policies and the repeated loss of our reputation as protectors of 
wilderness areas and stewards of a clean environment.

the government and a decision that the New Democratic Party will 
support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Bill C-38 is discussed at committee I urge my colleagues not 
to be swayed by submissions and witnesses that put forward a 
variety of arguments to promote boundary changes.  As a submitter 
presents facts and data that suggest 5% of the core calving area 
can be removed, I ask them to question where that 5% is located 
and the significant effect that a small 5% slice could have upon 
the overall Bluenose caribou population; the loss of char 
spawning areas; where muskox will mate; the further loss of 
Canada's extremely limited refugium areas; and the impact upon 
fragile wild flowers and lichens where few footsteps have tread. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When jobs are discussed they should remember the capacity for 
sustainable development and the unforgiving limits the tundra 
environment allows for habitat and species recovery, and the 
centuries required to repair basic intrusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When socioeconomics are discussed they should remember the 
benefits that are presented through eco-tourism and the unique 
variety of enterprises available to the community:  bird 
watching, hiking, camping, natural appreciation, natural and 
environmental sciences, archeology and photography.  The list 
continues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ten years of studies of the Bluenose herd have identified the 
necessity for the preservation and the location of core calving 
and post-calving areas.  They should not be swayed by 
pro-development arguments that more studies are required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must protect the current boundaries of Bill C-38, the 
designation of Tuktut Nogait national park in the National Parks 
Act for generations yet unborn.  To shrink a national park 
boundary to permit mineral development is reprehensible and 
should not be tolerated. 
<P><A NAME="LINK8"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to speak in favour of Bill C-38, an act to amend the 
National Parks Act to include Tuktut Nogait in the schedule of 
national parks. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed site for Tuktuk Nogait Park is close to Paulatuk, 
in the western part of Canada's Arctic. In 1989, the community 
of Paulatuk submitted to the federal government a conservation 
plan recommending that a new park be established to protect the 
calving ground of the Bluenose caribou herd. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 the federal government announced its willingness to 
establish a national park near Paulatuk.  In 1996 the governments 
of Canada and the Northwest Territories, the Inuvialuit Regional 
Corporation, the Inuvialuit Game Council, the Paulatuk Community 
Corporation and the Paulatuk Hunters and Trappers Committee 
signed an agreement to establish a national park in the 
Inuvialuit settlement region near Paulatuk in the Northwest 
Territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreement also recognized the boundaries of Tuktut Nogait 
which represent approximately 16,304 square kilometres.  It is 
also important to note that this area represents the Tundra Hill 
national region, an area not currently represented under the 
national parks system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that it has taken the government so long to 
bring in a simple piece of legislation that would see the 
establishment of Tuktut Nogait.  In consequence, the government 
has delayed the creation of long term meaningful jobs and 
economic growth for the north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the members of the House heard yesterday, the Government of 
the Northwest Territories is reviewing a request by the 
Inuvialuit Regional Corporation to remove part of the lands 
agreed upon in the 1996 agreement.  What we are talking about 
here is the removal of 415 square kilometres to permit mineral 
development within the core calving ground of the Bluenose 
caribou herd.

carving out parts of our national parks to make mining companies 
more attractive to investors.  The proposed reduction of Tuktut 
Nogait for mineral development would set a dangerous precedent 
for this park and other parks that are not protected under the 
National Parks Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind the House that we are awaiting amendments 
to our ore legislation for seven other parks which represent 20% 
of the national parks system.  I want to assure my colleagues

natural heritage is preserved for our generation and generations

S-3, an act to amend the Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985 and 
the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Act, 
be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK12"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Revenue, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I appreciate this 
opportunity to speak today in support of Bill S-3.  This 
legislation offers concrete and well-considered measures to 
enhance the supervision of federally regulated private pension 
plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members know, this bill was introduced through the 
Senate on September 30 last year and was reported back on 
November 4 with seven amendments.  I would like to take this 
opportunity to thank the Senate committee for its rigorous review 
of the bill and the thoughtful amendments that were made.  I will 
highlight the thrust of these amendments later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Updating the Pension Benefits Standards Act 1985, or the PBSA as 
it is usually called, is long overdue.  I would like to explain 
to my hon. colleagues that the PBSA is the legislation that 
governs private pension plans in sectors subject to federal 
jurisdiction. Examples of these sectors include banking, 
interprovincial transportation and telecommunications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PBSA is administered by the Office of the Superintendent of 
Financial Institutions, or OSFI as it is usually called, on 
behalf of our federal government.  Of Canada's 16,000 pension 
plans, 1,100 are covered by the PBSA. They represent 
approximately $45 billion or 10% of the asset value of all 
private pension plans in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the number of Canadian seniors growing rapidly, I want to 
assure the House that ensuring sound secure pension plan systems 
has been and continues to be a priority of the government.  My 
hon. colleagues know that over the past two years the government 
has embarked on a dramatic reform to the public component of the 
national pension system.

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only is the old age security program being transformed into 
a revised seniors benefit, but also more recently there was the 
federal-provincial agreement to reform the Canada pension plan. 
These are two of the three pillars of retirement security for 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Private pension plans represent that vital third pillar.  Here 
too there is a need for action, although much less dramatic since 
prudent supervision and good governance are the issues that need 
to be addressed with respect to private pension plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I stated earlier, these changes are long overdue.  The PBSA 
has not been materially revised since it came into force in early 
1987. This is in contrast to the federal institutions legislation 
where the supervisory and prudential systems were significantly 
strengthened in 1992, 1995 and again in 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that the PBSA needs to be updated.  While 
most federally regulated pension plans are fully funded, some 
pension plans have come under financial pressure as a result of 
both demographic and economic factors.  These include the aging 
workforce and corporate downsizing we have experienced in Canada. 
These are two factors which make pension funding relatively more 
expensive for employers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this environment there have also been solvency concerns with 
some plans while others have been wound up without sufficient 
assets to pay all the promised benefits.  In these situations the 
employer, whether a single employer or an industry group, 
experienced economic difficulty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition many pension plans made substantial improvements to 
pension benefits in the 1980s with the expectation that employers 
would always be able to fund them.  This also added to the 
challenges.  In some cases insufficient contributions were made 
to fund these improvements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As these problems emerged it became clear that the current 
prudential and supervisory framework is not equipped to deal with 
problem plans.  The range of powers and regulatory components 
needed are not there.  Bill S-3 meets these challenges.  Under 
this legislation the federal government and the Office of the 
Superintendent of Financial Institutions will have additional 
necessary powers to work with plans that are experiencing 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to go into the basic principles.  I want to assure hon. 
members that these are not patchwork band-aid measures. The 
measures in Bill S-3 flow from a series of basic principles 
outlined in the government's July 1996 white paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Included are the principles that private pension plans are 
supervised for the benefit of members, retirees and other 
beneficiaries; that the pension regulatory and supervisory 
framework should contain the incentives and safeguards necessary 
to reduce the possibility that pension promises are not met; and 
also that early intervention in and resolution of pension plans 
experiencing some difficulty should occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Outside supervision cannot and will not be expected to guarantee 
that pension promises will always be met nor can it be a 
substitute for good governance of the plans by the administrators 
of those plans.  Regulation and supervision must be cost 
effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The regulatory framework for private pension plans should not 
impose undue costs on existing plans or unduly inhibit the 
creation of new pension plans.  Members of private plans should 
receive adequate information from the administrator concerning 
the financial condition of their plan. There must be appropriate 
accountability and transparency in the supervisory process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to discuss the basic principles in more detail.  The 
first principle helps us to focus on what pension plans are. They 
are really employee benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employers, and often employees, contribute to these plans but 
let us keep in mind that employees often have no opportunity to 
withdraw from their employer plan while they work for the 
organization.  Without the opportunity to cease making 
contributions, employees must rely on the plan's administrator to 
make sound financial decisions with their money so that benefits 
will be available for them in the future. 
It is precisely because of this situation that the government 
believes OSFI must have new powers to resolve the troubled plan's 
problems early on.

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly when an employer's economic difficulties affect a 
pension plan and a plan fails to manage its risks, it is to the 
advantage of the plan's members, retirees and other beneficiaries 
to have the situation resolved promptly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This should not necessarily mean that the plan be terminated. 
There may well be other approaches and actions that can more 
fully preserve the employees' contributions and benefits.  Yet 
termination is currently the only supervisory tool available to 
OSFI. This leads to another closely related point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that our regulatory approach recognize that the 
termination of a pension plan with insufficient assets to pay the 
promised benefits does not in and of itself represent a failure 
of the supervisory process.  Even in vibrant economies, pension 
plans occasionally terminate with insufficient assets to pay the 
promised benefits. The health of pension plans is inescapably 
tied to the health of the pension plan employer and the industry 
in which it operates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a market economy some companies will inevitably encounter 
problems.  This is simply business reality.  The corollary then 
is clear.  With insufficient assets to pay all promised benefits, 
no supervisory system could even begin to forestall any pension 
plan termination without the authority and resources to oversee 
all management decisions made by the sponsor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if it could work in theory, such total supervision is 
neither feasible nor desirable.  Without question this is not a 
viable approach in a dynamic economy like that which Canada 
enjoys.  What is required is a balanced approach that melds 
appropriate supervision with responsible internal governance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to highlight one final principle.  That is the need 
for transparency of the supervisory system, a similar one to the 
financial institutions supervisory system.  If the financial 
condition of a pension plan deteriorates, it is important that 
pension plan administrators understand the steps authorities 
could be expected to take.  This understanding provides a 
realistic and credible incentive for plan supervisors to act in a 
timely fashion.  Furthermore the supervisor must have a clearly 
defined role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Amendments in this bill to OSFI's mandate include recognition of 
the importance of OSFI taking prompt action to deal with pension 
plans in trouble.  To complement Bill S-3, a guide to 
intervention clarifying actions that could be expected in the 
role of OSFI in various situations has also been introduced. 
This guide is similar to ones issued for financial institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to move on to another aspect of this legislation. 
Bill S-3 allows for the future introduction of a simplified 
pension plan.  This measure is intended to help small employers 
and to foster an environment that provides incentives for the 
creation of new pension plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The low pension plan participation rate of small businesses 
suggests that the traditional pension plans do not adequately 
meet the needs and expectations of small employers.  The 
government believes that action is necessary and needed to 
correct this situation.  Bill S-3 opens the door for the creation 
of a cost effective regime for pension plans below a certain 
size, for example, one with 250 members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a simplified pension plan, financial institutions could 
propose standard pension contracts containing both general and 
specific provisions for the small employer.  In addition, 
financial institutions would be responsible for administering the 
pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Standardizing pension plan contracts and transferring 
responsibilities for plan administration to financial 
institutions will greatly reduce costs for the small employer. 
The details of this regime will be introduced later through 
regulations.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the health minister has used the word “compassion” 
dozens of times this week when he was asked why he abandoned 
thousands of hepatitis C victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The arguments he advances for justifying the government's 
position are legal arguments, accounting arguments and political 
arguments.  There is no real compassion in either the 
government's position or in the minister's deeds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the compassion in abandoning tens of thousands of 
victims of poisoned blood who were infected through government 
negligence? 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the government does have compassion.  The government is 
concerned.  It is expressing its compassion and concern in a 
practical way by putting forward $800 million aimed at helping 
tens of thousands of victims of this tragic situation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a reflection on compassion.  Just a few weeks ago 
this is what the health minister was saying to victims of 
poisoned blood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said “We have to remember what this is about.  It is not 
about fiscal federalism.  It is not about politics.  It is about 
providing compassionate and fair and appropriate compensation to 
people who were injured through no fault of their own and we have 
to keep our eye on that goal”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the health minister take his eye off that goal? 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
all governments in the country that worked together on this 
difficult problem kept their eye on the goal of doing the right 
thing in accordance with sound public policy.  All governments, 
all ministers of health, worked together toward showing 
compassion as the Deputy Prime Minister has said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have now created an offer of $1.1 billion for the direct 
benefit of over 22,000 victims of this tragedy.  That, in the 
judgment of every government in the country of every political 
stripe, is the appropriate response to this tragedy. 
<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there used to be a day when ministers would actually 
resign rather than violate the principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the health minister actually believes that this decision 
should have been based on compassion and morality rather than on 
legal or accounting arguments, why did he not go in to the Prime 
Minister and say “these are the principles I am committed to. If 
you can't accept them and if the cabinet can't accept them, then 
find someone else to do your dirty work?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister is really committed to compassion and morality, 
why did he not resign rather than violate those principles? 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, is the Leader of the Opposition saying that Premier 
Ralph Klein of Alberta lacks compassion and morality when he said 
about this deal, referring to Premier Clark of British Columbia, 
“Without wanting to sound critical of Premier Clark, it seems to 
be sort of late in the game to start to change the rules and to 
express concerns?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is he saying that Premier Klein of Alberta lacks compassion?

that he would be their guardian.  He said in fact that he would 
be their champion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today those victims ended up here on Parliament Hill and the 
minister somehow did not meet them. 
They ended up pounding white crosses into the lawn in front of 
his office to tell him what they think of him.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member should know that in the course of the past 
several months I have met with many victims of the tainted blood 
tragedy, spoke to them directly, spoke to them about the approach 
being taken toward compensation and personally explained to those 
victims, as I have in the House of Commons, the reason for the 
approach taken by all governments in the country toward the issue 
of compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I explained to them that as the ministers of health looked at 
the history of these tragic events they found there was a period 
between 1986 and 1990 when governments could and should have 
acted and did not, and that is the basis on which compensation is 
being offered. 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we have a 
solution for the public relations nightmare the minister is 
facing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>B.C. has said that it is ready to move.  Saskatchewan is now 
ready to have a conference call on the issue.  Why does the 
health minister not just lead a new charge for a supplementary 
compensation package for all the victims of hepatitis C so that 
he can once again look those victims straight in the eye? 
<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
every provincial government stands solidly behind this agreement. 
Every provincial government respects the agreement that they 
themselves negotiated, including British Columbia and Quebec. 
Every province and both territories stand solidly with the 
agreement that they negotiated.

Canada's ambassador to China and the senior official responsible 
for operation unity at the time of the referendum told the Bloc

Quebecois could ask all the questions it likes on Option Canada, 
it would find out nothing, because it was he who spent the 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration.

<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker,  it 
is very simple.  We, and most Quebeckers and other Canadians, 
support the Canadian option.  The leader of the Bloc Quebecois 
opposes it and he is mistaken. 
<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Deputy 
Prime Minister can certainly not justify the expenditure of 
public funds by not responding to any question on the pretext 
that he is defending Canada.  Is that what I am to understand 
from his response?  It does not make any sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask him whether the minister responsible for operation 
unity at the time, now the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, could confirm that the link between operation unity 
and Option Canada was such that the senior official of one 
ordered the other to spend? 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Godfrey (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have already answered 
all these questions many times.  We have submitted over one 
hundred pages of responses.  The matter is totally clear.  There 
are very few responses, because we have already provided the 
documents required and requested. 
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
remind the House that Mr. Bullock, now the Canadian ambassador 
to China, was then director of Operation Unity and therefore 
reported directly to the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since Option Canada's budgets were apparently spent, as she 
herself said, by the director of the Operation Unity team, how 
could the minister claim not to be perfectly aware of how the 
$4.8 million given by the federal government to Option Canada 
right in the middle of the referendum campaign was spent? 
<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
first, the question is based on false premises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we know that the Standing Orders do not allow ministers 
to comment on their previous responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat, it is too bad, but most Quebeckers and other Canadians 
support the Canada option and the Bloc Quebecois is opposed to 
it.  Present polls show that the Bloc Quebecois is mistaken in 
its criticism.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the federal government could already rely on the services 
of Operation Unity, which had a budget of almost $12 million at 
the time, a budget which could easily have been increased if 
necessary, why did the federal government pay almost $5 million 
to a phoney organization like Option Canada, unless it needed a

requirements?

changes will have to be made in future.  We then answered the 
questions asked.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, small 
private woodlot owners are being penalized by the federal tax 
code for following environmentally responsible standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national round table on the environment and the economy 
report tabled last October recommended that private woodlot 
owners be treated as small business owners.  This would require a 
change to the tax code to allow sound forestry management 
practices and silviculture expenses to be deductible from their 
taxes against their income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Minister of Finance.  What is the 
government's response to the round table's recommendation, and 
when can private woodlot owners expect a change? 
<P><A NAME="LINK76"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for giving me advance notice of 
the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my understanding that there is a differential between the 
odd woodlot owner and a woodlot owner who has a business plan and 
is actually in the business.  Owners under the second category 
are considered to be in the business of operating the woodlot and 
would be able to claim silviculture expenses.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The national roundtable also recommended that private woodlot 
owners be provided with the same capital gains tax exemption 
currently available to farmers.  At present if an owner wishes to 
pass on their woodlot to an heir it is more advantageous to 
clearcut the woodlot and pay less capital gains tax than manage 
the woodlot in an environmentally sound manner.  The current tax 
code offers an incentive to prematurely clearcut woodlots rather 
than use sustainable forestry practices.

there is sound reason for the approach taken by the governments

</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer the hon. member, for example, to the writing this week 
of Professor Bernard Dickens of the medical law and ethics 
faculty of the University of Toronto. He wrote at length an 
analysis that was published in the popular press about the proper 
role of government when it comes to a tragedy like this and the 
distinction between paying compensation based on accepting 
responsibility and going beyond that and the implications for the

infecting those victims before 1986.  He believes it was an

that in the period 1986 to 1990 something could have been done to 
manage the risks.  Something should have been done to prevent the 
infections and it was not.

the health minister is running out of excuses.  One of the lame 
excuses he trots out is that if he compensated all the victims it 
would open up the legal floodgates.  He said that anybody who is 
sick would sue the government.  But that is ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These victims are not suing because they are sick.  They are 
suing because the government made them sick.  It is government 
negligence that is to blame.  That legal precedent has already 
been set through the treatment of AIDS victims who are now 
compensated on the principle of negligence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why the two tier standard? 
<P><A NAME="LINK91"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I made the point that in the HIV example of 10 years ago the 
government proceeded on the same principle.  It looked at what 
happened.  It found that government should have been more 
vigilant, should have put surveillance systems in place, should 
have been more keenly aware of what was going on in Europe and 
other countries, and did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the basis of that, compensation was offered.  We are using 
the same principle in this case.  It is a sound principle.  It is 
a principle accepted by every government in this country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK92"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the principle is that when the government is negligent it should 
pay. The government was negligent because it had a test that 
could have screened for hepatitis C as far back as 1981.  That is 
when the German government started using the same test to screen 
for hepatitis C.  The facts are irrefutable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should have screened for hepatitis C as far back 
as 1981 but it did not.  That is called negligence.  Some people 
would call it malpractice.  I call it just plain wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why will the health minister not right this wrong?  Why will he 
not compensate the victims? 
<P><A NAME="LINK93"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  First, Mr. 
Speaker, it is accepted by most commentators who know the history 
of this file that it was in 1986 that Canada ought to have 
adopted testing procedures.  I rely, among others, on the Krever 
report in that connection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member refers to 1981.  Is he now arguing against his 
colleagues by suggesting compensation should only go to 1981 and 
not before that?  The Reform Party should decide on one approach 
to this issue because it is contradicting itself.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, given that these discussions will be taking place on the 
compensation package, it would be helpful for the Minister of 
Health to address the real question about whether or not 1986 
makes sense at all in terms of liability.  We do know as 
previously mentioned there was a study, a report in 1981 showing 
that surrogate testing was recommended and the department of 
health and the Red Cross turned it down because of expense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it the minister's position that the victims who were

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is possible to find reports, whether here or in other 
countries, of isolated suggestions of tests before 1986.  There 
is no question about that.  It is referred to in the Krever 
chronology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is it was in early 1986 that experts agreed it was 
incumbent upon those responsible in this country to respond and 
to put the systems in place.  They chose not to do so and the 
consequences were tragic.  It is for that reason we have chosen 
that year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is broad support in many circles for that approach.  I 
refer to the Saskatoon <I>Star Phoenix</I> editorial of this week 
which said that the health ministers, who had to evaluate the 
Krever “recommendations in the context of their ramifications on 
the entire health system, made a difficult but justifiable 
decision”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Last Saturday I had the pleasure of meeting with some members of

along with all merchant navy vets risked their lives during World

</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister keeps saying that the merchant navy vets are equal 
under Bill C-84 but there are 40 restrictions applied to them

brought legislation forward which gave the merchant seamen 
veteran status under the act.  I say to her that they did receive 
that and they will continue to receive it.  There will be further

<P><A NAME="LINK123"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, there are 
40 restrictions so they are not totally equal. The men and women 
of the merchant navy have become so disillusioned that they are 
planning a hunger strike on Parliament Hill for May 12 if they 
are denied again what is rightfully theirs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why now are we failing to help those who gave us freedom?  These 
men and women are requesting a small compensation settlement for 
the many years in which they were not recognized.  Is the

immediately to correct this injustice?

for.  All of the members who were merchant seamen with high seas

years ago our government set up independent drug testing in the 
wake of the thalidomide disaster, a disaster which made Canadians 
realize we needed control over drug safety and that health 
outranked cost considerations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, rather than protect public safety, the government is 
interested in the controlling of costs at all costs.  To save a 
few bucks the Liberals threaten to put many more Canadian lives 
in jeopardy by giving effective control over drug approval to the 
drug manufacturers themselves.  How does the health minister 
justify substituting commercial and corporate interests for the 
public interest? 
<P><A NAME="LINK136"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
for Health Canada, public safety is the bottom line.  We have 
excellent professionals in the department who conduct the 
appropriate tests and investigations before any drugs are 
approved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To remove any doubt and to ensure public confidence in the 
excellence of their work, I have appointed a science advisory 
board chaired by Dr. Roberta Bondar, herself a distinguished 
scientist.  They will look at the science capacity in the 
department.  They will report to me and I shall make public their 
report on the question of whether we have the people we need in 
the Department of Health to fulfil our important public 
responsibilities.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill S-3, an 
act to amend the Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985 and the 
Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Act, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  When the House broke for question 
period the hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of

<P><A NAME="LINK186"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Revenue, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will try to wrap it 
up a little earlier than the full 29 minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe when I left off I was speaking about standardizing 
pension plan contracts and transferring, especially for the small 
employer, some plan administration responsibility to financial 
institutions as a cost reduction measure.  The details of this 
regime will be introduced later through regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to move now to speak about reducing regulatory 
burden. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Bill S-3 the Minister of Finance would be able to enter 
into a multilateral supervisory agreement that is currently being 
developed by OSFI and the provincial pension regulators through 
the Canadian Association of Pension Supervisory Authorities, 
known as CAPSA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>OSFI has been participating in this development for upwards of 
two years now.  By reducing the number of rules to be complied 
with the regulatory burden facing multi-jurisdictional plans will 
be reduced.  This goal is consistent with the government's 
objective of reducing overall regulatory burden. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While a number of issues remain to be worked out it makes sense 
to include the authority to enter into this agreement now to make 
way for future reductions in regulatory burden.  In drafting this 
package I should point out that the government reviewed 
legislation in other jurisdictions in order to benefit from their 
experience and to minimize any regulatory differences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have highlighted the key principles underlying the proposed 
legislation and now I want to turn to some of the specifics of 
Bill S-3 itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will start with OSFI's supervisory focus, wherein Bill S-3 
replaces OSFI's obligation to review all plan documents and 
amendments with the requirement that plan administrators certify 
at the time of their filing that documents and amendments meet 
the regulatory requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This change focuses the ultimate responsibility for the plan 
administration where it belongs, on the plan administrators.  In 
turn, this allows OSFI to allocate resources to solvency concerns 
or higher risk plans.  This refocusing is consistent with the 
government's intention to further clarify OSFI's mandate.  It 
must also be noted that OSFI retains the right to review 
documents and amendments on a case by case basis and will do so 
as appropriate.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, the superintendent currently has very 
limited powers to take remedial actions with respect to a pension 
plan.  Bill S-3 introduces several specific new authorities and I 
will only describe the most important of these. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most significant is the authority to issue directions of 
compliance to plans regarding conduct which is contrary to safe 
and sound financial or business practices and for breaches of the 
act.  This is similar to the power in the financial institutions 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-3 introduces an appropriate due process along with the 
authority for the superintendent to seek a court order requiring 
compliance with the direction.  In addition, Bill S-3 gives the 
superintendent the authority to attend and call meetings with an 
administrator or to require an administrator to call a meeting 
with members and other professionals in attendance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This authority could be used when OSFI believes that the pension 
plan members or all the members of a particular plan's board of 
trustees are not fully apprised of the problem.  The 
superintendent will also have the authority to obtain independent 
professional advice at the expense of the plan.  Some plans 
routinely neglect to file reports required by OSFI to adequately 
monitor plan solvency.  This authority will help the 
superintendent to have these reports prepared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the superintendent will be able to remove an 
administrator and appoint a replacement when a plan is being 
wound up and circumstances suggest that members' interests are 
not best served by the incumbent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to take a minute to cover the funding rules which 
have been advanced under this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Bill S-3 the superintendent must approve any benefit 
enhancements that reduce the plan solvency ratio below the 
prescribed rates or levels.  This reflects the government's 
belief that it is not appropriate for pension plans already 
experiencing financial difficulties to make improvements when 
there is no way for the employer to increase funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have received some concerns, as I am sure my colleagues have, 
with respect to this approach.  It is important for this House to 
understand what concerns have been voiced and to know that the 
government is working to address them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we want the House to realize that the concerns being 
raised relate primarily to the solvency threshold which plans 
must maintain in order to improve benefits.  This bill does not 
specify that threshold.  Those details will be provided in the 
regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our original white paper indicated the government was looking at 
requiring that plans now show a solvency ratio of 105% after an 
amendment, with this requirement being phased in steadily over 
approximately a 15 year period.  Subsequently a range of experts 
was consulted on this proposal.  Professional and industry groups 
and unions have pointed out that this threshold may be too high 
and that more flexibility is desired.  Consultation is continuing 
on the regulation that will provide the details behind this 
provision while recognizing that it serves pension plan members 
no great service to be promised benefit improvements that cannot 
be delivered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alternatives are being considered for achieving the same result. 
This could involve a lower threshold accompanied by realistic 
commitments from the plan to fund itself in an appropriate 
manner.  There may also be other options that will emerge as this 
work is further fleshed out.  It should be made clear that the 
government will undertake considerable consultation prior to the 
issuance of the regulations associated in particular with this 
provision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will spend a couple of moments on the arbitration process for 
surplus assets.  In the white paper interested parties were 
invited to comment on proposals dealing with entitlement to 
pension plan surplus assets.  Many comments were received but not 
many concrete suggestions were made.  Most comments indicated 
that this is a difficult area to legislate and any improvement 
would be welcomed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government believes that Bill S-3 facilitates arrangements 
between employers and employees concerning the use of surplus 
assets in two ways.  It provides a lower cost alternative to 
going to court and it promotes an environment where employers and 
employees work toward a mutually satisfactory compromise.

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Briefly, Bill S-3 proposes that if entitlement to surplus assets 
is not clearly demonstrated in the pension plan documents then 
the employer can propose to the employees a surplus withdrawal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If more than two thirds of the employees consent and required 
solvency thresholds are met, the superintendent may approve the 
withdrawal.  For ongoing plans, if less than two thirds but more 
than one half of the employees consent, then the employer can opt 
to seek arbitration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Originally Bill S-3 provided that for plans being wound up if 
less than two thirds but more than one half of the employees 
consented, arbitration would be mandatory.  As I noted earlier, 
the Senate made a few amendments to the bill, all dealing with 
the surplus issue. The Senate was concerned about certain 
situations regarding plans in the wind-ups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the point of view of pension plan members and retirees, the 
timely statement, settlement and distribution of surplus assets 
is a priority.  We agree that this is a concern.  As such, the 
original bill had a certain no man's land. No definitive action 
to deal with surplus assets or surplus was required if less than 
one half of the employees consented to a proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate passed an amendment that requires arbitration within 
18 months after the termination of the plan, irrespective of 
consent levels achieved for any proposals.  The Senate also 
questioned the intent of the requirement for the superintendent 
to approve the withdrawal.  Clearly the intent is there to ensure 
that certain minimum solvency thresholds are maintained. 
Obviously the superintendent is not going to consent to a surplus 
withdrawal that would jeopardize plan solvency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate agreed with the intent but perceived that the 
original drafting of Bill S-3 provided the superintendent with 
pervasive scope for not consenting to a surplus withdrawal, in 
particular if the superintendent did not think that the deal was 
fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a concern that if an employer went through the rather 
lengthy consent and arbitration process the superintendent could 
arbitrarily deny the withdrawal.  As such, an amendment was passed 
by the Senate which requires that the superintendent in deciding 
whether to consent to a refund must recognize the claim of the 
employer to the surplus or part of the surplus, as arbitrated 
under the provisions of the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government believes that the Senate amendments fill gaps in 
Bill S-3, and we appreciate the additions.  Other more technical 
amendments were also passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The measures in this bill are the result of a broad consultation 
process.  When drafting this legislation the comments received on 
the initial proposals contained in the white paper were 
considered and the appropriate amendments made.  Provincial 
ministers responsible for the supervision of provincial pension 
acts were also invited to comment and there was ongoing 
consultation among pension supervisors throughout CAPSA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other proposals in the white paper not addressed in this 
legislation will be introduced later through regulation.  Areas 
such as additional disclosure requirements and funding rules are 
already dealt with through regulations, and this approach will 
continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other cases such as planned governance and investments, the 
government believes it is more appropriate to develop best 
practices.  We recognize that the size and other attributes of 
individual pension plans will effect governance structures and 
investment strategies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considerable additional consultation will take place prior to 
the implementation of these regulations and any resulting 
guidelines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time, on behalf of the government I would like to thank 
the Senate and the many industry participants and other 
stakeholders who provided constructive and insightful advice.  I 
can assure them that the government looks forward to additional 
feedback on its regulations and guidelines in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have highlighted the important issues dealt with in this 
legislation.  Bill S-3 will enhance the stability of Canada's 
private pension plan regime to the benefit of plan members 
throughout Canada.  Of that we are confident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage my hon. colleagues in the House to give speedy 
passage to this bill and I thank them for their attention.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I wish I could say at the outset that it is a pleasure 
for me to rise today to speak to Bill S-3 but it is not.  I say 
that not because I am particularly opposed to this piece of 
legislation but because I am very much opposed to the way the 
government has decided to introduce some of this substantive 
legislation through the other place. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1225"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-3, an act to amend the Pension Benefits Standards Act, 
1985 and the Office of the Superintendent of Financial 
Institutions Act, accomplishes four things.  First, it enhances 
the powers of the superintendent of financial institutions to 
supervise a pension plan which includes the authority to issue 
directions of compliance.  Second, it is designed to clarify that 
the office of the superintendent of financial institutions' focus 
with respect to the supervision of pension plans is on matters 
affecting the funding and financial condition of pension plans 
and not on reviewing the text of all pension plans and amendments 
that are filed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, it provides a mechanism for an employer to establish 
entitlement to surplus assets, including obtaining 
membership consent and access to an arbitration process.  Fourth, 
it authorizes the Minister of Finance to participate in 
agreements with designated provincial authorities respecting the 
application of provincial law to any pension plan that is subject 
to federal jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These changes are intended to improve the supervisory regime for 
pension plans under the PBSA which regulates approximately 1,100 
of Canada's 16,000 pension plans.  These changes also reduce the 
administrative burden regarding private sector pension plans and 
allows the office of the superintendent of financial institutions 
to have increased supervisory powers to take action when concern 
arises over the safety and soundness of a plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk about some of the highlights of this bill under two 
main areas.  The first area is that of administrative reductions. 
Under the amended bill, plan administrators will be allowed to 
certify that all pension plan amendments meet with the standards 
of the law.  This is instead of the present requirement which 
states that each change must be reviewed and improved 
individually.  The change will allow for greater time to be spent 
on other matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A new kind of simplified pension plan is also created under Bill 
S-3.  In this plan a small employer can use a standardized plan 
text administered through a financial institution such as a trust 
company.  This is designed to permit defined benefit plans to be 
extended to small employers who were formerly frozen out of 
offering such plans due to the high administrative costs involved 
in creating a customized plan.  This will be an added bonus for 
these small businesses. This bill will allow employers to act as 
administrators for plans established under collective agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second area is increased supervisory powers for the office 
of the superintendent of financial institutions, OSFI.  There are 
several increased supervisory powers for OSFI.  Most of these 
changes will allow the office of the superintendent of financial 
institutions greater powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some major changes include the following.  The superintendent 
will have the right to call meetings with plan administrators or 
to force administrators to call meetings with plan members to 
discuss problems.  The office of the superintendent of financial 
institutions may enforce changes to a plan before the plan faces 
bankruptcy.  Under existing legislation the superintendent has 
only two options, to close the plan down or to let it run. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Changes in this bill would also allow the OSFI to expect that 
the administrator of a plan would use such techniques as 
diversification and match assets to liabilities to avoid risks. 
The OSFI may issue directions of compliance, a kind of court 
order, to prohibit certain actions on the part of individual plan 
administrators.  The OSFI will be given the powers to remove 
administrators and replace them with a court appointed 
administrator when a plan is being wound up.  The OSFI will also 
be given the power to administer a new set of rules requiring 
that surplus assets in the wind-up of a plan will be distributed 
fairly and in an open manner.  A vote must be held among plan 
members to determine how the surplus will be distributed. 
In principle I support the bill, as does the official opposition. 
However, there are some serious concerns regarding how the bill 
came before us today and I mentioned that at the outset.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill was introduced and passed by the Senate of Canada and 
is before us today as the sober second thought before the bill is 
passed and given royal assent to become law.  It is ironic that a 
bill of this nature, one which would normally be introduced in 
this place and then sent to the Senate for final approval, is 
brought here by the very place that is to provide a second look 
at legislation normally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our House leader, the member for Langley—Abbotsford, raised a 
question of privilege on this very issue because of the nature of 
this place.  Three of the five political parties did not have the 
opportunity to discuss the bill in the first instance in the 
other place.  The hon. member also argued that a similar bill, 
Bill C-85 introduced in the 35th Parliament, received royal 
assent and did not this time.  There were also arguments made 
that this was a supply or in other words a money bill and we all 
know from Canadian history and politics courses that bills of 
this nature are only to be introduced in this Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speaker ruled this was not a question of privilege and that 
the bill is properly before the House now after being introduced 
and debated in the other place.  I am not arguing with the 
Speaker's judgement but I am calling into question why the 
government would have this legislation introduced in the other 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My main concern comes with the representation of the people of 
Canada.  There will be several individuals affected by this 
legislation and my concern is why the government introduced this 
particular piece of legislation in the Senate, an institution 
that is unelected and unaccountable to the citizens of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of Parliament I was elected by the people of Prince 
George—Peace River to represent them.  My constituents, knowing 
their feelings regarding the Senate, an unelected, unequal and 
what many perceive to be an ineffective institution, would not 
agree with this practice.  Many feel that I am their 
representative, not an individual appointed by the Prime Minister 
who may or may not serve the best interests of the province of 
British Columbia, depending on whether they actually show up for 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as the elected members of Parliament need to serve as the 
first voice for our constituents, not as the sober second thought 
of legislation.  That was the intent of the other place, and so 
it should remain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the intent of the bill before us today but not with 
the way it came to us to be debated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Kilger:</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
rise on a point of order. There have been discussions among 
representatives of all parties.  Some of our colleagues who would 
have liked to debate this subject matter are not present today 
but look forward to taking part when we resume the debate at a 
later date.  This is with particular reference to the members of 
the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think there would be consent that those who want to 
participate and are available for debate today do so and that 
when we return to this subject matter at a later date the 
representative for the Bloc Quebecois, in accordance with 
Standing Order 74, be given 40 minutes on debate if he or she so 
chooses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Madam Speaker, I just want the record to 
clearly show we have agreed to this in an honest attempt to try 
to keep our House working well together and I would like the 
record to show that the Bloc owes us one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Is there agreement to 
proceed as such? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo—Alberni, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
my discussion will centre not on the bill, because by and large 
we support portions of the bill, but on the origins of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill originated in the Senate, and this is where the Reform 
Party has some difficulty.  The Senate is unelected, 
unaccountable, unlike the House of Commons, and we feel bills 
should be originating in this House.  They then should go through 
the other place for sober second thought.  That is fine.  We 
agree with that.  However, we have major difficulty with having 
bills originate in the Senate 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason we have the difficulty is the unelected and biased 
nature of the other place.  I would like to go through the 
appointments the Prime Minister has made to the other place since 
he came to power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are 28 appointments and the reason I wish to go through 
this list is to show how biased the appointments are and that 
legislation originating in the other place has to be biased 
because of the make-up of the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister's appointments to the Senate were Sharon 
Carstairs, a former Manitoba Liberal leader; Landon Pearson, who 
is married to the son of former Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson; 
Lise Bacon, former Liberal deputy premier of Quebec; Jean-Robert 
Gauthier, a long time Liberal member of Parliament.  John G. 
Bryden was a candidate for Liberal leader in New Brunswick and 
managed the Prime Minister's 1990 New Brunswick Liberal 
leadership campaign.  The point I am making is that these people 
are all very biased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rose-Marie Losier-Cool has no patronage connection disclosed; 
Céline Hervieux-Payette, former Liberal cabinet minister under 
Prime Minister Trudeau; Marie-Paule Poulin, former deputy 
secretary to the cabinet in the privy council office.  These are 
all senators appointed by the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Doris Anderson has no patronage connection that was disclosed; 
Bill Rompkey, former Liberal cabinet minister in the Trudeau 
government; Lorna Milne, former Liberal riding president and a 
Liberal Party worker; Joseph Landry, former Liberal member of the 
New Brunswick legislative assembly; Shirley Maheu, former Liberal 
member of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nick Taylor is a former Alberta Liberal leader; Jean Forest's 
patronage connection was not disclosed; Eugene Whelan, former 
Liberal cabinet minister under Trudeau; Leonce Mercier, Quebec 
Liberal organizer; Wilfred Moore, no patronage connection; Lucie 
Pépin, former Liberal member of Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Catherine Callbeck is former Liberal premier of Prince Edward 
Island; Sister Peggy Butts, no Liberal connection that we could 
find; Fernand Robichaud, former Liberal MP in the government; 
Marisa Ferretti Barth, no connection; Serge Joyal, former Liberal 
MP and prominent Liberal backroom fellow. Thelma Chalifoux has no 
patronage connection; Joan Cook, failed provincial Liberal 
candidate and loyal Liberal worker; Archibald Johnstone, no 
patronage connection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last appointment which raised a lot of concern in this House 
and across the country was Ross Fitzpatrick, prominent B.C. 
Liberal organizer and golfing buddy of the Prime Minister.  In 
fact, he is a former business associate of the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I wish to make is that 20 of these 28 appointments 
have blatant Liberal connections.  Any bill that originates in 
the Senate, as Bill S-3 did, and then comes to this House by 
definition has to be biased. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1240"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT32"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT32"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1240

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What these appointments demonstrate is that the Senate is not 
working and it needs to be reformed.  The Senate was set up by 
the Fathers of Confederation to represent the provinces.  That 
was the original intent of our Senate.  Quite clearly from the 
list I have just read, the majority of senators appointed by the 
Prime Minister represent not the provinces they come from but the 
Liberal Party, the party of the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, that is the concern we have with legislation that 
originates because it is by definition biased.  The bill we 
largely support but we do not support the process.  The process 
is flawed and any bill that comes through the Senate should be 
looked at.  By definition, a money bill cannot come through the 
House but other bills we feel should originate with all of us who 
are elected, accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we go back to our constituents and they do not like what we 
have done, we will not be elected in the next election.  That is 
accountability.  There is no accountability in that other place. 
By definition we feel all bills should originate in the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK189"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I ask my 
colleague to comment on the distribution of the members of the 
Senate in terms of how many there are from each province relative 
to the population of British Columbia and so on.  I think he is 
aware of these numbers and he could enlighten us as to how well 
the Senate does in representing the different population areas of 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Gilmour:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
the opportunity to expand on the numbers in the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Senate first started and the country was small, between 
Upper and Lower Canada or Ontario and Quebec there were 24 
senators each.  The maritimes have 30 collectively.  Where it 
falls apart is west of the Ontario border because instead of each 
of the western provinces being given a number of senators equal 
or in comparison to the other provinces that were already in, the 
four western provinces got only twenty-four senators, in other 
words, six for Alberta, six for B.C., six for Manitoba and six 
for Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a major discrepancy and it is something that will take 
constitutional change.  For example, electing a senator does not 
take constitutional change.  That can be done as was shown with 
Senator Stan Waters.  The difficulty in the numbers is what is 
going to take quite an arm wrestling match because there is a 
disproportionate number across the country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK190"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, Bill 
S-3 proposes to update the Pension Benefits Standards Act, a law 
through which the federal government supervises private pension 
plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's system of retirement income has three pillars.  The 
first pillar is the basic old age security paid to all seniors 
together with the various supplements paid to low income seniors. 
This first pillar will soon be undermined by the proposed seniors 
benefits which will result in effective marginal tax rates 
approaching 70% for some seniors from the combined effect of 
existing tax rates and the 20% clawback on family incomes above 
$26,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Retirement savings experts are already telling middle income 
Canadians over the age of 50 to be wary of savings in RRSPs 
because what they save now will be most likely eaten up in higher 
taxes later.  This creates a direct disincentive for Canadians to 
do what is right and that is to save for their own futures and 
for their retirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second pillar consists of the employment based Canada and 
Quebec pension plans.  Under the government's reforms to this 
pillar Canadians will have to pay more to get less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third pillar includes retirement savings such as RRSPs and 
employer pension plans.  The government has moved to restrict 
access to RRSPs by freezing contribution limits and forcing 
seniors to mature their RRSPs two years earlier.

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation deals with the other part of the third pillar, 
employer pension plans.  Most employer pension plans are governed 
by provincial law, but 500,000 Canadians belong to the 1,000 
plans that fall under federal law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ten years ago the Progressive Conservative government overhauled 
the Pension Benefits Standards Act, the law that covers those 
plans. Significant changes were made to the minimum standards 
that plans must meet in areas ranging from survivor benefits to 
information disclosure.  The bill before us updates that act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The goals of the bill are to improve the way that plans are 
governed, to improve Ottawa's ability to step in when plan 
administrators do not appear to be following sound financial 
practices to set up rules for the withdrawal of pension 
surpluses.  It will also allow Ottawa to enter into supervisory 
agreements with provincial regulators through the Canadian 
Association of Pension Supervisory Authorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike other recent changes to our system of retirement savings, 
the only parts of the bill to generate even minor controversy are 
the provisions that pertain to the withdrawal of pension 
surpluses.  Pension fund managers are concerned that the surplus 
and the wind-up provisions in the bill are weighed heavily 
against employers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the bill is not particularly controversial.  There has 
been some controversy over the introduction of some government 
bills in the Senate, a practice which has fallen into disuse in 
recent years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without getting into a debate on Senate reform, if bills are to 
be introduced in the Senate, Bill S-3 is especially the kind of 
bill on which the Senate can do solid work before sending it on 
to the Commons.  This is particularly the case given the 
combination of the technical nature of the bill, the expertise of 
those on the Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce in 
the area of corporate governance and the non-partisan spirit of 
co-operation with which members of this committee approach such 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To not optimize the collective skills, wisdom and experience of 
these senators is an affront to the Canadian taxpayer.  We do 
have a Senate.  The senators on this committee have demonstrated 
prowess, ability and expertise in these areas.  I would remind my 
colleagues in the Reform Party that to not optimize this 
expertise would be denying Canadian taxpayers another level of 
deliberation on this type of important legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an approach that we could use here from time to time when 
we look at legislation, especially legislation affecting areas of 
corporate governance where there is a significant amount of 
institutional knowledge in the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate banking committee has made six substantive amendments 
as a result of the testimony it heard from officials and from 
outside witnesses.  The Senate amendments further clarify the 
rules to be followed when an employer wants to withdraw from the 
pension surplus.  It struck a provision that would have given the 
Superintendent of Financial Institutions the ability to decide if 
a particular allocation of a surplus was fair, as the issue of 
fairness should be left to the employees and employers to be 
settled, not to a public servant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also improved a process for allocating the surplus in cases 
where a company goes bankrupt or winds down.  It is very 
important that we protect individuals when a company is faced 
with the types of dramatic downsizing and corporate readjustments 
that have occurred over the past few years.  The legislation will 
help improve that process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those amendments were developed by opposition and government 
members in the Senate, working in a spirit of co-operation with 
the officials.  A spirit of co-operation might be something that 
we should try to duplicate in the House periodically when we are 
working on legislation as important as this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the process finance officials conceded that the 
bill had been improved by the contribution of the Senate.  Our 
colleagues in the other place have done well on this rather 
technical bill.  That does mean that we do not have to do our 
work or that we do not have further work to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to the committee examination of the bill and to 
further improving it through contributions by the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I would like to ask a question of my colleague who just 
spoke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I understand it, the opposition which my colleagues made to 
this was the fact that the issuance of the bill that came from 
the Senate was in violation of Standing Order 80 that says:

</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 53 of the Constitution Act provides that only the House 
of Commons may table money bills.  It goes on to say that bills 
which require the expenditure of public funds or invoking a tax 
or an impost.  That means fines, levies, duties and penalties. 
These bills are totally out of order with Standing Order 80 and 
run opposite to section 53. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member agree that these bills should not originate in 
the Senate but should come from here first? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Madam Speaker, the hon. member would 
seek to deny Canadians the benefit of the expertise of the Senate 
on this type of legislation.  As a parliamentarian I am quite 
proud of the spirit of co-operation and the level of expertise 
that benefited Canadians through the work of the Senate on the 
legislation.  I work alongside senators to provide the good 
representation Canadians deserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Senate reform is another issue.  It is arguable that there needs 
to be some significant Senate reform.  It was under a 
Conservative government that Stan Waters was elected as a 
senator.  While there is a need for Senate reform in the interim 
we need to maximize both houses.  This may mean that some 
legislation will periodically be introduced in the Senate where 
more substantive, non-partisan co-operation and expertise can 
benefit Canadians before it reaches the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK192"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I will follow up on the issue raised by my colleague. 
The member rightly points out that there are some very fine, 
dedicated and capable people serving in the Senate.  We could all 
wish they were more democratically chosen but that does not 
necessarily reflect on their abilities.  That is a good point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However we have a different problem.  We have an issue that lies 
at the heart of democracy.  In a democracy it is the people who 
rule.  When decisions are made with respect to spending their 
money, shaping their future and ordering their lives, should it 
not be the people through their elected representatives who bring 
those measures forward?  If we are to endorse a situation where 
the other place— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am afraid I have to 
interrupt at this point.  The question of what emanates from the 
Senate is a question for the Senate and for the House.  As far as 
the bill being receivable in the House is concerned, the Speaker 
has already ruled on that matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Madam Speaker, with respect, that 
seems to be a very integral part of the bill which goes to the 
heart of who makes decisions for the people of Canada.  If we are 
not allowed to discuss that issue here then the democratic 
process is not well served. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I want to respect the concerns raised by the Chair, I 
might appeal to the Chair to consider whether we really want to 
cut off the issue of debate at this time.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The purpose of the 
debate is not to question what has already happened.  I am 
prepared to let the debate continue at this time with the 
understanding that the Senate has to make its own rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as this is concerned, does the hon. member have a 
question to ask at this point? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  I rise on a point of order, Madam Speaker, 
on the same question that was raised and for further 
clarification of where we are coming from here.  In the bill 
there is an enacting clause which says “Her Majesty by and with 
the advice and consent of the Senate and the House of Commons”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can challenging the advice from the other place be out of 
order when it is in the enacting clause?  Not only is the Senate 
mentioned in the enacting clause of the bill, but the bill was 
introduced in the Senate and it is the Senate that is asking the 
House of Commons to consider it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a bill is under time allocation it is appropriate to debate 
the use of time allocation.  Time allocation has nothing to do 
with the principle of the bill.  Yet it is fair game to debate it 
because time allocation was used to advance the bill through 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case the government is using the Senate to introduce 
bills to advance its legislation through parliament.  For this 
reason it should be in order to debate this procedure as it is in 
order to debate time allocation.  How can it be relevant to 
debate some procedures and not relevant to debate others?

</I></B></P><P align=left>The case for debating the use of the Senate to introduce 
legislation must be allowed.  You may have some personal doubts, 
Madam Speaker, but I would suggest that you give the member who 
is addressing the bill the benefit of the doubt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The matter has 
already been ruled on by the Speaker and the purpose of the 
debate today is to debate the bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK193"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, today we are debating a bill that probably does not 
affect a lot of Canadians, but every legislative procedure which 
ties the hands of and puts regulations in place for any Canadian 
is of interest to all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is entitled amendments to the Pension Benefits 
Standards Act. 
The bill amends an act that was brought into place some time ago. 
Its purpose is to improve the supervisory regime for pension 
plans that are regulated under the act, especially private 
pension plans established for employees who are subject to 
federal jurisdiction such as in the fields of banking, 
interprovincial transportation and telecommunications. Provinces 
have similar legislation to look after private pension plans that 
fall under provincial jurisdiction.

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole point of the exercise is to make sure when employees 
put their hard earned dollars into the hands of their employers 
on the understanding that they are going to have some pension 
benefits at the end of the day, that their interests will be 
protected and looked after.  This is so they will not end up 20 
years later with the company in bankruptcy and a notice on the 
door saying sorry but they have no pension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an important bill, not just in the federal jurisdiction. 
Quite often measures put into place federally are looked at, 
mirrored and seen as a benchmark for what is done in the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For at least a decade there has been controversy about actuarial 
surpluses in private employer-employee pension plans. This is a 
very nice problem to have.  It is wonderful to be a member of a 
pension plan that actually has more money in the bank than will 
ever be needed to pay the full pensions of all the people in the 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is such a nice situation one could only very much wish that 
the same prudence had been exhibited by our federal government 
with respect to the Canada pension plan. Far from having to worry 
about who gets a big surplus in the Canada pension fund, we have 
to worry about who is going to get stuck with paying for a debt 
in that plan of $485 billion. The government says it is no 
problem, that it will just make our kids and our grandkids pay 
it, so what is there to worry about?  The money is not there but 
the government will just get it from them.  That is how our 
federal public pension plan has been managed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately there has been a bit more prudence in some of the 
private pension plans and there is actually a surplus. One issue 
which has been raised is what happens to a surplus when there is 
one.  Obviously it should not just sit there for ever and ever. 
It needs to be allocated in some fair and reasonable manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was not a problem much before the mid-1980s, but there has 
been spectacular growth in some of the private pension plans over 
the last few years.  One plan we know about enjoyed a 21% growth 
in 1995, 20% growth in 1996 and 17% growth in 1997.  It would be 
nice to have that kind of return on our Canada pension plan. 
Instead, our kids are promised less than 2% growth.  That is what 
we are giving our kids but the private pension plans do not seem 
to have that trouble.  It is nice for them.  It is too bad the 
children and the youth of Canada cannot expect that kind of 
prudent management for their pensions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is a surplus in the millions of dollars in these 
pension plans, who is entitled to it?  One might think that the 
entitlement would be fairly simple, that it would go back to the 
people who put it in, the employers and the employees.  But there 
always seems to be some tension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the employer company entitled to the surplus because it 
managed the plan so well and therefore the surplus should be its 
reward?  Or should the surplus belong to the workers who actually 
made the capital investment in the first place?  These questions 
in the past have been left to the courts to decide.  The judicial 
part of our system does rule in these kinds of disputes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue was brought to a head in 1986 when the owner of 
Dominion stores took back $63 million from three employee pension 
plans. The employees were not too impressed with this so they 
went to court.  The court ordered the owner of Dominion stores to 
return the funds to the employees.  This caused some concern in 
the provincial sphere because at that time the province of 
Ontario had legislation that regulated these funds.

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1986 Ontario put a moratorium on all the surpluses so they 
could not be taken or distributed.  Although the moratorium has 
been relaxed somewhat, the provincial rules for division of 
surpluses are very stringent.  There has to be agreement by 90% 
of the employees before any surplus in private pension funds can 
be distributed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition believes there are some questions in 
Bill S-3 with respect to accountability.  It is our duty, mandate 
and responsibility on behalf of the citizens of this country to 
hold the government accountable by being a watchdog to make sure 
when the government takes steps that it is doing the right thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has been playing that role vigorously with 
respect to the whole issue of payment of compensation to 
hepatitis C victims.  In a host of other issues the official 
opposition looks at the issue and indicates its concern that the 
government is not treating citizens of this country fairly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this bill goes to committee and at third reading the Reform 
Party will work vigorously on behalf of Canadian citizens whose 
moneys are deposited with private pension plans.  It is important 
to make sure that when government brings this legislation forward 
that we research and understand who it is that stands to benefit 
from it.  There are not many big pension plans in the country. 
Therefore it is a limited number of people who may or may not 
benefit or who may or may not be penalized or who may or may not 
suffer potential loss with this kind of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role of the superintendent of pension funds is set out under 
the Pension Benefit Standards Act which is the act we are talking 
about amending.  The superintendent is supposed to make sure that 
the private pension plans are well funded.  In other words the 
superintendent makes sure that if employees are putting their 
monthly or weekly contributions into a company pension plan that 
the company manages those funds in such a way to protect the 
interests of the employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that the same standard of care and the same 
vigorous oversight of the Canada pension plan is not in place. 
There are millions of Canadians in a Canada pension plan that is 
not funded.  Less than 10% of the funds needed to pay pensions 
under the Canada pension plan are actually in place. Imagine the 
outcry if private pension plans were allowed to operate with only 
6% of the funds that would be needed at the end of the day to pay 
out pensions actually kept in the fund and the employer spent the 
rest of the money for its own business purposes.  Somebody would 
be in jail but of course when the federal government does this, 
nothing happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately for people with private pension plans there is a 
little more diligence.  Somebody does care what private employers 
do even if nobody seems to care how imprudent the federal 
government is.  The superintendent makes sure that the plan 
remains solvent and does not hand out surpluses.  The courts 
decide who gets any surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under these amendments, the role of the superintendent is 
broadened.  If 50% of the employees agree, the superintendent 
appoints an arbitrator to decide how the surplus in a pension 
plan is to be distributed. 
The superintendent did not have this role before.

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something we are going to be asking some pretty pointed 
questions on in committee.  We understand that under the present 
act it is very unlikely that the employer would get anything out 
of a surplus in a private pension plan. Under the new act 
employers will now have the door opened to recover or to be able 
to use some of the surplus.  Again we wonder whether there is any 
potential conflict of interest, whether this is appropriate and 
why this possibility is being opened up at this time.  We are 
going to be asking some questions about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now an employer might try to approach employees for 
agreement saying he will get half and they will get half, but 
they will all get something.  Even if the employers and employees 
agreed, the courts would still be required to give their blessing 
to any distribution.  Under these amendments however, an 
arbitrator would be appointed by the superintendent who would 
make that decision.  The question in our minds is whether that is 
a better way to go, whether this is something that is 
appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to raise this concern at second reading before the bill 
goes to committee.  We want to make sure we do our job, not to 
just say that it looks like a good idea and modernizes the act so 
let us just go ahead.  We have a responsibility to look into 
these matters and we will do that. I want to put on the record 
that is where we will be going on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to encourage modernization of some of the measures. We 
want to reduce administrative burdens where this can be done 
because it is really the employees, the people who benefit from 
pension plans, who have to pay those costs.  If they can be 
reduced it is a good thing and we would applaud that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would also make sure there continues to be a very high level 
of supervision of these plans.  No one wants to find out at the 
end of the day that the pension plan they paid into all their 
working lives and are counting on has gone missing, that the 
money is not there or has not been managed in a way that makes 
sure pensions are available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the same concern the official opposition has regarding 
the Canada pension plan. Down the road we believe our children 
may say they are not going to pay money for a very low return for 
themselves and the Canada pension plan will simply not be 
available for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As with many bills, we see some positive measures.  We see some 
benefits for the citizens who are affected.  However we also do 
have some real concerns regarding how much this broadening of the 
ability outside the courts for the distribution of a surplus 
should be increased.  That is a real concern.  I urge other 
parties in the House to also look closely at this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue to study the bill during the committee 
hearings. Other issues may arise.  However we have identified the 
main one.  We believe we need to be vigilant on behalf of 
Canadians to make sure there are not employers who seek to gain a 
disproportionate advantage from employees, as was the case with 
the Dominion stores distribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as official opposition in this second reading stage see some 
good measures of streamlining in this bill. We also see some 
areas where we would like to probe a little more deeply, look at 
some of the winners and losers a bit more carefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With those remarks I hope we will be in a position to ensure 
that in whatever form this legislation comes back at third 
reading, it will truly be in the best interests of all Canadians, 
particularly those directly affected by the act.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I thank my colleague from Calgary—Nose Hill for her 
excellent presentation on Bill S-3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I noted in her speech that she mentioned the modernization of 
the pension plan regime, and I would like to add to that:  What 
about modernization of the place where the bill originated? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to clarify that earlier one of my other colleagues, 
the member for Souris—Moose Mountain, rose on questions and 
comments.  I believe he was not questioning the validity of the 
Speaker's ruling.  When the Speaker ruled that it was in order, 
that the Senate actually introduced Bill S-3, the bill that we 
are debating today, I do not believe he was questioning that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member for Calgary—Nose Hill like to comment on the 
general practice where a government would continue to introduce 
legislation through the back door, as it were, through an 
unelected, unequal and unaccountable Senate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Madam Speaker, this is an issue that 
will continue to be of concern to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Democracy really means rule by the people.  In a democracy, 
since we cannot all be in Athens and put our black bean or our 
white bean into the circle, we elect people to represent us in 
that capacity.  We rule through the agent of our elected 
representatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have another house of government in the country which is not 
elected and does not have a mandate from the people who are 
supposed to be the rulers of the country.  That being the case, 
unelected people in a democracy should not be bringing forth 
measures on behalf of the people.  That totally flies in the face 
of the whole principle of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When bills are introduced in that way, my position and I believe 
the position of most Canadians is that is terribly undemocratic. 
It contravenes some of the most cherished traditions and values 
of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be fought vigorously, not because the people in the 
Senate are competent as many of them are and not because the 
people in the Senate do not have levels of expertise sometimes 
greater than that of many members of the House but simply and 
solely because senators are not the democratically chosen 
representatives of the people whose job it is to order their own 
lives, spend their own money and shape their own future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will oppose the introduction of bills at every turn of the 
wheel. 
<P><A NAME="LINK195"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to speak for a moment.  I 
probably will not take my allotted time because the member for 
Calgary—Nose Hill did a superb job of analysing what is in the 
bill and how it will affect the lives of a lot of people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a moment to say a couple of words with 
regard to the Senate.  I ask the senators and constituents who 
are watching this debate on television to hang on to their 
armchairs because I am about to say something that is very nice 
regarding the Senate.  That is probably a shock to a lot of 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to allude to the fact that the bill originated in the 
Senate.  At the present time a committee of senators are 
travelling around the country, particularly in the west, meeting 
with grassroots, hard working farmers regarding Bill C-4 
respecting the wheat board.  The senators are meeting with these 
people and I hope they are listening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel it is very efficient for the Senate to be doing that.  If 
someone were to identify it as a job description, a very 
important part of it would be getting into the country and 
representing the regional interests of all Canadians.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CRIMINAL RECORDS ACT

<A NAME="LINK198">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK199"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.)</B> moved that Bill 
C-284, an act to amend the Criminal Records Act and the Canadian 
Human Rights Act (offences against children), be read the second 
time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to Bill C-284 
this afternoon.  The bill proposes to amend the Criminal Records 
Act and the Canadian Human Rights Act with respect to sexual 
offences against children.  I was pleased that the bill was drawn 
and made votable.  I do not buy lottery tickets but I feel like I 
have won. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill addresses some of the very real concerns of parents. It 
addresses some of the procedural shortcomings of our current 
policies regarding an individual's criminal record.  Essentially 
the bill allows for the disclosure of an individual's criminal 
record if the individual has been convicted of a sexual offence 
against a child and later applies for a position of trust with 
respect to children.  We would think that this would be the 
current case but it is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I delve into the details of the bill, I would like to lay 
out the big picture that lies at its heart.  Our families are the 
building block of society.  Children are our nation's future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As one of the constitutional principles of my party, we “affirm 
the value and dignity of the individual person and the importance 
of strengthening and protecting the family as essential to the 
well-being of individuals in society”.  Our children are a most 
precious resource as they are our future.  If we protect our 
children we are protecting the future of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers are concerned about the safety of our children. 
Reformers are concerned about ensuring that those responsible for 
children will not abuse their position of trust.  Reformers are 
concerned about how difficult it is for children's organizations 
to know whom it is that they are hiring and to be sure that they 
are not putting children at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Especially with respect to sex offences against children, 
Reformers and hopefully all of us in the House are concerned 
about protecting those most vulnerable from the potential sexual 
predator.  We justifiably recoil in horror when we hear some of 
the stories of children being sexually abused.  As 
parliamentarians in the House we have the responsibility to 
fulfil the fundamental role of government to ensure the 
protection of our citizens.  This is particularly true for 
children who are the most innocent and vulnerable in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-284 before us today is designed to help address these 
legitimate concerns.  It would enable those responsible for 
children to make fully informed decisions about whom they hire. 
It would help ensure public confidence that those responsible for 
children or looking after children have not abused this position 
of authority in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-284 was based on an earlier bill in the 35th parliament 
tabled by the Reform member from Fraser Valley, which again 
underlines our commitment to children and families.  His bill was 
in response to a petition from over 25,000 people across Canada 
which called for specific changes to prevent those convicted of 
sex offences against children from holding positions of trust 
over children.  This is what Bill C-284 is concerned about.  This 
could effectively be achieved when Bill C-284 is passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the mechanics of our current legal system in this 
regard.  It is true that when one is convicted of an offence, 
including a sexual offence against a child, one receives a 
criminal record and justifiably so.  It is true that if a person 
applies for a position of authority over children in day care, et 
cetera, the children's agency may do a record check, flag the 
fact that the person has been convicted of such an offence and 
take these facts into consideration when considering a job 
application.  This all makes sense and that is how it should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the weakness in our current laws?  The weakness occurs 
when an one's sentence is completed and one receives what is 
termed a “ pardon”.  Let me be clear that “a pardon does not 
erase the fact that you are convicted of the offence”.  This is 
a direct quote from the pardon application booklet of the 
National Parole Board.  The individual has still committed the 
offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather, a pardon allows people convicted of a criminal offence 
to have their criminal record sealed and effectively erased from 
the public record.  This means once a pardon is awarded for an 
offence for which one is convicted, any federal agency or 
department that has records of convictions must keep those 
records separate and away from the public. 
Therefore, once a pardon is granted the fact that a person was 
convicted of a criminal offence will not be disclosed or made 
accessible to anyone without prior approval of the Solicitor 
General of Canada which, for practical purposes, is an impossible 
process.

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially once a person receives a pardon for a previous 
conviction there is no record accessible to the public that there 
ever was such a conviction or that the pardon was ever even 
granted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to spend too much time debating the merits of 
pardons, although I will note that according to the National 
Parole Board for the last number of years 96% of the total 
decisions it makes are in favour of granting pardons.  Very few 
are denied.  More specifically, in 1996-97 there were 18,294 
decisions made and 104 decisions were denial, 1% of the total. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that background let us go back now to Bill C-284.  In the 
preamble of the bill it recognizes that there are certain 
circumstances in which it may be appropriate to grant a pardon to 
a person who has been of good behaviour following a conviction 
for a criminal offence and a period following the completion of 
the sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-284 also recognizes that if a person has been granted a 
pardon for an offence the record of that offence should be kept 
separate from other records and access thereto should be given 
only in cases where public interest overrides the privacy of the 
record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-284 would submit that public interest clearly overrides 
the privacy of the record in connection with the interests of 
caring for children, particularly when those responsible for 
children are reviewing applications for employment in positions 
of trust regarding children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as I earlier indicated, once a pardon has been granted 
for any offence, including sexual offences against children, the 
current official policy is don't ask, don't tell.  Employers 
guided by the Criminal Records Act are not to ask someone to 
disclose a conviction for which a pardon has been granted or 
issued. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To rectify the situation Bill C-284 proposes to allow the 
limited disclosure of an individual's criminal record when an 
individual applies for a position of trust with respect to 
children, even where a pardon has been granted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear one member saying that makes good sense.  I hope we can 
all concur and speedily pass it through the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Children's organizations would then be able to identify those 
who are more of a risk of abusing a position of trust with such a 
disclosure, the end result being better protection of Canadian 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we will all agree that the protection of our children is 
paramount.  Those who have suffered from sexual abuse 
characterize it as a life sentence.  We in Parliament have a 
responsibility to ensure that when one's child is being placed in 
the hands of another individual those hands are not likely to be 
abusive.  These are the concerns of Bill C-284. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would enable those responsible for children to make 
fully informed decisions about who they hire.  Bill C-284 would 
give parents with children in third party care the assurance that 
those responsible for looking after their children have not 
abused this position in the past.  This is important because all 
the evidence indicates that individuals who have sexually abused 
others in the past are at greater risk to repeat this abusive 
behaviour.  I will speak further to this a little later, but 
first I will summarize the particulars of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it is specific in its intent in order to better protect 
children from those who have been abusive in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, Bill C-284 proposes to allow for the limited disclosure 
of an individual's criminal record if the individual has been 
convicted of a sexual offence against a child and later applies 
for a position of trust with respect to children.  Such a 
disclosure will include an individual's criminal record for a 
previous sexual offence against a child or children, even if one 
had served one's sentence and had later received permission to 
have the notice of a conviction removed from the individual's 
criminal record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-284 does not propose that sex offences against children 
can never be pardoned, although that might be another reasonable 
thought.  The bill does not propose that if one makes a mistake 
such as this it should be forever on one's criminal record. 
Again, that might have merit but that is not what this bill is 
all about.

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather, Bill C-284 proposes that if one does sexually abuse 
children that person could effectively be prevented from holding 
a position of care or authority over children ever again.  Those 
responsible for children will be able to see that a job applicant 
has abused such a position in the past and thus be more 
judicious and wise in their hiring practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is Bill C-284 necessary?  Essentially it sends a message 
that protecting our children is paramount.  Bill C-284 provisions 
are common sense and because studies have shown that those who 
abused children sexually once are more likely to do it again. 
This is not harsh on my part. Those are the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Correctional Service Canada studies have shown that about one 
third of all sex offenders are convicted of a new criminal 
offence after release.  I am referring to a study done in 1996 by 
Correctional Service Canada, “Forum on Corrections Research”. 
To reference this same source, according to the offenders intake 
assessment process most of the 808 recent federal admissions with 
a sexual offence history had recommitted a sexual offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other studies I can quote but for sake of time I am 
going to move on to one other study which indicated that sexual 
offenders who had committed sex offences in the past had a 
subsequent sexual recidivism rate of about 30%.  Again, not to 
use my words, but to quote this study's authors, the strongest 
predictor of repeating sexual assault crimes was not surprisingly 
a previous sexual offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-284 would address these troubling statistics by giving 
responsible agencies the means to deny sex offenders the ability 
to place themselves in high risk situations ever again.  It would 
be good for both the offender and of course for the children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the right to privacy, some may ask.  In a May 1996 
discussion paper the privacy commissioner explained the Privacy 
Act does not prevent the release of personal information if it is 
in the public interest to release such information. In fact, the 
act specifically permits the release of personal information in 
public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The April 1996 RCMP protocol manual defines public interest as 
“evaluated on the basis of whether it is specific, current and 
probable, where there is a possible invasion of privacy balanced 
against a public interest, consideration may be given to who 
would be receiving the information and whether any controls can 
be placed on further use or release”.  That is from the RCMP 
disclosure of personal information in the public interest 
document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit the disclosure provisions in Bill C-284 fall well 
within the accepted protocol for the release of personal 
information, of which one's criminal record is a part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in the public interest for children not to be exposed to 
those who have abused them in the past and are more likely to do 
so again in the future, as the statistics I have quoted so 
clearly show. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in the public interest for parents to have confidence in 
those who are caring for their children, to evaluate public 
interest on the basis of whether it is specific, current and 
probable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-284 is specific in that the disclosure takes place only 
when those responsible for children request the information upon 
reviewing an individual's job application for a position of trust 
with respect to children.  Therefore it is specific. Bill C-284 
is current in that disclosure takes place only if an individual 
applies for a position of trust over children.  If no appropriate 
application is made, then no disclosure is given. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-284 is probable in that it allows for disclosure only 
during the time an individual applies for a job with children and 
information disclosure is very relevant to the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overall the bill is important for the protection of our 
children.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who have suffered from sexual abuse characterize it as a 
life sentence. I am quoting Abby Drover who as a 12 year old was 
held captive in an underground bunker in 1977. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we say no to parents and child care agencies crying out 
for this simple straightforward tool to protect innocent 
children?  How can we say no to the protection of our children as 
we look into their eyes, place them in someone else's hands, 
close the door and drive away?  We cannot.

and speedy passage of this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased to take part in 
the debate on Bill C-284 introduced by the member for Calgary 
Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill deals with sentencing, release on parole, and 
Canadians' fundamental rights and freedoms, all topics familiar 
to us in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last 10 years, various justice ministers have presented 
a variety of legislative initiatives, some of which were 
specifically intended to introduce stiffer penalties and delay 
the release of those convicted of crimes involving the sexual 
exploitation of children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992, for instance, the House considered and passed an 
important bill introduced by the then solicitor general and 
intended to replace the Parole Act and the Penitentiary Act with 
the Corrections and Conditional Release Act.  I must point out 
that, after a few years, even this act was constructively 
amended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all due respect for the member who introduced this bill, I 
cannot understand why the House is devoting time to issues that 
have recently been extensively debated here and in committee, 
especially when we know that the time allocated to private 
members' business is limited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposals have been made, however, and I will take the 
opportunity available to me for comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All Canadians know of examples of terrible crimes and what 
happened to the victims of these criminal acts.  From the 
comments sent to riding offices, mail received and reports in 
the media, we know that some of our fellow citizens are living 
in fear of crime and feel that the government has not been 
successful at protecting society at a time when people's 
perception is that the law is being flouted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would emphasize that this is not a view held by all Canadians. 
Far be it from me, however to ignore the concerns of individuals 
and groups wanting us to take a stronger stand against 
criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not long ago, the crime rate rose every year.  More crimes and 
different types of crimes were being reported, because victims 
of domestic violence and sexual harassment were less stigmatized 
and less afraid to speak out and help in the efforts to bring 
their aggressors to justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in recent years, violent crime has declined.  Despite 
the vast media coverage of sensational crimes, the general 
public must be better informed about the way the justice system 
works and about the measures taken to reduce crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly an informed public is more likely to see the gaps in the 
system it knows only superficially. 
Those directly responsible for the security of Canadian 
communities, from the police through prosecutors, judges and, at 
the end of the line, the federal and provincial criminal law 
systems, must respond to the criticisms that arise from 
increased awareness and greater surveillance.  This is the least 
we can do as legislators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the statistics, we can see many factors 
affecting individuals' vulnerability to crime.  For example, 
geographical location is a factor.  More violent crime occurs in 
urban centres than in the country. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1345"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I want to point out is that crime is not endemic everywhere 
in the country.  I agree that many Canadians have no choice but 
to live where they are and they never know who they will run 
into one day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is also reasonable to think that, for many other 
Canadians, the only violence they will witness will be what they 
see on their televisions in the evening. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must respond to these concerns and we must do so in a very 
effective manner.  In the case of individuals, problems may often 
be dealt with directly by referring them to community and victim 
support groups that are available within the Ministry of the 
Solicitor General, from the Correctional Service of Canada and 
the National Parole Board regional offices throughout the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, most police forces assign officers to community 
service duties and many courts are monitored by representatives 
of victims service organizations.  This direct intervention by 
our staff members and constituency offices to provide information 
and assistance is the most satisfactory and personalized solution 
to constituents who are feeling baffled or neglected by the 
criminal justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When protests are prompted by system faults, the system must be 
changed from within, or if necessary, must be altered through the 
legislative process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As is sometimes the case in isolated and regrettable instances, 
the correctional system's failures can be traced to human error 
where established policies and procedures that would protect the 
public are ignored or often misapplied.  Extraordinary incidents 
occur with some tragic unfortunate results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must do everything in our power to reduce the number of these 
incidents, but an ineffective response can be worse than no 
response at all.  Piecemeal legislation change is not a solution 
to the problems perceived. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe Bill C-284 is too narrow in its focus and too 
punitive.  The law must be fashioned to accommodate a range of 
offenders in any given category.  That is not to say that there 
are good people who commit violent and deplorable acts and bad 
people who are convicted of the same type of offences. There are 
however levels within each class of offender that lead us to 
believe that some may more readily resume a law-abiding lifestyle 
than would offenders who are serving sentences for similar 
offences. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill would reject the guiding principle of correctional 
services, which is that the public is best served if “the 
criminal is put back on the straight and narrow”. Inmates who 
react well to the opportunities for treatment, training and 
education offered by our system can return to society one day as 
law-abiding citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless of what we do for, or to, them, these individuals 
will be back in the community one day.  Consequently, those who 
no longer constitute a threat must benefit from all reasonable 
opportunities, so that they may again be part of society as soon 
as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only would the present bill restrict those opportunities for 
too many criminals, but it would also lengthen sentences without 
taking court deliberations into consideration, as well as 
punishing criminals for what they might do after serving the 
entire sentence for what they have done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that I have mentioned some of my reservations concerning 
this bill, I will use the rest of the time allocated to me to 
remind my colleagues of a related initiative carried out during 
the last session of Parliament on behalf of the Minister of 
Justice and the departmental portfolio of the Solicitor General. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-55, a cohesive and complete set of reforms which came into 
effect last August, enables the courts to order the surveillance 
of certain criminals for up to 10 years after the end of their 
prison sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In earlier initiatives we also revised the Criminal Code in 
order to allow the courts to ban persons found guilty of sexual 
offences involving children from the vicinity of schools, 
community centres and playgrounds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In parallel, criminal harassment and stalking have become 
offences on which it is now easier to act because of certain 
clauses in the Criminal Code.  The efforts expended to tighten 
up the legislation relating to these categories of criminals may 
have escaped the notice of the hon. member for Calgary Centre.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That is surprising, because I know that he is greatly interested

proposals of this nature constitute opportunities for frank 
discussions, in my opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be satisfied if, as a result of this debate, the public 
acquires more knowledge of this part of our correctional system. 
The hon. member who introduced Bill C-284 obviously shares my 
opinion, and I congratulate him for his perseverance in bringing 
criminal justice into the public eye and thus helping to make 
Canadians better informed. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of Bill C-284.  I 
commend the work of the member for Calgary Centre in tabling such 
an important piece of legislation. Bill C-284 is important in the 
sense that it focuses on one of the highest priorities, if not 
the highest priority the criminal justice system should have, 
which is the protection of children from abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conservative estimates indicate that one in three girls are 
sexually abused before the age of 18 while one in six boys are 
sexually abused before the age of 16.  These are tragic and 
disturbing figures. As a former crown attorney I often dealt with 
cases that put a human face on these statistics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even more frightening is the fact that most abused and neglected 
children never report these incidents to the proper authorities. 
This is especially true of cases of sexually abused children 
since there may be no outward sign of the physical, psychological 
or emotional harm that has resulted. Furthermore, sexually abused 
children are often reluctant to report these crimes for they feel 
intense shame, and secrecy is often the result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these and other reasons we must focus our attention and our 
efforts to combat child abuse at the prevention level.  It is a 
serious matter of public interest which Bill C-284 if passed 
would help to address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As outlined by previous speakers in the House, this bill amends 
two existing statutes, the Criminal Records Act and the Canadian 
Human Rights Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments to the Criminal Records Act would allow for 
limited disclosure of criminal records of persons pardoned for 
sexual convictions against a child.  This disclosure would occur 
when the pardoned person applies for a position of trust over a 
child.  The information would be provided to those individuals 
with responsibility for the child who are considering such an 
application. Any inappropriate disclosure of information by these 
individuals would be subject to criminal prosecution or sanction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Put simply, these changes would give organizations that deal 
with children an additional tool to scrutinize potential 
employees or volunteers before they are placed in positions of 
trust, in positions where children are most vulnerable where a 
relationship of trust might exist. Groups such as Scouts Canada, 
Girl Guides of Canada , Big Brothers and Big Sisters of Canada 
and minor sports teams would have access to information that is 
extremely relevant to the selection process they must undergo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those who would object on the grounds of privacy rights for 
pardoned offenders, I suggest they examine the reality of sexual 
offenders.  Among criminal offenders, those convicted of sexual 
offences have one of the highest rates of recidivism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our children are far too important to risk having repeat 
offenders enter into positions of authority and trust.  We must 
give child centred and youth centred organizations the tools to 
prevent further tragedies of sexual abuse. It is a sad irony that 
we presently have a government that cracks down on law-abiding 
gun owners and leaves tens of thousands of hepatitis victims 
twisting in the wind but nevertheless feels that the rights of 
convicted child sex offenders should take precedence over 
children's safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second component of Bill C-284 amends the Canadian Human 
Rights Act.  It would permit organizations to refuse to employ 
individuals in so-called child trust positions on the basis of 
persons having been pardoned of sexual offences against children. 
This amendment is a logical step in this bill. 
Once an organization has access to relevant information, it 
should certainly be free to act upon that relevant information 
without fear of reprisals.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I share the view of those who believe that rehabilitation is a 
laudable goal.  I also believe that securing employment for 
offenders re-entering society is often critical to ensure that 
they do not become repeat offenders and that rehabilitation can 
occur.  This in turn helps protect public safety and confidence 
in our criminal justice system which is something that has been 
sorely lacking in recent years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we need to draw the line at allowing convicted sex 
offenders irrespective of whether they are pardoned to secretly 
enter into positions of trust over children.  On balance it is 
far too important.  The consequences and the potential for harm 
are something we really have to consider in this instance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians need peace of mind that organizations in which they 
entrust their children's safety have taken all precautionary 
steps necessary to protect their children's safety. Bill C-284 
gives these organizations another very crucial weapon to fight 
child abuse. This bill is a reasonable compromise between the 
rights of offenders and the rights of society, which is something 
that we always wrestle with in our justice system. In particular 
this bill protects our most important citizens in this country, 
our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the Progressive Conservative caucus, I urge all 
members to support this legislation.  Let us support our 
volunteer driven organizations that deal with our children and 
the future of our country.  Let us support our families and the 
safety of our children.  Let us do it and let us do it quickly. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I begin by commending my colleague from Calgary Centre 
for his wisdom and effort in bringing this legislation before the 
House for consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-284 has all the elements that make excellent legislation. 
First of all it is based on common sense.  Our society does not 
accept child molesters in any position of trust when it comes to 
the issue of children.  Common sense tells us that it is simply 
too risky and any parent is unwilling to accept that kind of risk 
when it comes to their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation is also simple and direct.  It sticks to the 
very matter at hand and pinpoints a specific flaw in our justice 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally this bill is reasonable and fair.  While its central 
focus is to protect our children, the amendments proposed under 
Bill C-284 do not flagrantly harass convicted child molesters who 
have been pardoned.  There is absolutely no impact on their 
search for gainful employment that does not involve children. 
Unless children are involved, they continue to enjoy the 
privilege of not being required to divulge their conviction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill closes a loophole and that is one of the things MPs 
are sent to the House to do.  We must close the legal loopholes 
that jeopardize the safety of Canadians and fail to protect and 
improve their lives.  When we discuss this loophole we are not 
talking about extreme cases, worst case scenarios or remote odds. 
We are talking about a common occurrence where a convicted child 
molester has been given a pardon and is perfectly free to seek a 
position involving children with no scrutiny and absolutely no 
questions asked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only about 1% of convicted criminals who apply for pardons are 
refused.  That means 99% are pardoned.  It is not as though a 
child molester must fight through challenging hurdles in order to 
get himself or herself into a position of trust over children. 
The possibility of this happening is very high and very real. 
Once the pardon is granted, the current laws mean a day care or 
nursery school is breaking the law to even ask a child molester 
if he or she has ever been pardoned for a criminal offence 
against children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate can be boiled down to one central issue, the quest 
to appear politically correct versus the protection of our 
children. We are well aware of this government's effort to ensure 
the rights and freedoms of prisoners and convicted criminals.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are so very sensitive to the newest theories in criminal 
rehabilitation.  That is all very well and good, but never can 
these accommodating gestures be made at the expense of victims 
and potential victims, in this case the most vulnerable in our 
society, our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Which is more important, the right to privacy for a pardoned sex 
offender or the right to life and safety of a child?  I believe 
Canadians want the law to place children first.  As for the 
privacy and potential harassment of a pardoned criminal, this 
bill does not advocate pasting their name and photo on every 
telephone pole, something that has become a great source of 
controversy in this country and around the world.  This 
legislation is simply designed to prevent and discourage sex 
offenders from working with children.  That is all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of some of the other parties in this Chamber have 
accused Reformers in the past of sensationalizing crime and 
inflating the problems in our justice system.  In rebuttal I 
would argue that the only thing Reformers have done has been to 
raise the unpleasant and horrifying impact of government inaction 
in rectifying faulty laws, legal loopholes and weak enforcement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform MPs have done many things in Ottawa that members of other 
parties have not dared to do, things that would disturb the old 
guard and the status quo.  We have dared to bring these 
preventable crimes to light. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not going to relate the horrible tragedies in which 
convicted child molesters have managed to regain access to 
children.  We all know it happens.  We all read the newspapers 
and watch television.  Instead I want to appeal to the mothers 
and fathers, the grandmothers and grandfathers, the aunts and 
uncles, the Godmothers and Godfathers and anyone else who is 
fortunate enough to have a child in their life who they love and 
who loves them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like many children that child will probably at some point in 
his or her life enrol in a nursery school, a play group, a day 
care, a sporting activity, a hobby club or a service organization 
such as Brownies or Scouts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take the example of a nursery school.  The parents of 
that child have the right to demand that their two, three or four 
year old child is not susceptible to sex offenders or child 
molesters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To achieve this level of safety the nursery school, like most 
organizations involving children, requires that any employee, 
volunteer, or any other individual for that matter, with access 
to those children while they are under the responsibility of the 
school undergo a criminal reference check.  This would include 
the nursery school teachers, any assistants or any parents who 
help with the children's activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Individuals obtain from the police documentation stating that 
they have no criminal record.  At this point, if a parent feels 
certain their child is at no risk of being in the care of a child 
molester, they are unfortunately misguided.  When a convicted 
criminal receives a pardon for his or her offence the police are 
required to remove any record of that conviction from their 
personal records.  So, unwittingly, the police may issue a 
positive criminal reference check for a pardoned child molester. 
That is certainly not the fault of the police.  It is the fault 
of the law.  It is obvious that we need to remedy this horrifying 
oversight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe Bill C-284 is the ideal solution.  It would ensure 
that organizations like nursery schools do not mistakenly hire 
a child molester.  At the same time the bill offers a reasonable 
approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This fairness can be seen in the following example.  Again I 
will refer to my nursery school scenario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A father of one of the nursery school's young students is 
required, along with all parents, to assist the teacher during 
some classes, or to drive students on a field trip.  When this 
man, now in his late thirties, was 18 years of age perhaps he was 
involved in a bar room brawl and subsequently received a 
conviction for assault.  It undoubtedly was a stupid thing to do 
and part of his youth that he is not very proud of, but he has 
taken responsibility for his actions, served his debt to society 
and some two decades later has a career and family of his own. 
He requests, and is granted, a pardon for his assault conviction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it fair that this man be prevented from participating in his 
own child's nursery school activities?  Of course not.  He was 
young and he made a mistake. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1405"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT48"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Bill C-284, with his pardon, this man would still receive 
a positive criminal reference and be able to fulfil his parental 
obligations to the nursery school.  He poses little risk, if any, 
to the children and Bill C-284 acknowledges that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But child molesters do pose a very high risk, a very serious 
risk to children's safety and they should never, ever, be put in 
a position of trust over children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just how much of a risk do children face?  In studies conducted 
by the Correctional Service Canada, pedophiles were found to have 
the highest rate of sexual recidivism when compared to other sex 
offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One such study called “Managing the Treatment of Sex Offenders: 
a Canadian Perspective” said that “It appears likely that 
pedophiles, especially those men who offend against young boys, 
are at greater risk to recidivate sexually than are rapists”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another study called “Factors Related to Recidivism Among 
Released Federal Sex Offenders” found that one-third of sex 
offenders were convicted of a new criminal offence following 
release.  This study also found that pedophiles had the highest 
rate of sexual recidivism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet another study by the Canada working group found that when 
sexual aggressors do re-offend they tend to repeat the offence 
for which they were originally convicted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very fortunate that this bill has been deemed votable. 
This means that we in this Chamber have the opportunity to enact 
some very good legislation, the kind of legislation that will 
reap benefits, restore faith in the justice system and, first and 
foremost, protect children.  Obtaining these goals is part of our 
job as parliamentarians and I encourage all members of this House 
to do their job and support Bill C-284. 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I too want to congratulate the member for Calgary South for 
bringing forward this private member's bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He started off his comments by saying he felt he had already won 
by getting selected in the lottery and, as all members know, that 
is a matter of being fortuitous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The more important success the member has achieved is that he 
has brought an issue before the House which has received the 
support of a committee of his peers to be votable.  I think that 
is the success, that the bill is before this House and will be 
subject to a vote of members of Parliament.  For that he 
should be congratulated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe he has brought a matter to the attention of the House 
which is important for debate.  The greatest value of Private 
Members' Business is that it provides an opportunity for public 
debate and for consultations among the parties to determine 
whether or not there is some basis for influencing legislation 
either directly or indirectly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently we have talked a great deal about the Young Offenders 
Act and the issue of whether or not the names of young offenders 
should be disclosed and what impact that may have on their 
ability to be rehabilitated.  I see many parallels between that 
issue and the issue which the member has brought forward.  The 
only difference is that this bill targets the sexual offenders of 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one of those issues about which people should be very 
cautious because of the inherent risks involved.  If we had to 
pit the interests of one against the other, clearly, most people 
would say that public interest is more important than the 
interest of the individual who has been convicted of sexual abuse 
against children.  It is a very difficult issue to deal with, but 
legislators have to deal with difficult issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Questions have to be asked whenever we do Private Members' 
Business.  It is a matter of whether legislation should come 
forward with regard to a certain aspect that we may have 
identified.  Or, has the fact that this has come forward 
identified other areas?  Are other things going on that are 
related which would provide some synergy or make the legislation 
even better? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is always the frustration or the difficulty with Private 
Members' Business because to get the confidence of members it has 
to be somewhat straightforward without too many tentacles leading 
to other areas of other legislation.  That is the problem and 
that is why most Private Members' Business does not pass in this 
House.  I would support changes or some reform to Private 
Members' Business to allow a better airing of some of these views 
so that good ideas, such as the one brought forward by the 
member, do get worthy consideration.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk for a few moments about the Criminal Records Act. 
The development of the Criminal Records Act was based on a 
proposal put forward in the same way as this private member's 
bill, although the intention of the sponsors of the two private 
members' bills and their ultimate foundations were somewhat 
dissimilar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Private members' bills and initiatives should be taken very 
seriously.  Without such respect, however, we may have some 
unexpected consequences.  I raise the caution from the standpoint 
of a member who has been very active in private members' bills. I 
must admit that from time to time issues are raised by other 
members that I have not contemplated.  That is understandable 
because ordinary members of Parliament do not have the resources 
to be able to do that exhaustive work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This member has touched on an area at which I know the 
government has been looking as well.  There are some 
possibilities which have to be explored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously the objective before us is to determine how we can 
improve the Criminal Records Act.  It was introduced in June 1996 
and referred to the justice committee of the day.  It held formal 
meetings between March and November 1967.  The proposed changes 
were discussed at length and the committee had the opinion of 
many interested parties.  These are the kinds of things that 
would occur at committee should this matter be referred there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That justice committee report came back to the House.  The 
government at the time proceeded with a study of the initiative. 
In the current situation we face the same fundamental question as 
was posed when the legislation was first discussed some 20 years 
ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is the legitimate balance between the objective of 
assisting those who have transgressed the law to reform and lead 
crime-free lives and the equally legitimate needs of the policing 
authority and the community at large to be protected from a 
recurrence of criminal activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principal issues obviously extend to others.  They include 
where the line is drawn between individual and collective rights. 
Is it worth the time of parliamentarians to ensure that all 
options may have been canvassed and discussed?  Should we make 
one change to a complex piece of legislation that may have some 
far-reaching implications on other pieces of legislation?  Has 
sufficient study been done? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know whether the process at this point allows for 
sufficient study to have been done to date.  I do know, however, 
that the House would provide the venue and the envelope in 
Private Members' Business to have that kind of consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that the ideas for change which led to the passage of 
the Criminal Records Act were first presented to the House in the 
form of a private member's bill.  The government of the day 
apparently recognizing the importance of the change in this area 
encouraged the initiative.  I believe the parallel exists here as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill proposed comprehensive reform and resulted in a 
consensus among those who had knowledge of the subject.  I think 
it will take some work to get the House up to speed on the 
sensitive criteria related to it.  Thereafter the government bill 
was sent to committee for additional study.  This is certainly 
something that should be considered in terms of this bill as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the officials of the Department of the Solicitor 
General have had occasion to study the various suggestions our 
hon. colleague has raised.  I think I can conclude that the 
member has identified a potential weakness in the system.  I am 
not exactly sure whether what he is proposing is precisely the 
way to do it, but I want to make a recommendation to him with 
regard to how we proceed from here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very often good ideas in Private Members' Business do not 
receive the confidence of the House in terms of a vote, but there 
is another opportunity that has happened on many occasions.  When 
substantive issues raised in a private member's bill are valid 
and enjoy the support of the House, the bill may very well not be 
voted on and dropped from the order paper.  However the member or 
someone in support of the member can rise in the House and ask 
that the subject matter of the bill be referred to committee.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It means that it would still remain alive as an issue.  It means 
that if the government is serious about the issues that he has 
raised and some ancillary issues this member would still see his 
initiative go forward in legislation that may be brought in by 
the government.  I ask him to keep that in mind as we move 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would support referral of this matter to the standing 
committee on justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I again congratulate the member. All private members' business 
deserves our respect and attention.  I believe he has done a 
excellent job in raising this issue.  We should be thankful for a 
fine job on behalf of all private members.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I too would like to congratulate my colleague from 
Calgary who has brought this private member's bill in.  I too am 
pleased that it has been drawn as a votable item. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to withhold most of my comments for the second 
round of debate on this bill because time does not permit it 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there are a number of observations I would like to 
make.  There are a number of suggestions I would like to make to 
hon. members on the government side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Reform caucus do not seek any glorification in 
winning a so-called political battle in bringing this motion 
forward.  We have but one purpose.  We are not vindictive.  We do 
not hold malice.  We have one thing in mind. We are not satisfied 
with the 31% figure of pedophiles coming back to abuse our 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member who spoke earlier from the government seemed to 
suggest that number was satisfactory.  I do not think the last 
member who spoke from the government would agree.  He would agree 
that if we can by any means bring that down to 15% that would be 
better for all of the people in Canada, never mind this House. We 
are here because of the people of Canada.  This bill came forward 
because of the children of Canada, whom we want to protect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My profession has put me front and foremost of watching young 
people suffer because of sexual molestation.  I have watched them 
struggle through life.  I watched them struggle through high 
school.  Now I watch them struggle in adulthood.  If there are 
ways and means to prevent this, then let us go for it.  I say to 
my hon. colleague who spoke last from the Liberal side of the 
House we do not care what happens.  If he would like to readjust 
the bill and bring it back in, we would be pleased with that.  We 
are not looking for credit in any way.  The hon. member who 
initiated this bill would be the first to agree to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Different organizations have been mentioned.  I want to tell 
members of the difficulties I had hiring teachers on whom I could 
not obtain the information I should have obtained.  They were 
protected. This led to a disaster.  I was the CEO to the board. 
A bill like this would prevent school boards from becoming 
trapped in an issue.  It would prevent communities that hire 
recreational directors from becoming trapped.  They should have 
this right.  To deny the main purpose of this bill, to deny the 
main intent of this bill will mean this will go on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Church groups that get young people together for the summer 
should have this right.  They should have the right for limited 
information to protect not only themselves but the children. They 
are putting on functions for children because they love children 
and they want to protect them. 
The fundamental purpose of this bill, the only purpose, is to 
provide protection for Canadian youth.

<A HREF="#LINKT51"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, let us forget about politics.  Let us forget about the 
different parties.  Let us forget about our personal viewpoints. 
Let us work together, whatever it takes.  If it means going back 
to the committee, fine.  But let us come up with a more positive 
solution than we have at the present time or Canadians are going 
to have less faith in the House for not doing something which is 
a national problem.  We cannot sit by and simply say, as I heard 
this afternoon, 31% is not a bad figure and it is holding.  That 
is not good enough for us on this side of the House.
