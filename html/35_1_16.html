	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the Standing Orders of the House of Commons in force on January 28, 
1994, be amended as follows:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>PART A.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I. That Standing Order 73 be amended</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>1. By deleting sections (1) and (2) thereof and substituting the following 
therefor:</BLOCKQUOTE>
``(1) Immediately after the reading of the Order of the Day for the second reading 
of any public bill, a Minister of the Crown may propose a motion that the said bill be 
forthwith referred to a standing, special or legislative committee. The Speaker shall 
immediately propose the question to the House and proceedings thereon shall be 
subject to the following conditions:
<P>
(<I>a</I>) the Speaker shall recognize for debate a Member from the party forming the 
Government, followed by a Member from the party forming the official 
Opposition, followed by a Member from each officially recognized party in the 
House, in order of the number of Members in that party, provided that, if no 
Member from the party whose turn has been reached rises, a Member of the next 
party in the rotation or a Member who is not a member of an officially 
recognized party may be recognized;
<P>
(<I>b</I>) the motion shall not be subject to any amendment;
<P>
(<I>c</I>) no Member may speak more than once nor longer than ten minutes;
<P>
(<I>d</I>) after not more than 180 minutes of debate, the Speaker shall interrupt the 
debate and the question shall be put and decided without further debate or 
amendment.
<P>
(2) Every public bill, except for bills referred to a committee before being read a 
second time pursuant to section (1) of this Standing Order, shall be read twice and 
referred to a committee before any amendment may be made thereto.
<P>
(3) Unless otherwise ordered and except for bills referred to a committee before 
being read a second time pursuant to section (1) of this Standing Order, in giving a 
bill second reading, the same shall be referred to a standing, special or legislative 
committee.''
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>2. By renumbering sections (3) and (4) thereof as sections (4) and (5) 
respectively.</BLOCKQUOTE>
II. That section (1) of Standing Order 74 be amended by deleting the word 
``When'' and by substituting therefor the words ``Unless otherwise provided by 
Standing or Special Order, when'', in paragraph (<I>a</I>), by deleting the words ``or 
second speaker'' and substituting therefor the words ``, second or third speaker'' 
and in paragraph (<I>b</I>), by deleting the word ``two'' and substituting therefor the word 
``three''.
<P>
III. That the Standing Orders be amended:
<P>
1. By inserting, immediately before Standing Order 76, the following:
<P>
``At Second Reading
<P>
76. (1) The report stage of any bill reported by any standing, special or 
legislative committee before the bill has been read a second time shall not be 
taken into consideration prior to the third sitting day following the presentation 
of the said report, unless otherwise ordered by the House.
<P>
(2) If, not later than the second sitting day prior to the consideration of the report 
stage of a bill that has not yet been read a second time, written notice is given of 
any motion to amend, delete, insert or restore any clause in a bill, it shall be 
printed on a <I>Notice Paper</I>. When the same amendment is put on notice by more 
than one member, that notice shall be printed once, under the name of each 
member who has submitted it.
<P>
(3) When a recommendation of the Governor General is required in relation to 
any amendment of which notice has been given pursuant to section (2) of this 
Standing Order, notice shall be given of the said Recommendation no later than 
the sitting day before the day on which the report stage is to commence and such 
notice shall be printed on the <I>Notice Paper</I> along with the amendment to which it 
pertains.
<P>
(4) An amendment, in relation to form only in a government bill, may be 
proposed by a Minister of the Crown without notice, but debate thereon may not 
be extended to the provisions of the clause or clauses to be amended.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>NOTE: The purpose of this section is to facilitate the incorporation into a bill of 
amendments of a strictly consequential nature flowing from the acceptance of 
other amendments. No waiver of notice would be permitted in relation to any 
amendment which would change the intent of the bill, no matter how slightly, 
beyond the effect of the initial amendment.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
(5) The Speaker shall have the power to select or combine amendments or clauses 
to be proposed at the report stage and may, if he or she thinks fit, call upon any 
Member who has given notice of an amendment to give such explanation of the  
subject of the amendment as may enable the Speaker to form a judgement upon 
it. If an amendment has been selected that has been submitted by more than one 
member, the Speaker, after consultation, shall designate which member shall 
propose it.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>NOTE: The Speaker will not normally select for consideration any motion previously 
ruled out of order in committee, unless the reason for its being ruled out of order was 
that it required a recommendation of the Governor General, in which case the 
amendment may be selected only if such Recommendation has been placed on notice 
pursuant to section (2) of this Standing Order. The Speaker will normally only select 
motions that were not or could not be presented in committee. A motion, previously 
defeated in committee, will only be selected if the Speaker judges it to be of such 
exceptional significance as to warrant a further consideration at the report stage. The 
Speaker will not normally select for separate debate a repetitive series of motions 
which are interrelated and, in making the selection, shall </I><I>consider whether individual 
Members will be able to express their concerns during the debate on another motion.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="958"> 958 </A></B>
<P>
<I>For greater certainty, the purpose of this Standing Order is, primarily, to provide 
Members who were not members of the committee with an opportunity to have the 
House consider specific amendments they wish to propose. It is not meant to be a 
reconsideration of the committee stage.</I>
<P>
(6) When the Order of the Day for the consideration of the report stage is called, 
any amendment proposed pursuant to this Standing Order shall be open to 
debate and amendment.
<P>
(7) When debate is permitted, no Member shall speak more than once or longer 
than ten minutes during proceedings on any amendment at that stage.
<P>
(8) When a recorded division has been demanded on any amendment proposed 
during the report stage of a bill, the Speaker may defer the calling in of the 
Members for the purpose of recording the ``yeas'' and ``nays'' until more or all 
subsequent amendments to the bill have been considered. A recorded division or 
divisions may be so deferred from sitting to sitting.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>NOTE: In cases when there are an unusually great number of amendments for 
consideration at the report stage, the Speaker may, after consultation with the 
representatives of the parties, direct that deferred divisions be held before all 
amendments have been taken into consideration.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
(9) When proceedings at the report stage on any bill that has not been read a 
second time have been concluded, a motion ``That the bill, as amended, be 
concurred in and be read a second time'' or ``That the bill be concurred in and 
read a second time'' shall be put and forthwith disposed of, without amendment 
or debate.
<P>
(10) The report stage of a bill pursuant to this Standing Order shall be deemed to 
be an integral part of the second reading stage of the bill. When a bill has been 
concurred in and read a second time in accordance with the procedures set forth 
in this Standing Order, it shall be set down for a third reading and passage at the 
next sitting of the House.
<P>
After Second Reading''.

<B>(1105 ) </B>
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, the motion to change the rules of the 
House, which I am proposing today, is intended to implement a 
number of commitments that my party made in the recent 
election campaign and in the throne speech in order to revive 
and revitalize the House of Commons.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In the speech from the throne, the government committed 
itself to ``enhance the credibility of Parliament''. The changes 
they propose to make to the Standing Orders of the House of 
Commons ``will give the hon. members the opportunity to be 
more actively involved in the development of government 
policies and legislation''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As I have said in quoting the throne speech, what we want to 
do is renew and revitalize the House of Commons. Of course 
changing the rules of the House does not alone bring about its 
revitalization. It is the extent to which the new procedures are 
used that will make the difference.
<P>
	Today we are providing a framework for renewal. It will be up 
to all members, both government and opposition, to make these 
procedures effective.
<P>
	It is to state the obvious to say that Canadians have in recent 
years, and I think especially over the last nine years, grown 
increasingly dissatisfied with the way the House of Commons 
has functioned. They have been unimpressed both with the 
process that the House has used to do its business and with much 
of the results. The changes to the standing orders, the rules of the 
House, proposed today make a beginning on improving the 
process. Our success in improving the process will, in my view, 
have a constructive influence on improving the product.
<P>
	Our Parliament is an institution founded on developments 
many centuries ago. It is one that has evolved over the years to 
meet the changing expectations of society. We believe that the 
Canadian system of parliamentary government is fundamentally 
sound but that the recent practices of the House of Commons 
have become inadequate to meet the expectations of the 
Canadian people.
<P>
	Canadians expect responsive as well as responsible 
government. Many Canadians have in recent years come to feel 
that the House of Commons has failed them in this regard. They 
also expect more transparency in government decision making. 
In this regard as well, Canadians have been dissatisfied with 
parliamentary proceedings. Also, our electors want us to 
conduct their business in an orderly and civil fashion. They have 
not been overly impressed with the record of the House in recent 
years on this front either.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="960"> 960 </A></B>
<P>
	However, the new government has been making a real effort to 
have the House operate with a more constructive tone and with a 
better sense of decorum. The opposition parties, I am happy to 
say, have been making a similar effort and the results have been 
a matter of favourable comment by many outside the House.
<P>
	Members will note that the proposals in this motion do not 
represent radical departures from some of the ways in which the 
House has operated. They in fact reinforce the fundamentals of 
our system. By this I mean they seek to restore a more active role 
to our members of Parliament and to provide a better balance 
between them and the government. The proposals are the end 
product not just of the Liberal platform, but of intensive study in 
recent years both inside and outside the House.
<P>
	There has been a growing consensus both inside and outside 
the House that proposals such as the ones we find in the motion 
before us are essential to the recognition by Canadians of the 
House of Commons as the central institution of our federal 
government. We do not apologize for what appears to be a 
national consensus. We are pleased to be able to act on this 
national consensus and this is what we are doing today.
<P>
	I want to mention some of those who have contributed to the 
development of this consensus.
<P>
<B>(1110 ) </B>
<P>
	A year ago there was an important report prepared by the 
present minister of government services and the hon. members 
for Saint-Léonard, for Kingston and the Islands, and for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell. This report deserves our 
recognition.
<P>
	Several months later the standing committee on House 
management made its very useful 81st report which represented 
work not only by the members I have just named but also by such 
members as the member for Winnipeg Transcona and former 
members, such as the hon. Jim Edwards.
<P>
	There have also been many studies by academic and private 
sector organizations. There has been work over the years by the 
Parliamentary Centre for Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade 
under the leadership of Peter Dobell. The House has benefited as 
well from commentary on procedural matters by journalists 
such as Hugh Winsor, Doug Fisher and, yes, Bob Fife.
<P>
	In the immediate past weeks we also benefited from 
constructive discussions with the Official Opposition, with the 
Reform Party and with other members. I would like to thank 
particularly the hon. members Roberval and 
Kindersley-Lloydminster, the House leaders for the Bloc and 
the Reform Party, for making a number of constructive 
suggestions which we have been happy to incorporate into this 
motion.
<P>
	I believe this kind of collaboration and consensus building is 
what the Canadian people desire of their elected representatives. 
I am confident all members who want to build a more vital and 
more relevant House of Commons will be able to support these 
proposals.
<P>
	The House actually got a head start in its proposals last week 
when it unanimously approved a restructuring of the committee 
system. At that time the standing committees were realigned to 
match the new structure of the government to make it absolutely 
clear which committee would deal with which of the 
departments and agencies. One important feature of the reforms 
adopted last week was the confirmation that the standing 
committees and not the legislative committees would be the 
usual and customary route for the consideration of the 
committee stage of bills.
<P>
	The motion before us today follows and adds to the changes 
made last week. I would like to now turn to its specific 
provisions.
<P>
	The main object of today's motion is to put in place more of 
the parliamentary framework that will permit members to do 
what was promised by my party in the election campaign and in 
the throne speech. This promise was to enable members of 
Parliament to play a greater role in the legislative process before 
being limited in their scope of action by the approval in 
principle of a bill that is implied by second reading.
<P>
	Second, our proposal will give members an opportunity to 
have more input in the preparation of annual departmental 
spending plans. This will be a considerable enhancement of 
their role in the present process whereby they merely review the 
estimates for the current fiscal year. Since these estimates bear 
the constitutionally required recommendations of the Governor 
General, they are procedurally difficult to alter.
<P>
	Third, our motion would enable members to be directly 
involved in the consideration of proposals for the annual budget 
and in consultations about it before being confronted with 
formal tax measures to which the government must be 
constitutionally committed.
<P>
	It is our proposal that these tasks be undertaken through the 
work of members in the standing committees of the House 
holding hearings, listening to witnesses and arriving openly at 
decisions and recommendations.
<P>
	In a country as vast and complex as Canada every government 
decision represents a compromise. Every decision on 
legislation, on expenditure and on taxation affects different 
groups and regions in our country in different ways. No decision 
can be reached without consulting a wide range of Canadians, 
without considering the views of provinces and municipalities 
and without extensive consultations within the government 
itself, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="961"> 961 </A></B>
<P>
that is among departments of the federal government. As a result 
virtually every government decision represents myriad 
compromises.
<P>
<B>(1115 ) </B>
<P>
	The difficulty that the present practices cause for our 
democratic society is that most of these consultations and 
compromises occur before legislation or financial proposals are 
made public in Parliament.
<P>
	There is little transparency in this pre-parliamentary process 
which gives natural rise to suspicions, justified or not, about its 
fairness and balance.
<P>
	The impact of this approach on Parliament is as a consequence 
often negative. Interested groups unhappy with the result of the 
process may simply seek champions of their opposition in the 
House and often find them in one or more of the opposition 
parties as well as in individual members on the government side.
<P>
	Also ministers and their officials, having already been 
involved in extensive consultation and compromise, are very 
often highly reluctant to agree to substantial alterations of the 
bill in the House. As a result, what could be a constructive and 
potentially more unifying parliamentary process may well 
become confrontational and lead to more division instead of 
some reasonable degree of consensus?
<P>
	It is true that in a regionally, socially and economically 
diverse country such as Canada, arrival at consensus on national 
policy is not easy. When attempts at reaching such compromise 
appear to be restricted to private and even secret processes, 
however, it is at the expense of the valuable educational and 
enlightening effects of more public involvement. All this 
merely exacerbates mistrust and suspicions and makes the 
arrival at some reasonable degree of national consensus unlikely 
or certainly more difficult.
<P>
	Canadians have the sophistication and the generosity to cope 
with the forging of at least some of these difficult compromises 
more in public than has been the case before now. There may be 
some who doubt this but I am convinced that most Canadians are 
capable of understanding each other's needs and positions and 
are willing to sanction the kinds of compromises between 
regional, social and economic groups that are necessary to 
govern so diverse a nation as Canada.
<P>
	What is more, it is important that a modern democratic 
government, more often than at present, more openly involve its 
citizens in this kind of decision making. The government must 
give more trust to its citizens and their elected representatives if 
citizens are to trust their government. Therefore we are 
proposing two new avenues, two new routes, for the House to 
deal with legislation in addition to the one already in existence.
<P>
	The first new avenue, the first new route, would see the 
government introduce a bill for first reading but after a short 
debate of up to three hours and a vote, if necessary, the bill 
would be referred to a committee, usually a standing committee, 
before rather than after second reading and approval in 
principle.
<P>
	The committee would be able to hold extensive hearings and 
would be able to make amendments to the bill unrestricted by 
the present limitations considered to be imposed by approval in 
principle at second reading. Committees would be in a position 
to make extensive revisions to the legislation. Amendments of a 
similarly broad nature could be proposed at the report stage after 
the bill was sent back to the House and this would be prior to the 
completion of the second reading stage.
<P>
	When the report stage is concluded, under this new procedure 
a motion for second reading would be disposed of without 
further debate and the bill would be set down for consideration 
at the third reading stage at a future sitting.
<P>
	The third reading stage as well as the earlier report stage 
would continue to provide broad opportunities for all MPs who 
wish to engage in debate of a more general nature on the bill in 
question.
<P>
	The second new avenue or route would see a committee, on 
motion by a minister or by a private member, if it is a matter 
during private members' hour, charged with the responsibility 
of preparing a bill. Such a committee, likely a standing 
committee, could hold wide ranging hearings on what ought to 
be included in the legislation and would report to the House on 
the principles, provisions and scope of the proposed bill.
<P>
<B>(1120 ) </B>
<P>
	That report could include some of the drafting. Concurrence 
in the report would be an order of the House to bring in such a 
bill. The bill, having already been subject to extensive debate in 
principle during consideration of the motion to concur, would 
have to be given second reading expeditiously and referred to 
committee for detailed study of its legislative language. 
Subsequent consideration by the House would take place under 
already existing legislative procedures.
<P>
	One of the features of this route would be that the 
government, if impressed with a private member's initiative, 
can move it for consideration as compared with the slow and 
difficult procedure usually applied to private members' bills.
<P>
	As I have said, in addition to these two new routes the present 
legislative process will also be retained, the process of sending a 
bill to committee, only after the vote on second reading.
<P>
	The House and its committees will need to develop the 
techniques and the expertise required to make the new 
procedures effective. We propose to make a relatively limited 
number of government bills subject to the new procedures in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="962"> 962 </A></B>
<P>
beginning. I foresee the two new routes  becoming more and 
more the procedures to be preferred by the government.
<P>
	The great advantage of these new procedures, these new 
routes, would be that members would be able to do what they 
and those who elected them have always expected, and that is to 
do more to develop legislation.
<P>
	There is, however, an important additional potential benefit to 
be gained. The broad role of standing committees with regard to 
a bill dealt with in either of these two new processes could 
substantially reduce the quasi-proprietary attitude of ministers 
and their officials toward their legislation. By the time such a 
bill is ready for second or third reading, it could be as much the 
committee's bill as it is that of the sponsoring minister. It has 
been suggested that a vote on second or third reading of such a 
bill could as a consequence of this be more difficult to describe 
as, standing by itself, a confidence issue. Members on all sides 
of the House could find themselves freed more often of 
constitutional implications in voting and would be able to depart 
from party positions without concerns about defeating the 
government.
<P>
	In other words, the suggestion has been made to me that these 
two new legislative routes could be one way of increasing the 
number of so-called free votes.
<P>
	The new procedures also can help avoid situations that all 
governments face from time to time. They result from a bill's 
being developed within departments without sufficiently broad 
and open public consultation. As a consequence, things could be 
overlooked and the governments as a result are embarrassed, to 
say the least, when the bill must be dramatically changed or even 
withdrawn in the face of a strong expression of negative public 
opinion after that bill has been introduced.
<P>
	I would like now to turn to our proposals regarding greater 
involvement of members of the House in financial procedures. 
Under present rules the House does not deal with government 
expenditure until the estimates, the spending programs for the 
current fiscal year as recommended by the crown, have been put 
before it.
<P>
	The estimates are complex and difficult to analyze and are, for 
constitutional reasons, difficult to change. In addition, their 
consideration is subject to a rigorous timetable. Main estimates 
are referred to standing committees late in February and their 
study must be completed in committee by the end of May of the 
same year. As a result, the examination of estimates has become 
rather cursory and there has been no focus for parliamentary 
debate on government spending before its spending priorities 
are actually set.
<P>
	We propose, therefore, that concurrently with consideration 
of the main estimates for the current fiscal year, each standing 
committee must also consider the future expenditure priorities 
for the subsequent fiscal year of the departments and agencies 
for which it is responsible.
<P>
	The committees would be required to report their findings and 
recommendations by the end of June in order to fit into the 
government's administrative timetable for preparing the next 
year's estimates, a process that occurs in the autumn of each 
year.
<P>
<B>(1125 ) </B>
<P>
	The House would thus have the opportunity to provide the 
government and the public with its views on expenditure 
priorities before the estimates for the next fiscal year are 
prepared rather than being put in the difficult position of having 
to deal with what amounts to almost a fait accompli when the 
estimates are finally tabled.
<P>
	Turning to another matter, the annual budget presentation by 
the Minister of Finance usually takes place around the end of 
February of each year. We are proposing in this motion, 
therefore, that the Standing Committee on Finance be required 
to undertake an annual public consultation on what should be in 
the next budget and in so doing to conduct extensive public 
hearings. This consultation would have to take place in the fall 
of each year between September and December so as to fit into 
the real timetable for budget preparation by the Department of 
Finance.
<P>
	Having the consultation take place in this time period would 
make the involvement of parliamentarians meaningful and 
relevant. This would provide a forum for both parliamentarians 
and the public to air their views on these important matters well 
before the budget is locked in in order for it to be presented 
around the end of February.
<P>
	This would also enable the Minister of Finance to test 
proposals and ideas with the public less hindered by the often 
misunderstood and often exaggerated concept of budget 
secrecy.
<P>
	The idea is that while the minister would still take care to 
avoid giving unfair commercial advantage through advance 
notice of what the budget would actually contain, he or she 
would have the benefit of public and parliamentary comment 
before, rather than after, preparing the budget. Also this would 
be done because the study has to take place in the finance 
committee in the fall of each year before a budget is expected to 
be presented the following February. This would have to take 
place at a point close to when decisions are being made within 
the government on the contents of the budget.
<P>
	I should add that the public could well benefit from a better 
understanding of the options, and by analysis of the committee 
proceedings hopefully would be more confident that the budge 
once published reflects its needs.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="963"> 963 </A></B>
<P>
	In addition to providing the framework for implementing our 
platform commitments and what was said in the throne speech, 
the motion seeks to regularize the hours of sitting of the House. 
Over the years evening sittings in my view have proven to be 
unproductive for legislation and not helpful to the health and 
family life of members and the staff of the House.
<P>
	Evening sittings will still occur when the House is debating 
general policy matters that attract an unusually high level of 
participation, as we have seen in the last few weeks, or holding 
special debates on matters of urgency. However, we consider it 
desirable that the House not usually sit during the evenings in 
order to give members more time for committees, for work in 
their offices and perhaps, most important, time for some normal 
home life for those whose families come to be in Ottawa.
<P>
	We wish as well to accommodate members' travel on 
weekends to their constituencies by reverting to an earlier 
adjournment time on Fridays. We would make up the time lost 
by sitting until 6.30 p.m. rather than 6 p.m. during the week and 
by doing away with the break between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. on 
Tuesdays and Thursdays.
<P>
	We are also proposing a measure that would protect the right 
of private members to have their proposals debated for the full 
allotted of time as well a measure that would recognize in the 
rules the need for the House to make certain amendments from 
time to time to tax bills that are already before the House.
<P>
	There are a number of other areas of parliamentary procedure 
that have been subject to comment from both within and outside 
the House including what has been mentioned in the House 
management committee's 81st report of which I spoke earlier. 
These include such matters as the conduct of Question Period, 
special debates and Private Members' Business. I do not believe 
that these should be the subject of an initiative by the 
government at the beginning of new Parliament, especially one 
in which more than two-thirds of the members are new to the 
House. In addition there is the question of electronic voting, a 
subject that has engendered a lot of discussion in recent years.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	These subjects as well as a number of other issues such as 
recall, referenda, citizens' initiatives, are among those that 
should be addressed in a parliamentary study. As a result we are 
proposing that the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs put them on its agenda for early consideration.
<P>
	Also the government has decided that as a part of its effort to 
enhance the relevance of the House of Commons, ministers 
must, whenever possible, make announcements regarding 
policy first here in the House and before meeting the press rather 
than after.
<P>
	This enables members to hear first about such decisions in the 
House of Commons. This also facilitates formal responses by 
the opposition parties. We saw a good example of how this 
approach can work with a  statement by the Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration just last week.
<P>
	It is also the government's intention to continue the 
innovation seen in the last few weeks in which the government, 
on its own initiative, sets aside a significant portion of its own 
House time for general debates on policy issues of current and 
immediate significance.
<P>
	I believe this enhances the role of members since their voices 
will be heard here in the House of Commons more often before 
decisions are made rather than afterward.
<P>
	I want to turn to a subject that is not mentioned in the motion 
itself, but I anticipate that some of the debate on the motion will 
concern this subject. It is the subject of so-called free votes. I 
want to spend a few minutes discussing this important topic.
<P>
	The subject does not appear in the motion because in our view 
it is not a matter that can be dealt with effectively by the rules 
themselves. In fact it is not a matter dealt with now by the rules, 
the standing orders of the House. Instead I have concluded it is a 
matter to be dealt with by each party and each party's members 
themselves.
<P>
	A government may choose to declare a vote a free vote but it 
cannot oblige the other parties in the House to accept such a 
declaration. For example, in the last Parliament the House had 
before it a bill on abortion which government backbenchers and 
the Official Opposition regarded as a free vote but which the 
then third party declared to be as far as it was concerned a party 
vote, that is one of party policy from which dissent by its 
members was not acceptable to it.
<P>
	We should also bear in mind that this question is as much one 
of self-discipline as it is of party discipline.
<P>
	Most members of this House sought election on the basis that 
they were supporters of a particular party, its leader and its 
program. This is certainly the case for the Liberals who 
campaigned on a more fully detailed and developed platform 
than is usually the case. Electors likely expect their members to 
represent them in a manner that is consistent with the basis on 
which their members sought election.
<P>
	A more complex consideration here is that the question of free 
votes is not only a matter of internal parliamentary procedure. 
We are dealing here with the Constitution. To be sure it is the 
largely unwritten part of our constitution but it is a vital part, 
crucial to the whole concept of parliamentary democracy.
<P>
	It is a fundamental constitutional principle that the 
government in order to hold office must command the 
confidence of the House of Commons. Confidence means that 
the House does not only agree that the Prime Minister and the 
cabinet ought to remain in office, but in order to permit them to 
do so the that House is prepared to support their fundamental 
policies. This is a basic element of the unwritten part of the 
Constitution, that part which stems from the preamble to the 
Constitution  Act which states that Canada is to have a 
constitution ``similar in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="964"> 964 </A></B>
<P>
principle to that of the United Kingdom''. In other words, we are 
the heirs to hundreds of years of constitutional practice and are 
at the same time both liberated and bound by that legacy.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	For more than 300 years it has been a constitutional principle 
in the United Kingdom, and later in Canada, that ministers in 
order to hold office must have the support of the House of 
Commons in the sense that they are assured of a majority on 
their central policies. They must demonstrate on an ongoing 
basis the ability to persuade the House to grant the crown the 
funds necessary to carry on the government, to raise the 
necessary moneys through taxes and to enact the laws the 
ministry considers essential for good government.
<P>
	Under our constitution the House may express its satisfaction 
with ministers who hold office by passing motions expressing 
confidence or defeating motions of censure from time to time. 
But if that same House were at the same time to deny regularly to 
the ministers the funds needed to administer the government or 
the taxes to pay its bills or the legislation the ministers believe 
essential, those ministers would be shown to be unable to 
govern.
<P>
	As a result, they would have to leave office or seek the 
election of a new House. The confidence of the House and the 
government is not simply something that is periodically voted 
upon. It is something that is also gained or lost on a cumulative 
basis.
<P>
	Not long ago the Prime Minister was asked in the House to 
commit the government to a process whereby it could, after any 
defeat on any bill or motion other than an explicit no confidence 
motion, bring before the House a motion reaffirming the 
confidence of the House and the ministry and if sustained in that 
motion to carry on.
<P>
	This process, if sparingly used, is a legitimate one. It was 
employed in the House once 25 years ago. This happened when a 
government, having carried a tax bill successfully through all 
earlier stages, was not sufficiently prudent and held the final 
vote at what proved to be the wrong time. Having been defeated 
on the third reading of that bill, the government later brought in 
a motion that specifically declared that situation not to have 
been an intentional declaration by the House of no confidence in 
the government. The House accepted the motion and the 
government carried on.
<P>
	It is not however a device that is, if resorted to on a regular 
basis, at all compatible with Canadian and British constitutional 
theory or practice. A government, I submit, in order to remain in 
office must be able to count upon Parliament to support the 
essentials that the programs that it places before it and upon 
which its members were elected. Both the Constitution and the 
electorate expect the government to do something more than to 
simply cling to office. A government is expected to pursue the 
program on which it was elected.
<P>
	This is not to say that the government must be on the winning 
side of every vote in the House in order to stay in office. Far 
from it. The Sir John A. Macdonald government between 1867 
and 1872 absorbed many defeats both on legislation and on 
supply. The Trudeau government between 1972 and 1974 also 
carried on despite defeat, including some on supply.
<P>
	The cumulative effect of votes in both of those parliaments 
however was supportive of these governments. By and large 
they got their legislative programs and their central fiscal 
policies adopted.
<P>
	The question of confidence is far from straightforward. This 
was demonstrated during the debate on the Address in Reply to 
the Speech from the Throne in January 1973 when then Prime 
Minister Trudeau presented an exposition of the confidence 
convention and said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Some things for us will be questions of confidence. Some things would mean 
the demise of the government. If, for instance, there should be a clear vote of no 
confidence in the government, if the government should be defeated on 
fundamentals, on basic principles-we shall go to the people-But I hasten to add 
that other questions, if they go against us, will not be interpreted by the 
government as a defeat of the government.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1140 ) </B>
<P>
	He was then followed by the then leader of the New 
Democratic Party, the late David Lewis, who summed up in his 
view what was Mr. Trudeau's position on confidence as being:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We will let you know whether it was confidence after.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Mr. Lewis begged to differ. He said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I want to tell him that, as far as we are concerned, it will be parliament that 
will make that decision.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Constitutional experts tell us the fact is that both Mr. Trudeau 
and the late Mr. Lewis were correct. A government can always 
assert that the results of any vote in the House demonstrates that 
it enjoys the confidence of the House. However, in the final 
analysis it has to prove this claim on an ongoing basis by 
continuing to win crucial votes here in the House. This shows 
how complex the question really is.
<P>
	Our Constitution differs from that of the United States. There 
the executive and legislature are rigorously separated. In 
Canada the executive and legislature are not rigorously 
separated as is the case in the United States. Our Constitution 
does not permit the executive and the legislative body to 
function almost independently, often working in opposite 
directions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="965"> 965 </A></B>
<P>
	This is not to say that our Constitution is based upon the 
subservience of the legislature to the executive. Indeed in 
principle at least the reverse is true. It is the central thrust of our 
proposed procedural reform, the reforms we are discussing 
today, to reinforce the role of members of this House without 
sacrificing the mutually interlinked, the symbiotic relationship 
between executive and legislature that is the hallmark of a 
parliamentary democracy.
<P>
	While this issue is as I have said more complex than some 
would have us believe, I do not wish in describing these 
complexities to leave the House with the impression that the 
government is reluctant to depart from the recent practice of 
treating virtually every vote in the House as a matter of 
confidence. In fact it is definitely not the intention of the 
government to treat every vote as a matter of confidence. There 
will certainly be more occasions than in the past when this 
government will not regard issues before the House as matters of 
confidence, whether these be on amendments, on bills or on 
other motions.
<P>
	I think I should return to the motion before us and to say in 
conclusion that I want to repeat that this motion is intended to 
provide an important new framework for both immediate and 
ongoing parliamentary reform. However, it will still be up to 
members on both sides of the House to make it work.
<P>
	I want to assure you, Mr. Speaker, that it is the government's 
intention, it is the intention of members supporting the 
government, to make these changes work. I believe this motion 
will carry out the government's commitment in the throne 
speech to enhance the credibility of Parliament by giving 
members of Parliament a greater opportunity to contribute to the 
development of public policy and legislation.
<P>
	I urge this House to adopt this motion as a substantial 
contribution to achieving these important objectives which are 
aimed at restoring the confidence of Canadians in the House of 
Commons as the central institution of our federal government 
and of our parliamentary democracy.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the speech 
from the throne, the government committed itself to enhancing 
the credibility of Parliament. It also announced that changes 
would be proposed to the standing orders of the House of 
Commons to give members of Parliament a greater opportunity 
to contribute to the development of public policy and 
legislation.
<P>
	Today, the government introduced its proposals for 
parliamentary reform. The Official Opposition does not object 
to the proposed changes to the Standing Orders of the House of 
Commons. However we do have some reservations.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	Certain aspects of the proposed reform violate the 
fundamental principles of our parliamentary system. In other 
areas, we feel it does not go far enough, and we seriously doubt 
that the few changes being proposed will be able to restore 
Parliament's image and enhance the role of its members in the 
eyes of the public.
<P>
	We realize that updating the rules in the Standing Orders is 
not a task to be taken lightly. Parliamentary procedure is 
extremely complex. It is based on principles that are meant to 
protect the inherent values of a democratic society like ours. 
Any attempt at reform must be done with great care, to avoid 
undermining the fundamental principles of our parliamentary 
democracy. As Charles Franks, founding president of the 
Canadian Study of Parliament Group pointed out, parliamentary 
reform is not a straightforward technique to make Parliament 
more effective and efficient, although it is often presented in 
those terms. This kind of reform is about the interests that 
legislators must serve in Canada and how various points of view 
may or may not affect choices and results.
<P>
	However, we know that thorough reform is possible, witness 
the sweeping reforms of 1968 and 1985. It is enough to observe 
the following rule: any changes in the Standing Orders must 
conform to the fundamental principles of the Canadian 
parliamentary system.
<P>
	Before taking a closer look at the government's proposals, 
perhaps I may briefly recall, for the benefit of this House, the 
underlying principles.
<P>
	The Canadian parliamentary system is derived from the 
British system. In fact, according to the preamble to the 
Constitution Act, 1867, the Canadian Constitution is based on 
the same principles as those applied in the United Kingdom.
<P>
	Historically, the British parliamentary system has consisted 
in a set of techniques for co-operation between the government, 
called the King's Council, and the elected assembly or House of 
Commons. To encourage co-operation between the two powers, 
the British created various means of contact as well as certain 
controls and constraints.
<P>
	Normally, these parliamentary techniques should have 
disappeared when the supremacy of Parliament, represented by 
the House of Commons, became the sole legitimate basis for the 
exercise of political power in Great Britain and Canada. 
However the need to reconcile parliamentary supremacy and 
effective government led to maintaining the parliamentary 
mechanisms that we know today.
<P>
	Briefly, the British parliamentary system is based on 
maintaining a balance between the government's right to govern 
and the right of the House of Commons to control the 
government's activities, according to the principles of 
parliamentary supremacy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="966"> 966 </A></B>
<P>
	To maintain this very necessary balance, the British 
parliamentary system requires a flexible sharing of legislative 
and executive powers by Parliament and the government, while 
stressing co-operation.
<P>
	The government enjoys the confidence of members of 
Parliament who belong to the party that has the majority of the 
seats in the House of Commons. This allows the government to 
dictate the business of the House. Although the House of 
Commons conducts its business as it sees fit, it is more or less 
subject to the government's will. This mechanism allows the 
government to govern.
<P>
	However, members of the House of Commons enjoy 
guarantees by which they are free to criticize the nature of 
government activity. These guarantees arise from the Standing 
Orders of the House and certain conventions. The preservation 
of the rights of the opposition is one of the basic unwritten rules.
<P>
	The contemporary role of the House of Commons is therefore 
to monitor the government's actions. The main function of its 
members is to publicly and freely challenge and criticize the 
government and the measures it tables in the House. Any 
infringement of the member's role diminishes the usefulness of 
the House of Commons as a democratic institution.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	As a result of the last election, the 54 members of the official 
Opposition were given the mandate to defend the interests of 
their constituents in the House of Commons pursuant to 
Parliamentary rules and traditions. They intend to assume the 
traditional role entrusted them under the Canadian 
parliamentary tradition to monitor the government's actions. 
However, Quebec voters did not give them the mandate to 
reform federal institutions such as the House of Commons.
<P>
	Granted, the government has presented us with a proposed 
reform of the Standing Orders of the House, and it is its 
prerogative to do so. We have decided to co-operative to fully 
assume our parliamentary role and carry out our mandate. But 
our duties are not limited to approving the government's 
proposed amendments to the Standing Orders. We must also 
offer constructive criticism of the proposed reform. The Official 
Opposition intends to underline not only the positive aspects but 
also the shortcomings and oversights in the government 
proposals. The objective of this approach is to reassert the value 
of the members' work while respecting the underlying 
principles of the Canadian parliamentary system.
<P>
	As representatives of Quebec voters, we cannot let the House 
lose some of the tools it has to monitor the government's 
actions. We would prefer to see an increase in the number of 
such tools. In fact, the Opposition watches over the transparency 
and openness of the House of Commons proceedings, in order to 
preserve the democratic values of our society.
<P>
	In this regard, we are a little surprised by two amendments to 
the Standing Orders put forward by the government: the referral 
of a bill to a committee after the first reading and the delegation 
to a committee of the responsibility to draft a bill. Of course, the 
government asserts that noble goals are behind these proposals. 
Unfortunately, they will result in suppressing debate in the 
House on the principle of government bills.
<P>
	The first amendment enables a minister to propose a motion to 
refer a bill to a committee right after the first reading subject to a 
short 180 minute debate during which no amendment would be 
allowed. Once the motion had been passed, the bill would then 
be referred to a committee controlled by the government 
majority for review.
<P>
	The report stage would then be followed by second reading 
without amendment or debate. The report stage would become 
part of the second reading stage. The bill would then be 
reviewed at the third reading stage pursuant to the current 
Standing Orders.
<P>
	Of course, Opposition members would have the opportunity 
to address in the House the principle of the bill during the initial 
debate on the referral motion. However, the debate would then 
be shorter than the usual second reading debate. Moreover, the 
members would lose the opportunity to propose the 
postponement of second reading or to put forward a reasoned 
amendment. The proposal to amend Standing Orders 73 and 76 
and to add Standing Order 76(1) would limit debate in the House 
on the principle of the bill.
<P>
	Comment 659 in the sixth edition of Beauchesne reads as 
follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The second reading is the most important stage through which the bill is 
required to pass; for its whole principle is then at issue and is affirmed or denied 
by a vote of the House.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The debate and vote on the principle of a bill is the Opposition 
members' main mechanism to control government bills. It 
enables them to criticize in the House the principle of a bill 
before the clause by clause review in committee.
<P>
	It would be difficult to question the principle of a bill in 
committee at the report stage while trying to amend it clause by 
clause. As a result of this amendment, the debate on principle 
would be diluted by that on the amendments to each clause of the 
bill. We will debate technicalities without having discussed 
clearly and openly the opportunity of the bill. That is why the 
opposition has reservations about this amendment. In our 
opinion, it affects the fundamental right of members of 
Parliament to have an input in the legislative activities of 
government, a right which is at the very root of the Canadian 
parliamentary system.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="967"> 967 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	We doubt that such an amendment will renew the credibility 
of this House in the eyes of Canadians. We could have had 
something more substantial to reassert the value of Parliament.
<P>
	We feel uneasy about another amendment and for the same 
reason: the one allowing a minister to put a motion to instruct a 
committee to prepare and bring in a draft government bill. In its 
report, the committee would recommend the principles, scope 
and provisions of the draft bill.
<P>
	Concurrence in this report by the House would constitute an 
order of the House for the government to bring in a bill based on 
the report, but not necessarily the one recommended by the 
committee. The government bill would then be introduced for 
first reading. The third sitting day after having been read a first 
time, the bill would be set down for consideration at the second 
reading stage, and immediately voted upon without debate or 
amendment.
<P>
	In effect, this amendment to Standing Order 68 prevents 
members from debating in the House the principle of 
government bills. Certainly members are involved in the 
preparation of the draft, but their input is more theoretical than 
anything else, as far as we are concerned. In fact, the decision 
rests with the majority of the members of the committee who 
come from the government party.
<P>
	The principle of the bill adopted in committee essentially 
reflects the wishes of the government. It cannot be argued 
therefore that opposition members participate fully to the 
preparation of the bill. They do participate in the debate on the 
committee report and can propose amendments. By then 
however, the bill tabled by the government has turned into an 
entirely new governmental bill that can be different from the 
draft bill tabled by the committee.
<P>
	This can hardly be seen as the same bill. In fact, we are 
dealing with an entirely new bill, the principle of which has 
never been considered. This amendment denies the members the 
right to debate in this House the relevancy of the new 
government bill. Also, the involvement of opposition members 
in the preparation of the bill is used to claim later that they were 
in agreement. It is basically infringing upon the right of 
opposition members to examine the legislative activity of 
government by forcing them to conduct a fundamental part of 
their work as parliamentarians in committee, without debating 
the principle of the bill.
<P>
	Again, the opposition doubts that this is the sort of 
amendment that will enhance the work performed by the 
opposition members. It undermines a major aspect of the 
Canadian parliamentary system, in that the members are to 
monitor the legislative activities of government through an open 
debate in the House of Commons on the principle of 
governmental bills. For that reason, it would be dangerous for 
the Official Opposition to say  that this amendment will help 
remedy the negative perception the public may have of the 
House of Commons.
<P>
	In spite of these reservations, the Official Opposition 
recognizes that some of the changes proposed by the 
government are indeed interesting. Two amendments are timid 
steps in the right direction. First, the amendment to Standing 
Order 81, empowers standing committees to consider 
government expenditures for future years.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	Second, adding Standing Order 83(1) authorizes the Finance 
committee to make reports on budgetary policies before the 
tabling of the budget.
<P>
	These proposals, however, are not enough. The government 
forgot to include some measures which would have enhanced, in 
a concrete manner, the status of the work done by MPs, thereby 
improving the credibility of Parliament as a whole. By 
proposing that the House of Commons examine 
order-in-council appointments before such appointments take 
effect, the government would have taken a giant step toward 
transparency.
<P>
	It would have been in everyone's interests, including the 
Prime Minister, the opposition parties, the members of 
Parliament and the candidates to those positions, to submit to 
the House, as part of this parliamentary reform, a procedure 
allowing the members and the public to participate in the 
appointment process. In so doing, the government would have 
concretely enhanced the status of the work done by MPs and 
would have given back some credibility to Parliament.
<P>
	Yet, during the election campaign, the Liberals promised to 
restore integrity within the federal government administration. 
On page 92 of their famous election program, the Liberals 
accused the Conservatives of choosing political friends when 
making key appointments within the government, adding that 
they would put an end to this reprehensible practice. The 
Liberals committed themselves to making appointments on the 
basis of competence.
<P>
	Why then did they not propose, as part of this parliamentary 
reform, a review process which would take place prior to 
confirming order in council appointments? We wonder.
<P>
	Giving MPs the power to approve order in council 
appointments before their coming into effect would have been 
an excellent way of solving the problem exposed by the Liberal 
Party in its election program. Indeed, to allow the House of 
Commons to review order in council appointments of 
parliamentary officials, judges, ambassadors, high 
commissioners, top civil servants, chairpersons and directors of 
Crown corporations, as well as of those appointed to various 
regulating agencies, organizations and tribunals, would 
certainly have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="968"> 968 </A></B>
<P>
been an excellent way of removing the negative perception the 
general public has of some of our political institutions.
<P>
	The idea is not a new one. Such a review process already 
exists in another great democracy, namely the United States of 
America. The reform proposed today does not take into account 
the urgency of implementing such a review process, by the 
House of Commons, regarding appointments made by the 
government. Yet, it is essential that the public view these 
appointments as not being merely a form of patronage.
<P>
	The government is saying to Canadians: If you want more 
transparency, you will have to wait! Indeed, the government 
failed to propose an important measure which could have 
improved the public perception of our parliamentary 
democracy.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the opposition also notes another important 
oversight, namely the absence of a mechanism to hold special 
debates on issues deemed important by the members of the 
opposition. Such a measure would have enabled the government 
to enhance even more the status of the work done by MPs. Past 
experience reveals that emergency debates in the House are a 
rather rare occurrence. These debates are held at the discretion 
of the government. The conditions regulating the holding of 
such debates are very strict and thus prevent debates on issues 
deemed important by the public. Many Canadians feel that the 
work done by the House lacks relevance to the main current 
issues. The holding of special debates would provide MPs with 
an opportunity to have in-depth discussions on current issues.
<P>
	In its 81st report tabled in 1993, the Standing Committee on 
House Management recommended the adoption of a procedure 
to hold special debates on specific issues. The goal was to ensure 
that members of the opposition would be able to raise questions 
of particular interest to them. The government did not deem 
appropriate to include a procedure for special debates in its 
parliamentary reform, even though this would have had the 
effect of giving more credibility to the work of the House and to 
the parliamentary role of the MPs.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	In the same vein, I would like to mention a final major 
oversight of the government. The government did not include a 
proposal to create a special question-and-answer period on 
particular topics or departments. This oversight is even more 
glaring in that the 81st report of the Standing Committee on 
House Management recommended establishing such a question 
period and having one every week. According to the committee, 
this special question-and-answer period could deal with 
regional or sectoral problems that do not receive due attention 
from the opposition, for lack of time. It would also provide an 
opportunity to question ministers more systematically than is 
possible now.
<P>
	The government thus dropped a fundamental 
recommendation of the management committee to make the 
work of Parliament reflect the people's everyday concerns. This 
oversight will not bring the institution of the House of Commons 
closer to the people.
<P>
	In conclusion, the reform proposed by the government is 
light-years away from a real, specific upgrading of the work of 
members of Parliament. On the contrary, the government is 
proposing changes to the Standing Orders which, although 
positive in some respects, seem in their application to contradict 
to some extent the foundation of the parliamentary system in 
which we now operate.
<P>
	We deplore the fact that the government did not consider 
statements made by one of its own members when he criticized 
the Conservative government's reform plan in 1991. On April 9, 
1991, the Liberal member for Kingston and the Islands said, as 
reported on page 19189 of <I>Hansard</I>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We believe that this country functions best when it has a strong and effective 
opposition.</BLOCKQUOTE>
Later he added:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-the importance of an opposition in Parliament to inform the people and to 
express their grievances in Parliament is deep rooted in the British 
parliamentary tradition. Over the years, governments have sought to curtail the 
rights of oppositions to present grievances and to argue their case.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The official opposition agrees with the opinion expressed by 
the hon. member. Indeed, the present official opposition takes 
the same view of the parliamentary system because it 
summarizes the present situation. The government, by 
abolishing debate in the House on the principle of a bill, seems 
to be ignoring the right of opposition parties to express their 
grievances and to argue their case. Moreover, it is not proposing 
supplementary mechanisms that would allow free criticism of 
government action.
<P>
	It is a pity that the Liberal Party in power has a different 
opinion than it held when it was in opposition. The government 
has not been concerned with the fine principles it defended when 
it was in opposition. Perhaps the Liberal Party in power and the 
Liberal Party in opposition say two different things. Events bear 
that statement out, at any rate.
<P>
	With its incomplete reform, the government will not achieve 
its objective of restoring the credibility of Parliament and of the 
present system. The official opposition knew that we could not 
count on the federal government to solve an image problem with 
the House of Commons. Obviously, the government is showing 
real timidity in submitting specific measures to end what I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="969"> 969 </A></B>
<P>
would dare say is the widespread disillusionment that people 
feel towards politicians.
<P>
	Nevertheless, the official opposition is aware of the most 
important role which it must play in this House. It has always 
shown that it intends to defend the interests of its constituents, 
in accordance with parliamentary rules and traditions. For these 
reasons, it will not impede the proposed reform.
<P>
	Yes, the opposition has reservations. It shares its 
disappointment with all citizens. But to show its good faith and 
its sense of fair play, it recognizes the proposed reform. It could 
have fiercely opposed some of the amendments presented today, 
but it prefers to give its consent so that the positive aspects of 
the reform can have unanimous support in this House.
<P>
	In closing, I say to the government that forewarned is 
forearmed. The official opposition intends to continue to 
promote the openness demanded by voters. It will vigorously 
defend the values inherent in the Canadian parliamentary 
system so that it can defend the interests of Quebecers in this 
House, in accordance with its mandate.
<P>
	This does not exclude the possibility that in future it might 
fight a subsequent reform which could interfere with its work in 
Parliament and its defense of its constituents' interests. Our 
society's democratic values depend on this.
<P>
<B>(1210 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. On 
behalf of the Reform caucus co-ordinator I would like to notify 
the Chair that pursuant to Standing Order 43(2) we will be 
dividing our time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, today is a very 
great day and one we should mark high on the marquee as being 
very important for the House, for Parliament and for the people 
of Canada.
<P>
	First I want to thank the government on behalf of the Reform 
Party for putting such a broad agenda before us. Its willingness 
to look at changes to the committee structure and then 
presenting those changes will bring about certain expediencies 
and as well make those committees more effective. The second 
matter we appreciate very much is that the agenda to be set 
before the Standing Committee on Procedures and House 
Affairs will be broad enough to look at a number of items we 
think are very important to the process and the way we act as 
parliamentarians.
<P>
	We must recognize as parliamentarians that the attitude of the 
public has changed and that we must adapt to the changed 
attitude and expectations. The public we have spent millions of 
dollars on for years and years ought to be able to be more 
involved in the process. I believe we have arrived at a point at 
which it said to us: ``We have arrived; we want to be involved so 
you as legislators make sure you have a process by which we can 
intervene and present our points of view and direct  government 
during a session of Parliament, specifically during this 35th 
Parliament''.
<P>
	All of us have heard that this is not just a Canadian 
phenomenon. It is a phenomenon of the United States. Over the 
weekend some members of Parliament had the opportunity of 
hearing a presentation on Congress reform so that Congress 
would be able to hear what the public wanted. The fellow who 
presented it talked about the attitude of Americans and how they 
wanted to be involved. It is very consistent with what we are 
hearing. It was a good message.
<P>
	Japan, Europe and other parts of the world have gone through 
the same populous phenomenon, the same people involvement 
phenomenon. We must pay attention to it as it is significant.
<P>
	This attitude came into focus during the debate on the 
referendum. At that time the old traditional approach, the 
elitism, or the hierarchal approach to politics was defeated by a 
broad base of populism. People on the no side had very few 
dollars to spend. People on the yes side had millions of dollars 
and they spent it through a variety of mediums trying to 
convince the population that they should vote yes on the 
referendum. The people said no, that they would decide and they 
did.
<P>
	We have to recognize other characteristics in the process. 
They should be a lesson and an influence on what we determine 
after we have hearings and the committee comes back with its 
report. Voters want more input and more say in the decisions we 
make not only at election time but between elections. They want 
equality of input. Everyone no matter their social standard or 
what economic position they are in-the poor, the middle 
income, the rich-wants to have something to say about the 
process and we must open the doors for them.
<P>
<B>(1215 ) </B>
<P>
	Something very important to me which I have seen happen in 
our political system is that certain vested interest groups and 
certain people within our society are able to succeed because of 
who they knew and who they were able to influence in 
government. People are saying to us that is not the current rule 
and is not the way it should be. It should be taken out of the 
political process. It should now be what one knows, what one's 
attitude is and what one can place into debate to determine the 
actions of government. It should be this way not only in the 
House but also within the rooms of the public service and of the 
ministers with whatever actions the minister takes in his or her 
public responsibilities. That is a very impressive major change 
to me as a parliamentarian.
<P>
	What challenge is offered? How do we respond to our leaders 
who now are the electors? The electors are finally getting 
through to us and saying something. How do we respond? First 
we must respond by adding opportunity to the process. In the 
agenda before the standing committee are some very important 
matters: citizens' initiatives, referendums and direct 
representa-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="970"> 970 </A></B>
<P>
tion to the standing  committees so that the members of 
Parliament can be more involved and more aware of attitudes.
<P>
	Some people say we are going to a referendum on everything. 
That is not the intent of a referendum nor do people want that 
type of government. They do not want daily referenda. They 
want to know that if they want utilize referenda it is there so they 
can get involved. It is very important that we add it to our 
process.
<P>
	The second matter they want to challenge us with, and this 
may be said of myself being around for some time or some of the 
members of government who have been around Parliament for a 
period of time, is that we must be prepared to change our 
thinking. As a new member of the House we should also take 
that advice.
<P>
	Today I would like to call on the Prime Minister and the 
government House leader, who made a very eloquent and 
elaborate presentation today, to think in a more open manner. 
We must reconsider some of the traditional approaches on how 
we act and how we behave. It is often easy to say we tried that 
before and it does not work, we should not have that on our 
agenda. I have gone through the process a number of times. 
About 10 years ago I had a certain experience in my legislative 
responsibility. At that time it may have been out of step, but 
today it is more acceptable. Some of these public processes are 
just good examples of that.
<P>
	For example, I would like the government to reconsider its 
thinking regarding free votes. In the early stages we do not have 
to have a free vote on everything. Possibly there is an area where 
we can test the free vote without the confidence convention. 
Maybe there are some areas where new programs of expenditure 
will be initiated by government. It could be in the budget 
process. The Prime Minister, by announcement, could say this 
item is open to a free vote; the convention is not there. That 
would be acceptable to the House. It could possibly be done on 
some of the bills that reference expenditures where it is a new 
policy, one that has not gone through the electoral process.
<P>
	As I listened to the House leader's remarks today I felt that 
was part of his concern, that if the political party has made a 
commitment out on the hustings it should follow it through. I 
would, in a sense, agree with that. It has been given a mandate to 
follow through so it should. The House of Commons may have a 
limited amount of authority, but there should be some areas 
where we can test this concept without just rejecting it in whole. 
I call on the House leader to think about it. I also call on the 
committee of House affairs to examine it further.
<P>
	I have one minute left and would like to cover two other 
topics. I support the changes in the committee structure as it 
concerns my involvement with the finance committee. It is 
excellent the government is giving us more opportunity and 
flexibility to be able to determine the direction of government. I 
appreciate that very much as an opposition member.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	The proof is certainly going to be in the follow through. The 
note that I wanted to highlight in this last minute of my remarks 
is that historically-I read some of the reports of committee 
work-the concern was that ministers and senior government 
officials did not listen to the committees after they did some 
good work. I know the initial attitude of the government is to 
change that and try to listen to the committee.
<P>
	Another suggestion I want to make for the committee today in 
my brief remarks is that we look at using the technology of the 
day and the available electronic equipment to do away with 
some of what I call the paper pile up and waste I find on 
Parliament Hill.
<P>
	Two weeks ago I set outside my office a huge pile of paper. I 
said: ``What a waste''. I looked through it and there were many 
things that were not relevant to my responsibilities. There must 
be some way we can even have <I>Hansard</I> electronically available 
without sending that major document to our office every day. I 
would like to add that to the committee's agenda for it to look at. 
There would be cost savings, more efficiency and an update of 
the process.
<P>
	In conclusion elitism is out. Populism is in. If we make these 
major changes during the 35th Parliament, I will be able to say 
we have achieved significant relief for the people of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with 
interest to the comments of my hon. colleague from Lethbridge. 
I tend to agree with almost everything he said. I echo his 
comments on the proposals enunciated today by the government 
House leader. They are a major step forward.
<P>
	I listened with particular interest when he referred to his 
previous life and that there were times when perhaps 
government policy was influenced more by who people knew 
within the government than from a democratically driven 
change. We can probably say that similar observations have 
been made about Ottawa, that perhaps public policy has been 
driven in the past by lobbyists and others from the outside as 
opposed to the public generally.
<P>
	One aspect of the reforms proposed today that concern me is 
the ability of any of these reforms to deal with initiatives before 
us at the moment. That is the matter of cigarette smuggling. 
People have said this is an item that ought to receive serious 
input from provincial ministers of health because of the 
implication it has for health.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="971"> 971 </A></B>
<P>
	If this is not caving in to pressure from the cigarette 
manufacturers it is certainly caving in to pressure from people 
participating in illegal activities. Does my hon. friend from 
Lethbridge think any of the proposed changes introduced today 
would help us if they were in place today to deal with some of 
the critical issues confronting us surrounding this whole matter 
of cigarette smuggling?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Often one of the reasons that one 
has very brash reactions from the general public is that it does 
not seem to be able to vent that feeling somewhere.
<P>
	This matter concerns both federal and provincial taxation. It 
could be open to a citizen's initiative. Potentially we could even 
have a referendum on it but it takes a bit of time to do that type of 
thing. I know we are sort of in the hot box and have to make a 
decision on this one right away. That often will occur. If we had 
the procedure in place then we could make a rational adjustment 
to use it. I would like to see that very much.
<P>
	We are having a public discussion with regard to cigarette 
smuggling. I believe the public has an answer to it somewhere. 
The government will look at it from a certain perspective but I 
am not sure it would reflect public opinion at the present time.
<P>
	In a quick answer to the question, opening the public process 
would bring about a more satisfactory answer than one we would 
make here believing what the public servants have fed us.
<P>
<B>(1225 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise in the House to join in 
the debate on the motion put by the government House leader 
dealing with changes to the standing orders, the rules of the 
House of Commons.
<P>
	I would like to begin by congratulating the government and its 
House leader for bringing in these changes at this time. To me 
they represent the beginning of the reform of this place that my 
party, the Reform Party of Canada, has been advocating for 
some time now.
<P>
	We in the Reform Party are fundamentally committed to 
changing the way business is conducted in Parliament so the 
people of Canada and the members of Parliament who represent 
them can gain some influence over the policy making process.
<P>
	In our party platform, devised long before the call of the last 
election, we made it clear we did not believe this place was 
functioning in a way that best served the people. We proposed in 
our platform changes which we believe would give members 
some influence over the policy making process of government. 
Ours was not a plan released in the heat of an election campaign. 
Our plan for reform goes much further than what has been 
proposed today.
<P>
	We believe the government is reacting positively to our 
pressure by bringing in these changes to the standing orders. We 
in the Reform Party will watch the government carefully to see 
if it is really committed to fundamental reform or if it is simply 
putting limited reforms in the window for Canadians to look at 
without any real intention of making them work. However these 
changes represent a good first step, but it is only a first step.
<P>
	The changes introduced in relation to bills proceeding to 
committee prior to second reading and enabling the government 
to request or ask a committee to draft a bill are really not 
necessary. If the government wants to do these things it simply 
has to do them and could do them under the present rules. These 
changes present an orderly procedure by which bills can be sent 
to committee after first reading and the government can request 
a committee to bring in a bill. These procedures allow for 
limited debate so that the government is assured of 
accomplishing its objectives without giving up valuable House 
time.
<P>
	In relation to the proposal to send bills to committee prior to 
second reading we know that the subsequent debate on second 
reading will really become debate on amendments. As well 
when a bill comes back to the House from the committee which 
has been asked to draft it, again debate at second reading will not 
take place.
<P>
	Debating time which could have been used by the opposition 
to set out deficiencies will be lost, but as we believe in the 
greater good of getting on with reform we support these two 
initiatives.
<P>
	I hope the government will take advantage of these changes. If 
it does then we might see the beginnings of real input into the 
legislative process by both backbench MPs on the government 
side and by opposition members as well. If the government does 
not use these new rules then the people of Canada will deal with 
it appropriately four years hence.
<P>
	By virtue of changes proposed to Standing Order 81 the 
mandate of standing committees will be broadened to allow 
them to comment on departmental spending plans when the 
committee is dealing with the department's main estimates. This 
is good as far as it goes, but in reality it will do little to affect the 
spending patterns of government departments and help bring 
government spending under control. More changes are 
necessary and I will be addressing this issue later today.
<P>
	Also changing a standing order to allow the finance 
committee to hold pre-budget consultations and report prior to a 
particular day in December every year sends a welcome signal 
that at least members of the House will be consulted. Hopefully 
the report which will be forthcoming yearly from this committee 
will be taken into consideration by the Minister of Finance and 
the Prime Minister.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="972"> 972 </A></B>
<P>
	The last proposal in this motion is to refer a number of 
procedural matters for examination to the Standing Committee 
on Procedure and House Affairs. I am concerned that the date for 
reporting on these matters has been lost. We in the Reform Party 
will be vigilant in ensuring that these matters are reported back 
to the House at the earliest possible time.
<P>
	I note that in response to suggestions made by my party this 
list has been broadened to include elements of direct democracy 
and I thank the government. The matters contained on this list 
are important. I look forward to the discussions of this 
committee.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	The list is still incomplete. How can we have meaningful 
reform or even a study of reform without including in this list 
the structure and functioning of the standing committee system?
<P>
	In my initial address to the House I dealt with freer votes and 
the relaxing of the confidence convention. I also stated that 
there is a feeling among Canadians that government-and by 
this I mean government in its broadest connotation, the party in 
power, the opposition and the bureaucracy-is not serving the 
needs of Canadians; that is government serves its own needs 
first and the public's needs second, if at all.
<P>
	With all due respect to the hon. minister of the government, a 
point of clarification is we refer to freer votes and relaxation of 
the confidence convention. This does not refer to the 
government's saying today or on this issue it will have free 
votes. Legally and constitutionally all members of the House are 
guaranteed the right of independence.
<P>
	Again may I stress this is an attitudinal change. We are all 
campaigned on party policy, on definite issues which we were 
elected to support by the Canadians who elected us. However, 
that does not suggest that each member of the House should be 
prevented from truly representing their constituents on specific 
matters which reflect the very serious interests of that area of 
Canada. We must not operate from fear. If the government loses 
a vote on a certain initiative, that could have a good positive 
result. Perhaps it was bad legislation.
<P>
	I cannot agree with former Conservative House leader, Doug 
Lewis, who expressed that government is entitled to its bad 
legislation. Why? When we have the opportunity to correct this 
waste of valuable debate time in the House and this waste of 
taxpayers' dollars let us address it.
<P>
	In my initial address to the House I dealt with freer votes and 
relaxing the confidence convention. That is why I argued for an 
attitudinal change in this House that would result in a relaxation 
and redefinition of the confidence convention, which would 
result in freer votes. Through such changes members could 
begin to play a vital role in making and influencing in public 
policy.
<P>
	I believe my remarks in relation to the confidence convention 
and freer votes are equally valid in the context of reform of the 
standing committee system.
<P>
	The changes proposed to the rules today, bills to committee 
prior to second reading and the government's asking committees 
to bring in bills, are good ones. If they are used and the results of 
the committee deliberations are not ignored by the government, 
this will make committee work more rewarding for the 
members.
<P>
	I urge the government to go further than this in relation to 
committees. Let us in the committee on procedure and House 
affairs examine the report of the House of Commons liaison 
committee tabled last spring, which addressed committee 
reform in detail. Let us together devise methods to limit the 
power of the whips in this Chamber so that substitutions on 
committee are not made in order to ensure the outcome of a vote 
which is crucial to the government. Let us look at various 
structures so that the House, through the committee system, can 
once again make meaningful comments on government 
spending.
<P>
	This House, through changes to the rules brought in over time, 
has effectively lost control over government spending. This 
must not be allowed to continue. Ways must be found so that 
members can gain some control over public expenditures. These 
changes are worth the time it will take for the House and its 
committees, especially the procedure and House affairs 
committee, to study.
<P>
	Reform goes much farther than what has been presented 
today. It is a beginning. I congratulate the government for taking 
the initiative and implementing some of the changes which 
members of the House, both today and in the past, have strongly 
recommended.
<P>
	I also want to recognize the contribution made by the Reform 
Party toward these changes. Although in our opinion these 
changes do not go far enough, we do recognize the good intent of 
the government just as we recognize that the Reform members 
and the Reform Party have prodded the government into action. 
If the Conservative Party were sitting in our seats in opposition 
today it is highly unlikely we would be witnessing these 
changes.
<P>
	I look forward to being a part of the procedure in the House 
affairs committee and contributing to its discussions.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Fernand Robichaud (Secretary of State 
(Parliamentary Affairs)): </B>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak 
to the House on the issue of parliamentary reform. This is a 
subject which is very important to me, not only as a member of 
the government team but also as the member for Beauséjour.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="973"> 973 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In the last three general elections the people of Beauséjour 
have elected me as their member of Parliament in the House of 
Commons. They have given me a mandate to defend their 
interests in the House. I am very proud to represent the people of 
Beauséjour. I can assure the House and the people from 
Beauséjour that I will make every effort to represent them well.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	However, when I was elected for the first time in 1984, it took 
me some time to realize how complex and inflexible the 
machinery of government is. It is not always easy to find one's 
way among procedural rules, the Standing Orders of the House, 
party discipline and the expectations of those who have put their 
trust in you.
<P>
	You know, as I do, that the voters are disillusioned with 
political institutions. They are disheartened by what they read in 
the newspapers and see on television every day.
<P>
	Last fall people from coast to coast delivered a very clear 
message by electing more than 200 new members to this House.
<P>
	The people want to see some changes. They are dissatisfied 
because they were not always consulted, because their opinions 
were not always taken into consideration, and because important 
decisions were often made behind closed doors.
<P>
	Data compiled from a survey conducted in 1992 for the Royal 
Commission on Electoral Reform and Party Financing confirms 
what our constituents have long been thinking. Seventy per cent 
of respondents said they felt the government did not care at all 
about what people like themselves were thinking. This is very 
unfortunate.
<P>
	No fewer than 82 per cent of Canadians, that is more than four 
in five, also responded that most candidates in federal elections 
made promises without any intention whatsoever of keeping 
them. This too is very unfortunate.
<P>
	Finally, 32 per cent of respondents said that most elected 
officials simply did their best under difficult circumstances. 
This is a little more reassuring. And, it is precisely to address 
these difficult circumstances that we are proposing changes to 
our Standing Orders.
<P>
	All those who have red the red book released during the last 
election campaign-and many have-know that parliamentary 
reform is very important to the party which now forms the 
government.
<P>
	We made a commitment to electors to adopt a series of 
measures to restore their confidence in political institutions. It 
is no coincidence, therefore, that one of the first initiatives put 
forward concerns the standing orders of this House.
<P>
	This decision reflects not only our eagerness to take concrete 
action, but also our willingness to initiate a constructive 
dialogue with all members of this House on this issue.
<P>
	The changes that we are proposing would allow MPs to play a 
greater role and restore the confidence of Canadians in the 
integrity of their Parliament and in its ability to intervene in 
matters which it deems important.
<P>
	Thus, we are proposing that certain government bills be 
referred to committee immediately following first reading. The 
committee could then consider them, amend them if it wishes 
and report back to the House. The House would then proceed at 
the same time to the debate on second reading and at the report 
stage.
<P>
	The procedure for third and final reading would remain the 
same.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	As we all know, the current legislative process is almost over 
by the time a bill reaches first reading stage. Too often, members 
get the feeling that the legislation before them is set in stone, as 
we say.
<P>
	Therefore, we want to change the process so that a bill would 
be referred to a committee right after being read the first time. 
That way, each and every element of a bill will undergo a 
complete and open examination. We will have a more 
transparent decision making process, as was requested by our 
constituents. Quick referral to a committee would give hon. 
members more influence over the substance of the bills.
<P>
	In order to increase their influence, we could ask committees 
to study some issues before a bill is drafted.
<P>
	Committee members would then have a say in the legislative 
strategy, suggesting guidelines or parameters for the upcoming 
bill.
<P>
	We want the government to be more open when time comes to 
prepare the budget. In the past, consultations regarding the 
budget were kept secret. Nothing could come out before the 
budget was tabled in the House.
<P>
	We want the Standing Committee on Finance to study the 
fiscal policy put forward by the government. We want to 
establish a very open consultation process for the budget. 
Through his efforts these last few months, the Minister of 
Finance has shown the way we want to go on this issue.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Our wish is to listen to what people have to say so that we may 
respond not only to their needs but also to their expectations. 
The changes we are proposing will make it possible for the 
Standing Committee on Finance to hold consultations next fall 
before the presentation of the 1995 budget.
<P>
	The process of establishing a budget will be much more open 
and a lot less secretive.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="974"> 974 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Before the government unveils its fiscal priorities, as many 
people as possible should have an opportunity to express their 
views. Again, to avoid putting members before a <I>fait accompli</I>, 
we are suggesting that, after detailed study of the Estimates, the 
committees be given three additional weeks to prepare a report 
on future priorities for a department, for example. Therefore, 
when members of the Standing Committee on Finance would 
undertake their consultation process in the fall, they would 
already have a number of suggestions to take into consideration.
<P>
	The measures I just mentioned would help members to play a 
more important role and to feel they really have some influence 
on bills referred to the House and passed.
<P>
	Not one of us was elected to simply say yea or nay on bills we 
have not worked on. Thousands of people trusted us to make 
changes; we cannot disappoint them.
<P>
	The measures before us today also involve changes to the 
sitting hours of the House. By eliminating the evening session 
on Wednesdays and adjourning earlier on Fridays, hon. 
members will be able to spend more time on committees and in 
their ridings.
<P>
	Finally I would like to add that these measures mark only the 
beginning of parliamentary reform. During the weeks and the 
months to come, we want to sit down with representatives of the 
Opposition parties to come up with some more changes.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	These changes will affect question period and statements by 
members. There are other points that we would like the 
parliamentary reform committee to study before submitting to 
the House a report with recommendations. What we would like 
is to pursue the dialogue on parliamentary reform with all 
elected members in the House.
<P>
	We must innovate, we must take a fresh look at our tasks as 
parliamentarians and we must find solutions which will help 
restore the integrity of the government. We will thus restore the 
confidence of the Canadian people in their institutions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is our duty to offer to Canadians a parliament to which they 
can relate and to give them an institution of which they can be 
proud.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I congratulate the hon. member for an interesting and 
very well intended speech.
<P>
	I am pleased to hear of the possibility that committee 
members could receive the bill beforehand. This would 
certainly be beneficial for everyone and I thank him for saying 
that.
<P>
	I would also like to mention what the hon. member just said 
about the times changing. This is a very good move. In view of 
the fact that 1994 is the year of the family I hope we take this 
into consideration. MPs are just as important as everybody else 
and so are their families.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robichaud:</B> Mr. Speaker, the government leader in the 
house mentioned the fact that members do have families and that 
we should take into consideration their family roles. It is for that 
very reason that we want to make changes in the sitting 
schedule. For members whose families are in the Ottawa area, it 
will mean more time at home, and those whose families stayed 
home will have more time to spend in their ridings. It also means 
that we will be able to serve our constituents much better.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when the government leader introduced his 
parliamentary reform agenda this morning, he said that there 
were much dissatisfaction in the population about the work the 
hon. members were performing in this House. On that I agree.
<P>
	There are several criticisms regarding our work and while 
some are justified, others do not withstand a critical analysis. 
Nevertheless, some changes have to be made. It is on this basis 
that the leader in the House spoke of renewal.
<P>
	However, before we proceed with what he calls the 
parliamentary renewal, we have to make sure it is based on the 
foundations of the British parliamentary system. When I say 
that, I mean that we have to consider collective 
sovereignty-that is the sovereignty of the people who elect us 
to this House and therefore send here members of different 
parties.
<P>
	Therefore, we have to reconcile collective sovereignty and 
government efficiency, that is the capacity for the government 
to act in a normal, unhurried and also consistent way. We do not 
want to go through, for instance, the unfortunate bell incident 
we experienced a few years ago. I know that the same incident 
could still happen in the Senate, but we must live with that.
<P>
	When we talk about the foundations of the British 
parliamentary system, we talk about a balance between the role 
of the government, which is to govern, and the role of the House 
of Commons, which is to monitor the action, activities and 
proposals of the government.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	Needless to say this must be done openly and the Official 
Opposition definitely supports that wish, that will for a greater 
openness of all the mechanisms and operations of this House. 
But it is not enough to talk about openness, we must also talk 
about the principles behind any bill because, in the end, we must 
judge the proposals we receive. Who better than Beauchesne can 
define for us the importance of the discussion on the  principles 
behind any bill. Beauchesne says: ``The second reading is the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="975"> 975 </A></B>
<P>
most important stage through which the bill is required to pass; 
for its whole principle is then at issue and is affirmed or denied 
by a vote of the House''.
<P>
	We may question this reform plan because the debate and the 
vote on the principle of a bill are the best way the opposition 
members have of controlling government bills. The debate and 
vote on principle allow them to question the very 
appropriateness of presenting such a bill before it is examined 
and debated clause by clause.
<P>
	The proposals in this reform bring a few questions to mind. 
Will members really have the opportunity to criticize a bill 
before it is passed? I do not question the government's 
intentions on this issue, I am simply saying that, if we accept 
what is proposed, we will still be far from our objective. Maybe 
we will reach it, but only experience will tell us if such is the 
case or if we have missed our goal altogether. The possible 
consequences of these modifications lead me to believe it will 
be hard for members to debate, in the House, the suitability of 
government bills.
<P>
	We will have 180 minutes to determine if it is relevant to send 
a bill to committee; but then we will be discussing the 
appropriateness of sending the bill to committee and not the bill 
itself. Let us not kid ourselves, everyone knows that we can talk 
about something even if we do not have the right to do so, that 
we can do indirectly whatever is forbidden directly. Therefore, 
that 180-minute period will in fact be devoted to discussing the 
principle of the bill. If we do not agree with the principle, we 
will question whether or not it should be referred to committee. 
But we would have to use a round-about way to debate what is 
most fundamental.
<P>
	Moreover, since members will have the opportunity, in 
committee, to get involved in the actual drafting of a bill, clause 
by clause, they will certainly be more involved in general, but 
here again, the government will have to exercise a lot of caution. 
Some members, although opposed to the very principle of a bill, 
may still try to improve it. They should not be told afterwards: 
``You proposed an amendment which was adopted, and now you 
are voting against it''. They still want to be able to vote against a 
bill, even if they have drafted, asked for the adoption of or voted 
in favour of an amendment to a given clause, in order to limit the 
subject matter of a bill they intend to fight. That should be made 
perfectly clear so that opposition members are not used to 
rubber stamp a bill they disagree with.
<P>
	I do think that the government will have a huge responsibility 
in that matter. Democracy should not be held hostage by cunning 
manoeuvring. As I said before, only time will tell how good this 
reform really is. It does have some positive aspects such as the 
review of estimates by the standing committees. It will allow 
members to review the estimates of each department and to table 
reports regarding the government's future  expenditures. We 
totally support such an initiative; as a matter of fact, we of the 
Official Opposition, have been demanding a debate in the House 
for the past three weeks, to review each department's budget, 
item by item, envelope by envelope. Therefore, you can be sure 
that we support this committee. Still, it falls short of the 
fundamental request we have been making since the start of this 
Parliament.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	A second positive point certainly is the idea of pre-budget 
consultations by the Standing Committee on Finance. This 
committee will consider and report on proposals regarding the 
budgetary policy of the government. I think this is an important 
step, one that should have preceded the tabling of the current 
budget. I think that, before all those consulting firms that have 
organized conferences across Canada, the primary stakeholders 
are the members of this House. We were not consulted, but this 
change will remedy this shortcoming.
<P>
	Speaking of shortcomings, I believe that there are a few more. 
I am referring for instance to pre-screening for 
order-in-council appointments. On page 92 of their platform, 
the Liberals accused the Conservatives of making a practice of 
choosing political friends. Well, there is nothing in here to stop 
such a practice. As the Minister of Canadian Heritage said, and 
the appointment of the president of the CBC reflects that reality, 
the red book is a thing of the past and we must look to the future. 
We can see that it is indeed a thing of the past, because the 
proposal made, as I said, on page 92 of the Liberal red book is 
nowhere to be found in here.
<P>
	There is also the issue of special debates. It was also raised. 
The Liberals had raised it at the time they were in the opposition. 
There should be a procedure to allow special debates to be held 
in a timely manner. Many people wonder why the members of 
the House are debating some obscure matter with little 
connection with current events sometimes, while major events 
can happen in our society that seem to go unnoticed in this 
House. The fact of the matter is that special debates would allow 
the House of Commons to be attuned to reality. Yet there is 
nothing with regard to that in the proposal before us.
<P>
	We must see why such a proposal was made, and I refer to my 
colleague from Kingston and the Islands who said in 1991: ``We 
believe that our country works well with a strong and efficient 
opposition''. Now can we conclude that this reform will really 
enable the opposition to be strong and to function effectively? 
This reform in itself does not necessarily enhance the role of 
members of Parliament. I repeat, experience will show whether 
the fundamental principles which I think are endangered by this 
reform are respected or not. I hope that the government will have 
the wisdom to assess whether the reform will achieve its 
objectives or not. If the reform does not have the intended effect, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="976"> 976 </A></B>
<P>
the  government should come back with something else and not 
stubbornly keep the reform as it is.
<P>
	I do not think that we should consider this reform to be 
permanent; rather, it is subject to improvement at any time. We 
are trying to use new mechanisms. Experience and practice will 
show whether it has met the objectives.
<P>
	I will close with some suggestions that are not found in this 
reform. First, I am thinking of this mechanism for an inquiry 
which exists in Quebec City whereby the leader of the official 
opposition can question the premier on a specific issue for an 
hour, with the Speaker of the House present, to get to the bottom 
of an important subject, which cannot be done in the daily 
question period. This exchange between the premier and the 
leader of the opposition helps the people form a better idea of 
the issues involved in a debate, which can only be healthy in a 
democracy. This exists and goes on in Quebec City, not every 
week but occasionally, and we could do it here.
<P>
	A second suggestion concerns the ban on reading our 
speeches in this House; that is why no lectern is provided.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	Everyone knows that members read their speeches to all 
intents and purposes. They have notes and they read them. In 
reality, it is rather hypocritical. The Solicitor General, who is 
the Leader of the Government in the House, read his entire 
speech on the proposed reforms, whereas this is prohibited, Mr. 
Speaker. Of course you did not stop him, because everyone does 
it. Only the budget speech can be read, because the Minister of 
Finance cannot be expected to recall all of the figures. I would 
point out that once the budget is adopted, very often he cannot 
recall the figures.
<P>
	The point is that in reality, things are quite different. One 
thing must be recognized: members are not supposed to read 
their speeches because they should speak spontaneously, from 
the heart. Well, I have nothing against members reading their 
speeches. Everyone does, so why not recognize this fact. It 
would be a lot simpler than having to carry around books on 
which to prop up our speeches. It would be much simpler if 
members had a lectern.
<P>
	My third suggestion is this: except for emergencies, votes 
should be held on Tuesdays and Wednesdays because some 
members are in their ridings on Mondays and Fridays. We divide 
our caucus in two because we must also work in our ridings. A 
number of members from more remote ridings must leave on 
Thursday after oral question period.
<P>
	We must recognize this fact. I do not see how concentrating 
the votes on Tuesdays and Wednesdays impedes democracy. On 
the contrary, it would help to create a better balance between 
House and riding work and the parties already agreed to this so 
far, that is up to week three.
<P>
	One final suggestion. I realize that it is against the rules for 
you to have a list of speakers. Yet, I gave my list to you at the 
beginning of the debate, as did the others. Again, the rules do not 
correspond to reality. Everyone knows that the Speaker has a list 
of those members who will be asking questions during oral 
question period. No one says that this is prohibited. Yet, we 
exchange lists and submit them to you every day so that you can 
refer to them during statements under Standing Order 31.
<P>
	In my opinion, the time has come to dispense with this 
pretence. It would be much easier if we knew exactly who was 
planning to speak. Each party could submit its list and you could 
work with that. Then everyone would know who was planning to 
speak and when. Why not recognize what actually happens? 
Why not let people know when their members will speak, 
instead of pretending that I do not give you a list? By the way, in 
one hour I will be submitting my list for oral question period, as 
I do every day.
<P>
	These are just a few suggestions which would help us do away 
with old habits that no longer correspond to reality.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Leader of the Government in the House of Commons):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for 
Laurier-Sainte-Marie. His comments were highly 
constructive and his suggestions are much appreciated.
<P>
	I do not agree with his suggestion that votes should take place 
only on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. It is a problem in this House 
because we only sit 130 days a year, roughly, under the new 
system introduced by the former government. Every three or 
four weeks the House adjourns for one or two weeks. At Easter, 
for instance, there is a two-week recess. It is at such times that 
members should be travelling to their constituencies, not now 
when the House is sitting. In my opinion, when the House is in 
session, the members should be here.
<P>
	There is enough time to work in the constituencies on 
weekends and during the weeks when the House is not sitting. 
That is why I do not agree with him that we should not hold votes 
on Thursdays. Those are simply my thoughts on his speech.
<P>
	I think that he may have misunderstood the government's 
intention in putting this proposal before the House today 
because we did propose a change to the second reading of bills as 
he suggested. We will only have a very short three-hour debate 
on the motion to refer the bill to a standing committee after the 
first reading.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="977"> 977 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	He indicated that the House would lose the right to hold a 
debate on the principle of a bill at second reading, that is true. 
But, at the same time, the committee to which the bill is referred 
will have a lot of opportunities to review the bill.
<P>
	As a member of the Bloc Quebecois, he did not have the 
opportunity to do committee work in the last Parliament. If he 
had been a member of a committee, he would have realized that 
many proposed amendments are inadmissible as the principle of 
the bill has already been voted on by the House itself.
<P>
	The committee members cannot change this principle. What 
is this principle? This argument is always debated by the 
committees, and an amendment which proposes a major change 
to a bill is deemed to have altered the principle of the bill; thus, 
the amendment becomes inadmissible. It is a problem.
<P>
	The new procedure will eliminate this problem and the hon. 
members will have to opportunity to put forward many 
amendments that were previously inadmissible. So I hope that 
when he sees this new procedure put into practice, he will 
support our proposal. This procedure will eliminate, with other 
opportunities, the second reading debate in the House. I hope 
that he will see our proposal in this light because I think it helps 
to understand our meaning. I hope that this explanation will help 
him.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not judging the 
government's intentions. My judgment was based on what will 
happen in practice.
<P>
	First of all, in committee, there are no more than two or three 
members from opposition parties, which limits considerably 
their ability to speak. Second, a debate in committee is not as 
public and general as a debate in this House, where all 
Canadians can find out, through newspapers and television, 
what the members said about a particular issue.
<P>
	With regard to votes on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, I will tell 
you that a member's work in his riding is not only on weekends. 
Very often, we have to go back to our ridings during the week. 
Moreover, in the past, votes were held mostly on Mondays and 
very rarely on Tuesdays or Wednesdays. If we are to vote on a 
particular day, why not choose a day when more members are 
present. This would allow us to strike a better balance between 
our work in our ridings and our work here in Ottawa.
<P>
	We were told in the past that it was impossible to defer a vote 
for more than 48 hours. That is what has always been done. I 
think there is a very simple solution: to defer votes for 72 hours. 
It is just 24 hours more and that is exactly what was done when 
the Prime Minister was scheduled to give a speech in Toronto 
last Monday. The government thought that 72 hours instead of 
48 made a lot of sense. It allowed the Prime Minister to be here 
for the vote. I think that what was done for the Prime  Minister 
could very well be done for other members of the House.
<P>
<B>(1310 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think you will find a disposition 
on this side of the House to limit speeches to 10 minutes with the 
usual 5-minute questions and comments thereafter.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Murray Calder 
(Wellington-Grey-Dufferin-Simcoe):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I 
rise on this occasion to make my maiden speech, I wish to extend 
my congratulations and best wishes as you face your new and 
most difficult task.
<P>
	There is no greater honour for me than standing before this 
House as the newly elected member for 
Wellington-Grey-Dufferin-Simcoe. The riding, as the name 
suggests, is made up of municipalities of four counties in 
southwestern Ontario. In total there are 31 towns, townships and 
villages with four upper tier county councils.
<P>
	The riding's boundaries are the historic and picturesque town 
of Elora, Nichol township to the south, the rural and agricultural 
communities of Clifford and Minto township to the west. The 
largest and most urban area is the town of Orangeville to the east 
and the beautiful port communities of Collingwood and 
Thornbury on Georgian Bay to the north. This vast and diverse 
riding is representative of the uniqueness and diversity of its 
citizens residing within its borders. 
Wellington-Grey-Dufferin-Simcoe is home to 112,000 
people, and I wish to extend my sincere thanks for the trust and 
opportunity they have provided in allowing me to represent 
them.
<P>
	I would also be remiss if I did not take this time and 
opportunity to thank my wife and family for their dedication and 
support and understanding as I embark on my new parliamentary 
career.
<P>
	The topic of debate today in the House is parliamentary 
reform. It is probably safe to assume the reason two-thirds of us 
are here and new to the House is that many defeated incumbents 
paid little heed to the demands from the public about this very 
important issue.
<P>
	If the House would allow me some licence to address the 
concerns voiced to me during the election campaign, I will 
proceed. One of the most visible and contentious areas which 
requires change is the pensions for members of Parliament. 
During the election there was a clear message that we must 
return to an understanding we are the representatives of the 
people and as true representatives we must understand and 
appreciate the values of those we represent, values of equity, 
fairness and service.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="978"> 978 </A></B>
<P>
	There is no member in the House who has not already felt the 
burdens of this office. It has been three brief months since our 
election and less than a month since the opening of the 35th 
Parliament. I ask the members present to consider the amount of 
time spent in Ottawa, the time spent in transit and the time spent 
in our ridings. Many members of the House have young children 
and spouses they dearly miss. Some members have left behind 
successful businesses to devote their energies to public service.
<P>
	These are great sacrifices but sacrifices we chose to make of 
our own free will. Despite the enormous burdens of this office 
there must be a limit to the compensation for this job.
<P>
	To return to my earlier point, we are here to represent the 
values of our constituents. There is a rage in the land about the 
current pension system. It violates the sense of equity of people 
as there is nothing to compare it with in the private sector. 
People are angry that after voicing their protests they have not 
been heard. It is unfair, they say, that politicians can write their 
own cheques and pay them with taxpayers' money.
<P>
	During the election the Liberal Party presented its platform in 
a document some of us may be familiar with entitled ``Creating 
Opportunity'' or the red book. More recently in the speech from 
the throne the government reaffirmed its support for the 
independent review currently under way.
<P>
<B>(1315 ) </B>
<P>
	It is important that we remove the public irritants that have 
undermined politicians in the public eye. This Parliament must 
signal the end to double dipping. We cannot have people 
receiving both pay and pensions from the federal government. 
The taxpayer is willing to pay but the taxpayer is not willing to 
pay twice.
<P>
	The age at which pensions are received must be reviewed. No 
one in the private sector receives full pensions immediately 
after vacating a position. The question put to us during the 
election and now before the members of the House is why should 
we.
<P>
	What is the appropriate age? I do not have all the answers but 
if we are to represent and reflect the realities of our constituents, 
should we not be governed by the same rules of economy as 
them? Should we receive full pensions after retirement without 
an age restriction? I think October 25 told us no.
<P>
	The size of pension is another component. Our pensions must 
be based on value qualified by reasoned assessment, not greed. 
The review under way must look at our duties and skills and 
other factors also should be assessed objectively. From this we 
should arrive at a figure more in tune with the feeling of 
Canadians.
<P>
	The government House leader has now placed before the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs a number 
of items to be reviewed. I believe this to be a great step forward.
<P>
	Among some of the items to be discussed are procedures 
regarding members' statements, special debates, the taking of 
division by electronic means, the conduct of private members' 
business especially with regard to private bills and Senate 
public bills, any anomalies or technical inconsistencies in the 
standing orders, the reform of Question Period, measures to 
achieve more direct participation by citizens including citizen 
initiatives, the right of constituents to recall their MP, binding 
referenda, free votes in the House of Commons, debates on 
petitions and fixed election dates.
<P>
	I applaud the government House leader on this initiative. I 
look forward to participating in the debate and review of these 
proposals.
<P>
	We have seen recently that private members can make 
valuable contributions to the presentation of different ideas 
before the House, for example the great acceptance from 
members from all sides and the success of the debates on 
Canada's peacekeeping role and cruise missile testing.
<P>
	These debates raised the level of decorum and intellectual 
exchange of ideas. This type of reasoned debate is what makes 
this House such a great institution. It is unfortunate that these 
exchanges do not receive the level of public interest as the often 
rowdy and point scoring mentality we have seen in some 
question periods.
<P>
	In the remainder of my allotted time I wish to address one 
final issue. The lobbying industry has expanded rapidly over the 
past years. The integrity of government is questioned when 
there is a perception that the public agenda is set by lobbyists 
who have excessive resources to exercise their influence away 
from public view.
<P>
	I believe there is only one collective body we must listen to 
and that is the Canadian people. In order to ensure that the 
voices of the silent majority are heard over the voices of the few 
we must strongly address the issues of conflict of interest, 
influence peddling and selling access. There must be openness 
and consultation with all Canadians, not just with the lobbyists 
arriving at decisions. It is this point I applaud the actions of the 
Minister of Finance in his pre-budget consultations. These 
consultations allowed the minister to hear advice from bankers, 
economists and social agency advocates. What is more 
important is that we were able to hear what was said in the open, 
in full public view, not just whispers behind closed doors.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	In conclusion, I feel the points raised here today are a starting 
point and not in any way a cure all for the changes required in the 
operation of the House. I want to go back for a moment and 
restate that we must represent not only the people of our ridings 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="979"> 979 </A></B>
<P>
but their values. If we are indeed bold enough to bring this 
process of change,  we will have succeeded in creating a 
government with priorities based on equity, fairness and service 
to the people of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I congratulate the hon. member on his speech. I concur 
with just about everything.
<P>
	However, in agreeing with the member on the atrocity of the 
pensions and in fact in MPs collecting pensions prior to 60 or 65 
years of age, while agreeing with the member-and it is hard for 
anyone in Canada to disagree-I have to point out right now that 
there are former members of the House who lost in the last 
election who are collecting pensions way before they are 60.
<P>
	I constantly hear that Canadians are very angry about this. I 
heard it again all weekend from my constituents at our annual 
general meeting and at my constituency opening.
<P>
	Does the government have any plans or some kind of process 
in place, something that we can address this with, to prevent 
right now those who are receiving this pension prematurely?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Calder:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member of the Reform 
Party for that question.
<P>
	As I stated in my speech these are all things that are under 
review at the present time. No, I cannot say we are going to stop 
this immediately. It is a review that is going to be done, not only 
by the Liberal Party but by the Reform Party, the Bloc Party and 
any independent members as I understand the process. By that 
we are reflecting the view of all Canadians.
<P>
	Yes, I heard the same thing during the election and I referred 
to it in my speech. I know this is an issue that will be settled in 
the near future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, I found the 
hon. member's speech very interesting, particularly in respect 
of the special interest groups and lobbies that we are all faced 
with from time to time.
<P>
	It is very easy to react immediately and say that we should 
pass some sort of legislation to stop this, but I would just like to 
make the member aware of a process that some of us use in the 
Reform Party, that is having a special interest log book in the 
riding.
<P>
	I would like to ask the member if perhaps he could take this 
approach as well. In my riding, whenever I tell special interest 
groups or write to tell them that I am making an entry into my 
special interest log book, the reaction is amazing. They become 
upset that they are going to be put in front of the people of my 
riding for scrutiny. It works very well for me. I wonder if the 
hon. member might consider that as an alternative to legislation 
that he can use immediately.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Calder:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for that 
excellent idea. It is something that we will probably take and 
incorporate in the way that we run our constituency offices and 
our Ottawa offices here.
<P>
	It just goes to prove what I stated in my speech. If the House 
becomes more and more open we will be getting ideas from all 
sides. It is just the fact that the government's ideas are not 
always the best. They will become a heck of a lot better if we 
listen to the opposition at the same time and try to incorporate 
all ideas.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the intervention by the government House leader reminds us 
again of Jeremy Bentham's point that constitutional laws are not 
made by any one actor alone. It is made by the constitutional 
company. In the case of the reforms proposed for this institution, 
Parliament, the reforms or the changes will be made by 
government initiatives and by the contributions from the 
opposition and the other parties in the House.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	The debates have been constructive on issues where we have 
had open debates as in peacekeeping and the cruise missile 
testing. I think it signals good opportunities for the House to get 
the constitutional structures of Parliament moving again.
<P>
	We do so in the light of two great principles of 
constitutionalism of our time, the alternance which is very 
apparent from government by executive to government by 
assembly. My colleagues in the Official Opposition will know 
that this has been true of French constitutional history since the 
French revolution. The alternance between the strong executive 
power and strong assembly power is I think one of the 
phenomena of our times, a check against an executive deemed to 
be too strong, a reinventing, a recreation or a creation anew as in 
the present Russia of power by assembly.
<P>
	The other is the principle of participatory democracy. One of 
the implications for that is a requestioning of old truths such as 
those uttered by Edmund Burke and often quoted in the House. It 
is perhaps important to remember that Edmund Burke was not 
the product of a democratic system of election. His career in 
Parliament was facilitated, made possible, by being named to 
pocket boroughs or rotten boroughs and so the comments on 
responsibilities to his electors was meant for a handful of people 
and not the great mass of people that we are facing today.
<P>
	The constitutional company here very clearly includes the 
Speaker. This unprecedented process of election saw some of 
the candidates for the Speakership by invitation address the 
Official Opposition, the Reform Party and then the Liberal Party 
in which advances were made in the comprehension of the 
Speaker's role, that the Speaker has the opportunity not merely 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="980"> 980 </A></B>
<P>
by conduct but by judicious coaxing to speed Parliament on its 
way to renewal.
<P>
	I looked at the role of the committee on management which is 
now the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. I 
looked at the description of its agenda, its mandate, and I see not 
a committee. I see a supercommittee, a committee on 
committees. I would have to say I congratulate the Official 
Opposition and the Reform Party for sending along very strong 
and thoughtful representatives to that committee, but I can see a 
capacity to change the whole system if they fulfil their mandate: 
initiative, right of recall, binding referenda, free votes, fixed 
election dates. That is a challenge and as a member of that 
committee I find it very exciting.
<P>
	I know the Official Opposition will pardon me if I quote from 
Danton's address to the French revolutionary convention avoir 
de l'audacité, toujours l'audacité, encore une fois l'audacité. 
Constitutional boldness. Let us get the message and get working 
upon it.
<P>
	Finally the House leader, because the initiatives are the 
government's and this was a very thoughtful address, if I may 
say so, steeped in parliamentary traditions, had never regarded 
himself as a prisoner of old rules, the dead hand control of old 
history. We use precedents to shape the future. We use them 
creatively.
<P>
	I was reminded of this when there was discussion of the 
prerogative powers, the issue of the dissolution power, the issue 
of what happens if Parliament is defeated in the House. I was 
consulted in 1968 when in a surprise vote, a snap vote in the 
House, launched by an ingenious New Democratic Party leader, 
the government was defeated and the issue was must they resign. 
Much the same issue came up when Mr. Clark was defeated in 
the House in 1979 and seemingly assumed that he must resign 
immediately.
<P>
	In fact, there was some suggestion the Governor General of 
the day might have tried to persuade Mr. Clark to take a bit more 
time before he rushed to what turned out to be his 
self-destruction.
<P>
<B>(1330 ) </B>
<P>
	It is a fact that the British House of Commons, from the 1920s 
onward, never regarded a House defeat as automatically 
compelling the resignation of a government or a dissolution. 
The precedents have to be examined creatively and in some 
senses we should perhaps recognize in Canada that we apply 
British precedents much less imaginatively and creatively than 
the British. Beware in imitating that we become more 
conservative than the people from whom we are borrowing.
<P>
	Let me in that spirit come back to the issue of constitutional 
change, Parliament as a dynamic institution. We saw this in the 
debate over peacekeeping and cruise missiles. I would suggest 
that one of the issues that it brings up, particularly in relation to 
cruise missiles, is that prime ministers should be protected when 
somebody phones them up at five o'clock in the morning and 
says: ``The fate of civilization hangs on your decision, you must 
join me in my adventure''.
<P>
	It is quite possible the fate of civilization does not hang on 
that decision. The man calling may have indigestion. In a 
situation like that it may be helpful to say that on issues 
involving foreign affairs one would like to consult Parliament. 
One could simply say: ``George, go back to sleep again and call 
me at some other time''.
<P>
	I would like see a repetition of these debates on foreign 
policy, perhaps also a tabling of agreements, treaties and even 
executive agreements, as we saw on the cruise missile which 
now seem to be entered into without parliamentary consultation, 
unless as with FTA and NAFTA we follow the American 
procedure of submitting them as Congress did with special 
reasons to both Houses of Parliament, the fast track procedure.
<P>
	One of the ideas might be to have all foreign policy acts tabled 
in the House before the formal act of ratification by Order in 
Council. I offer this simply as a suggestion that the range of 
possibilities is very great.
<P>
	I listened with great interest to the comments of the Official 
Opposition on the tabling of Order in Council appointments. I 
would suggest, though, the issue is not tabula rasa. In an earlier 
capacity I gave frequent testimony, simply because the 
parliamentary committees were frequent, on issues of changes 
to Parliament. One of the things suggested was that a reformed 
elected Senate might be given a power of review and if 
necessary a power of rejection of these appointments.
<P>
	There is a lot of good learning there. I am sure the suggestion 
made by the opposition that these matters be submitted to 
Parliament will come up for consideration. Let us have the 
consideration on a basis of the very valuable work that has been 
done and it may have a better chance of being adopted in 
Parliament.
<P>
	The thing that is most impressive is the expansion of the role 
of committees, the giving to third parties, which means in this 
case the Reform Party, the possibility of initiating amendments 
in committees, the giving of the possibility to private members.
<P>
	The work of this Parliament is so much done in the 
committees. Never forget that under the parliamentary system 
the committees have the power to compel testimony. They have 
the power to punish recalcitrant witnesses. The only thing really 
immune is the confidential advice within cabinet and possibly 
advice by officials to cabinet ministers. Everything else is 
within the parliamentary domain.
<P>
	I hope there will be an end to these travelling circuses that we 
saw on the constitution. It is not participatory democracy when 
we get selected invited witnesses to appear. Parliament should 
be doing that. The real strength of this Parliament is in its 
committees. They are all party committees. I draw great hope 
from the comments by the House leader on this particular issue. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="981"> 981 </A></B>
<P>
He believes in reviving the committee structure. It will mean 
more participation, a recognition that legislation is a dialectical 
process. Government and opposition contribute to it. It is better 
done in the informal give and  take and compromise in 
committees than in the House in which our formalized debate 
tends to ratify decisions already arrived at.
<P>
<B>(1335 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to be rising in the House today to join in the debate on 
the motion before us.
<P>
	The Reform Party grew from a desire of a founding group of 
people who, among other things, wanted to bring real 
accountability to the government. This government motion is 
another step toward that goal.
<P>
	There should be opportunity for input by the people who 
elected us. I congratulate the government for its new approach 
of direct consultation. There should be the opportunity for freer 
votes and I congratulate the government for its promise to move 
forward on this proposal and introduce freer votes to the House.
<P>
	There should be more opportunity for individual MPs to have 
an influence on legislation before the House at the committee 
stages of a bill. I congratulate the government for taking the 
initiative in this respect. I give credit to the government for 
taking these steps and introducing these changes and for talking 
about other steps and changes.
<P>
	The Reform Party also deserves credit for the part that it has 
played in getting to this point. We helped create the political 
situation conducive to change and along with it, I hope, a 
willingness to turn the talk about turning change into reality.
<P>
	It is very important that the parliamentary reforms we 
introduce be meaningful and sincere. They must be effective and 
not just window dressing. The voters of Canada want 
substantial, useful and worthwhile changes and they want to be 
able to see the proof that these changes are being implemented.
<P>
	The voters of Canada want actually to see the consultative 
process turn into a course of action by the government as 
suggested by the majority. They want to witness free votes in 
this House and they want to see that individual MPs can have an 
influence on the new legislation as it is studied in committees.
<P>
	Our view is that the government must be willing to accept 
changes to its legislation during the process and that it should 
not feel threatened by free votes or even the loss of a vote.
<P>
	Greater flexibility in the process will mean better government 
for all of us and will help restore respect for Parliament from the 
people who elected us.
<P>
	I am especially pleased that this motion includes provision for 
the procedure on House affairs committee to study and report on 
political reforms such as the introduction of recall.
<P>
	Talking about recall usually causes an allergic reaction among 
politicians. I often see it on the other side of this House. The 
symptoms include chills of horror down the spine, 
uncontrollable nervous twitching, squirming in the seat, catcalls 
and the hurling of insults.
<P>
	We should recognize this disease and name it recall phobia 
disease, meaning fear of recall. One cause of this disease is the 
widely held but totally incorrect belief that if a Liberal MP only 
got 40 per cent of the vote, the Reform supporters could get 
together with the NDP supporters and recall the Liberal MP 
simply because they held 60 per cent of the vote.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> I hear laughter from the 
other side of the House, and that is because this is silly.
<P>
	It is not because the NDP and Reform supporters could not get 
together on such a project but because good recall legislation 
sets up reasons for recall so that political and special interest 
groups cannot initiate recall simply because they did not vote 
for the member.
<P>
	The threshold number of signatures of eligible voters on a 
petition for a byelection could be very low indeed if the recall 
petition first has to pass an eligibility test before a 
commissioner of elections.
<P>
	The responsibility would lie with the persons initiating a 
recall petition to prove that there were grounds for that petition.
<P>
	As I have already said, it would not be sufficient for 
petitioners to simply say that 60 per cent of the voters did not 
vote for the member. Nor could they state that the member failed 
to represent the constituency properly unless they could produce 
evidence for the commissioner of elections to prove that this 
was the case. Therefore it is not the number of signatures on a 
petition for recall that is critical. It is the validity of the reason 
for the recall petition that is important.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	Some likely valid reasons for a petition could be a criminal 
act by a member, a proven failure to vote in accordance with the 
clear majority wish of the constituents, misrepresentation, for 
example, as has been recently revealed in the House, and so on.
<P>
	In places like California, Montana and North Dakota recall 
legislation exists with petitions thresholds of less than 20 per 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="982"> 982 </A></B>
<P>
cent. I challenge any member of this House to point out when the 
last recall took place in one of those states for any reason, let 
alone by a special interest group.
<P>
	The voters of jurisdictions where recall exists hardly ever 
need to recall a member because the threat of recall ensures that 
they receive good representation and therein lies the real reason 
recall is opposed by the traditional party structures in Canada.
<P>
	It has nothing to do with claims that special interest groups 
could initiative mischievous recall because, as I have already 
pointed out, legitimate reasons for recall can be built into 
legislation. We can also build in limits on the number of times 
recall can be initiated in a term or at what point in a term that 
petition could begin.
<P>
	Nothing brings on a violent attack of recall phobia disease 
more than the thought that MPs might actually vote to represent 
their constituents in the House. Good recall legislation can 
answer all of the concerns of those MPs who have been struck 
with recall phobia disease. It can totally eliminate the fear for 
good MPs while still making possible the recall of MPs who 
have failed to represent their constituencies or have conducted 
themselves in an inappropriate manner.
<P>
	I am personally unafraid of recall. I do not get shivers down 
my spine. I do not squirm uncontrollably in my seat or hurl 
insults or catcalls at the mention of that six-letter word. I am 
immune to recall phobia disease.
<P>
	With a bit of logical thought every MP in the House could be 
immune to recall phobia disease. Hopefully there will soon be a 
time when we will vote to accept recall legislation as part of the 
ongoing reforms of our parliamentary system.
<P>
	In the meantime I once again thank the government for having 
given us the opportunity to discuss this motion. I expect to vote 
in favour of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
enjoyed the hon. member's remarks very much.
<P>
	I participated in a discussion last evening with his colleague 
from Calgary Southeast, I believe it was. I may have got the 
direction incorrect, but it was one of the members from Calgary 
and of course I cannot use her name. I enjoyed the discussion 
very much. I was pleased to hear the hon. member echoing the 
comments she made about the virtues of recall.
<P>
	I have not noticed anybody's spine twitching on this side of 
the House, but I think there is something that the hon. member 
might want to bear in mind in his comments about recall. I know 
it is one of the things that will be studied in the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs when it becomes 
seized of the matter once the motion has been passed. He may 
want to give evidence before the committee on his views on this 
important issue.
<P>
	He might bear in mind the fact that in political life popularity 
of governments goes up and down. When the government goes 
down the opposition normally goes up but not always. 
Sometimes it gets fractured among various opposition parties. I 
need hardly remind the member there are two splinter groups 
sitting behind him that are no longer parties in the House. 
However they do have some interest and still some support 
among the electorate, weak as it may be. Governments, as I say, 
go up and down. When they go down, the opposition parties go 
up.
<P>
	Surely the hon. member must be very suspicious and a little 
mischievous in proposing a recall of members when he knows 
that as an opposition member there will be very little call for 
recall in his case. When I was an opposition member the chances 
of anybody instituting a recall petition against me were virtually 
nil unless, as I say, there had been some major problem for 
which I might have been expelled from the House, like a 
criminal conviction on a very serious offence. Those are 
grounds for the House to expel a member. It has happened 
before. There are precedents for it.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	On any other matter my electors are most unlikely as long as I 
am an opposition member to consider recalling me because I 
cannot do damage in a riding. It is quite impossible. The 
government on the other hand makes decisions that can affect 
ridings across the country. It has to take sometimes-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The time is going by. I think the 
member gets the point. Would the member wish to reply to what 
has been said?
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can see that 
the hon. member opposite has not yet been made immune to 
recall phobia disease, but I am pleased he paid attention and did 
not notice the squirming around him at the time.
<P>
	This is not a matter of popularity of the government. It is a 
matter of individual recall. There is definitely a public 
movement out there to have some accountability in members. I 
would repeat to the hon. member that a critical part of recall 
legislation must have built into it the ability to assess the reason 
for recall. That is really the key to it. There is nothing to be 
afraid of if there are established genuine reasons, not just a 
matter of popularity.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
to the comments of my colleague from the Reform Party. The 
concept he puts forward is an interesting one on recall.
<P>
	I have been a member here for five years, in the bad old days 
when we were perhaps in greater disrepute than we have been at 
any time in the history of the country. I have never had a 
constituent in the riding of Dartmouth, or any riding I went to in 
my capacity as a critic, come up and talk to me about the need to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="983"> 983 </A></B>
<P>
recall or to have a provision within our rules for recall. Many of 
them came  forward and indicated to me that other things should 
be done such as freer debates in the House of Commons.
<P>
	Does the member believe this is an issue created by the 
Reform Party in the pre-election period, or does he really 
believe it is a grassroots movement? If it is, I certainly have not 
seen it in my travels.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Vancouver North):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for his question. I suspect as a result of his question in 
the House that he will get some telephone calls from his riding 
requesting that there be recall.
<P>
	I can see that he has not yet been made immune to recall 
phobia disease either. I hope we will manage to make some 
progress on this over the ensuing months.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for his address and ask 
two brief questions.
<P>
	The first one relates to his suggestion that there are particular 
reasons why members might be recalled. I wonder whether he 
would like to share those with us.
<P>
	My second question is whether his party has costed out the 
expenditures that would have to be undertaken in order to have a 
by-election under those circumstances. How expensive would 
that be?
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Vancouver North):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for his question. It gives me the opportunity to expand a 
little. Some valid reasons that I suggested earlier in my speech 
might be a criminal act by a member or a proven failure to 
properly represent the constituency.
<P>
	I do not pretend to be the person who would write the 
legislation or who has taken sufficient input to know all the 
reasons that could be valid.
<P>
	In terms of the cost of democracy, there is a cost to democracy 
which we are ready to accept in terms of recall. That push that is 
out there is telling us that people are prepared to have a cost of 
recall. I have to say that the member is assuming that recall is 
going to happen every day and shows a fear of recall. Recall is 
such a rare event that it would be well worth the cost when it 
eventually happens.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to address Parliament. The committee on parliamentary 
reform has put Motion No. 6 before the House. I wish to do a 
particular thing here, that is to reconcile the responsibility of a 
member of Parliament as a representative and the technological 
means that currently exist that would better facilitate the overall 
operation of this place.
<P>
<B>(1350 ) </B>
<P>
	I particularly wish to applaud the motion currently before the 
House to amend the standing orders. I suggest that these 
proposed changes are really but a tiny step forward. Given the 
task before us, now is the time to take not a tiny step but a big 
step forward. Now is the time to determine what aspects of the 
old way of doing politics should be kept as a tradition and what 
things should be changed so that we can improve and represent 
our constituents better in this place.
<P>
	I am not talking about some kind of fantastical movie script. I 
believe it is time to leave the ``Jurassic Park'' era of governing 
without worrying about offending the old guard of ``The Firm''. 
We have surpassed the technological ``Age of Innocence''. As 
those who govern this land we want to improve our standards 
and efficiency of governing. To do that we must move forward at 
a pace similar to those we seek to serve.
<P>
	As a member of Parliament I have a number of roles as does 
every member in this House. These include at least three areas: 
first as a representative, second as a legislator and finally as a 
source of legitimization. Let us examine each of these in turn.
<P>
	Let us consider the words of the chairman and chief executive 
officer of Canada's largest chartered bank who described the 
new frontier before us as a multimedia universe of converging 
services ultimately coming into the home through a single 
carrier, smart phones, smart TVs, smart computers, smart 
VCRs, smart faxes and smart cards that let us pay bills, transfer 
money, make investments, play games, show pictures, selected 
products and services, take college courses and maybe even 
vote. Let me repeat those last words ``maybe even vote''. 
Electronic voting is one element which would greatly improve a 
member's ability to perform the duties of representation, 
legislation and legitimization.
<P>
	Consider first the area of representation. Being the 
representative of Okanagan Centre incorporates three 
dimensions, mandate, proxy and trusteeship. The mandate 
function is determined by my political party whose principles 
and policies I support. By proxy I am bound to represent, to the 
degree that they can be determined, the wishes of the 
constituents in my area. In an instance in which that cannot be 
determined it is my responsibility to act as a trustee to make 
decisions that act in the best interests of my constituents. To be a 
truly effective representative we require a dynamic synthesis of 
all three roles.
<P>
	After the debate in the House a decision is made on the matter. 
The decision is made by means of a vote. Where representation 
certainly takes place during the debate, actual representation 
happens when the vote is cast.
<P>
	Because members are required to be away from this place 
from time to time it is not possible for them to be present at all 
times when a vote is called. When a  member does not cast a vote 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="984"> 984 </A></B>
<P>
it can be argued that the member's constituents were not 
represented.
<P>
	Let us recognize that we have the ability today to ensure that 
every member is able to vote on every bill from anywhere in the 
world. The technology can work for us.
<P>
	Let us look at the second function, that of legislators. The 
decision to introduce legislation is not arbitrary but rather the 
development of implementation of legislative measures which 
reflect the goals of all Canadians. In its ideal form legislation is 
a result of consensus among Canadians. A recent example of 
consensus gathering was the pre-budget debate in this House. 
Another was the consultation of the Minister of Finance in four 
major urban centres in Canada. Although it is commendable that 
the minister sought the advice of Canadians it is unfortunate that 
this type of consultation does not occur before every major 
government decision.
<P>
	Further, it is too bad that many Canadians were excluded and 
did not have the opportunity to participate in the finance 
minister's sessions. An electronic town hall meeting similar to 
the one recently held by U.S. Vice-President Al Gore would 
have enabled residents from every part of Canada to participate 
simultaneously in such consultations through technological 
interconnections.
<P>
	A much wider and probably more representative consultation 
would have resulted without incurring the costs of air fares, 
hotels, meals and sundry items, to say nothing of the personal 
energy that was invested by the persons involved in travelling 
about this country.
<P>
<B>(1355 ) </B>
<P>
	A final function of a member is that of legitimization. 
Democracy requires that the rules which govern society are 
respected. Respect results from an acceptance, not necessarily 
agreement with legislation either past or present. The notion of 
legitimization comes from belief that a member will act in 
accordance with the rules of decorum and do the utmost to 
represent the riding.
<P>
	Legitimization occurs as a function of the member voting on 
legislation, responding to constituents and fulfilling the 
promises made during an election campaign.
<P>
	The notion of legitimization may be taken one step farther to 
include access to information. A government which voluntarily 
shares information as well as seeks the opinions of its people 
instils trust between government and the people. Failure to 
observe this relationship results in cynicism as was evident 
during the last federal election.
<P>
	Open and easy access demystifies the political process and 
reaffirms the need for our existence. I am suggesting that we 
examine the contents of the technology treasure chest.
<P>
	Technology can allow individuals to communicate more 
readily and easily with their members and with the government 
as a whole. My job as a representative of my constituents would 
be made easier if the federal government took a big step forward 
and provided greater integration, technological integration, 
within the House and outside the House.
<P>
	Many Canadians know that both government and business 
leaders need to understand the drivers of change within our 
economic system. Those who understand the impact of 
technology and the impact that it will have will be the successful 
leaders of the future.
<P>
	Many aspects of the tomorrow envisioned by Alvin Toffler in 
his works <I>The Third Wave</I> and <I>Future Shock</I> are upon us today. 
Technology affords us the right to expect bringing into 
existence, probably in the House, the concept of electronic 
democracy. It is this concept that should be incorporated into 
any discussion concerning parliamentary reform, particularly as 
we try to fulfil the many roles that members must undertake to 
represent their constituents.
<P>
	We are taking small steps in the proposed amendment, but 
now is the time to take a big step and significantly alter the 
standing orders of the House of Commons to incorporate 
technology and thus greater involvement from all Canadians 
into the decision making process. Imagine electronic 
referendums and more direct, less complicated democracy, 
electronic interaction with constituents and with this place.
<P>
	Now is the time. Carpe diem. Let us seize the day.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my colleague for his address and I ask a couple 
of brief questions.
<P>
	I listened rather carefully but I did not hear any reference, 
although there might have been, to other countries utilizing 
some of the concepts that he has put forward. Are there 
examples of other countries doing exactly that?
<P>
	The other question is in terms of cost. Do we have any notion 
as to how costly this would be?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Schmidt:</B> Mr. Speaker, in the first instance there are other 
examples in which this technology has been and is being 
applied. A variety of examples can be made. For example, I 
referred to Vice-President Al Gore who conducted a town hall 
meeting electronically and people virtually from right across the 
United States, from one end to the other, were able to talk to one 
another in this particular instance via a computer network.
<P>
	Of particular interest to me in that instance was the 
involvement of people unable to come to a meeting, who were 
physically disabled and had to sit at home in their wheelchairs. 
They were able to involve themselves as readily and as 
completely as someone not physically disabled. There was a 
great and wonderful opportunity  for these people to be actively 
involved in the decision making and communication interaction 
process.
<P>
	With regard to the second question of the hon. member as to 
the cost, the details of this have not been worked out. I do not 
<P>

<B><A NAME="985"> 985 </A></B>
<P>
have the details of the costs, but there are two dimensions here. 
One is the dollar cost and the other is that if we really believe in 
democracy we should pay the price to have democracy that 
actually reflects our people's needs. We will do so successfully 
and it will not be an inordinate amount. To suggest that the 
present system does not cost money is false as well.
<P>
<B>(1400) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth):</B> Mr. Speaker, I know the 
clock is ticking but very quickly I would like to ask the member 
a question. He is a new member who canvassed on a platform of 
parliamentary reform as some of us on this side of the House did. 
Does he not believe that some of the initiatives which have been 
undertaken by the new government have been positive?
<P>
	An example is the fact that we have had so many free debates 
in the House on major issues. In the early days of this Parliament 
the government put forward some initiatives to start the reform 
of the political process.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Schmidt:</B> Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member had listened 
carefully to my speech, he would have heard that I did applalud 
the government's actions in my speech.

	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean): </B>Mr. Speaker, the 
Kahnawake Band Council has issued a press release which is a 
full blown charge against Quebecers and their government. This 
press release refers to the hatred of the population, the 
persecution of English speaking Quebecers and the immorality 
of the Quebec government.
<P>
	I want to say that Quebecers are a tolerant people and that, 
despite numerous exactions by armed native groups, they 
continue to have good relations with native people. Moreover, I 
would like to say that the Quebec government was the first to 
recognize the principle of self-determination and that the James 
Bay Agreement is still a model in Canada.
<P>
	We have in Quebec a joint forum made up of equal numbers of 
representatives from various native peoples and representatives 
of Quebec society where current problems are being discussed. 
Instead of resorting to such unacceptable and provocative

<P>
	A few years ago, the 150-year old church encountered damp 
and peeling paint on its walls. Studies showed that the proper 
cure involved major repairs to roofs and walls as well as 
repainting. Instead of simply trying to patch, members of the 
congregation embarked on an elaborate program to restore their 
church to the glory that it had a few decades ago.
<P>
	Despite difficult economic times, the work has now been 
finished. The architectural heritage of the city of Peterborough 
has been greatly enriched. The new chimes bring a sound of 
hope to all citizens.

Canadian flag becoming or being subsumed into the America

<P>
	It is not just Canadians who are offended by this logo. This 
logo has also been challenged in the United States for defaming 
the American flag.
<P>
	Regardless of CP's rights as a private company to choose any 
logo it wants, Canadians should have a voice in this matter. CP 
Rail is a company that Canadian taxpayers have helped to 
establish through subsidies, outright gifts of land and other 
means. I note that most of the track in eastern Canada is owned 
by CN and more precisely, the taxpayers of Canada.
<P>
	Currently CN, which displays the Canadian flag on its trains, 
and CP are in negotiations for consolidation of rail service in 
eastern Canada.

would like to mention one instance where federalism was good 
for Quebec.
<P>
	The Federal Office of Regional Development has recently 
announced a partnership between Canada and Quebec which 
will allow Ericsson Communications of Montreal to launch an 
important research and development project in the field of 
cellular telephone communications.
<P>
	That partnership between the federal and provincial 
governments and Ericsson will maintain 400 jobs and create 140 
new ones. The expected investments could exceed $94 million 
and will open important markets for many small and medium 
sized businesses in Quebec.
<P>
	Thanks to such investments, Ericsson will be a world leader in 
cellular phone technology. That project reaffirms, once again, 
Montreal's position as the true telecommunications centre in 
Canada.
<P>
	In conclusion, let me stress the fact that this company has 
been able to pursue its expansion in Montreal and in Quebec 
thanks to the Canada-Quebec agreement on industrial 
development.

	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi):</B> Mr. Speaker, 1994 is the 
International Year of the Family. This should be the opportunity 
for parliamentarians to become aware of the many difficulties 
Quebec and Canadian families are faced with, and for the 
government to respond to the crying needs of today's families. It 
goes without saying that the economic difficulties we are 
experiencing take a terrible toll on families.
<P>
	According to Statistics Canada in 1990, 1.1 million Canadian 
children lived below the poverty line. No one can be indifferent 
to such alarming figures. Another international research 
organization estimates that 29 per cent of single parent families 
live below the poverty line, putting Canada in seventh place 
among industrialized countries.
<P>

Canadian families so they can fully develop on a personal level 
and find total fulfilment worthy of a truly modern society.

earlier today I had the pleasure of participating in a special 
presentation when members of CAVEAT, Citizens Against 
Violence Everywhere Advocating its Termination, presented 
petitions containing over 2.5 million signatures to the Minister 
of Justice.
<P>
	These petitions ask that Parliament recognize that crimes of 
violence against the person are serious and abhorrent to society.
<P>
	Mrs. Priscilla de Villiers suffered a tragedy in her family with 
the abduction and murder of her daughter, Nina, in 1991. Mrs. de

I would like to draw the attention of this House to the disturbing 
proliferation of killer board games and serial killer cards 
depicting perpetrators of violence.
<P>
	Many Canadians have expressed concern about the 
insensitive glorification of violent crime that these games 
promote. The exploitation of human suffering for the purpose of 
financial gain is morally unacceptable.
<P>
	Recognizing that the most expedient means of getting such 
products out of stores is to make them prohibitively expensive 
and that there may be freedom of speech issues in relation to our 
charter, I recently tabled a motion recommending $100 per unit 
tax levy on the manufacture or importation of such products 
which explicitly depict or promote actual or fictional 
perpetrators of homicide, kidnapping or sexual assault.

<P>
	I implore our government while ensuring the safety of our 
troops on the ground to urge the UN to take whatever actions are

	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon):</B> Mr. Speaker, it appears 
this government is going to cave in to the law breakers by 
lowering taxes on cigarettes.
<P>
	Tobacco, I might point out to this House, is the only legal 
consumer product that kills when used exactly as intended. It 
costs the Canadian taxpayer an estimated $15 billion in indirect 
and direct health care costs.
<P>
	The revenue minister says cost does not affect the use of 
tobacco. I wonder what the minister is smoking. In 1992 
Statistics Canada indicated: ``Affordability is to date the most 
significant factor in the reduction of tobacco use in Canada. 
Regular smoking among Canadian teenagers has plummeted as 
taxes drove prices up higher''.
<P>
	How about getting from the Minister of Health a real 
commitment to the health of Canadians. Stop the smoke-screen. 
The Minister of Health should come clean and cough up: Does 
she or does she not support lowering taxes on cigarettes?

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is directed to the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Saturday, another barbaric act was committed in Sarajevo, 
where a mortar shell that hit the central market killed 68 people 
and wounded over 200. Following this tragedy, UN 
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali asked NATO for 
authority to proceed with airstrikes against the Serbian artillery 
positions which hold Sarajevo under siege.
<P>
	I want to ask the Prime Minister whether he could indicate the 
Canadian government's official position on this request from 
the UN Secretary-General which favours airstrikes to free 
Sarajevo.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
like everybody else we are very unhappy with the unacceptable 
and barbarous act committed in Sarajevo over the weekend.
<P>
	At this moment we are consulting with our allies on this 
problem. The Minister of Foreign Affairs has been in 
discussions with U.S. Secretary of State Christopher and the 
foreign ministers of England and France. Discussions are going 
on at this time.
<P>
	The situation is very, very bad. We will see in the next few 
days what the best action is that we can take. Of course, 
Canadians have the particular situation that our troops are 
located in Srebrenica and we have to consider that.
<P>
	We will be consulting with our allies. We hope that we will 
find a way to have peace in that part of the world because what is 
going on at this time is completely unacceptable.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, an emergency NATO meeting on the matter was 
scheduled today, at the request of France and Belgium. What 
position did the Prime Minister instruct his representatives to 
take on behalf of Canada at this meeting?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
do not think we can make a final decision at this time. I believe 
that the people who are meeting at this very moment want to 
analyse the situation and try to propose an action plan. The 
Canadian officers present are to report to us on the nature of 
these discussions, and we will see what their decision should be.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to ask the Prime Minister whether he can 
promise that his government will not approve airstrikes without 
guarantees for the safety of Canadian peacekeepers in Bosnia.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
at this very moment people are discussing the use of airstrikes to 
prevent the so-called strangulation of Sarajevo, and there is no 
direct connection with the position of Canadian soldiers who are 
now located in another part of Bosnia.
<P>
	We have to weigh the pros and cons, and our position is still 
the same. In Brussels we said that airstrikes could only be used 
in self-defence, which is not the case in the Srebrenica area at 
this time. In the case of Sarajevo, the governments concerned 
are now analysing the situation.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Saturday 
edition of <I>The Gazette</I> reported that the chief of the Kahnawake 
reserve, Mr. Joe Norton, claimed to have received assurances 
from the RCMP that it was not planning to enter the reserve to 
fight cigarette smuggling and that moreover, the RCMP 
considered Akwesasne, Kahnawake and Kanesatake to be 
special cases.
<P>
	Can the Prime Minister tell us clearly and unequivocally 
whether or not the RCMP gave such assurances to Chief Norton?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
think the RCMP officer who spoke last Friday evening on 
television stated his case very clearly. We have said clearly to 
everyone that the rule of law applies everywhere in Canada, 
without exception.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> In that case, Mr. Speaker, 
and to dispel any doubt or confusion people may have, including 
the inhabitants of these native reserves, could the Prime 
Minister agree to a request to meet with Mohawk chiefs and 
make it clear to them that he intends to ensure that the rule of law 
is applied everywhere in Canada?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
officers of the RCMP had occasion to discuss these matters with 
them last Friday. They were told clearly that the law has to apply 
everywhere. They have been in touch with the Minister of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development about that.
<P>
	One thing I do not like is the impression the hon. member is 
trying to make that this is only a problem within Indian reserves.
<P>
	Contraband is a problem across the country but especially in 
Ontario, Quebec and Atlantic Canada. Most of the contraband 
comes in outside the reserves and it is not very fair to try to 
create the impression that it is a problem with Indians in Canada. 
It is a problem with many people in every city across the land.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	It is rumoured the government is considering a major 
reduction in tobacco taxes. If this is true, to avoid any increase 
in the deficit these cuts will have to be offset by matching 
spending cuts or replacement tax revenues.
<P>
	Can the Prime Minister tell the House which programs he 
intends to cut or which taxes he intends to increase.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there will be a budget in a few weeks.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, with all due 
respect the rumours are very strong.
<P>
	Health organizations across Canada are outraged by the 
government proposal to cut tobacco taxes.
<P>
	Would the government calculate the long term increase in 
health care costs which would result from these cuts in tobacco 
taxes?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
hope to make a statement tomorrow on this. I said to the House 
very clearly that it is no good for anybody to bury his head in the 
sand.
<P>
	A lot of very cheap illegal cigarettes are available everywhere 
at this moment. I said we would use every means at our disposal 
to make sure that the traffic of illegal cigarettes and other 
smuggling are terminated in the short term. We will use every 
tool at our disposal to achieve our goal in the shortest period 
possible. We are faced with a problem that has existed for years. 
We have decided that the time has come to bring order to that 
field and it will be done very quickly.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, a second 
supplementary question. Last week certain native Canadians 
threatened an armed response to any attempt by the RCMP to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="990"> 990 </A></B>
<P>
enforce existing smuggling laws. This situation has caused 
understandable concern among law enforcement officers 
involved.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister's definition of self-government 
include the right to disregard the laws of Canada and to threaten 
police who may be called in to enforce them?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this statement is extremely exaggerated. We want to make sure 
that native Canadians can make decisions concerning 
themselves in order to find a better place in Canadian society. At 
the same time they know and accept the fact that they are within 
Canada and they have to respect the laws of Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> My question 
is for the Prime Minister. A few days ago the chief of the 
Akwesasne reserve, Mike Mitchell, stated:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``[The police] are going to have to be reminded that there are a 
lot of weapons that exist here-and trying to pursue this in a 
violent manner is going to be met with probably a very hostile 
manner as well''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister think this is idle talk? Does he think 
that the police should let themselves be intimidated on the 
Akwesasne reserve?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the position of the government is clear. It intends to have the law 
enforced everywhere in Canada. That continues to be our 
position. It is not a matter of looking for confrontation but 
instead, of enforcing the law in an equal manner in every part of 
the country. This is what we are going to do.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would remind you that there have been over 70 
violent deaths on Akwesasne over the past seven years and that 
the Mohawk people are presently being terrorized by a handful 
of individuals. Is it not the responsibility of this government to 
ensure that all the inhabitants of this country, including the 
Mohawks living on Indian reservations, can live in peace 
without being terrorized at the hands of a few individuals?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
That is exactly what we intend to do, and I am very pleased to 
have the support of my colleague opposite on this.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="INDIANAFFAIRS">INDIAN AFFAIRS</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is for the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. 
The <I>Globe and Mail</I> quotes a spokesperson for the Mohawk 
warriors as stating that any RCMP incursion into his reserve 
would be treated as an invasion by a hostile government.
<P>
	As the civilian police forces are not presently enforcing the 
law in the Mohawk's self-declared sovereign lands, would the 
minister of Indian affairs agree the Canadian government 
appears to have accepted the Indian self-declared sovereignty?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, there are times when we have to 
come together not just as members of this Commons but as 
concerned people and not be throwing gasoline on a highly 
volatile situation. Does the hon. member want to force another 
Oka? It happened so innocently and it could happen again.
<P>
	If the hon. member would take the time to go down to 
Akwesasne, as many members on this side did, he will find 
12,000 law-abiding Indians doing their business-law abiding, 
with a hospital, a school and a 500 criminal element. It is the 
criminal element we have to deal with.
<P>
	The member for Lac-Saint-Jean said that in his statement 
about two weeks ago. There are Indians and there is the criminal 
element. The leader of the opposition said that when dealing 
with Davis Inlet. The hon. member who sits behind the leader of 
the opposition said that today. We do not have to deal with 
Indians, but with the criminal element in Indian communities 
the same way we deal with the criminal element in the 
non-Indian community. That is the long and the short of it.
<P>
<B>(1430 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East):</B> Mr. Speaker, I suggest to 
the minister that we might be able to cool this fire if he could 
give us the government's position on this.
<P>
	Does the government, representing all the people of Canada 
have ultimate, exclusive, supreme power and authority over all 
Canadian soil including territory claimed by all identifiable 
groups including those people described as aboriginal?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, there are one and a half million 
aboriginal people. We are dealing with them as individuals, as 
family.
<P>
	The hon. member is looking at one part of the country. I wish 
he would look at what the government has just done in 
B.C.-toward his neck of the woods-in Labrador and Nunavut.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="991"> 991 </A></B>
<P>
	In twelve weeks we have kick started most of the negotiations. 
That is what is going to bring this country together. Common 
ground brings us together and not what certain groups within the 
Mohawk community are doing right now.
<P>
	I am getting upset because it only took Oka three weeks of this 
type of dialogue to happen. Meech Lake floundered. A few 
Indians went out to protect a golf course. The army was called 
out by the province of Quebec and the next thing is that we spent 
$150 million and killed a person. I do not want to see that happen 
again.
<P>
	Our party and our government is going to ensure that it does 
not happen again.

	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of National Revenue.
<P>
	It is obvious that the Ontario government does not agree with 
the federal government's proposal to lower taxes on cigarettes to 
curb smuggling. The Premier of Ontario has stated that, in his 
opinion, smuggling could easily be thwarted if the federal 
government imposed a special export tax on cigarettes 
manufactured in Canada.
<P>
	Does the revenue minister share the Ontario premier's 
opinion regarding the imposition of an export tax on Canadian 
cigarettes?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, it is true that the Ontario premier has made statements 
on this matter and that he has proposed an export tax on 
Canadian cigarettes, but I do not agree with him on this point.
<P>
	This alone would not solve our current smuggling problem. 
We need something much more effective than what the premier 
has proposed, and I am sure that we will have more details on 
this tomorrow, as the Prime Minister just said.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> Mr. Speaker, does the 
revenue minister not agree that the refusal by the Ontario 
government to lower its taxes on cigarettes would make his 
anti-smuggling plan totally ineffective, particularly in Ontario 
and perhaps even in Western Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, it is true that in hypothetical situations, we can have 
hypothetical answers to hypothetical problems. However, we 
still do not know what we will do. We do not know all the steps 
the government will take, that will be announced by the Prime 
Minister tomorrow. As to what can happen at the border between 
Ontario and Quebec, I cannot give a good answer because it is a 
hypothetical situation.

	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question has been inspired by Dave and Brenda 
Fountain of Burns Lake, B.C. who are currently being 
challenged on a piece of duly deeded private property they own.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. In the throne speech, 
his government committed to the forging of a new partnership 
with aboriginal people, specifically in respect to the 
implementation of their inherent right to self-government.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister commit to all Canadians that his 
government's definition of aboriginal self-government does not 
mean a self-government that would exist outside the federal and 
provincial laws that all Canadians are currently obliged to abide 
by?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
said many times that the situation with regard to Indian land is 
that it is all part of Canada. They have to abide by the legal 
system in Canada when we sign agreements. The Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development is trying to find a way 
to give the authority to the native people to be able to make their 
own decisions that affect themselves, so they can find a proper 
place in Canadian society.
<P>
<B>(1435) </B>
<P>
	That is what he is negotiating at this time, but all within the 
fact that they are within a sovereign nation that is Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I commend the efforts of the Prime Minister in his 
search for the meaning of aboriginal self-government.
<P>
	I would like to ask the Prime Minister if at this time his 
government defines aboriginal self-government as an order of 
government that would exist outside federal and provincial 
jurisdiction or as a level of government that would exist within 
and under federal or provincial jurisdiction?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> The hon. 
member should know that Indian reserves come under federal 
jurisdiction within a province. The Indian land is in the name, in 
the trust of the federal crown.
<P>
	Therefore we already have a system that sometimes, like 
passing a road through an Indian reserve, has to be done by the 
federal government, not by a provincial government. It is the 
law of the land following the signing of the treaties with the 
natives in Canada.

for the Minister of Agriculture.
<P>
	The shutdown of the port of Vancouver, Canada's largest 
seaport, has cut off millions of dollars of commodity exports 
including hundreds of millions of dollars of grain, potash and 
forestry products.
<P>
	Now that the mediated talks have broken off, could the

measures the government is prepared to take to guarantee that 
Canadian grain exports will reach their markets and that the 
integrity of our international trade position is not hindered?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to answer the 
question of the hon. member.
<P>
	As the House knows, over the past week or 10 days we have 
been encouraging the parties to the dispute to exercise their 
rights and obligations under collective bargaining to reach an 
agreement. In the past several days we have offered the 
mediation services of the federal government to do that. 
Unfortunately as of yesterday the talks once again broke down 
and the sides were unable to come to any agreement that would 
allow them to proceed with a new contract.
<P>
	The assessment we made is that the impact of this work 
stoppage is now reaching beyond the parties themselves. It is 
having a very serious impact on the economy generally; 
certainly the grain economy of western Canada and the economy 
of the port of Vancouver.
<P>
	Consequently notice will be placed on the Order Paper today 
of the government's intention to introduce measures to end the 
work stoppage and bring about a resumption of port operations.
<P>

<P>
	I would like to ask the Minister of Human Resources

special legislation to deal with the situation Parliament after

stoppage problem at the port of Vancouver. There are many 
other questions related to labour matters and I hope that we will 
providing, during the course of the next several months, an 
opportunity for this House to discuss them and to come to grips 
with them.

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is directed to the Prime Minister.
<P>
	A report from the U.S. State Department, which referred to 
so-called problems experienced by anglophones and allophones 
in Quebec has caused considerable consternation among the 
Quebec public. The report is critical of Bill 86, especially where 
it affects access to English schools. However, the Quebec 
Minister of international affairs was strongly critical of this 
report and said, according to La Presse, that legislation to 
protect the French fact in Quebec did not constitute a violation 
of human rights.
<P>
	Can the Prime Minister tell us whether his government, 
through the Minister of Foreign Affairs, intends to lodge an 
official protest with the U.S. ambassador regarding the contents 
of a report that is very damaging to the reputation of Quebec 
and, hence, that of Canada as well?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, speaking on behalf of the Minister of Foreign Affairs 
who is not in the House today, I would say that the Canadian 
government does not make a habit of commenting on documents 
originating from the foreign affairs departments of other 
countries. It is not in keeping with international custom.
<P>
	I may add as a general comment that I myself did not read the 
report by the U.S. State Department, but from what I have heard 
it was drafted before certain amendments were made to 
Quebec's legislation, which means that today, considering the 
rules of international courtesy and the scope of the comments 
made by the State Department, there is no good reason for 
making representations to the U.S. government.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Mr. Speaker, Mr. Ciaccia 
felt he had to make a strong protest and ask the federal 
government, or at least he says he will in <I>La Presse</I>, to support 
him in that endeavour.
<P>

with Quebec and lodge a strong protest against these comments 
which are very damaging to Quebec?

	Can the minister inform this House what options the 
government is considering as a suitable response.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
think the Prime Minister has addressed that question.
<P>
	There are meetings going on in Brussels today and will be in 
the next couple of days.
<P>
	As far as the Canadian government is concerned we are most 
interested and concerned that the Canadian troops in Bosnia are 
not put at undue risk by any escalation action that may occur as a 
result of these discussions that are going on.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a supplementary question. Can the minister tell the House 
what the government's position is on air strikes.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Prime Minister addressed that subject when he was in Brussels a 
couple of weeks ago.
<P>
	The former government did sign on with the rest of the NATO 
nations in not ruling out air strikes in certain eventualities. 
However the Prime Minister made it clear in Brussels that 
linkage of air strikes with an attempt to open the airport at Tuzla 
and to liberate the Canadian contingent at Srebrenica was just 
not acceptable to the Canadian government.
<P>
	Our position is that we believe that there are other ways to 
achieve peace there before we start taking drastic action.
<P>
	Indeed the Minister of Foreign Affairs made a statement 
yesterday which has been broadcast widely on television to the 
effect that the negotiations must still go on and that we prefer a 
negotiated route before any further escalation.

minister is aware that the subsidy cheques from the Canadian 
Milk Board were delivered to farmers almost eight days late in 
December and four or five days late in January.
<P>
	In view of the problems facing the Canadian agricultural 
industry, what does the minister intend to do to assure farmers 
that those cheques will be delivered on time in the future?

<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question. He is right. There was an unfortunate delay in the 
delivery of some dairy cheques in late December and early 
January. That delay resulted from communication problems 
between the Department of Supply and Services and Canada 
Post.
<P>
	As soon as the Canadian Dairy Commission learned of the 
problem it notified all of the provincial milk boards and 
agencies to let them know the nature of the problem. The 
commission has also received the assurance of Supply and

consequently, has brought to a halt the export of millions of tons

<P>
	During this past weekend a meeting attended by more than 
500 people in the riding of Markham-Whitchurch-Stouffville 
resulted in a demand that the government investigate the 
circumstances surrounding the election of the sitting member. A 
petition has also been initiated with the intention of collecting 
around 40,000 signatures to support this demand.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister acknowledge that these events are 
symptomatic of the growing public support for recall legislation 
among the voters of Canada.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Out of order. Ancient history.
<P>

with regard to these questions. Perhaps if the hon. member could 
rephrase his question in such a way that it was not so pointed we 
might be able to get answer. I wonder if he would try to rephrase 
the question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, would the 
Prime Minister agree that there is a general mood among the 
public of Canada in support of recall legislation?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
do not know where the member is taking that. Perhaps he should 
read the editorial from the <I>Calgary Herald</I> that supported his 
party last election where they say recall is unnecessary.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime

now we all know that 190 Canadians with an annual income of 
more than $250,000 did not pay one penny in income tax in 
1991. Even worse, that same year, 20 millionaires paid less than 
$100 in taxes to the government. And these are only a few 
examples of social injustice, a few of the scandals.
<P>
	Like his Minister of Finance, does the Prime Minister intend 
to go on tolerating such situations as those concerning family 
trusts and tax shelters? Or does he intend to act quickly to put a 
stop to it?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
usually when people quote someone, they mention their sources. 
The problem was raised several days ago, in caucus and in the 
media, by the hon. member for Gander-Grand Falls. I think 
that is exactly what the Minister of Finance wants: to make the 
system more equitable. I hope that if he does and he manages to 
plug these loopholes, opposition members will not complain 
that he is raising taxes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
about this concern for fairness, instead of attacking social 
programs, the middle class and the elderly who pay their taxes, 
can the Prime Minister promise Quebecers and Canadians that 
this disgraceful injustice will be stopped once and for all?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there will always be people who find loopholes in the tax 
system, and it is up to the Minister of Finance to deal with that.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance is now trying to remedy the situation. 
The minister said that in his budget, he intends to bring fairness 
back to our tax system. Naturally, some people will be affected. 
As I said earlier, I hope the Opposition will not claim he is using 
the word fairness as an excuse to raise taxes. He will use it to 
ensure that everyone pays their fair share. If this happens to 
increase government revenues, that is fine, and I think everyone 
in the House will agree.

of the children of British Columbia?

<P>
	I mentioned to her and through her to the House of Commons 
that privacy laws prevent me and him from going into the 
details. Suffice it to say that Mr. Drake is coming up for a 
hearing and I will use every method within the Immigration Act 
to protect Canadian communities and the security of Canada 
with respect to this case as with respect to other cases.

two departments. I would like to ask the minister today what part 
of that revenue, if any, is being used to make sure that our

young people who are crossing the border.
<P>

Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. I can assure 
him that because of a number of savings that have come about as 
a result of automation we have been able to put a large amount of 
resources, approximately $13 million, into computer and 
electronic surveillance equipment for our customs officers at 
border crossings.
<P>
	In addition, I can tell him that through reorganization again 
we have the possibility of increasing the number of people at 
customs stations, so we will in fact have a larger number using

cross the border, and also deal with other elements such as 
terrorists, criminals or others who attempt to cross the 
Canadian-American border and other borders, and of course at 
airports.
<P>
	I would specifically like to mention, as he has, that the 
programs for missing children are working effectively, but we 
need the support of the public in making sure that we have the 
maximum amount of information available so we can in fact use 
our automatic systems for licence plates and other such things

had to shell out more than $150,000 for the reconstruction of the 
towers of the Caribou pier in Nova Scotia, and the Wood Island 
pier in Prince Edward Island. This expenditure was made 
necessary simply because the Department of Public Works did 
not check to make sure that the size of those piers could 
accommodate the ferry.

<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Public Works. How can the

	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Secretary of State 
(Multiculturalism) (Status of Women)):</B> Mr. Speaker, I did not 
anticipate your being ready so quickly.
<P>
	In 1971 the Liberal government took a timely step forward in 
affirming the uniqueness of Canadian identity. It proclaimed the 
multiculturalism policy of Canada showing how we perceived 
ourselves and how we were viewed by nations throughout the 
world.
<P>
	We let it be known on domestic and international stages that 
we placed a high value on the diverse heritage that history 
bestowed upon us to share. Many changes stemmed from this 
policy in the lives of citizens and in government activities. Part 
of this social evolution took place in 1988 when the world's first 
national multiculturalism legislation saw the light of day in the 
House and was unanimously passed.
<P>
<B>(1505) </B>
<P>
	Through the multiculturalism act we made an emphatic 
statement that ours is a life story to celebrate a legacy of 
traditions brought from nations far and near to link our cultural 
communities as one people united under one banner. The act 
codified in law the multicultural reality that has flourished since 
the First Nations settled this vast land, long before the advent of 
the explorers. We were indeed proud to see respect for our 
neighbours' origins become the law of the land.
<P>
	Diversity is a Canadian reality, a reality reflected in this 
House, in you, in me and among all our colleagues, and among 
the citizens from all ethnocultural groups who have placed us 
here to speak on their behalf. The essence of this diversity lies in 
how we conduct day to day life in Canada, at home, at school, in 
our neighbourhoods and in the workplace.
<P>
	It is with regard to where many Canadians work and provide 
services to the public that I tabled the fifth annual report on the 
operation of the Canadian Multiculturalism Act. It documents 
progress the federal departments and agencies made in 
honouring this government's commitment to reflecting 
Canada's cultural make up in its daily affairs. It also helps keep 
these administrations accountable to the people of Canada 
whom we have the privilege of serving.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In other words, the federal government must play a leading 
role in Canada's cultural development. This annual report 
covers the 1992-93 fiscal year. It applies to a time that preceded 
the return of this government by seven months.
<P>
	Nevertheless, I have the duty to ensure that the document is 
tabled.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Some departments and agencies have made great strides in 
upholding diversity in the workplace and ensuring that all 
citizens have equal access to government services.
<P>
	To cite just two examples among the many highlights of 
outward looking ventures, during 1992-93 CBC prepared a plan 
of action on equitable portrayal in programming. This led to 
further progress in the movement toward increasing the 
presence of visible minority performers and subjects on TV and 
radio in Canada.
<P>
	A great number of programs dealt with the fight against 
racism and hatred as well as with the promotion of cross cultural 
relations. It included a Canada Day documentary in which five 
Canadians of diverse cultural backgrounds discovered the 
meaning of being a Canadian.
<P>
	Agriculture Canada funded research into the diverse food 
buying habits of consumers and the opportunities that these 
trends present to Canada's agri-food industry. The results of this 
research were provided to producers and retailers in this fast 
growing sector. We shall do some ongoing nation-wide studying 
of these trends and help our food processors compete with 
foreign companies.
<P>
	These innovative ideas are but a few among the many put 
forth by a large number of agencies and departments on the front 
line of diversity awareness. These employees deserve our 
praise. Other administrations proceeded at a somewhat less 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="998"> 998 </A></B>
<P>
accelerated pace. We acknowledge their efforts and encourage 
them on.
<P>
	Finally, a minority of offices have not quite blazed a trail in 
advancing the benefits that diversity can bring and diversity 
offers. Hanging posters in the lobby is a good start but one must 
make the actual message on those posters come to life. Their 
intentions are honourable but they really could go further.
<P>
	With this in mind, I have asked program staff to convene a 
round table of senior officials. These people will explore new 
ways to highlight the fact that the government demonstrates 
leadership in bringing about meaningful change in Canada.
<P>
	Clearly one cannot look to the outside until one has had a 
thorough scan of the inside.
<P>
<B>(1510 ) </B>
<P>
	As my hon. colleagues have likely sensed, this report is a good 
foundation for a much more energetic plan of action for the 
remainder of the decade. However one cannot really call it a best 
seller, not at least right now. Let us wait until I table some 
reports in the year to come, same place, same time, but I do 
believe it will be a different story, a story about widespread 
institutional change.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The portfolio entrusted to me by the Prime Minister is an 
honour, as well as a challenge.
<P>
	Our mandate is to articulate the idea that our approach to 
citizenship embraces all Canadian women and men-seniors 
and young people-regardless of where they or their ancestors 
were born. We will be busy during the 1990s and I look forward 
to every day of it!
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	At the top of our agenda is the need to enlighten, to educate, to 
arouse a better understanding and interest, to open the eyes, to 
drop the lid on the coffin and finally entomb the myths that 
multiculturalism is merely an immigration issue, that diversity 
must lead to division, and the misguided musings about quotas.
<P>
	I have already heard rumblings in this House about 
ghettoization. It is true there are those who do move into places 
some people think of as comfort zones. Others might call them 
ghettos. I do not think that is the right nomenclature, but they 
move to a place called Canada first. They contribute their skills 
to a land built by others before them who arrived with courage, 
hope and dreams.
<P>
	Canada is a nation where we all enjoy freedom of movement 
and we all have the right to move to a neighbourhood with 
stores, with a market and with a community centre that 
represents a familiar setting. It is a comfort zone. All citizens 
have that right too. They have every right to tell us to stop 
focusing on the small picture of who lives where and who does 
what and to look at the whole screen in panorama.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Let us recognize diversity as the most obvious characteristic 
of the Canadian reality, thanks to our ancestors from around the 
world.
<P>
	Our diversity is at the heart of our identity, and you cannot 
rewrite history. We know of regimes in this century that tried to 
do so, and they failed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I suggest that members see ``Schindler's List'' if they want a 
reminder.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Whether people know it or not, multiculturalism will not fail.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Anyone who foresees the end of our respect for neighbours' 
origins and for their right to become involved in our 
communities is not facing the fact that all Canadians have equal 
rights and equal responsibilities.
<P>
	Embracing all our traditions is an eloquent expression of the 
Canadian dream. It forms the very lifeblood of our nationhood. 
It creates building blocks, not stumbling blocks, for one only 
stumbles when one lives in darkness and cannot see the path 
ahead.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The federal government intends to follow a path clearly laid 
out, long before Confederation, by our aboriginal peoples and 
generations of ancestors.
<P>
	The finest homage we could pay them is to show that there is 
no such thing as us and them, mainstream versus immigrants, 
old guard versus newcomers.
<P>
	Even the so-called mainstreamers have roots that spread all 
over the world. We Canadians are one big family. After all we 
are all made of flesh and blood.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We also have a mission on a broader scale to serve as an 
example to troubled nations that look to us for inspiration in 
times of strife when they think of freedom, human rights and 
shared values. We will reinforce our status as a role model 
through an alliance of every man, woman and child with a grasp 
of the responsibilities of Canadian citizenship. We shall pick the 
route that leads to a land where every person's talent and energy 
will build on what is great about Canada. We will strengthen our

<P>
	The task that faces us all is not an easy one. Yet I can think of 
little in life more debilitating than idleness, scapegoating, 
antipathy and apathy.
<P>
	I speak from my own heart to those who ask if a land of 
opportunity, equality and fairness is a dream world; who 
question whether multiculturalism has a value or is a value, has 
an inclusive policy or is an inclusive policy; or who think that it 
can happen alone. I say when we cease to dream we cease to 
grow.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I welcome the opportunity afforded by the presentation 
of the fifth annual report on the operation of the Canadian 
Multiculturalism Act by the Secretary of State for 
Multiculturalism to address this important topic.
<P>
	We are also anxious to hear the results of the round table of 
senior officials, which will report shortly to the secretary of 
state on new ways to demonstrate the government's leadership 
in bringing about meaningful changes in Canada. However, I 
would like to draw attention to the subtext of the speech by the 
secretary of state, which implies there is no difference them and 
us, no difference between immigrants and the citizens of this 
country, the founding citizens.
<P>
	How can the government claim to promote multiculturalism 
while stating there is no difference between the members of 
cultural minorities and the members of our two majorities in this 
country, the franco-Quebecois and anglo-Canadians?
<P>
	The secretary of state appears to use the words 
multiculturalism and assimilation interchangeably.
<P>
	Let us look at the facts. In most Canadian provinces, 
Amerindian and cultural minorities of every description are 
assimilating in great numbers. In Quebec, however, aboriginal 
nations maintain their language and culture to a greater extent, 
and we can even speak of a renewed interest in those languages. 
Among Quebec's cultural minorities, mainly in Montreal, we 
see greater retention of their mother tongue by children of 
immigrants-the second and third generation.
<P>
	I think the secretary of state was referring to the integration of 
immigrants in the vast Canadian anglophone majority to which 
she belongs. Does the secretary of state realize what is 
happening in her own province? This is a denial of Quebec's 
distinct identity. Her department's mandate is to encourage a 
sense of Canadian cultural identity based on the main 
characteristics of Canada, which are bilingualism and 
multiculturalism. it is clear that the federal government's 
policies are more inclined to embrace the perspective of a 
hypothetical pan-Canadian cultural identity.
<P>
	Until Quebec has acquired full political sovereignty, we will 
defend Quebec's right to the recognition of its cultural identity.
<P>
	When the secretary of state says that diversity is the most 
obvious characteristic of Canada, because our ancestors came 
here from all over the world, we must not and cannot ignore the 
fact that today, and in fact for the past 350 years, there has not 
been one Canadian reality but three: one francophone, one 
anglophone and one Amerindian or aboriginal, the reality of the 
aboriginal First Nations.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	This is not a situation unique to Quebec. It is the same for 
Acadians and the French speaking communities of the rest of 
Canada.
<P>
	Waves of immigrants settled in Quebec, coming first from 
Great Britain, Ireland and Mediterranean and slavic countries, 
then more recently from Asia, Africa, Latin America and West 
Indies. Quebecers do not make a distinction. They are all true 
Quebecers.
<P>
	For Quebec, the diversity principle must revolve around the 
French nature of our culture embodied in all our institutions and 
on which is based Quebec distinctiveness. The contribution of 
immigrants to Quebec and Canada is enormous, culturally as 
well as socially and economically. The diversity of our 
population must allow for differences while encouraging 
newcomers to blend into the social fabric.
<P>
	To that end, the authorities having jurisdiction, that is to say 
Quebec and the other provinces, must have the tools necessary 
to facilitate this blending in, whether it be job training or French 
language education.
<P>
	It is important to establish clearly that a sovereign Quebec has 
every intention to abide by the treaties and conventions which 
protect minorities. We will participate fully in the discussions 
that, at the international level, will focus on the tools developed 
to better protect minorities.
<P>
	The multiculturalism policy of the Canadian government has 
a lot in common with that of Canadian diplomacy. It irons out 
the reality and distinctiveness of Quebec.
<P>
	A federation has to give a certain image of itself, whether 
abroad or to newcomers. In this regard, it appears that our 
federation hides behind stereotypes the true identity of one part, 
because it cannot integrate its distinctiveness.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
statement of the hon. minister was long on rhetoric but in our 
opinion very short on substance.
<P>
	As the party in power for 17 of the past 25 years and the 
architect of the multiculturalism policy since 1971, the minister 
gave two examples today through which she was able to identify 
progress having been made in upholding diversity in the work-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1000"> 1000 </A></B>
<P>
place in the public sector.  One of them was in the form of a plan 
of action prepared during 1992-1993 to increase the presence of 
visible minority performers and subjects in Canadian television 
and radio.
<P>
	Twenty years after the multiculturalism policy was 
proclaimed the Canadian Broadcast Corporation finally made 
plans to be more inclusive of visible minorities. This the 
minister heralds as a great stride forward. Can we expect to wait 
another 20 years before this plan of the CBC is actually put into 
action?
<P>
	This brings clearly into question the effectiveness of the 
official multiculturalism policy. Given the identification of the 
policy with the Liberals, it is particularly surprising that Liberal 
MPs from ethnic minorities have in the past been openly critical 
of the policy of multiculturalism. The Liberal MPs representing 
Toronto area ridings particularly were critical not only of the 
creation of a separate department but also of what they termed 
the ghettoizing nature of multiculturalism as a whole.
<P>
<B>(1525 ) </B>
<P>
	Expressing sentiments he said were shared by several ethnic 
minority MPs in the party, the member for York South-Weston 
argued that while the policy of multiculturalism may have been 
valid in the past, it no longer plays a constructive role.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I believe strongly that the policy is no longer valid or appropriate today. In 
effect, the present policy of multiculturalism is divisive. It divides Canadians. It 
is unfair in that it treats Canadians in different fashions. It is regressive and at 
times discriminatory.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That statement was by the member for York South-Weston.
<P>
	In an article entitled Ethnic Pluralism Under Siege-Popular 
and Partisan Opposition to Multiculturalism from <I>Canadian 
Public Policy</I>, December 1992, Spencer's commission argues 
for refocusing official multicultural policy as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We believe that Federal Government funding for Multiculturalism activities 
other than those serving immigrant orientation, reduction of racial 
discrimination and promotion of equality should be eliminated, and the public 
funds saved be applied to these areas.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Spencer report's criticism of multiculturalism and 
recommendations for narrowing the policy's scope were 
reinforced by suggestions that minority and immigrant groups 
were also critical of the policy.
<P>
	For example, one writer of Japanese ancestry describes the 
reality of racism from her experience as a child and adult in 
Canada that is belied by the rhetoric of multiculturalism. She 
says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Multiculturalism, a term everyone loves to use in defining Canada, is admirable in 
theory but it does not work in practice. Multiculturalism is the name given to the ethnic 
and cultural diversity of our country. It implies an attitude of tolerance and acceptance, 
of equality among all regardless of ethnic background. This idea does not stand the test 
of personal experience. And the experience of individuals provides real insight into 
what defines  our country. Though official policy would have it otherwise, it is hard to 
be different in this country. For me this is an irony that underlies the very fact of being 
Canadian.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Still others have gone further to argue that through 
strengthening the associations between being ethnic and being 
of inferior status, multiculturalism actually promotes or causes 
racism.
<P>
	Similarly novelist Meil Bisoondath writes:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In stressing the differences between groups, in failing to emphasize that this is 
a country with its own ideals and attitudes which demand adherence, the policy 
has instead aided in hardening of hatreds.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This brings me to the position of the Reform Party on the 
current policy of multiculturalism. We call for the abolition of 
the official multiculturalism department. We call for the 
acceptance and integration of immigrants into the mainstream 
of Canadian life.
<P>
	We have found that Canadians welcome, value and enjoy the 
wealth of backgrounds and cultures represented by its citizens. 
This great country was built by hard working and enterprising 
people who came here from all over the world. Many are proud 
to celebrate their heritage and ethnic societies have flourished in 
Canada for generations.
<P>
	Whatever our ethnic and cultural backgrounds, what binds us 
together is our tremendous pride and privilege in being 
Canadians. It ought to be the role of the federal government to 
preserve and protect those things that we all have in common, 
and in ensuring equality for all regardless of things like race, 
language, culture and country of origin. Because of this I urge 
the minister to use her influence in cabinet to end the use of a 
definition of Canada as a meeting of two founding races, 
languages and cultures. This definition of Canada was 
introduced by the Liberals and is one which they cling to to this 
day even though it excludes more than 12 million Canadians 
whose culture and language of origin is neither French nor 
English.
<P>
	In addition, those proud Canadians who fall outside the 
Liberals' two founding races definition are ready, able and 
willing to preserve those elements of their culture and heritage 
that are important to them, using their own money and their own 
resources.
<P>
<B>(1530 ) </B>
<P>
	They do not require these activities to be funded by other 
Canadians through the allocation of tax dollars. Keeping the 
heavy hand of government out of such activity would also allow 
ethnic societies to remain free of some of the unfortunate 
political obligations that have been perceived to arise in 
conjunction with the allocation of political largesse.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1001"> 1001 </A></B>
<P>
	Instead the Reform recommends that federal multiculturalism 
programs provide immigrant adjustment services, language 
training and focus on the elimination of racism. These are the 
services new Canadians really need to help them build a new life 
in this country.
<P>
	The Reform's position is that official multiculturalism has 
indeed failed to respond to historical and contemporary 
discrimination as well as class and gender based inequities in 
the workplace.
<P>
	I suggest to the minister that we ought to focus our energies 
and resources on the key problem which is removing the 
tremendous challenges and obstacles to ensuring that every 
Canadian becomes an effective participant in the economic and 
political spheres of our country, Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simon de Jong (Regina-Qu'Appelle):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
seek unanimous consent of the House to be able to place on 
record for maybe five minutes or so the position of the New 
Democratic Party on the statement by the minister.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent for the 
member's request?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. de Jong:</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank you and the 
members of the House for giving me unanimous consent to put 
on record our position.
<P>
	First of all I would like to congratulate the minister on her 
new responsibilities and position. I have worked closely with 
her in previous parliaments and I know she will do an excellent 
job. Her heart and mind are in the right place.
<P>
	I also wish to congratulate the government for following 
through on its promise to have ministerial statements and new 
policy directions being made in the House rather than at press 
conferences.
<P>
	It does not bode well for this Parliament when one hears the 
position taken by the Official Opposition party and by the 
second largest party in the House. The Official Opposition party 
is so narrowly focused in its own little world that I am afraid it 
misses the much larger point and the larger reality that most 
Canadians are living in.
<P>
	The position of the Reform Party I also find most unfortunate. 
They suggest we should focus our efforts on the pride in being 
Canadians. I have always felt that my support of 
multiculturalism was my way of celebrating being Canadian. 
One of the major essences of Canada is the fact that we are not a 
melting pot and that we celebrate our diversity. In this diversity 
is our strength.
<P>
	We see the ramifications of this all over the place. We see 
people of Ukrainian, Croatian, Chinese or Vietnamese descent 
opening up trade connections and possibilities with the 
countries of their origin. This has a tremendous economic plus 
for Canada.
<P>
	It also is when one sees throughout history the rise of great 
nations, those great nations that embraced multiculturalism, 
different thoughts, different traditions and different ideas. This 
coming together made countries great. I believe if 
multiculturalism does its job in Canada it will help make Canada 
great.
<P>
	I urge the minister to continue with her work and to redirect 
some of the things that department has been doing. It can be 
more successful in some areas. Certainly the concern of racism 
being on the rise is a legitimate concern. In hard economic times 
we will have that increase in racism. The department has an 
important task to fulfil. I extend to her and the department all of 
our best wishes.

	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops)</B> moved for leave to introduce 
Bill C-211, an act to amend the Criminal Code (cattle rustling 
and range cattle).
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to present this private 
member's bill regarding cattle rustling and range cattle 
problems.
<P>
	It sounds as though this is a bill that comes out of the 1890s 
but in fact cattle rustling in the last number of years has become 
a major problem not only in western Canada where I am more 
familiar with it but, I am told, across the country per se.
<P>
	In spite of the reductions in staffing of the RCMP they do an 
admirable job but it is impossible for them to carry on the 
necessary surveillance. The various cattle organizations do their 
best in terms of range land patrol but not are not able to do the 
job required in such a vast country as Canada.
<P>
	Over the years when cattle rustlers have been caught, very 
little normally happens. The case does not make it through the 
courts. Consequently today people are literally losing thousands 
of livestock to one form of cattle rustling or another.
<P>
	The severity of the crime must be reflected by the severity of 
the punishment. This bill increases significantly the punishment 
for cattle rustling. It is not hanging. I do not support capital 
punishment. It goes a long way to making the point that this is a 
serious offence. It should be dealt with appropriately.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure after five years of serving as the member of Parliament 
for Dartmouth to rise in this place to talk about the changes that 
have been proposed and put before us today with regard to the 
standing orders of the House.
<P>
	When I first arrived here in 1988 I guess I was one of those 
people who wanted to change the world and do it rather quickly. 
But at the same time, because I had spent some time working for 
the previous Liberal administration, I knew that the rules of the 
House could be used either in favour of reform of the rules and 
progression of legislation or used to stymie.
<P>
	Unfortunately, in the first four and a half years I was here the 
rules of this place were all too often used to stop that type of 
exchange and that type of debate and in actual fact to undermine 
the confidence Canadians had in this institution.
<P>
	The Right Hon. John Turner, the member for Vancouver 
Quadra until the recent election and who chose not to seek 
re-election, often said that this place is the highest court in the 
land. It truly is. It is a pleasure to be sent here no matter what 
political philosophy one harbours at any time. Indeed it is an 
honour to be allowed to come to this place and represent one's 
constituents.
<P>
	However, what happened in the last session at least, far too 
often the government of the day even without a great deal of 
consultation with its own members would decide with rules that 
were enacted in an archaic way so that only the executive branch 
of government had any right to know what in the name of 
goodness was going to take place. Bills were put before the 
House which were imperfect as most bills will be. Even on the 
government side good members, nearly all of whom were 
defeated or retired, were not allowed to have any input. They 
really saw what was going on when it went to their Wednesday 
caucus meeting. At that time there was no attempt to seek input 
so that as legislators or as representatives of the people we could 
better the legislation and put our ideas forward. It was the 
government line.
<P>
	The bill would come down and members would be told: ``That 
is it. You go in the House. You have your marching orders and 
you support that bill to the death''. Members on the opposition 
side did exactly the opposite. Most times it did not matter if 
there was a grain or a whole beach full of wisdom in the bill 
members of the opposition opposed because it was viewed in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1003"> 1003 </A></B>
<P>
that type of combatant legislative set of regulations that was 
what they did.
<P>
	The rule changes that are before us today are a step forward. 
We have seen a few steps forward since this Parliament was 
elected. We have seen the reform document that was tabled. 
When the Minister of Supply and Service and Public Works was 
our House leader, he put forward a number of reforms that we 
thought if we were the government we would like to try to 
pursue.
<P>
	One thing was that we would have free debates in this House 
so that prior to the government making a decision members from 
all sides, not just the government side, but the opposition and 
other parties and the independents represented here would have 
an opportunity to put their position forward. Hopefully the 
minister or the government generally would listen and come up 
with better legislation, better regulations and better governance 
for the country. These rules start to do that.
<P>
	I recall that in 1988 after I was elected committees were 
struck and all too often government members came in and 
supported bad legislation. As I said, in most cases opposition 
members would not support even good legislation. But there was 
one opportunity we saw for change. It was when the then 
Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs came forward to 
me as the critic and said: ``Look, we have a Bankruptcy Act''. It 
was Bill C-22. ``We are going to introduce this thing in the 
House of Commons''. I think the six or seven previous attempts 
to pass that had failed. It was clearly not in the public interest for 
anybody who was on that committee to see another attempt at 
reforming Canada's bankruptcy laws fail. We were in the middle 
of a recession and we were seeing unprecedented numbers of 
individuals and companies going bankrupt. I think the 
Bankruptcy Act dated back to 1948 or 1949. It had never been 
substantially reformed.
<P>
<B>(1545 ) </B>
<P>
	I said to the minister: ``If you are prepared to allow us to 
pre-study the bill or give it to us after first reading and if you are 
prepared to tell your members on the committee that they have 
free rein to treat the bill as a draft piece of legislation, I will give 
you the assurance of the Official Opposition that our members 
will try to build a bill that can pass the House of Commons, that 
takes account of the special interests but comes forward with 
what is in the public interest''. That worked and for months we 
studied that bill. The bill we came up with did not even look the 
same as it had.
<P>
	Alas, when it came down to the crunch the government of the 
day decided it was going to become partisan again. When that 
happened the business of the committee shut down. That rare 
period of harmony in the committee changed. We became highly 
partisan and the bill hit the rocks. It was only because we were 
able to rediscover that sense of joint responsibility for 
legislation we were able to pull it off the rocks.
<P>
	The country is better off today because there is a new 
Bankruptcy Act. Probably thousands of people are still 
employed in Canada because that act allows for reorganization 
of corporations and allows for reorganization of personal debt. 
It was a fine hour for the House of Commons when we did 
exactly that type of work.
<P>
	The changes to the standing orders we are debating today go 
even further. I am an advocate of reform. If we are to gain back 
the respect of the people whom we are elected to serve it is 
important that we be allowed to do our jobs as parliamentarians. 
It means that members of the Bloc Quebecois, the Reform Party, 
New Democrats and the independents in the House be allowed as 
much input as possible into the legislative process.
<P>
	The reforms before us today indicate that after first reading 
and before approval in principle when everyone is tied down to a 
position, bills can be referred to standing or special committees 
of the House. This has pushed us miles forward from where we 
were.
<P>
	If we pursue this vigorously on important or contentious 
pieces of legislation or those which have various sides to them, 
members of the Bloc, members of the Reform and indeed 
members of the governing Liberal Party will be able without 
fear of reprisal from their whips-God love all the whips-to 
provide direct input. This is a very positive step for this 
Parliament.
<P>
	Through the reading of the proposed amendments we are 
debating today I also get the sense that committees will or can be 
asked by a minister to come up with the general direction on a 
piece of legislation. In other words it can roughly formulate 
legislation which would then go to justice officials who would 
put it together.
<P>
	As time goes on and in practice I hope that these committees 
will work together. I hope they will find areas in the public 
interest to conduct their own studies without necessarily a 
reference or request from a minister and come forward with 
what they believe is appropriate legislation addressing those 
concerns.
<P>
	For example, in the last couple of sessions of Parliament 
members have come forward with private members' bills. Some 
of those private members' bills dealt with ingredient labelling. 
Actually the Deputy Prime Minister when she was in opposition 
had put forward a couple of those bills.
<P>
	Suffice to say perhaps standing committees will be able to 
take that type of subject matter and formulate pieces of 
legislation. They could then be put before the House finding 
some process by which they could be properly debated and 
passed, if they are good pieces of legislation.
<P>
	I could speak for days on this subject, but in closing I 
commend my government for taking the initiative so early in 
this new Parliament to put forward what I hope is the first of a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1004"> 1004 </A></B>
<P>
number of reforms. It will put some respect back into the 
parliamentary process and will also make this place more worth 
while for the members who serve here.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I say to the hon. member for Dartmouth that I too feel 
this is a positive step in this new government. When we were 
campaigning during September and October all members on all 
sides of the House heard the same thing from the Canadian 
people. They are not happy with the way Parliament has 
functioned. They are unhappy with the tight and rigid rules.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	This is a step forward, but I believe we do have a long way to 
go. We have many avenues to explore in order to make all our 
voices heard in Parliament. Any movement forward will be seen 
as positive by all Canadians.
<P>
	I would ask the member for Dartmouth to comment 
specifically on the areas of reform, such as pensions. In general 
Parliament has taken a fair amount of heat particularly from the 
Reform Party in suggesting that perhaps Liberal members are 
not supportive on reform in the pension areas. I believe that is 
not true and that a good many members are quite supportive of 
practical measures to be reformed in the pension area.
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacDonald:</B> Mr. Speaker, the whole area of pension 
reform is not something the Reform Party, the Bloc or the 
Liberals can claim credit for.
<P>
	The Canadian public, because of the way we have conducted 
ourselves in the past here, has had a pox on both our Houses, and 
I mean the other place as well as this place. Therefore the good 
members who sit here are constantly being questioned about 
whether or not they are paid too much or whether or not they 
give value for money. That did not happen 10 or 15 years ago. It 
has just happened recently.
<P>
	I can think of nobody in the previous Parliament who did not 
fully justify the pay received from the crown for the job 
performed. I can honestly say I have never met anybody who 
served in this place, at least when they first came to serve in this 
place, who was here for self-interest. They were here because 
they wanted to better the country.
<P>
	The problem we have as legislators is that there are people 
like Mr. Somerville of the national coalition who would have 
everybody in the world believe that nobody works up here. That 
is fundamentally wrong. Every member of Parliament knows, as 
the new members in the Reform Party, the Bloc and the Liberals 
have learned very quickly, that this is a very difficult job. It is a 
tough job but it is one we sought.
<P>
	As far as pension reform goes, I have always said I do not 
believe people in this Chamber are overpaid. They are underpaid 
for the work they do. Far too many have to make choices with 
their families and they have to live with those choices long after 
they finish serving in this place. Nobody here should get rich, 
but nobody should be beaten every day in the media and by 
public interest and indeed by some members here because they 
take a salary home for a job well done. That is on all sides of the 
House.
<P>
	The public wants pension reform. I will continue to say what I 
said during the campaign. I am fully in favour of an independent 
committee saying what we are worth here. Regardless of 
whether it says we are worth $100,000 or $30,000, or if it says 
we are worth a pension after 20 years or 10 years, I am quite 
prepared to live or die by whatever the recommendations are, if 
it is a truly independent committee. Other members have to be 
prepared to do that also. They have to defend whatever it is the 
independent committee recommends to their own constituents 
not just during election campaigns but as soon as that committee 
reports.
<P>
	I am in favour of pension reform, but let us support whatever 
it is that comes in from the independent commissions.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alfonso Gagliano (Saint-Léonard):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is 
the first opportunity for me to address the House since the 
elections. First of all, I want to thank the voters in my riding for 
giving me a third solid mandate to represent them in the House, 
as I have done since 1984.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> A good choice, indeed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> My hon. colleagues say the voters made a 
good choice; I thank them, and especially my constituents for 
their continued support. I want to assure them that I will do my 
very best to represent them well, as I have been doing for nearly 
ten years now.
<P>
	I also want to take this opportunity to thank the Prime 
Minister for appointing me chief Government whip, a rather 
heavy responsibility considering the historic outcome of the 
elections.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	Since October 25, 205 new members have arrived to sit on 
both sides of this House. Furthermore, two new parties have 
joined the mix, making it a difficult task to organize everything 
on Parliament Hill. With the co-operation of the other parties 
and of my colleagues, the Official Opposition whip and the 
Reform Party whip, I think a more civil tone has been adopted in 
this House and I hope that this can be maintained. That is what 
Canadians want. We have a House with 295 energetic men and 
women who want to make their views known. Given the fact that 
we sit opposite one another, we cannot liken our system to a 
round table meeting. At times, some animosity may surface, 
particularly during oral question period, but I think that every-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1005"> 1005 </A></B>
<P>
thing is going well so far and I hope that this continues to be the 
case. As chief Government whip I will try to set an example.
<P>
	Everyone points to our famous red book and to the fact that 
during the election campaign, we made some very specific 
promises. From the moment the government was sworn in, the 
Prime Minister set the tone by slashing ministers' budgets and 
by following through on his first promise, namely to save $10 
million per year. Immediately after taking this initiative the 
government cancelled the helicopter contract, as it had 
promised to do. It also carried out a number of other initiatives.
<P>
	Not only the government, but all of us in this House have 
come up with a plan to cut $5 million a year in the expenses of 
the House of Commons. It is not much, a mere drop in a budget 
of $220 million a year, but this is just a beginning. In time, with 
your help on the Board of Internal Economy, Mr. Speaker, we 
will look for ways to make further savings. For the time being, 
we have a plan to save $5 million a year. The Board of Internal 
Economy has already adopted a certain number of measures and, 
hopefully, with the support of my colleagues, we will be able to 
go ahead with this plan at our next meeting.
<P>
	As I said, we will continue to save a little here and there, not 
just for the sake of saving money, but to allow this place, this 
House, this Parliament Hill to be really operational and to adapt 
to a new reality, a new situation and new technology to be put in 
place. So, this is an important proposal, not only to cut expenses, 
but also to promote the efficiency of this place and allow us to 
represent our voters effectively, thereby sending the right 
message to our constituents.
<P>
	This brings me to the subject of today's debate: parliamentary 
reform. I see my colleague the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
House Leader. We sat together on the Board of Internal 
Economy and now we both sit on the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs. In the past, we have debated the 
issue of parliamentary reform at length in our committee and 
even in this House.
<P>
	Now, just a hundred days or so after coming into office, the 
new government, the new House of Commons has put forward a 
motion on parliamentary reform, a rather important subject that 
we have already taken steps on, about ten days ago, when we 
adopted the new House of Commons Standing Committee 
format. Here is another measure relating to this reform to enable 
all members to speak to represent their constituents and their 
views.
<P>
	Since 1984, I have had the honour and pleasure of sitting in 
this House as a member for nine years on the other side, and a 
few months on this side. But on one side or the other, there is one 
very important question that my colleagues and I have to ask 
ourselves in this debate today. We do not realize the implication 
of this change: to allow a bill to be referred to a committee after 
only a few hours of debate. This is a major change. I know that  
the Official Opposition mentioned it in their remarks, but this is 
of paramount importance.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	Once this reform is implemented, every minister and hon. 
member will make a speech, but their time will be limited. We 
will not have the time previously provided for second reading.
<P>
	How did we proceed in the past? Members on both sides of the 
House all made long speeches and took position and, when the 
bill was in committee, no one on either the government or the 
opposition side wanted to change their position. We would go 
through the same debate in committee and then, at the report 
stage, we would go over the same debate and the same 
amendments once again.
<P>
	I think that the amendments proposed in this reform package 
will enable committee members from both sides of the House to 
look at bills and to invite witnesses and experts; they will then 
be able to go beyond preconceived ideas and to propose 
amendments to improve the bill.
<P>
	If the bill is not valid and a lot of changes are made to its 
substance, I am confident that the government and its ministers 
will take this into account and withdraw the bill under 
consideration. This will make a real debate possible, unlike the 
shocking situation that prevailed in the past. We could spend 
hours, days and often weeks in the House on second reading of a 
bill. The debate in committee was just a formality since the 
government stuck to the position it had defended in the House at 
second reading and the opposition did the same thing.
<P>
	I think that, for once, hon. members on both sides of the 
House have a real opportunity to make changes in committee 
and to improve legislation. That is the role of lawmakers, who 
must also put forward and review options, like the Minister of 
Human Resources Development who has just presented a 
motion to give committees the mandate to look at this whole 
important issue. Whether or not we agree with this approach, we 
had one or two days of debate to express our opinions and 
suggest ways to resolve problems, and all these options are now 
available to the committee.
<P>
	Some members, especially in the Reform Party, may accuse 
us of not going far enough. There is the whole issue of free votes 
that has arisen since the opening of this Parliament. I can tell 
you that, as a whip, I consider all votes to be free. 
<P>
	Nowadays, it is unthinkable for a whip to tell members how to 
vote. That is just not done anymore. I think that members are 
free to vote as they wish. There are party positions, there is the 
question of leadership in each party and every one of us is big 
enough to face his or her responsibilities.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1006"> 1006 </A></B>
<P>
	Many times in this House we have seen members decide to 
vote against their own party. Some regretted it, others are proud 
of it.
<P>
	We must not say that is a small step; for me, it is a big step. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope-you are indicating to me that my time has 
expired-that with the co-operation of my colleague, the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Government House Leader, who 
chairs the Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, we can 
look into the whole issue of electronic voting. That is very 
important.
<P>
	We have already discussed this subject with my colleague, the 
chief opposition whip, and we are trying to have all votes held 
on Tuesday evening. The idea of voting on Tuesday and 
Wednesday evening is not bad; I think it would save time. That 
too is important. The members would all be here and while they 
are in the House, we could vote on several bills, one after the 
other, instead of always ringing the bells for fifteen or thirty 
minutes; and members could plan their schedules better.
<P>
	I am glad that this reform will be implemented within a few 
days and I am sure that the House of Commons will be better for 
it.
<P>
<B>(1605 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand-Norfolk):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with interest to our whip's speech. I have a few 
questions for him. When I was in opposition I was always 
concerned about the fact that when we were sitting in 
committees, we as members in the committee could not bring 
forward any pieces of amendments to that bill that actually cost 
the government money.
<P>
	As a result a lot of the proposals being put forward by 
committees, a lot of the good ideas that came out of committees, 
were always ruled out of order because they cost the government 
money. I am wondering if our whip can tell me whether or not 
that has been alleviated. Are there in place now some provisions 
to allow committees to actually do the work they were put there 
to do which is to bring forward ideas that the people of Canada 
want to bring forward in legislation and ideas that unfortunately 
may cost the government money?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for his 
question. He explained a situation that we have both 
experienced in committee. It has not changed. Unfortunately 
this parliamentary reform motion we have before us does not 
address that particular problem for the reason that there are 
some constitutional situations that do not allow us to go ahead 
right now. We wanted to make sure that we had some substantial 
parliamentary reform but naturally we could not address the 
whole package altogether.
<P>
	What is important here, and I want to stress what I said before, 
is that after 180 minutes the legislation will be sent to 
committee. That is so early that I am sure members will be able 
to influence the minister and his officials. Therefore on those 
monetary amendments that  the members will make I am sure 
the minister or the officials of the minister will agree to make 
them.
<P>
	Indirectly we are answering that problem which would take a 
long time in the House and through lawyers and so on regarding 
how we can go about this constitutional impediment we have in 
terms of spending money because it is the crown and only a 
cabinet minister can do that.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member mentioned the whip and the whip's 
powers, so to speak, and the government does recognize free 
votes to a certain extent right now.
<P>
	Keeping that in mind, I would ask the hon. member if the 
government would consider allowing free votes in the standing 
committees including free votes for chair and for vice-chair 
rather than have the whip tell the members who they will vote 
for for chair and vice-chair?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> Mr. Speaker, a very interesting question. I 
would like to tell the hon. member that all our votes are free 
votes, including in committees.
<P>
	The Prime Minister, a minister, the whip and the House leader 
can all express our opinions. We suggest our choice but 
members in a committee or in the House can stand and vote the 
way the member wishes to votes.
<P>
	The idea that there is no free vote is a figure of speech. The 
member has the right to vote freely in a committee or in the 
House. The Prime Minister, the leader of the party, the whip, the 
House leader and any other minister or member have the right to 
say we should vote that way. It is up to the member in the end to 
decide.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa):</B> To begin with, Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to congratulate the hon. member for Saint-Léonard. 
Saint-Léonard is the riding next to Bourassa and we have a lot in 
common, including an important Italian ethnic minority.
<P>
	I also want to express my support regarding the committee's 
policy to reduce by $5 million a year House of Commons 
expenditures. This is an important message to send to the public, 
particularly in a period of economic crisis. I also want to say that 
I will support any measure to enhance the status of the work 
done by MPs, as well as to improve Parliament's effectiveness.
<P>
	I have a question for the hon. member: When you looked at 
parliamentary reform and drafted the proposal which you tabled 
in this House, did you take into account the experiences of the 
United States, France and Great Britain?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alfonso Gagliano (Saint-Léonard):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I 
said in my speech, in the last two to three years, my colleague 
the parliamentary secretary of the Government House Leader 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1007"> 1007 </A></B>
<P>
and I have examined this whole issue and we looked at what was 
being done elsewhere.
<P>
	In the case of the United States, we must of course consider 
the fact that their system is presidential, while ours is a British 
parliamentary system; it is therefore more appropriate to look at 
Great Britain, although we must take into account the Canadian 
reality-namely that Canada is a federation with some 
distinctive features. We also looked at the way things are done in 
France, and in other countries which have a British 
parliamentary system similar to ours.
<P>
	Parliamentary reform is of course an ongoing process which 
is applied every day. Indeed, without realizing it, we often reach 
unanimous agreements which can later become regulations. 
Consequently, I fully agree with the hon. member for Bourassa 
that we must continue to try to make the role of MPs more 
effective, so that we can adequately represent those who elect us 
every four or five years. This responsibility which consists in 
representing the public and with-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The time for questions and comments 
is up. Resuming debate. The hon. member for 
Richmond-Wolfe.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
proud to take part in this debate concerning amendments to the 
Standing Orders of the House. After listening to the previous 
speakers, you can tell how everyone is concerned about giving 
elected representatives more responsibility and more influence 
on how this House and the whole process work.
<P>
	As my colleagues have done earlier, I would like to express 
my point of view and begin by describing some of the 
fundamentals involved here. The hon. member for Dartmouth 
talked about progressive elements. Instead of using words like 
``progressive'', he should talk about rules or evolution, as his 
colleague from Saint-Léonard did.
<P>
	The hon. member for Saint-Léonard reminded us that there 
are over 200 new members in the House. It is true that those new 
members have a lot to learn and to take in.
<P>
	As for the proposed amendments to the Standing Orders of the 
House, according to the Constitution, Canada's sovereignty is 
entrusted to three entities: the Crown, the Senate and the House 
of Commons. In reality, however, that is not the case. We have 
learned from the history of Western parliamentary government 
that the real power belongs to the inner cabinet of the 
government party.
<P>
	However, as we come to the end of the 20th century, the 
political power in Canada is based on only one legitimate 
principle, and that is the power given to the House of Commons 
whose members are elected to represent the will of the people. A 
minimum balance has to be struck between the sovereignty of 
the people, expressed by universal suffrage, and the efficiency 
of the modern state so that the spirit of democracy can survive 
throughout Canada as well as Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	The primary objective of members of Parliament, who 
represent the various societies and nations that comprise the 
Canadian entity, is to control the actions of the parliamentary 
executive.
<P>
	With the emergence of the welfare state, the postwar period 
marked the beginning of an era in which politicians were faced 
with an ever increasing number of laws that were more and more 
complex, mounting budgets and a more cumbersome 
administration. So, we are witnessing the progressive growth of 
the executive at the expense of the legislature. This is not in 
itself a serious problem, but it can become extremely dangerous 
for the democratic future of a geopolitical entity when, for 
example, the leader of the governing party states repeatedly in 
the House that no one in Canada or in Quebec wants to reopen 
the Canadian Constitution, thereby denying the very existence 
of the official opposition.
<P>
	As I said, the contemporary role of the House of Commons is 
to control the government's actions, which implies the right of 
members to question and criticize freely and publicly the 
government and its legislative measures. The disappearance of 
the parliamentary balance and the emergence of a parliamentary 
oligarchy infringes on this right and reduces the democratic 
nature of the House of Commons.
<P>
	The members of the Bloc Quebecois, the Official Opposition 
in this House, have a number of reservations about the proposed 
changes to the Standing Orders of the House put forward by the 
Liberal government, since the dynamics of the proposals are 
such that the sacred balance between the legislative and the 
executive powers would be destroyed.
<P>
	These proposals call into question the very essence of 
parliamentary democracy. However, Bloc members did not 
receive a mandate from Quebec voters to reform federal 
institutions and, in this particular case, much less a mandate to 
reform the House of Commons which of all the institutions is the 
one largely responsible for Quebec's gradual, ongoing loss of 
political autonomy.
<P>
	The Bloc's mandate in this House is clear. It is to defend the 
interests of Quebec, according to parliamentary rules and 
traditions, while there is still time. The Bloc has a fundamental 
obligation to oppose any reform which is aimed at limiting the 
role of opposition members in controlling government activity. 
This obligation involves protecting the interests of Quebecers.
<P>
	Since this political party's primary objective is to secure the 
national independence of the Quebec state, it cannot help but 
advocate the decentralization of the decision-making process. 
In short, the Official Opposition acts as a watchdog in ensuring 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1008"> 1008 </A></B>
<P>
the transparency and openness of the proceedings of the House 
of Commons.
<P>
	It is written in the famous red book, the Liberal Party agenda 
so often waved about during the election campaign, and I quote: 
``The people are irritated with governments that do not consult 
them, or that disregard their views, or that try to conduct key 
parts of the public business behind closed doors''.
<P>
	This amendment put forward today by the same Liberal Party 
would enable a minister to make a motion to refer a bill to a 
committee immediately after second reading. It makes the Bloc 
Quebecois wonder what some of the statements contained in the 
red book are worth.
<P>
	Also, the throne speech mentioned that the government was 
``committed to enhancing the credibility of Parliament''. 
Basically, to make the House of Commons run more efficiently, 
the Liberals advocate providing members of Parliament a 
greater opportunity to contribute to the development of 
legislation. Again, the Bloc Quebecois questions the value, the 
usefulness of the government proposals in terms of referring 
bills to committee immediately after first reading, because that 
is the intent: to change second reading proceedings to allow the 
minister to ask for the bill to be referred immediately to 
committee. This would means that no amendments could be 
considered in the House. We do not think that abolishing debate 
in the House at the second reading stage is a measure that will 
increase transparency or allow members to make a greater 
contribution. The Official Opposition believes, on the contrary, 
that it undermines the legislative function of private members. 
Does this mean that parliamentary democracy is progressively 
disappearing? Is the member of Parliament not the front-line 
representative, that is to say the elected representative of the 
people of his or her riding, the riding being foremost in a system 
of democracy by representation? Those are the questions that we 
must ask ourselves.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	The reality is the following: the time allocated to the 
consideration of private members' bills in the House of 
Commons has shrunk from three to four days a week in 1867 to a 
mere two to four hours a week in 1968. The exact same thing is 
happening now with regard to the time allocated to the Official 
Opposition, for this government proposal basically eliminates 
any debate in the House on the principle of bills being read for 
the second time. And that is an important stage! Second reading 
is the most important stage a bill has to go through. That is when 
the House gets to vote on the very principle of the legislation.
<P>
	Again, the Bloc Quebecois has serious reservations 
concerning this measure put forward by the government to 
reform the House of Commons. One of the primary immediate 
objectives of the Bloc Quebecois will be to introduce legislation 
to increase the capacity to get involved, the legislative 
responsibility and the input of members of Parliament in the 
development of a decentralized Parliament. After all, 
Parliament is a  rhetorical instrument in the original meaning of 
the word, that is to say one that allows public debate on matters 
of public interest. As I said, it also encourages the expression of 
dissent in a civilized way. Real political opposition is a 
necessary attribute of democracy, tolerance and confidence in 
the people's ability to resolve their differences peacefully. 
Opposition is essential to the parliamentary political system; 
otherwise, politics simply becomes administration.
<P>
	With this in mind, the debate and vote on the principle of a bill 
at second reading is the most important way that opposition 
members have to oversee government bills and provides an 
opportunity to question the advisability of a bill before it is 
studied and debated clause by clause. By sending a bill to 
committee right after first reading, the government prevents 
members from criticizing the principle of a bill before its 
passage is assured.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you will agree that it is difficult in committee, at 
report stage, to call into question the principle of a bill while it is 
being amended clause by clause. Once again, the Bloc 
Quebecois believes that this infringes the fundamental right of 
members to control government legislation.
<P>
	With this reform, the opposition could no longer delay debate; 
from at least six hours allotted to the official opposition under 
the present Standing Orders, we would have at most one hour 
under the government's proposal. It seems that the power of 
backbenchers is being strangely eroded, as I already said several 
times, whence the reluctance of Bloc Quebecois members to 
approve such a measure. Incidentally, this same amendment 
does not restore Parliament's public credibility.
<P>
	The government's proposal to amend the Standing Orders of 
the House concerns the committee charged with tabling a bill. 
Thus a minister can present a motion delegating to the 
committee the power to draft a draft bill and table it in the 
House. In its report, the committee can then recommend the 
principle, scope and general provisions of the draft bill, which 
implies a provision for an immediate vote on second reading, 
without debate or amendment.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	The consequences of this proposal on the principle of 
parliamentary democracy and the importance of the role of the 
backbencher as a legislator are the same as in the case of the 
preceding proposal, namely that it prevents MPs from 
criticizing the principle of government bills. Indeed, nothing in 
this proposal indicates that a bill tabled by the government, 
following the report tabled by a committee, complies with that 
report. The government may well not respect the principle of the 
bill drafted by the committee when that bill is tabled for first 
reading.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1009"> 1009 </A></B>
<P>
	With this measure, the government is trying to force the hand 
of the opposition by indirectly implicating it in the decision 
process, by enabling it, in theory since committees are 
controlled by the majority, to participate in the drafting of bills. 
The government is trying to get the opposition to support the 
bills which are tabled.
<P>
	Although we do not systematically oppose this proposal, Bloc 
Quebecois members want to emphasize the importance of 
having a debate here on the principle underlying any bill, and 
they want to make this House aware of the fact that this measure 
does absolutely nothing to ensure transparency and to improve 
Parliament's credibility, two important election promises 
contained in the famous red book.
<P>
	The Official Opposition deplores the fact that the 
government's proposed reform does not provide for special 
debates on bills deemed important by MPs. Indeed, emergency 
debates are rather rare in the House. The rules governing such 
debates are very strict, thus preventing this type of exercise on 
issues of concern to the public. The relevance of the proceedings 
of this House often is not obvious for the public, since in the 
absence of emergency debates these proceedings are not always 
related to current issues.
<P>
	In order to better protect Quebec's interests, the Bloc 
Quebecois would like to enhance the status of the work done by 
the House of Commons. We therefore propose that a procedure 
be established to hold special debates on specific issues, as was 
recommended in the 81st report of the Standing Committee on 
House Management.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois also deplores the fact that the 
government did not make any proposal for a special question 
and answer period on specific issues, during which some 
ministers would answer all the questions asked.
<P>
	The eighty-first report, mentioned earlier, contained a 
recommendation that a special period for questions and answers 
be institutionalized on a weekly basis. The Standing Committee 
on House Management saw this as an effective means of dealing 
with regional and sectoral problems which, due to lack of time, 
could not be dealt with by the opposition during Question 
Period. The committee also saw this as a way to question 
ministers more systematically.
<P>
	We therefore notice a lack of political will on the part of the 
government and an attitude that clearly contradicts the great 
principle of the election platform of the Liberal Party of Canada.
<P>
	In this perspective, and to protect the interests of Quebec, the 
Bloc Quebecois proposes setting aside once a week, outside 
normal sitting hours, at least one hour for questions and answers 
on a subject or problem to be dealt with by a single minister. The 
Official Opposition would determine early in the week which 
ministers are to be questioned on what subjects, as well as the 
date and time of the proceedings. During these sessions, the 
House  would sit according to a format similar to that of 
committees of the whole.
<P>
	And, as a last point, I would like to draw the attention of the 
House to several government proposals concerning public 
spending and pre-budget consultations. The proposed reforms 
which empower the committee to examine the future year 
expenditure plans of departments before the last sitting day in 
June and to table a report advising the government on its future 
expenditure plans is a positive measure involving backbenchers 
in the budget planning process.
<P>
	The item on authorizing consideration of proposals regarding 
the budgetary policy of the government from September to 
December is also a way of involving backbenchers in the budget 
process. The opposition sees this as a positive element as well.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	Finally, the proposal regarding the possibility to amend the 
tax system in committee without previous notice before the 
introduction of a bill seems destined to give committees, with a 
parliamentary majority, all the flexibility required to impose tax 
measures. That way, the opposition would not get notices in the 
House and the government could introduce bills without saying 
immediately that their application would entail taxes.
<P>
	Before I conclude, I would like to remind the federalist 
members of this House who might feel very patriotic that Bloc 
Quebecois members were not sent to Ottawa to reform 
parliamentary structures, but to defend the interests of the 
Quebec state. Need I mention it? We are sovereignist members 
and as such we denounce the proposed changes to the Standing 
Orders since they do not improve openness and are not, 
therefore, in the interest of Quebec.
<P>
	Let me mention, as an example, the absence of any measure 
whatsoever which would allow the House to examine 
order-in-council appointments of officers of Parliament, 
judges, ambassadors, high commissioners, presidents and 
administrators of Crown corporations and of various people in 
regulatory bodies, agencies, and courts. It would have been very 
much in the public interest if, in the context of this 
parliamentary reform, a procedure allowing members to 
examine appointments before they became reality had been 
proposed to the House. In so doing, the government would have 
enriched and transformed the members' role and would have 
given back to Parliament its credibility. That type of proposal is 
essential to the openness of political decision making and seems 
to be a fundamental democratic measure if the people are to 
express their sovereignty since it would protect the country 
against patronage and political bias.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois cannot help but feel concerned since it is 
not covered in the proposal for parliamentary reform. The lack 
of such measure shows how the government are against 
openness even though last autumn, during the campaign, they 
prom-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1010"> 1010 </A></B>
<P>
ised they would  base appointments on qualifications and put an 
end to patronage.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to quote the liberal member for 
Kingston and the Islands who said, on April 9, 1991: ``That 
exposition of the importance of an opposition in Parliament to 
inform the people and to express their grievances in Parliament 
is a deep rooted one in the British parliamentary tradition'' and 
``We believe that this country functions best when it has a strong 
and effective opposition''. We of the Bloc Quebecois also 
believe that our country, that is Quebec, will have the 
opportunity to assert itself and gain political autonomy thanks to 
the presence in Ottawa of a strong and efficient Official 
Opposition. The voice the Bloc Quebecois is raising in protest 
against the centralizing views of the federal government and the 
lack of transparency of the parliamentary reform proposed 
today, is the same voice we hear, coming from the Canadian 
political scene, in favour of political independance for Quebec.
<P>
	Therefore, the sovereignist MPs reject the government's 
proposal to refer bills to committees for review, immediately 
after first reading, on the grounds that it violates the guarantees 
granted opposition members, under the Standing Orders, to 
question and criticize the government.
<P>
	The Bloc members deplore the lack of political will that 
would have allowed for real reform and put an end to the general 
disillusionment felt by Canadians for politicians as a whole. The 
same members deplore a partial reform which does not provide 
for this fundamental balance between the role of the 
government, which is to govern, and that of the opposition, 
which is to control the government's activities.
<P>
	To conclude, we also deplore the fact that this reform of 
parliamentary rules, which challenges some fundamental 
principles of our parliamentary system, does not address the 
tarnished image of MPs.
<P>
	In short, all the Official Opposition is seeking is that the rules 
of the parliamentary system be respected, and that decisions 
made by the Canadian political community be transparent, as 
requested by the Quebec people.
<P>
	Quebecers have a good memory and they are not ready to 
forget the many years under the Liberals, when many decisions 
regarding the political future of Quebec were taken, with total 
disrespect for openness, and resulted in the Constitutional Act 
of 1982.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is my duty, pursuant to Standing 
Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be raised 
tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. 
member for Richelieu-Cigarette Smuggling; the hon. member 
for Yukon-Tobacco Products.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
remarks that have been made in the debate today have been of 
considerable interest to the government. I will deal with the hon. 
member for Richmond-Wolfe in due course, but I wanted to 
start by speaking briefly about the remarks made particularly by 
the hon. member Mission-Coquitlam in her speech this 
morning. I thank all the members who participated in the debate 
for their contributions and suggestions which are of 
considerable importance to the government.
<P>
	Members on the opposite side will agree that the government 
has attempted to consult with them in formulating the proposals 
that were put forward. The general thrusts of the proposals were 
ones set out in the red book and we have proceeded with those. 
However we have added to the motion changes as suggested by 
members in the opposition and in the Reform Party which we 
think have ameliorated the motion and made it a better one for 
all members and for the House in general.
<P>
	The hon. member for Mission-Coquitlam referred to several 
of the items being referred to the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs which really are in the last 
paragraph of the government's motion today. The number of 
items being referred to the committee for consideration is a very 
substantial one. I know it will take the committee some time to 
get through it and the date for return has been omitted from the 
resolution. The committee is free to report from time to time its 
findings to the House. I am sure it will do so on some of the 
issues as the study is undertaken and completed.
<P>
	The interest in reporting on a large number of subjects at once 
saves time in terms of debate in this Chamber if there is going to 
be a debate on the adoption of the committee's report. On some 
of the issues no doubt there will be a desire on the part of 
members to have a lengthy debate. I can see that on an issue such 
as recall there may be considerable pressure to do that.
<P>
	On the other hand, the committee affords an excellent 
opportunity for discussion. The committee can hear witnesses 
and members are free to make speeches in committee. They can 
arrange to have those printed and reported if that is the interest. I 
look forward to a lively discussion in the Standing Committee 
on Procedure and House Affairs concerning the items referred to 
there.
<P>
	I remind hon. members on all sides that this particular 
committee has the standing orders, procedures and practices of 
the House referred to it on a permanent basis. It is free to launch 
a study on any aspect of the rules and practices of the House that 
it sees fit to do and may then report those findings and recom-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1011"> 1011 </A></B>
<P>
mendations to the House in the form of a report. We are not in 
any way restricted to the items listed in the paragraph at the end  
of this motion if the practice or rule that we are undertaking is 
already part of the practice of the House.
<P>
	In the speech by the member for Mission-Coquitlam she 
indicated that her party was interested in restructuring the 
committee system. I am not sure how she intended to restructure 
it. We have restructured it a bit. The changes were made last 
week. The changes contained in the motion before the House 
today are significant ones and in my submission give substantial 
additional powers to the committees of the House, particularly 
in dealing with government bills.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The problem as described to us by members of the Bloc 
Quebecois is totally different. I believe that the person who 
talked to all Bloc members misrepresented the implications of 
this resolution, of this motion. They misunderstood our 
proposed change to second reading and referral to committee of 
a bill after the first reading. This change is very significant 
because in the past, because second reading always took place in 
the House, when a bill was referred to a committee, that 
committee had to consider the bill as already agreed to by the 
House.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	The committee could not change the principles of the bill. As 
there were several principles at stake, it was very difficult to 
propose admissible amendments to a bill in committee. Now we 
practically have a free hand. When a bill is referred to a 
committee after the first reading, the committee can review the 
bill without restrictions. That is a major change to the Standing 
Orders of the House. It gives all members, on both sides of the 
House, the opportunity to propose such amendments. So it is 
quite important.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I say to the member for Richmond-Wolfe that he should read 
this again and not listen to whoever is giving instructions over 
there. If they read the changes they would see that this is 
significant.
<P>
	In fairness, the members who have spoken were not in the last 
House. The member for Laurier-Saint-Marie who was here 
was never on a committee because he was not a member of a 
party. The Bloc Quebecois was not recognized as a party before 
the last election. Like the NDP and the Conservatives now in the 
House, they were not allowed to be on committees. They were 
struck off. Therefore he did not have experience on a committee 
and I can understand his making this mistake.
<P>
	Had the member been there and tried moving these 
amendments he would have been frustrated to his wit's end. 
Quite sensible, ordinary regular amendments could not be 
moved because they changed the principle of the bill or were 
beyond the scope of the bill as approved by the House at second 
reading. That is gone and those restrictions are off.
<P>
	When a bill is there to amend the Canada Elections Act, for 
example, and it is before a committee after first reading, other 
amendments to the Canada Elections Act could be added to that 
bill before it comes back to the House.
<P>
	It gives tremendous scope to members of Parliament from 
every side to make changes in legislation that has been 
proposed. It is a very significant departure and one quite 
contrary to anything we have had before. It is a case of the 
government's giving up significant control of the legislative 
agenda in respect of a bill when it adopts this course and refers 
the bill to committee.
<P>
	It will be interesting to see how it works and I invite members 
to wait and see how it works. However, to criticize at this point 
as depriving the opposition an opportunity to debate the bill at 
second reading is unfair.
<P>
	It has that effect but the opportunities thereby created are so 
much greater that it is a bonanza for members, particularly 
members who are not of the cabinet, on every side of the House 
to participate in the legislative process.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I also know that the leader of the Bloc Quebecois comes from 
the Conservative Party. He was a Conservative before he 
founded the Bloc Quebecois. He approaches all changes in this 
House with the eye of a Conservative. I do not share his 
viewpoint.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am a Liberal. These are Liberal changes. These are changes 
that members are going to appreciate and enjoy. The fact that the 
Reform Party is accepting of them in such a generous way 
indicates that they do meet some of the objections.
<P>
	We have had arguments in the House that the House is 
unresponsive and there is a need for changes that allow for 
greater participation of members in debates of particular 
importance at a given moment.
<P>
	I recognize that a government's legislative agenda may not 
allow for such debates. I am delighted to see members referring 
to the 81st report of the standing committee on House 
management, as it was then called, that came in during the last 
Parliament which did make some proposals for changes in the 
opportunities for members to ask questions of ministers and for 
special debates on different occasions that were not emergency 
debates under Standing Order 52.
<P>
	Those are extremely rare. We had something like five 
Standing Order 52 debates in the last Parliament. They were 
extremely rare and very hard to get. They were subject to some 
comment by me in that committee, but most of the proposals that 
were put 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1012"> 1012 </A></B>
<P>
forward by that committee are ones that I personally support and 
am urging the government to consider.
<P>
	I am sure that in the new Standing Committee on Procedure 
and House Management the members opposite who have 
mentioned these with favour will raise them as proposals the 
committee could put forward to the House. I hope they will find 
some support among members of the committee on all sides. If 
we can come up with a recommendation to make such changes it 
would be delightful. I note the proposal for doing so is contained 
in the motion the government has put forward which indicates a 
willingness on the part of the government to consider this.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	I may say the government has shown restraint in not wishing 
to touch on things like question period which are principally the 
domain of the opposition. Members of the opposition can come 
forward with constructive suggestions that will improve 
question period and the other opportunities they have as 
members to participate in the affairs of the House by 
questioning the government ministers.
<P>
	I look forward to the opportunity. I look forward to the debate. 
I want to say how much I appreciate the very constructive 
suggestions being put forward today by members on all sides as 
we grapple with this problem.
<P>
	The lack of confidence in members of the House stemmed in 
large part because the last government was so inattentive to the 
wishes and desires expressed by Canadians. It ignored 
Canadians. It failed to live up to the promises it made.
<P>
	In proposing this motion we are trying to fulfil the promises 
we made in the red book. We are interested in allowing 
Canadians to participate in the committee process in a very 
meaningful and very direct way. In my view these changes 
which may sound small to somebody listening to this debate 
outside represent a revolutionary change in the way legislation 
is dealt with in the House.
<P>
	I look forward to having these in place and having the 
co-operation of hon. members on all sides as we move forward 
to try bills in this new process.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member for answering 
my questions from this morning.
<P>
	He also inquired as to how I felt we could restructure the 
committee system. In keeping with the rules of the House I 
would like to reword my answer into a question so it will be 
allowed.
<P>
	Would the government consider going to the extent of 
initiating and setting up a public accounts committee with 
all-party membership to look at the spending of two or three 
government departments for a year? In the process of one 
Parliament, which would be five years, we would be looking at 
15 or perhaps 20 government departments after the fact. This 
would be a way to hold us accountable. Could I have an answer, 
please.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, under Standing Order 104 there is 
already a Standing Committee on Public Accounts created by 
the House which is chaired by a member of the opposition. It has 
been a tradition in this place that a member of the Official 
Opposition is elected chair of that committee. I do not believe 
the committee has yet met, but when it does I have no doubt it 
will elect a member of the Official Opposition to be its chair.
<P>
	The public accounts committee includes, and I quote from 
Standing Order 108(3)(e):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Public Accounts shall include, among other matters, review of and report on 
the Public Accounts of Canada and all reports of the Auditor General of Canada 
which shall be severally deemed permanently referred to the Committee 
immediately they are laid upon the table;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Therefore the Auditor General's report, which was tabled the 
other day, is deemed referred to the public accounts committee. 
It is free to study as many government departments in a year as it 
wishes to do. It is free to study, because those are all reported in 
the public accounts of Canada, which are referred to the 
committee and the Auditor General's report thereon is also 
referred to the committee.
<P>
	The committee is free to undertake the study of any 
government department it wishes at any time. It is under the 
chairmanship of a member of the opposition so there is pretty 
free rein granted to that committee.
<P>
	The hon. member may have missed it as its reports are not 
widely covered by the media and so we do not hear about it, but 
it worked extremely well during the last Parliament.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciated the comments of the hon. member with 
regard to the proposed changes to the standing orders.
<P>
	I have a couple of comments and then perhaps a question. 
First, the door is open but we have not passed through it yet. I 
might say we have identified the right buttons but we have not 
pushed them yet. We are hoping that in the 35th Parliament we 
will not only identify the needed reform in this very institution 
but will also act upon those needs and implement them. I was 
glad to hear the hon. member say that the procedure and House 
affairs committee which he chairs would be willing to look at 
other issues with regard to parliamentary reform as well as the 
ones that are identified in the document we are debating today.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	A particular interest of mine is reform of the other place by 
non-constitutional means. Perhaps once we have dealt with 
some of the issues on this paper we can get to those as well.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1013"> 1013 </A></B>
<P>
	Another concern of mine is dignity and decorum in the House. 
I understand that the House is performing much better than has 
been seen in the past. As someone involved not only in 
campaigning in an election but also in candidate recruitment I 
found that young people were particularly turned off by this 
place. It would be appropriate for the House to do all in its 
means to change the appearance of this place so that young 
people would become excited about this institution and 
interested in the politics of their country.
<P>
	Does the hon. member have some ideas on how that could be 
accomplished?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a suggestion I would be 
interested in discussing with hon. members that would 
encourage young people to participate in Parliament.
<P>
	When I was in university I had the privilege of working here 
as a summer job for one of the ministers of the then government. 
It was quite a long time ago and I enjoyed it very much. I found it 
a tremendously worthwhile experience.
<P>
	We have two avenues open to us. One is to employ summer 
students. Many members may be able to afford this in their 
budgets and I think it is a great idea. I have done so since my 
election in 1988 and I found it extremely helpful.
<P>
	The intern program that is currently operating in the House is 
a relatively small program. It involves a number of individuals 
who are assigned for periods of months to a member's office to 
work there. Something the House might look at is the expansion 
of that program with a view to providing additional assistance to 
members in their office work, at the same time giving students 
an opportunity to learn more about the way Parliament works.
<P>
	I would recommend this to the House. It could possibly be 
accomplished by some change in the member's budget so that 
the service was provided by the House. Everyone would have an 
intern.
<P>
	That is a possibility. It is something we might look at as a 
House. It is certainly not government policy. It is something 
suggested to me by others who have been involved in the intern 
program, or indirectly through the intern program, and it would 
be a good opportunity for more people to participate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am very pleased to speak to the issue of parliamentary reform. 
It is one that has been my favourite since I was elected to 
Parliament in 1988.
<P>
	I would expect that all members take some pleasure from the 
fact that the government has moved to make changes in the way 
we do business in the House and in committees. It has been done 
early in its mandate and in a manner that reflects both the 
election promises it made and the work of other members on 
both sides of the House, not just in the last Parliament but going 
back about a dozen years.
<P>
	I would like to put the issue of reform of Parliament in 
context. It is a rather large context. I have to go back and at least 
make reference to the foundation document, the Magna Carta. I 
am not going to read from it but it is here. Part of the Magna 
Carta shows up in our statutory books of reference. It is actually 
an appendix to the Revised Statutes of Ontario if I recall my 
days of law practice. It is not an unimportant foundation 
document.
<P>
	I refer also to the bill of rights of 1689. It consolidated many 
of the rights and privileges that had been given birth to since the 
Magna Carta and which we still rely on.
<P>
	I have a photocopy of proceedings of the British Parliament in 
the year 1788 where an individual by the name of Harris and 
another unfortunate individual by the name of Lee were both 
arrested by the Sergeant-at-Arms for contempt of the House in 
failing to attend and answer questions at committee. I have a 
long history of reform supplemented in part by a document I 
read on the weekend which was written by William Lyon 
Mackenzie and contained a proclamation from Navy Island, 
U.S.A., following the Upper Canada rebellion in 1837. There in 
print were many of the basic fundamental rights and freedoms 
that we required in this country at that time and which we still 
rely on today.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	This House should always be reforming itself. We can reach 
back to 1837 and see the work and the lives lost. There were 
people hanged, people who followed Louis Papineau in Lower 
Canada and people who followed William Lyon Mackenzie in 
Upper Canada. But the work of reform of this House must 
always continue.
<P>
	Who is reforming the House? Is it the government? No, it is 
not the government's job to reform the House; it is the job of 
members of Parliament. Anyone who uses the term government 
in reforming this place is in part misinformed. The government 
does have a role in that it collectively is the word that represents 
all of the members of the House who sit on the government side. 
The government must show leadership, but the government 
cannot by itself reform this place. The government is a 
manifestation of the crown, of the King, of the executive branch 
of government. The government does not run Parliament, 
members of Parliament do. That is something we must never 
forget.
<P>
	The genesis of this round of reform, if we reach back about a 
dozen years, is the Lefebvre report, which I commend to 
members, and the McGrath report which dealt with a similar 
phase of reform. In the last Parliament we had the work of the 
House management committee, the work of the subcommittee to 
the liaison committee on committee reform and the work of our 
colleagues in the Liberal caucus, all of which has collectively 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1014"> 1014 </A></B>
<P>
been, at least in part, manifested by the proposals for reform in 
this 35th Parliament.
<P>
	I want to recognize a very important dynamic in 
parliamentary reform. One member can do nothing by himself 
or herself. Simply stated that is a fact of life; one person can do 
nothing. On the other extreme, we have a critical mass of people 
in parties, and a party can accomplish something, especially if 
we are the party on the government side and in the majority. But 
we must be careful to recognize that a party in majority is a party 
that holds virtually dictatorship powers. I say virtually because 
it is not often that a government will go to such extremes to 
impress its will on Parliament without listening to the 
opposition. Exceptions perhaps are the last Parliament. 
However we must all recognize this.
<P>
	Where is the middle ground? What is the mechanism? The 
only mechanism capable of delivering a vehicle for reform and 
activity by members of Parliament greater than one but less than 
the party is the parliamentary committee. That is where we must 
look for reform.
<P>
	I want to address two of the areas of reform very quickly. One 
is our absolute and utter failure to deal with the government's 
estimates. We have failed for years to do our work in monitoring 
the expenditures of the federal government. We are not alone in 
the western world. I know the British Parliament has similarly 
failed. I know that other Parliaments have failed. We do not want 
to continue this failure. We must recognize the challenge as it is. 
I believe the challenge is at the committee level. I am prepared 
to support the initiative in this round of reform that provides for 
a pre-estimates round of review that permits committees and 
members to impress upon government their views as to the 
spending in each envelope. I can only hope that it will work. I am 
not convinced that it will but we have to try it. We must start 
somewhere.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	The other area is the new process of referring bills to 
committee after first reading. I am at first blush going to support 
this. We have to do something to improve the legislative 
mechanism here.
<P>
	In my view it would be a wonderful institution if a committee 
could take a small piece of legislation, a small amendment, a 
one-page amendment, with the explicit or tacit consent of the 
minister, draft it and bring it into the House even during Private 
Members' Business as opposed to government business and 
have that amendment passed without having to gobble up the 
time required to develop cabinet consensus around the Privy 
Council table, back and forth among bureaucrats and back and 
forth through committee just to get one clause in a bill changed. 
It can take a year or two or three or four. I would love to see the 
new proposals accommodate that type of procedure. We will see 
if they do.
<P>
	Finally I want to make a pitch for codifying and putting into 
statute the mechanism of the House for reviewing all the 
delegated legislation, that is the statutory instruments and 
regulations enacted by the Privy Council. There are over 1,000 
per year. They are reviewed by the joint committee for scrutiny 
of regulations. This place and the other place share the 
workload.
<P>
	At the moment there are some areas of delegated legislation 
and regulations that are excluded from the disallowance power 
of the committee. The disallowance power was used three times 
in the last Parliament. However, because the power is in the 
standing orders as opposed to being statutory, this committee is 
not able to provide for disallowance of regulations and statutory 
instruments made by agencies outside government such as the 
National Transportation Agency of Canada.
<P>
	I would like to put it on record that it is my hope this will be an 
area for reform a little later in this Parliament. I want to join all 
members of the House from all sides who want to work to 
modernize Parliament's institutions and to make it a more 
effective place that will reflect the wishes of our electors and be 
efficient in so doing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Ontario):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have the 
unique pleasure today to compliment the member for 
Scarborough-Rouge River. About five years ago around this 
time I had the benefit of being his campaign manager. At that 
time I recall these same eloquent remarks being placed before 
the electorate and the fine people of Scarborough-Rouge 
River.
<P>
	It is significant that this is my first intervention as the member 
for Ontario. I will have an opportunity at some point to discuss 
that.
<P>
	Going very quickly to the question, how does the member for 
Scarborough-Rouge River feel these changes will impact him 
now that he is a government member? We know he has 
distinguished himself as a member of the opposition but now 
that he is sitting on the government benches it is very important 
for him to understand where his role is now in terms of 
government and how these new reforms will help him along.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Ontario for his 
question and comment.
<P>
	I learned a bit about Parliament before I was elected to 
Parliament. It will not be a surprise that most of what I have 
learned was in my first few years here as a member of the 
opposition. In my first few months sitting on the government 
side of the House I want to confirm that I cannot and will not 
forget all that I learned in opposition. I will not likely change my 
views about what this place needs and how it should be run. 
Hopefully I can be true to what I have always believed and to the 
views I formed in opposition.
<P>
<B></B>

<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	I realize that being in government has some additional 
responsibilities and on behalf of my electors I am certainly 
prepared to undertake all of those. Je me souviens. I will not 
forget what it was like in opposition.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure also to commend the hon. member for 
Scarborough-Rouge River on his presentation. It is a very 
happy day, I understand, for people on all sides of the House.
<P>
	I want to say as a member on this side of the House that we 
have to look on things, hopefully not differently but in a manner 
better than for many years prior to this time in the House.
<P>
	I say that many remarks have been made today talking about 
the reform of the standing orders, the reform of all our workings 
here in this institution. I know some of us believe that this is just 
a small chink in the armour but at least we are on the road.
<P>
	We talked about this for the five years we have been here. I 
want to commend the member for his visions that he put forward 
over the years and for the other members from all parties who 
were involved in trying to get a presentation such as this and 
trying to see this actual day come to pass.
<P>
	I want to ask a couple of questions and get the hon. member's 
views on what he would think of the possibility, as we go down 
the road, of changing or amending legislation and of writing 
policy. I wonder if he sees Parliament and the committees being 
in a position to write policy, to get actually to the point at which 
we will do those things as we reform this institution. What 
extent does he see this going to?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the 
question. There is one principle if we are to proceed down the 
road to making the place work better and if we are to use the 
committee structure and that is the committee must, before it 
starts work, have a consensus as to what it wants to do. Without 
that all efforts will be scattered to the four winds and the 
committee will simply not achieve any goal, whether it be 
legislative or policy oriented.
<P>
	I commend to all members who would be active in any 
committee area to build a consensus at the committee level 
before they start. One must accept a bit of divergence of views 
here at committee, but if they lose the consensus the committee 
will not impact on the government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand-Norfolk):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
wondering if the hon. member would give me his views on some 
changes that actually are not in this because as private members' 
bills go, everyone knows that we try to get up in this House and 
put forward legislation. Because of the system of the draw we 
have I was in a private members' draw for three years and never  
got drawn. I am wondering if the hon. member would agree with 
me?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have to admit to the hon. member and 
to colleagues that I will be chairing the subcommittee on private 
members' business. I can assure the hon. member and all 
members on both sides of the House that we will be looking very 
carefully at possible reforms in that area.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to advise the 
House that the hon. member for Calgary Southwest, a great 
advocate of parliamentary reform, will be speaking for 20 
minutes and after that we will again divide our time pursuant to 
Standing Order 43(2).
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
first I would like to sincerely commend the government House 
leader and other MPs responsible for these proposed 
amendments to the standing orders. I would also like to thank 
the member for Scarborough-Rouge River for reminding us 
that parliamentary reform ultimately depends on the initiative 
of individual members rather than on the initiative the 
government.
<P>
	The amendments proposed in the motion from our standpoint 
reflect a significant step forward toward improving the ability of 
the House to conduct its business. It is our sincere hope that this 
is just the first step of many in that direction.
<P>
	The proposed amendments that we find most attractive and 
most deserving of support are the following: first, the proposal 
to allow public bills to be sent to committees before second 
reading rather than after; second, the proposal to allow 
committees to draft and introduce bills; third, the proposal to 
allow the Standing Committee on Finance to consider and make 
reports on proposals regarding the budgetary policy of the 
government.
<P>
	The general thrust of all these amendments is to give members 
of Parliament a greater say in the development of public laws 
and budgetary policy. This in our judgment is just an excellent 
first step in the right direction.
<P>
	If hon. members agree with the spirit and the general direction 
of these amendments, it is a sincere hope of Reform MPs that the 
House will also be willing to consider additional steps in the 
same direction, steps that will take us toward a truly democratic 
and accountable Parliament for the 21st century.
<P>
	Three of the most important of these additional steps are the 
institution of freer votes in the Chamber, the acceptance of 
direction by this House through referendums and citizens' 
initiatives and the acceptance and institution of a recall 
procedure.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1016"> 1016 </A></B>
<P>
	Reform members are pleased to see that the concluding 
paragraph of the motion directs the standing committee to 
examine procedures which would facilitate the institution of 
these measures. Because these measures are frequently 
misunderstood in some quarters and maligned in others, I would 
like to add to the comments of the member for Lethbridge earlier 
in the day and just comment briefly on the importance of each.
<P>
	Let me start with the institution of free votes. If one is a 
so-called backbencher in the House, in other words if one is not 
a member of the cabinet, then there is no single reform that I 
would commend to such members for increasing our influence 
in this place and our ability to represent our constituents than the 
institution of freer votes.
<P>
	The Reform MPs have challenged the Prime Minister and do 
so again to become the first Prime Minister to truly liberate MPs 
from excessive party discipline. As I said in my reply to the 
speech from the throne, this could be accomplished if the Prime 
Minister were simply to rise in his place and say: ``Mr. Speaker, 
the government will not consider the defeat of a government 
motion, including a spending measure, to constitute an 
expression of non-confidence in the government unless it is 
immediately followed by the passage of a formal 
non-confidence motion''.
<P>
	If the Prime Minister were to take this simple step, what 
would be the practical consequences? We would not, as the 
Prime Minister suggested the other day in response to a 
question, see the House dissolve into a Parliament of 295 
independent members. Under the freer vote convention we 
proposed we would still have parties. On most issues on which 
our platforms and commitments were clear and we were elected 
on the basis of those platforms and commitments we would 
continue to vote, for the most part, in accordance with those 
mandates.
<P>
	However, if from time to time there arose issues on which our 
constituents clearly wanted us to vote contrary to the party line 
we should have the freedom in this House to do so without being 
censured by our colleagues or maligned by the media as 
dissidents or pressured by party whips or party leaders to vote 
against our constituents' interests.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	If we also relaxed the confidence convention in this House in 
favour of freer votes on estimates and individual spending 
measures, we would not be destroying the capacity of the 
government to carry a budget. We would simply be 
implementing recommendations by previous committees of this 
House to which the Auditor General again drew our attention in 
his latest report.
<P>
	I want to quote four sections from his report and ask this 
House to come back to this subject. Paragraph 1.22 states in 
part:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>However, committees are spending less and less time on the estimates. One 
major reason for this apparent lack of interest lies in the impact of the confidence 
convention, which, as currently interpreted, makes any motion to change a vote 
in the estimates a potential test of the House's confidence in the government. 
Because failure to win a confidence vote leads to the resignation of the 
government, no changes can be made in the estimates, even though committees 
have the power-at least in theory-to reduce or reject estimate votes.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Paragraph 1.28 states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In 1988, the public accounts committee expressed concern about the adequacy 
of Parliament's scrutiny of the estimates-.The committee recommended to the 
House that a new ``budget committee'' be set up to remedy these deficiencies, and 
that ``the government not consider a reduction in the estimates as a matter of 
non-confidence''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In paragraph 5.114 of the report it is stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Opening up the budget process to allow parliamentarians to participate 
would certainly contribute to a more meaningful dialogue on deficits, debt and 
the expectations of the public. However there would still remain the stumbling 
block known in our parliamentary institution as the confidence convention: the 
notion that the party forming the government must be able to demonstrate that it 
enjoys the support of a majority of the members of the House of Commons on 
most pieces of financial legislation. The standing committee on House 
management noted in its April 1993 report on reforming the House that to 
change this confidence convention does not require amendments to the standing 
orders of the House of Commons. Rather it requires a better understanding of 
the rights and responsibilities of individual members and a recognition that 
``Canadians want to feel that their members of Parliament have opportunities to 
vote freely and they expect them to do it more often''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Finally paragraph 1.31 states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A recommendation in April 1993 by the standing committee on House 
management dealt with the convention of confidence. It stated that ``with few 
exceptions, motions proposed by the government should be considered as 
motions of confidence only when clearly identified as such by the 
government''. The committee felt that this, together with deleting some 
references to confidence in the rules of procedure, could help in opening up the 
budget process.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	If we relaxed the confidence convention in this House in 
favour of freer votes, a few government measures including 
spending measures would be defeated. Under the freer vote 
convention we proposed that would not automatically mean 
defeat of the government. If a government measure were 
defeated because a number of government members voted 
against it, that defeated motion would immediately be followed 
by a formal confidence motion. In that vote government 
members would most likely support the government.
<P>
	However by adopting the free vote convention we proposed, 
government backbenchers would have acquired for themselves 
and for this House the right to kill a bill or a portion of a bill 
without killing the government.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1017"> 1017 </A></B>
<P>
	If the House were to support having the Standing Committee 
on Procedure and House Affairs examine and report on this 
institution of freer votes, it has also been suggested that the 
committee should examine how freer votes, freer than the ones 
we have in this Parliament, came about in the British 
Parliament, the mother of Parliaments.
<P>
	I stand to be corrected by members who may have more 
intimate knowledge of the evolution of this practice in the 
British House, but my understanding is that the current free vote 
convention in that Parliament, while not as extensive as the one 
Reformers propose for here, came about not at the initiative of 
the cabinet and not at the initiative of the Prime Minister but at 
the initiative of the backbenchers.
<P>
<B>(1720 ) </B>
<P>
	It is my understanding that some backbenchers in the 
Thatcher government simply decided one day that they would 
vote against a government motion and they told the cabinet so. 
They also told the cabinet: ``We do not want to defeat the 
government. We just want to defeat this bill. If when the bill is 
defeated it is immediately followed by a confidence motion, we 
will support the government''. As one British commentator put 
it: ``After 300 years the backbenchers in the British Parliament 
finally figured out the importance of one simple mathematical 
fact: that there were more of them''.
<P>
	In a democratic chamber in which decisions are ultimately 
made by counting heads that fact ought to count for something. 
We say let not the rank and file members of this House take 300 
years to figure out that there are more of us here than there are 
members of the executive and aspirants to cabinet positions. Let 
us make that fact count for something in the 35th Parliament.
<P>
	I do not want to sound radical like William Lyon Mackenzie, 
but I say: Backbenchers of the House unite, unite behind the 
principle of freer votes. You have nothing to lose but the 
shackles of excessive party discipline.
<P>
	Time does not permit me to elaborate on the contributions 
which greater use of referendums and citizens' initiatives could 
make to enhancing the credibility of Parliament and providing 
this House with a clearer sense of direction on critical issues at 
critical times. Suffice it to say that the country needs a full 
blown referendum law that permits regular consultation of the 
public by national referendum, the results of which would be 
binding on the government of the day.
<P>
	Reformers propose that at each federal election Canadians get 
two ballots, not just one. On one ballot voters would mark their 
choice for a member of Parliament; on the other, a national 
referendum ballot, electors would vote on four or five major 
issues.
<P>
	Because Canadians do not trust governments always to frame 
referendum questions fairly or to permit referendums on issues 
of greatest concern to the public, citizens should have the right 
to force a question or to initiate a question on to a referendum 
ballot if 3 per cent or more of the total electorate were prepared 
to sign a citizens' initiative petition.
<P>
	One major reason we support the motion before the House is 
that its concluding paragraph directs the standing committee to 
examine ways and means to incorporate the results of 
referendums and citizens' initiatives into the legislative acts 
and decisions of the House. Anything which enhances the 
capacity of the House to respond to public direction will 
increase the credibility of Parliament and the trust of Canadians 
in this institution.
<P>
	Finally I want to touch on the institution of recall. The third 
step the House needs to take toward a more truly democratic and 
accountable Parliament for the 21st century is the initiative in 
proposing a mechanism for the recall of its own members if 
members completely lose the confidence of those who have sent 
them here.
<P>
	Chapter II of the standing orders, in particular Standing 
Orders 20, 21 and 23, provides for the House to exercise at least 
some discipline over its members with respect to their conduct, 
their election, their right to hold a seat and unacceptable 
behaviour, such as the acceptance of bribes. The spirit of 
Chapter II would be given some substance if Parliament were to 
pass a law enabling the electors themselves to discipline their 
members for unacceptable behaviour or consistent failure to 
represent constituents' interests.
<P>
	There have been primitive experiments with recall 
mechanisms in this country in the past, mostly at the provincial 
level by at least three different political parties: the old 
Progressive Party, the Social Credit Party and the CCF, which 
was of course the predecessor to the NDP. While none of these 
primitive experiments was successful they provide valuable 
lessons from which modern parliamentarians could learn in 
designing an effective recall mechanism.
<P>
	For example, the recall provisions used by the old Progressive 
Party and by the CCF were for the most part incorporated into 
party constitutions and procedures, not into public laws. They 
were in essence private contracts between a member and a small 
number of voters, usually the party executive or membership in 
the member's riding. These recall mechanisms were subject to 
abuse mainly by ambitious members of the MP's own party and 
brought the mechanism into disrepute.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	The recall mechanism utilized in Alberta in 1936 to which the 
Prime Minister directed the attention of the House the other day 
was incorporated into a public law, but it too had its defects. In 
this case the law was too easily opened to abuse by opposition 
parties and interest groups. For example it contained no 
provision  prohibiting the purchase of signatures for a recall 
petition. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1018"> 1018 </A></B>
<P>
Its first use was marred by this abuse when a group of lawyers in 
Calgary whose politics will remain nameless reportedly offered 
the good citizens of High River up to $5 a signature to sign a 
recall petition against the premier.
<P>
	Incidentally, and I do not think the Prime Minister mentioned 
this the other day, it may be of interest to members to know that 
when the Alberta recall bill was repealed by the Alberta 
legislature it was done by a free vote. The premier at the time, 
William Aberhart, voted against the repeal as did my father who 
was a cabinet minister at the time. The repeal was carried by a 
majority of the backbenchers who considered the bill to be 
defective.
<P>
	Any modern recall mechanism to be considered by the 
standing committee should have three major safeguards based 
on what can be learned from the lessons of the past.
<P>
	It should have a high threshold level. In other words a large 
number of electors would have to sign a recall petition in order 
to recall a member of Parliament and force a by-election. We 
have suggested that the threshold level be 50 per cent plus one of 
the number of electors who voted in the previous general 
election. In the constituency of 
Markham-Whitchurch-Stouffville for example, this would 
mean that almost 37,000 electors would have to sign the recall 
petition in order to trigger the recall of the member of 
Parliament who has lost their confidence.
<P>
	In addition we would propose that except in exceptional 
circumstances such as where it can be demonstrated that a 
member of Parliament made fraudulent representations to 
electors during the general election campaign, recall not be 
available to electors until 18 months after a general election and 
that it be available for use only once in a riding during the term 
of a parliament. This together with the high threshold level 
would largely prevent the politically motivated harassment of 
MPs by their political opponents or by well heeled interest 
groups through abuse of the recall mechanism.
<P>
	While some members of Parliament may ridicule the concept 
of recall I would encourage the more objective among us to do 
one thing. Members should do an informal or formal survey in 
their own ridings to find out what their constituents think about 
these direct democracy measures, the use of referendums and 
citizens' initiatives, freer votes, and the right of recall. I believe 
hon. members will find there is a great deal of public support for 
these measures and whether we like it or not the most popular of 
these three instruments is the right of recall.
<P>
	I close by again commending the government House leader 
and others for bringing forward the proposed changes to the 
standing orders we are discussing today. My only request is that 
we persevere and go three steps further toward making this 
Parliament an even more democratic and accountable institution 
for the 21st century.
<P>
	Reform members look forward with anticipation to the report 
of the standing committee called for by the final paragraph of 
the motion, in particular its recommendations on procedures for 
achieving freer votes, the institution of recall, and the 
incorporation of the results of referendums and citizens' 
initiatives into legislative acts.
<P>
<B>(1730 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
listened to the hon. member often in the last two years as he led a 
political party from relative obscurity to one that certainly holds 
some currency with the Canadian public today. I do respect his 
views, although I may not agree with all of them.
<P>
	The hon. member has done quite a lot, as has his party through 
their political movement to ensure that we just do not heap scorn 
upon those of us who seek to do public service through our 
respective legislatures but by raising some real issues. 
Sometimes institutions change very slowly. As a young member 
of Parliament I can tell the hon. member that much of which he 
speaks I have supported and I will continue to support.
<P>
	The whole concept of why we are here, whether it is to serve 
our party, our political masters within the party or our 
constituents, I am sure is one that each member of Parliament 
has had to deal with at some point since this country was formed. 
It is a matter of compromise and it is a matter of balance.
<P>
	We have a party system. It means that within our party 
structures we try to draw a consensus on major issues. To have a 
complete lack of any discipline within the caucus system, I 
would put forward, would lead to some anarchy and perhaps 
some extreme forms of legislation, coming as the member 
would say from the executive. I think there is a balance.
<P>
	However, I do agree that excessive discipline has been used in 
this place and in political parties for far too long. It has caused 
an abuse of the privileges of members who come here to speak 
on behalf of their constituents.
<P>
	I want to ask the leader of the Reform Party if he believes 
there is a happy medium between complete direct democracy for 
every member and the party discipline system. I have noticed in 
the few votes we have had in this House that it appears that 
either they are birds of a feather flocking together or-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. I think the member has 
the question.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1019"> 1019 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question. I want to acknowledge that none of us have a 
monopoly on the concept of parliamentary reform. There are 
members here who have advocated many of these changes for 
years and I certainly want to pay tribute to them.
<P>
	With respect to the member's question, yes, I would say that 
what we are trying to do is to find a happy balance. We are not 
talking about going from excessive party discipline to a House 
of 295 independents whose voting and policy record would be 
completely unpredictable.
<P>
	We are trying to get a balance among three things. There is the 
mandate theory of representation, that when members stand up 
here they represent the mandate they got from their electors. 
There is the trusteeship theory of representation, that when 
members stand up here they represent their own views and their 
own judgment that they bring to bear on public issues. There is 
also the delegate theory that when members stand up here they 
also represent the interests and views of the people who sent 
them here.
<P>
	I am suggesting we have to get a balance among those three. If 
push comes to shove, in my view the will of the constituents 
should prevail over my personal view or my party's view, and 
the standing orders of this House should facilitate that kind of a 
balance.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I find it very interesting the member would indicate 
that the recall mechanism is the highest priority of the public 
today. Coming from the east coast I would have to disagree.
<P>
	However, I would like for him to explain from where he gets 
his statistical data that he dare make a statement that it rates 
such a priority.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for her 
question. I might not have made myself as clear as I should have. 
I was not saying that recall was the most important thing in the 
minds of Canadian voters. I was saying that if asked about these 
direct democracy measures, referenda, citizens' initiative, freer 
votes and recall, at either public meetings or through surveys we 
have always found recall to be the highest priority of those four 
direct democracy measures.
<P>
	I think in a way it is a reflection of the public's cynicism and 
mistrust of our institutions and an attempt to do something to 
correct it.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, to the Leader of the Opposition or who would like to be, 
that would be fair to say would it not, I would like to ask the 
leader of the Reform Party about the referendum idea. I am quite 
concerned. On the surface it sounds very nice and appealing to 
some people. However, on examination it is far too simplistic. 
This is part of my question, but I must share a little of this 
rationale.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I would remind the hon. member and 
perhaps other members as well that I am reminded by our boss 
that questions are to go through the Chair rather than directly to 
the member.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Chamberlain:</B> Mr. Speaker, in a referendum we have 
very solid views from Canadians from different parts of the 
country but they have had no opportunity to debate as we do 
here. I believe that part of our reason for being here is to have the 
opportunity for dialogue and to exchange views, to find out the 
rights and wrongs about things we would not have thought about 
perhaps if we were sitting in our living rooms at home reading a 
newspaper, watching the TV and getting all kinds of media 
reports.
<P>
	There are good and bad sides to everything. Without that 
debate we would get a very cold, clinical, solid view in a 
referendum. I am quite concerned about that kind of push 
driving referendums. I would like to hear the opinion of the 
leader of the Reform Party on that.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. I think the question is 
clear enough.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her 
question and for that brief promotion to Official Opposition 
leader.
<P>
	I agree with the thinking behind the hon. member's question 
that unless there is an educational component and intelligent 
public debate that goes along with referenda that they are not as 
effective a mechanism for decision making as they should be.
<P>
	What most countries that have extensive referendum 
legislation provide for such as Switzerland and others is for the 
establishment of educational committees or promotional 
committees to thoroughly advocate the various sides of the 
issue. Certainly that ought to be part of any national referendum 
bill so that the decision made by people is an intelligent decision 
made on options that are presented not just something based 
solely on what they get from the media.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand-Norfolk):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
take a little longer than 15 seconds. As a member who has 
actually voted against my party on three separate 
occasions-actually my party voted against me once-I have 
always considered my votes in this House as a free vote and you 
will notice where I am sitting.
<P>
	I know that when I am elected that approximately 80 or 85 per 
cent of the people elect the party and not the individual member. 
Every time I stand up and try to express the view of my 
constituents that might be a little different from that of the party 
I always keep that in mind, knowing I represent a group that has 
elected me as a member of a party.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1020"> 1020 </A></B>
<P>
	I wonder in this debate how he can reconcile that with more 
free votes. I have a problem every time I do that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the member's 
question and the dilemma that freer votes can create in that 
respect.
<P>
	What I am saying, and I am sure this is the member's 
experience, that issues will come along where the party line is 
quite clear and he is absolutely aware that his constituents on 
that particular issue want him to do something different than his 
party. In other words, I am not talking now about general support 
for his party. I am talking abut whether the public supports him 
standing up and voting in favour of some measure put forward 
by his party with which his constituents disagree.
<P>
	We are suggesting that the free vote convention should be 
flexible enough to permit him to vote the way his constituents 
wish in that conflict situation and for him not to be subject to 
censor by his party or accused of being a radical or a dissident by 
the media. That would be my response.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
follow up on what my colleague from Haldimand-Norfolk said 
to the member for Calgary Southwest. When the member for 
Calgary Southwest talks about freer votes, referendums and 
recall, I ask this question. I was one of the promoters of what we 
are talking about today, free votes and more freedom to the 
committees and things like that. I have no problem with recall if 
that is what comes out of this. I have been recalled many times. 
However, I believe that if we do not vote the way our 
constituents want us to we do not have to worry about that very 
long either.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	However, in all sincerity, if we do what we are talking about, 
about opening this place up and making it freer in every respect 
that we can, will that not in itself take care of many of the 
problems we are talking about today?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, the short answer to the member's 
question is yes, up to a point. But just having freer debate or 
freer discussion in my view is not enough. It has to be carried 
that one step further where if, as a result of the discussion here, 
one comes to a conclusion somewhat different than one's party 
or one's constituents come to, that one would have the freedom 
to exercise it.
<P>
	Certainly this greater freedom of debate and expression is a 
step in the right direction, but to cap it off there has to be some 
application to the voting as well as the speaking.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, because 
this is such an important issue and we have the leader of the 
Reform Party who spent many hours and years working on this 
issue maybe we could have the unanimous consent of the House 
to continue questions.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is it agreed not to see the clock for 
three more people to pose questions?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I take it there is unanimous consent. Is 
there with the Reform Party?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yes.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Very well. The three members who 
were standing up can, with unanimous consent, put their 
questions but please do it briefly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sympathetic and support many 
of the hon. member's recommendations. There are some that I 
do not support, but I have real concern when he puts this 
emphasis on always listening to the popular view of our 
constituents.
<P>
	I have not always shared the popular view of my constituents. 
In fact I will give a specific example. When I started off 
opposing the Charlottetown accord, for the first two weeks of 
the campaign there were many of my constituents who did not 
share my view. Over a period of time many came around.
<P>
	The member does not realize that in this Chamber we have to 
deal with national issues that do not just concern the people of 
our riding but we have to make a judgment call and be sensitive 
to all regions and all concerns of other members in this House.
<P>
	I do not always believe it is the popular view of our ridings 
that should drive us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, I should make clear to the 
member that I am not talking about turning members of 
Parliament into a voting machine where all they do is go home 
on the weekend, count noses on an issue and come back here and 
stick up their hands or not. I am not talking about that.
<P>
	I agree with the member that there are lots of issues where the 
relationship between the member and his constituents has to be 
one of dialogue. The constituents may think this way and we go 
to them and say that we think differently because we have had 
this experience and have been exposed to this debate from others 
in the House.
<P>
	My experience has been that if our constituents think that we 
will defer to their judgment if push came to shove they will often 
defer to ours. However, if they think we are going to do what we 
want to do or what our party wants to do regardless of what they 
think, then that is where we lose them.
<P>
	I agree with the member there has to be dialogue, but I do 
think if push comes to shove the constituents ought to have the 
final say.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1021"> 1021 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Ontario):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank 
the hon. member for Calgary Southwest for his rather 
enlightening comment on what the Reform Party's position 
would be with respect to recall.
<P>
<B>(1745 ) </B>
<P>
	This reminds any budding student of history of the famous 
debate that took place some two centuries ago in the 1790s when 
the member for Bristol in England in the other Parliament 
discussed the various pros and cons of the system which the 
member, some generations later, has just suggested.
<P>
	My concern to the hon. member is that it seems very clear that 
the system the member proposes is not only cumbersome, it 
could very well be costly. If he stops to consider that if 50 per 
cent of the signatures are required in any one constituency, what 
is the cost that is going to be attributed to that very taxpayer in 
terms of determining whether or not those are valid signatures?
<P>
	The second part of that would be simply the cumbersome 
nature of having that kind of a system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, two or three points. I thank the 
member for his question. First of all, on recall if you set these 
safeguards high enough and strongly enough you can ensure that 
the instrument is not abused so it is not accessibly costly.
<P>
	On the second point, I would ask the members to consider the 
cost of having an unacceptable member of Parliament who will 
not or cannot represent your views. That is the cost you have to 
offset against the cost a removal mechanism.
<P>
	The third point I would make is the member made reference, 
and other members in this House have done this, to the famous 
speech by Edmund Burke in which he said that he owed his 
constituents his conscience, not his vote. This is the most 
articulate expression, the trusteeship theory of representation. It 
predated the existence of parties. The other thing the members 
should remember is that Edmund Burke was never elected again 
in the electoral district of Bristol.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Murray Calder 
(Wellington-Grey-Dufferin-Simcoe):</B> Mr. Speaker, with 
the discussion we are having here on free vote, there has to be a 
common ground between free vote and responsible government.
<P>
	There is a beautiful example south of the border which is 
predominantly free vote. On different issues I have watched and 
read in the newspaper, we have seen shameless vote buying.
<P>
	What I would like to know right now is where the leader of the 
Reform Party thinks the common ground is between free vote 
and responsible government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for that 
question. He hits on a very pertinent point. I believe this free 
vote convention that we have suggested covers that common 
ground. It gives the members the freedom to kill a bill or a 
portion of a bill, but when they do that  it reverts back to asking 
the House if it wanted to kill this bill or this portion of a bill, or 
did it actually want to kill the entire administration because it 
has no confidence it it.
<P>
	That free vote convention covers that common ground. It 
gives the members this individual capacity to kill an individual 
piece of legislation but ultimately also makes them accountable 
for the entire administration and it accountable to them. I 
thought this free vote convention we are proposing endeavoured 
to cover that common ground.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I thank members for co-operating. The 
time has long ago expired. With unanimous consent I will now 
go back to debate.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Catterall (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is a very 
important debate we are having and it is going to be extremely 
difficult and frustrating for me to be limited to 10 minutes.
<P>
	For the last 20 years of my life I have been practising 
participatory democracy first as a municipal politician and more 
recently in Parliament. I have dedicated most of my political 
career to opening up the processes of government, to making it 
more truly representative of the views of the people I represent 
and more broadly of the views of Canadians and their 
communities. I would love to debate at length why I disagree 
fundamentally with the member for Calgary Southwest, the 
leader of the Reform Party.
<P>
	Let me come to the subject of this particular bill before us 
because as I see the context of this bill, for nine years we have 
had a government that fundamentally did not believe in the role 
of government in society and therefore had a great deal of 
difficulty governing well and had a great deal of difficulty 
governing with respect for the people of Canada and their 
opinions.
<P>
<B>(1750 ) </B>
<P>
	I heard many times in the House: ``We have to make tough 
decisions and if they do not like us they can throw us out at the 
next election''. I do not believe that democracy begins and ends 
at the ballot box. It is something that goes on every day. It is the 
relationship between an individual member of Parliament and 
their constituents, it is a relationship between the institution of 
Parliament and all Canadians.
<P>
	This motion in my view is a significant step forward in that 
relationship not because how we conduct our affairs in this 
Chamber or in our committees is of great overwhelming 
importance to Canadians, they really are not interested in our 
standing orders, but they are interested in what our decision 
making process is and how their views count in that process.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1022"> 1022 </A></B>
<P>
	Substantial portions of that bill will allow them to see openly 
and transparently how this House and how this government 
reach the decisions that will affect how much they contribute to 
their society, how it is used and how that will affect much of the 
pattern of their lives as Canadians. What it will allow us to do 
individually is to have a more of an input in that process and also 
to get more out of it.
<P>
	I do not come here only to represent my constituents. I do not 
come here thinking that the views of Ottawa West should 
determine what should happen to the country. I come here to be 
part of building a nation on their behalf, certainly to represent 
their interests. The development of this wonderful nation called 
Canada is in their interest as well. I listen to the people from all 
parts of this country, from different kinds of communities. 
Together, certainly in my caucus, we try to come up with what 
we think is best for the country and best for its people.
<P>
	I hope that with these more open processes of members of 
Parliament being able to work together in committees to develop 
legislation, to consult openly with Canadians, Canadians will 
feel and will truly have a more active voice in that decision 
making if they choose to exercise that. They will also have 
members of Parliament able to engage more actively and 
dynamically in the exchange of views that allows to build 
consensus, not only about the specific problems and actions that 
we are confronted with but about a longer term vision for the 
country.
<P>
	We will always have differences of opinions on what those 
directions are. At least I hope with the measures we are taking 
today when we complete our work here in Parliament, a new 
program, that it will better serve the interests of our individual 
constituents and the country because we have looked at all 
aspects of it, we have considered all points of view and we have 
done that wonderful thing of not letting one point of view 
prevail over all others, but of finding that accommodation of 
many different points of view.
<P>
	I want to touch on one thing. As some of the members in this 
House know, my role in the last Parliament was as critic on 
public service issues. I want to say one thing that I think is going 
to become increasingly important. That is going to be 
developing not only a House and committees but a government 
in the broadest sense of including the public service that is also 
more consultative, more open and more capable of balancing 
those many different interests in society, making good decisions 
and recommending to us as government and as parliamentarians 
good decisions.
<P>
	I know, having seen the transformation over a period of years 
in municipal government to a more participative democracy, to 
quote a famous Canadian, that it takes time for the public service 
to see the wisdom of the people as a useful input to decision 
making. I know it is  going to be difficult for them. I know it is 
going to be a challenge.
<P>
<B>(1755 ) </B>
<P>
	I encourage them to go along with Parliament on this trip to a 
more democratic society and to see it as a positive step forward 
for how the public service functions as well.
<P>
	I have only a few minutes left but I do want to touch on a few 
things. I want to touch on the issue of free votes. This is the 
beginning of a debate that will come back to us.
<P>
	It is very easy for me to know what the constituents who 
phone or write to me on a subject or respond to a questionnaire 
think. Do I really know what my constituents think when I know 
the poorest members of society have less access to being able to 
respond and participate in a public debate?
<P>
	Do I have a responsibility to know that even though some 
people in my constituency are relatively voiceless without the 
money to organize, their views are, nonetheless, important and 
how they are affected is important? Yes, I do.
<P>
	Do I have the audacity to say that on any given vote in this 
House I know what my constituents think? I do not think so. I 
know what a small sample of my constituents think.
<P>
	I also have to know in much broader terms who my 
constituents are. I need to be in touch with them in a variety of 
ways and to absorb into myself what the many different 
concerns and preoccupations they have are so that I can bring all 
of those to bear as well as what I hear from fellow 
parliamentarians when I make a decision.
<P>
	Do I believe in recall? Let me say that I have been married for 
31 years. I am sure there have been hundreds if not thousands of 
days in those 31 years when my husband thought his life would 
be better off without this woman in it. On those days, he would 
have chosen to divorce me.
<P>
	However, on balance of those more than 10,000 days, both of 
us would say that there has been more good than bad and a lot of 
in between. We are glad that we did not have the easy escape 
hatch, that we are prepared to live with the balance of the good 
and bad. There is a lot of that in democracy.
<P>
	On any given day I may displease my constituents. My 
government my displease my constituents. On balance, I hope 
they will weigh both the positive and the less positive and not 
look at only their momentary self-interest when they decide 
whether I and my government have done a good job or not.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey):</B> Mr. Speaker, to the 
member for Ottawa West, the leader of the Reform Party said 
that there was almost a form of recall when he said that Burke 
never got re-elected.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1023"> 1023 </A></B>
<P>
	One thing that concerns me as a new member of Parliament is 
that all of us, for whatever reason, want to reinvent laws, rules 
and regulations.
<P>
	I will come to my question. I want to make a quick preamble 
here.
<P>
	General Robert made rules. We have a book of rules here and 
there are other things. I come from a municipal council where 
we stopped reading bylaws simply because what happened in the 
old days was that some people could not read. Sometimes they 
only had one written part and one had to read those things clause 
by clause. Now we have the electronic media and we have to fine 
tune it. That is what the government is trying to do.
<P>
	What bothers me in this place both with the committee work 
and with its rules and regulations and talking about laws is that 
we are spinning our wheels. We spend a lot of time at it. 
Somehow members of Parliament always want to do something 
and they think doing something is changing the rules. I know 
that rules are for making something happen.
<P>
	I want to ask the member for Ottawa West, how do we 
reconcile the permanent government, which is the civil service, 
integrating with the rules and regulations we have? We make a 
rule in committee, and it has been done before. I have seen this 
kind of thing as a mayor when six members of council asked the 
administrator to do six different jobs. They spin their wheels and 
never get anything done.
<P>
	How do we reconcile making a committee function properly 
with the civil servants who are there? How could we make that 
better by using these kinds of rules?
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Catterall:</B> This dilemma is not easy and I think the hon. 
member knows that the permanent public service as he calls it 
can be very resistant to change if it does not agree with it at first. 
Let me tell the hon. member what I have seen over the five years 
I have been here and how I think it has to change.
<P>
	I have seen officials come before committees as they are 
required to do to defend the position the government has put 
forward. Unfortunately that position has often been developed 
in the secrecy of cabinet without the open consultation and 
discussion we are talking about here.
<P>
	When we say we are going to send the concept of a bill to a 
committee for discussion so that the committee can consult with 
and hear the views of people who will be affected by the issue, 
that leaves our officials freer to bring forward options for a 
committee to consider. That is going to be a change for them. It 
is going to take some time for them to understand they are not 
defending a particular position and that they are free to advise 
the committee on options and on the implications of those 
options.
<P>
	It also means that members of Parliament must have a new 
relationship of respect and trust with the public service. It is not 
the defender of the government now. It is working with members 
of Parliament and the committee to help make a good bill.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Before recognizing the hon. member 
for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell there are three people left to 
speak. We have 22 minutes. I wonder if there would be a 
disposition to give eight minutes to each of the members and not 
have questions and comments. Is that agreeable? I take it it is not 
agreeable to do it that way and I call on the member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it gives me pleasure this afternoon to have the 
opportunity to speak on the motion before the House to amend 
our rules.
<P>
	We are amending the rules pursuant to a commitment made by 
our party during the last election campaign when we put out a 
program to Canadians. They voted for that program which 
included a number of things on Parliament. It mentioned 
allowing more free votes, giving MPs a greater role in drafting 
legislation, giving more power to House of Commons 
committees and involving the public in consultation before 
important legislation was introduced.
<P>
	Many of these issues have been done already. The others are 
in the motion we are debating today. That is what it is all about. 
This is part of the program I and all Liberal candidates stood for 
in the last election campaign.
<P>
	I want to advance the proposition to all members today that it 
is untrue to state at the present time there are no free votes. As a 
matter of fact a very successful argument can be made that all 
votes in this Parliament are free. I say it for the following reason 
and I am not saying we do not need to improve our system. After 
all we are proposing to do just that today.
<P>
	Nevertheless as a member of Parliament I have the power to 
make an accusation against any citizen of Canada in this House 
and I could never be sued in a court of law for saying it. I have 
the ultimate freedom in this Chamber on behalf of the people 
who sent me here to say anything, anything at all. I, though, 
must live with the consequences of that which I say in this House 
once I leave this House. Nevertheless, I still have that freedom. I 
as a member of Parliament together with my colleagues have the 
freedom to defeat my government in a non-confidence motion.
<P>
	Did the people of the United States have a tool like that in the 
Watergate scandal? Do they not wish they had had something 
like that? The process for getting rid of a president that country 
no longer wanted and Congress no longer wanted dragged on for 
months and months before the United States Congress. It would 
take about six minutes to do that in the House of Commons 
today.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1024"> 1024 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	We talk about freedom and powers that MPs have and do not 
have. Maybe MPs do not use all the power they have, but they 
have power in this House and to state the opposite is simply 
incorrect.
<P>
	We are talking about recall in this whole business. Does 
anyone realize what the whole process of recall would do to the 
freedom of a member of Parliament? If I were under threat from 
my own riding association for leaving my party to be recalled 
and lose my seat in Parliament, would that give me more 
freedom as an MP? No, that would mean I would be subject to 
even greater pressure from my colleagues. How much of that has 
been considered by those proposing recall? I submit not much 
thinking went into that particular proposition.
<P>
	We are talking about voting only as it reflects the aspirations 
of our constituents. I have been elected to this place three times, 
to the provincial legislature of my province once, to municipal 
council three times. I was fortunate and blessed by having 
received the support of my electors on seven different occasions 
in my life. I think I have done a few things which people might 
consider controversial. I have not always voted according to the 
wishes of the majority of my constituents.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I think you will have some understanding for this 
but I voted against abortion in this House. Was that the 
reflection of the majority of my constituents? Probably not. 
When I voted against capital punishment was that according to 
the wishes of the majority of my constituents? Probably not. 
And when I made very strong pronouncements against 
euthanasia probably the same logic applies.
<P>
	However in every case I made copies of my speeches and sent 
them to every single constituent in my riding. I stood by what I 
had said and stood there to be judged later by my constituents 
about what I had said. That is what it is all about. It is being 
accountable to those who sent us here and not necessarily always 
voting in the manner that 50.1 per cent of the people advocate.
<P>
	We are debating changing the rules of this House, rules that 
have existed in one form or another and in this Parliament or the 
mother of Parliaments for probably about 1,500 years dating 
from the period of Saxon-Wettins through the Norman invasion 
of Britain and then through all the changes that occurred. Then 
there are those forms we have adopted here and modified for our 
own use. We have to remember that there is a reason those rules 
have evolved. Yes, they can be updated. Yes, they can be 
improved. Yes, they can be modernized. Yes, they can be 
liberalized. Yes, we can do all those things to those rules. But let 
us remember why they are there.
<P>
	On the confidence convention, I saw someone resurrecting the 
ghost of William Lyon Mackenzie earlier today. Is that not 
interesting. William Lyon Mackenzie and Louis Joseph 
Papineau both fought for the institution of responsible 
government. Both fought for  the institution whereby there 
would be confidence votes so that the government could be 
accountable to the legislature. The member for Calgary 
Southwest had the right argument but was making it in reverse, 
unless I have totally forgotten everything I learned in history 
and I do not believe that I have.
<P>
	I say that having a system known as responsible government 
means to have a vote of confidence. It means ultimately that the 
government in this Chamber is accountable to all of us, where at 
one point we can all say or have the right to say that we can turf 
the government out right in here. That is an ultimate power few 
legislators have. What does it do? What kind of pressure does 
that put on our government, to say that it has to be accountable to 
all of us, that all of us have that great power over the 
government? I suggest to you that it can make government listen 
to those who were sent here to represent the people of this great 
country.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	Let us change this institution, let us modernize it, but let us be 
careful as well that we do not destroy it in our zeal to make it 
better.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu):</B> Mr. Speaker, let me 
congratulate the member on his speech. I cannot wait to see if he 
will say the same thing in a month or two, when the Minister of 
Finance will have presented his budget, when he will have 
tabled a bill changing the unemployment insurance program, 
when he will have modified projects in a way that will totally 
run counter to what he advocated when he was sitting here on the 
opposition side and, defending his principles, shouted down the 
government.
<P>
	Will he have the same courage then? Will he uphold the same 
principles? When one crosses the floor of the House, one 
generally receives a sort of electrical jolt and sometimes red 
books, like the one you mentioned earlier, become blue. That is 
why I am eager to see what will happen; I certainly urge the 
member to stick to what he just said.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, since I do not have a good 
memory for historical events in this House, the member 
opposite certainly remembers the blue books better than I do. 
After all, he is the one who sat as a Tory in the House, not me.
<P>
	Nevertheless, I do not claim that-and I do not want the 
member to suggest that I do-my government, the Canadian 
government will never be at fault and will make no mistake. Of 
course not. Nobody is perfect. What is important to know is 
whether the government is acting in the best interests of 
Canadians, not whether it is going to give a new grant to my 
riding or to that of the member opposite. The government is here 
for the common good, and I know that our Prime Minister, our 
government, intend to do just that. As I said before, if the 
government does not behave in a fair, honourable and account-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1025"> 1025 </A></B>
<P>
able  way, the House has the power to exercise the many 
prerogatives it has.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member justified voting against the wishes of his constituents 
on the basis that they could judge him at election time. But the 
hon. member knows that there are many issues that come before 
the House during a session and that it is unreasonable for him to 
say that they could judge him on one or other issue of the 
hundreds that come before us.
<P>
	Can the member not see that by picking and choosing when 
his personal beliefs will interfere with his representation of the 
people who elected him, that he is taking an elitist attitude to the 
people who elected him.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member may think I am an 
elitist. I find the comment rather odd as I came from the most 
humble beginnings to take my seat in Parliament. As the 
member gets to know me he will learn about that. The last thing I 
have ever been called is elitist as I will describe to him privately 
later. But that is certainly not the case.
<P>
	The proposition I am advancing to the member is that 
governments have to be accountable, MPs have to be 
accountable for what they say. That does not mean they cannot 
consult with their electors all the time. But it also means another 
thing; that if members do not have discipline as a party, no 
obligation to live with the program their party makes, either the 
one that I present or the one the member presented to the 
Canadian people, then surely the freedom he is advocating could 
also be used to go against the collective wishes of those who sent 
him here in the belief that within his own constituency there 
would be half or 1 or 2 or 3 per cent of the people more against 
the program of his own party than those who are for it. That is 
the caution I want to give the hon. member.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island):</B> Mr. Speaker, I join in this very 
historic debate today. I believe we are at a crossroads in this 
country.
<P>
	I found it rather interesting and almost amusing to hear people 
on the other side talk about what a wonderful breakthrough this 
is, that we are debating things before we actually decide them. I 
asked: ``Has it never been the case before?'' I am new to the 
political process. I did not even belong to a political party before 
I became involved very recently.
<P>
	I am astounded to find that what I dealt with during the 
election campaign is actually true, that for the most part our 
democracy is very inclusive. It is inclusive among a very small 
number of people. I applaud the government for the steps it is 
taking. It is wonderful we are having this debate, that we are 
looking forward to actually producing and having some 
changes, not just talk, but some actual changes.
<P>
	We need to reform the democratic process. It occurred to me 
while I was sitting here that perhaps we are observing an 
oxymoron. We are having a liberalization and a reform of the 
democratic process, two very different words and yet to a great 
extent we are heading in the same direction.
<P>
	I believe that one of the reasons we have so much mistrust of 
politicians is that our democracy works only in spurts. We have 
a spurt of involvement of the people at election time and then 
they are ignored until the next election. Consequently people 
mistrust the politicians because they detect and observe no 
ongoing accountability.
<P>
	There is an interesting statement in the red book which is so 
oft quoted in this Chamber. It really is not surprising that it 
should be in the book. The Reform Party and my involvement in 
it came as a result of this ``new emphasis in listening to the 
people, the constituents, the voters and the taxpayers''.
<P>
	When we listened to the taxpayers we found out among other 
things that there was a great deal of mistrust and distrust because 
of lack of consultation. The Liberal Party in its work to get 
elected did a good thing also. It began listening to the people. It 
probably did it through its polling techniques or whatever, but it 
heard the same message we heard that gave birth to our party and 
it was that people want to be involved on an ongoing basis in the 
decisions of government.
<P>
	The quote I would like to take from the red book is: ``The 
people are irritated with governments that do not consult them 
or that try to conduct key parts of the public business behind 
closed doors''. That is the truth which we are reaching for here.
<P>
	I pledge, and I am sure that I speak on behalf of all the 
members of my party, that we are going to work together to 
enhance not only the ease with which Parliament works but also 
with its accountability to the people.
<P>
	In that regard I would like to address for a few minutes a very 
important aspect of our work in representing the constituents, 
those that elected us. There is a lot of fear among 
politicians-and maybe I am wrong here-in talking on an 
ongoing basis with the electors and truly representing them. I 
hear over and over innuendo that they are not to be trusted, that 
perhaps they do not have enough ability, enough education, 
enough sense of history, enough perspective or maybe they are 
too narrow and they think only of themselves and so they cannot 
be involved on an ongoing basis.

<P>
	I read very recently an essay written by Woodrow Wilson 
which I think is very illustrative. I would like to read just one 
short section. He said: ``Today when our government has so far 
passed into the hands of special interests, today when the 
doctrine is implicitly avowed that only select classes have the 
equipment necessary for carrying on government, today when so 
many conscientious citizens smitten with the scene of social 
wrong and suffering have fallen victims to the fallacy that 
benevolent government can be meted out to the people by 
kind-hearted trustees of prosperity and guardians of the welfare 
of dutiful employees, today supremely does it behove this nation 
to remember that a people shall be saved by the power that 
sleeps in its own deep bosom or by none, shall be renewed in 
hope, in conscience, in strength by waters welling up from its 
own sweet perennial springs, not from above, not by patronage 
of its aristocrats. The flower does not bear the root but the root 
the flower''.
<P>
	In conjunction with this I believe that we should pay a great 
deal of attention to the concept of referendum to the people on 
important issues. We all recognize that as legislators here we 
represent a broader constituency than just our own home 
constituency. I also speak for Canada. I long to keep this country 
together. I think I speak on behalf of my constituents when I 
voice those sentiments.
<P>
	However we also need to recognize that on many issues our 
people are well informed and with an informed debate can 
become more informed and thereby give us real valid input, 
even to the point of having a referendum.
<P>
	I would also like to indicate that sometimes ordinary citizens 
feel totally left out of the process. There is something that they 
want done. Government will not hear them. It seems to me wise 
as a back-up, probably used very infrequently, that we have a 
method of citizens' initiative which will allow the citizens 
themselves to place on a referendum ballot a question which is 
to be answered and which is to be binding.
<P>
	I recognize that my time is fast disappearing. I would like to 
simply say that on the mechanisms of referendum and of 
citizens' initiative we have done a lot of work in developing 
them. I do not have time now to go into those details, but they do 
work, they can work, they do work in other parts of the world. I 
believe it would greatly enhance the democracy of this country 
if we were to incorporate those as well.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CIGARETTESMUGGLING">CIGARETTE SMUGGLING</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the 
Standing Orders allow for the ``late show'' or the adjournment 
motion, we can come back to a question raised in the House. I 
therefore take the four minutes which the Standing Orders allow 
me to use to return to the question which the Prime Minister was 
asked on January 21, 1994, when I asked why his Minister of 
Indian Affairs spoke of setting up a system of native 
self-government, although in his government program and his 
political speeches, the Prime Minister still said that there was no 
more room for constitutional negotiations.
<P>
	In his answer, the Prime Minister said that it was not certain 
whether negotiating native self-government required amending 
the Constitution or not.
<P>
	Now, all constitutional experts agree that it is necessary to 
amend the Constitution and the Prime Minister himself said that 
a committee was studying the matter and would report on it. So 
if a committee is about to report, why does his minister say that 
he wants to open negotiations right away, when he does not even 
know if he needs the provinces' consent or if he must open the 
constitutional issue to do so?
<P>
	What is surprising is that, in the second question I asked him, 
the Prime Minister said that the Minister for Foreign Affairs 
would be very happy to answer in a debate. He said, ``I have 
nothing to add to the statement I made earlier. Our ambition is to 
treat everyone equally in Canada, and that is why we believe that 
everyone is equal in this country and no one has special status''.
<P>
	The Prime Minister said that after his minister announced that 
he was ready to open constitutional negotiations with natives on 
their right to self-government. Despite claiming to support his 
minister, the Prime Minister said that he did not want to give 
special status to any province or nation, such as the Quebec 
nation or the aboriginal peoples.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="1027"> 1027 </A></B>
<P>
	This glaring contradiction brings me to the question I am 
raising in the House today to get more details through his 
parliamentary secretary. But I also want to invoke the reasons 
given by the minister to justify opening these negotiations to 
recognize the right of natives to self-government. The minister 
was doing it in the name of better economic management.
<P>
	If it is in the natives' interest to administer their own affairs, 
why would the same principle not also apply to the people of 
Quebec who happen to be one of the founding nations and who, 
like the other founding people, namely the aboriginal people, 
aspire to manage their own affairs? It is in the name of this very 
principle of better economic management and not to wage a flag 
war against the rest of Canada or to break up a country but to 
build one, like any free nation in the world has done. I think that 
since the Second World War, 65 new nations have emerged with 
all attendant rights.
<P>
	Our guiding principle is this: let us collect our own taxes. Let 
us manage our own affairs and then buy the services we need 
jointly with the sovereign countries around us. That is how we 
want to act with natives. In fact, the minister was talking about 
opening the Constitution in the same sense that we also want to 
open it, in the sense of managing our own affairs.
<P>
	It is strange to see the Prime Minister saying two different 
things, talking from both sides of his mouth about a founding 
people, namely the aboriginal people, and about the other 
founding people, namely the people of Quebec. It is in that sense 
that I would like the parliamentary secretary to the Prime 
Minister to answer pursuant to the Standing Orders for two 
minutes to elaborate on the government's precise position.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will respond to the member's question 
of January 21, 1994, when the member for Richelieu asked the 
Prime Minister a question regarding native self-government 
and the Constitution.
<P>
	Let me begin by saying that the Prime Minister has stated 
unequivocally in this House and elsewhere that the priority of 
the government is job creation and not the Constitution.
<P>
	The Liberal position on the nature of self-government was 
made clear in the red book. We said that the inherent right of 
self-government is an existing aboriginal and treaty right. To 
that extent the federal government is involved in a series of 
meetings with national and regional aboriginal leaders, 
provincial and territorial governments and other parties.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	The Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples interim report 
said it was possible to implement native self-government 
without changing the Constitution. That is what we are working 
on at this point in the discussion.  I hope this satisfies the 
member's questions which seem to have gone beyond his 
question of January 21.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TOBACCOPRODUCTS">TOBACCO PRODUCTS</A></H4>
	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to refer to a question I asked the 
Minister of Health on February 1, 1994 as to whether she was 
prepared to stand up for the health of Canadians on the question 
of the government's proposed policy of lowering taxes on 
cigarettes.
<P>
	The real question today is who sets tax policy and who 
defends health care policy in this country?
<P>
	First of all on the question of who sets tax policy, Canadians 
are wondering whether it is the law breakers or the cigarette 
companies.
<P>
	I must say the government certainly has some connections 
with cigarette companies such as that with Imasco, for example, 
which is the parent company of Imperial Tobacco. The Minister 
of Finance was formerly a member of the board. In 1992 Imasco 
donated $47,477.30 to the Liberal Party of Canada. Canadians 
are wondering whether the cigarette manufacturers are setting 
tax policy.
<P>
	Is it the provinces and territories? It would seem it is not the 
provinces and territories in conjunction with the federal 
government because the provinces and territorial health 
ministers are meeting tomorrow. The government has said it will 
state its intention on this matter tomorrow before that meeting is 
completed.
<P>
	The Minister of Health in her response to my question said she 
was concerned about health. She did not answer as to whether as 
Minister of Health she would stand up for the health of 
Canadians and advocate that cigarette taxes not be lowered.
<P>
	Rather, she said that she was very concerned about the high 
level of tobacco use among young people. I suggest to the 
Minister of Health that she might have cited the Statistics 
Canada study which indicates there was a direct decrease in 
consumption of tobacco products by teens as the price went up. 
However the minister refused to say where she stood on this 
issue.
<P>
	I would say also it is clear that the direct health cost results of 
lowering the tax will place a further burden on the provinces. 
Today there is a news release from the British Columbia health 
minister which states tobacco related illness is estimated to cost 
British Columbia nearly $1 billion annually.
<P>
	I would also ask as I did on February 1 whether this 
government is prepared to compensate provinces and territories 
for increased health costs as a result of decreased cost of tobacco 
products.
<P>
	It is clear that the use of tobacco is a very high contributor 
both to the health costs of Canadians and alas to the death of 
Canadians with some 37,000 Canadians a year dying as a result 
<P>

<B><A NAME="1028"> 1028 </A></B>
<P>
of tobacco use. In fact, a recent survey on selected causes of 
preventable death indicated that tobacco was number one far 
outweighing traffic  accidents, suicides, AIDS, homicides, fires, 
accidental poisoning and undetermined deaths. The relationship 
between tobacco use, health care costs and indeed the life and 
death of Canadians has been shown clearly.
<P>
	I would appreciate hearing what the government proposes to 
do in terms of the health of Canadians and whether Canadians 
are going to have a Minister of Health who advocates both 
within the cabinet and this House of Commons for the health of 
Canadians and takes that responsibility seriously .
<P>
	In view of the fact that in the next couple of years we will be 
undergoing a very comprehensive review of health care and 
health care costs, it does not augur well that we have a Minister 
of Health who would not stand up for the health of Canadians, 
but chose to be evasive and not to answer the questions on this 
issue.
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Susan Whelan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of National Revenue):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am to respond to the 
question of February 1 and that is what I will do.
<P>
	Research indicates that at least 38,000 die each year as a result 
of tobacco related diseases. These deaths reflect smoking 
behaviours of more than two decades ago when the risks of 
smoking were less understood.
<P>
	Even now more than 100,000 children and teens begin 
smoking every year in Canada.
<P>
	Enough is known about the hazards of smoking that we can 
predict with gruesome confidence that one in four of these 
young new smokers will die prematurely from conditions like 
emphysema, heart disease and lung cancer.
<P>
	Tobacco deaths are preventable and even one preventable 
death let alone thousands constitutes a tragedy. This is 
unacceptable.
<P>
	Canada's national strategy to reduce tobacco use has gone a 
long way toward reinforcing the idea that smoking is no longer 
cool for youth and a lot less socially acceptable among adults 
than once was the case in this country.
<P>
	This strategy has proceeded on a broad front with federal 
legislation restricting cigarette advertising and requiring strong 
visible health warnings on the product package, with health 
promotion campaigns aimed at encouraging young people to 
think twice about starting to smoke and to break free from social 
pressures to start smoking, and with federal legislation to raise 
the age at which people may legally be sold tobacco products to 
18.
<P>
	Tobacco smuggling is a serious threat to Canada's strategy 
against smoking because it is making cigarettes available to 
young people through illicit channels.
<P>
	Unless we put a stop to smuggling we will find it increasingly 
difficult to keep tobacco out of the hands of young teens, which 
is the very purpose of the sales of tobacco to young people act. 
With this law we expect Canada's retail sector to take a 
responsible approach to ensuring tobacco is not available for 
sale to young people but to make it work to control tobacco 
access by young persons.
<P>
	The tobacco market has got to move above ground where we 
can see it, where we can manage it, and where our programming 
can have its full effect.
<P>
	Canada leads the world in taking a comprehensive strategic 
approach to reducing the toll of sickness and premature death 
caused by tobacco smoking. We have no intention of forfeiting 
this lead. The government is committed to implementing 
innovative programs and legislation to maintain the momentum 
of our national strategy to continue to reduce addictions to 
tobacco in Canada and to continue to prevent tobacco related 
deaths.
<P>
	I want to inform the House that it is the government that sets 
tax policy in this country.
<P>
