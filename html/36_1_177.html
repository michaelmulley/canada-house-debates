2,355 more signatures of concerned citizens from nine different 
provinces, including Quebec.

Canadians are united in opposition to the federal government's 
fatally flawed gun registration.

Bill C-68 petitions.  Since last April I have introduced 1,855 
pages of petitions with a total of 43,265 signatures.  The 
petitioners are demanding an end to the government's billion 
dollar gun registration scheme because it will do nothing to 
curtail the criminal use of firearms, it is not a cost effective 
way to address the violent crime problem in Canada, it is putting 
tens of thousands of jobs in jeopardy, and it is opposed by the 
vast majority of police on the street and four provinces and two 
territories, comprising more than 50% of Canada's population.

pursuant to Standing Order 36, I am pleased to present a petition 
on the subject of human rights from a number of Canadians, 
including from my own riding of Mississauga South. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners draw to the attention of the House that human 
rights abuses continue to be rampant around the world in many 
countries, especially Indonesia.  The petitioners also point out 
that Canada continues to be recognized as the champion of human 
rights internationally.  Therefore the petitioners call upon 
parliament to continue to condemn human rights abuses around the 
world and also to seek to bring to justice those responsible for 
such abuses.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners urge parliament to establish peace tax 
legislation by passing into law a private member's bill which 
recognizes the right of conscientious objectors to not pay for 
the military and within which the government would declare its 
commitment to apply that portion of taxes that was to be used for 
military purposes toward peaceful purposes such as peace 
education, war relief, humanitarian and environmental aid, 
housing and other peaceful purposes.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the second petition deals with the MAI, the multilateral 
agreement on investment.  The petitioners express grave concern 
about the implications of the MAI for Canada's sovereignty and 
they call upon parliament to consider the enormous implications 
to Canada with the signing of the MAI.  They ask that it be put 
before the House for open debate and that a national referendum 
be held for the people of Canada to decide.

Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 36, I am pleased to stand on 
behalf of many constituents of Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre and 
other people across the country.  This petition pertains to the 
MacKay task force recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of people from Beauval, Strasbourg, Regina, 
Lanigan, Earl Grey, Duval and a number of communities who have 
signed this petition.  They are very concerned about the MacKay 
task force report which recommends that the banks get into the 
insurance business.  These people support the independent 
insurance brokers of Canada.  They do not support the banks 
taking over the business of the independent brokers association 
and its members.  They call upon parliament to totally reject the 
recommendations of the MacKay task force report pertaining to the 
entry of banks into the casualty and property insurance markets. 
They strongly urge parliamentarians not to give in to the 
pressure of the banks on this matter.

<P><A NAME="LINK22"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  On March 11, 1998 I placed 
Question No. Q-84 on the order paper, asking how many violent 
crimes had been investigated by the RCMP and how many involved 
the use of registered and unregistered firearms.  In accordance 
with Standing Order 39 I asked for a written answer within 45 
days.  My constituents have been waiting 335 days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commissioner of the RCMP wrote to me on July 6, 1998 
referring to his answer to Question No. Q-84.  The RCMP gave its 
response to the government 218 days ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raised this point on October 28 and again on December 7.  The 
parliamentary secretary said that the response was being 
finalized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Question No. Q-84 is the oldest unanswered question on the order 
paper.  For the third time, when is the government going to give 
my constituents the RCMP's answer to this important question? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member is quite

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP)</B> moved: 
<A NAME="LINK30">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should, in 
co-operation with the provinces, place an immediate moratorium on 
the export of bulk freshwater shipments and interbasin transfers 
and should introduce legislation to prohibit bulk freshwater 
exports and interbasin transfers in order to assert Canada's 
sovereign right to protect, preserve and conserve our freshwater 
resources for future generations. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to speak on behalf of 
my caucus today with respect to this motion.  I will read it into 
the record one more time: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should, in 
co-operation with the provinces, place an immediate moratorium on 
the export of bulk freshwater shipments and interbasin transfers 
and should introduce legislation to prohibit bulk freshwater 
exports and interbasin transfers in order to assert Canada's 
sovereign right to protect, preserve and conserve our freshwater 
resources for future generations. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>May I begin by saying I will be sharing my time 
with the hon. member for Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very important motion.  We have hope on this side of 
the House, in the NDP particularly, that there may come a day 
when parliament could express itself perhaps even unanimously in 
favour of this motion. It would be a historical moment.  For the 
first time as far as I know, parliament would have said clearly 
that there is a need for the government to act immediately with 
respect to a moratorium, and that there is a need for the 
government to proceed quickly to bring in legislation in the 
context as well of a larger national water policy that has been 
absent since the beginning of time in spite of Liberal promises 
to the contrary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been many occasions when the Liberal Party in 
government and in opposition made commitments to bring in a 
national water policy, to ban the bulk export of freshwater from 
Canada and we have had no action on this.  We asked the question 
of the government in the House last Thursday and we had no 
commitment to legislation or to a moratorium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion forces the government, we hope, to focus its 
thoughts on what needs to be done here and to join with us and 
hopefully with colleagues from other parties in the House of 
Commons in saying something decisive today, on February 9, 1999, 
about what Canada's intention is with respect to the export of 
freshwater, particularly with respect to bulk freshwater exports 
and interbasin transfers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Water is something that all Canadians have a common image of in 
our country.  Water is as Canadian as hockey, the RCMP and the 
beaver.  We want to make sure that we do not have happen to water 
what has already happened to hockey and to the RCMP. We know that 
hockey has gone south for all intents and purposes and has become 
Americanized.  It has become an export over which we have no 
control.  This is very much at the expense of the way in which 
hockey used to be done in our own country.  We know the RCMP has 
sold its copyright to Disney. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us make water a last stand.  Let us make sure that at least 
when it comes to freshwater resources, we as a country show some 
fortitude and determination, that what has happened to many other 
aspects of our country both with respect to natural resources and 
culture will not happen to water.  This is the intent of this 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is very important and I urge the government to 
consider it. The government may also have an opportunity to 
consider, in the course of reflecting upon our amendment, their 
own dark side on these issues. The dark side for the Liberals on 
this issue as in others is the international trade and investment 
agreements, in particular those which they have had a penchant 
for signing even after they ran against them and even after they 
said they would not sign them.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us say the government votes for this motion, and the 
Liberals pat themselves on the back about their determination not 
to permit the bulk export of freshwater.  We do not want to be in 
the situation three, five, or ten years from now where the 
Liberals say then what they are saying now about magazines and 
about drug patent legislation.  “Oh well, yes, we were against 
extending the drug patent legislation and we are for protecting 
the Canadian magazine industry, but what can we do because we are 
in NAFTA and we are in the WTO.  It really does not matter what 
we said before.  It does not really matter that we vigorously 
opposed the drug patent legislation or that we were vigorously in 
favour of protecting the Canadian cultural sector. We are hapless 
victims.  We are at the mercy of these trade agreements”.   Of 
course many of those agreements, particularly NAFTA and the WTO, 
the Liberals themselves signed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had enough of this self-inflicted powerlessness.  That 
is why we intend to move an amendment which would ask the 
government to go beyond the initial motion and give some 
indication of whether or not the Liberals would have the 
fortitude on behalf of the Canadian people to not be a party to 
any international agreement which in future was found to compel 
us to export freshwater in bulk against our will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to that debate.  I look forward to hearing from 
other members of my party on this. I also look forward to hearing 
from the Liberals as to whether or not this is just an expression 
of goodwill and good intentions that will once again be thwarted 
by the victim mentality that has overcome Canadian governments in 
the last several administrations, whereby they want to do the 
right thing but they cannot because of the trade agreements they 
have signed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also bring forward this motion in the context of knowing that 
we need a much fuller debate in this country, not just about 
exports but about water management in general.  It is not just a 
question of exports, although the motion addresses itself 
specifically to that.  It is about the lack of a national water 
policy in general.  It is about the lack of any commitment on the 
part of this government or any other government to make sure that 
water, even when it is not exported, remains in the public 
domain.  It is about water not becoming privatized as it has 
become in so many other countries and not being treated like any 
other commodity such as oil, gas, wheat or whatever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians think and say very clearly that they see water as 
being very different.  They see water as having a national 
dimension and also an environmental dimension that they feel 
should not be threatened by coming to view water as any other 
commodity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To those who say, quite rightly in the geopolitical sense but 
wrongly in principle, that water will be the oil of the 21st 
century, we say no.  We do not want water to be treated like oil. 
We do not want water to be treated like any other commercially 
exploited natural resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By this motion today we hope to contribute along with others who 
are acting in an extra-parliamentary sense, like the Council of 
Canadians who I believe are having a conference and a press 
conference on water today.  We hope to stimulate a national 
debate about conservation of water, about a national water 
policy, about water management and about the environmental 
dimension of the water question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that we should not be involved in the bulk export of 
freshwater from Canada, I think we should also admit as a country 
that we cannot do this from the high ground of being a country 
that looks after its water, of being a country that is committed 
to strict conservation of water and therefore in a position to 
lecture other countries about water conservation. We are not in 
that position.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not be self-righteous about it.  Let us admit that not 
only do we not want to export water but we have a need to treat 
the water which we keep within our boundaries a lot better than 
we do and to conserve it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are all these things.  There is the environmental 
dimension.  There is the public-private dimension.  There are the 
free trade and investment agreements which could prohibit us from 
prohibiting bulk water exports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to hearing from other members of my party and 
members from other parties on these issues today.  Hopefully at 
the end of the day, we can look back on this day as a time when 
we entered a new political period with respect to the attitude of 
parliament and the country toward our freshwater resources and 
look to the government to finally act on this particular issue. 
<P><A NAME="LINK31"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have 
listened with interest to my colleague across the way.  I agree 
with much of what he says, certainly about conservation, the 
environmental nature of water and so on, and let us not be 
self-righteous. I do not think we are doing nearly a good enough 
job on looking after our water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand that we have about 25% of the world's freshwater. 
Our population however is minuscule compared to that. I know my 
friend is compassionate and concerned about everyone and about 
Canada's place in the world.  I would like to know what he thinks 
the eventual outcome will be.  Are we going to build a wall?  Are 
we going to mount machine guns?  Are we going to stop the rivers 
flowing south?  What are we going to do when people outside our 
borders need freshwater, as they will in a few years or more and 
we have it all? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member raises a good 
question. It is precisely why we think the government should 
bring in legislation.  It is precisely why we think there should 
be a national water policy. In the context of actually having 
something on the floor of the House of Commons, that is to say in 
the context of actually having the government act, these kinds of 
issues could be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think we should assume that under any condition or 
under all conditions that we would be open to this sort of moral 
demand which the member talks about.  We need to create a regime 
in which if we want to make exceptions when there are people who 
need rather than want our water we could do so. We are not 
anywhere near that particular point in time.  We are at a point 
now where our water resources are vulnerable to the trade 
agreements and vulnerable to the absence of a national water 
policy. 
<P><A NAME="LINK32"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I just want to say a couple of words and then ask my 
colleague the member for Winnipeg—Transcona a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the member for moving this motion and the 
seconder, the member for Yukon, and the NDP caucus for taking 
this issue to the public once again and for trying to get the 
consent and support of the House of Commons in this very 
important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Canadians know, we need three elements for life on this 
planet. We need good soil, clean air and water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want the members and the people who are watching this debate 
to understand that we have international agreements when it comes 
to the flowing of rivers and other bodies of water south. These 
agreements are agreed upon.  We have to release a certain amount 
of the water that flows into these basins and that is something 
that will remain status quo.  We are not planning to dam the 
waters if this motion is passed. Those waters will continue to 
flow freely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very concerned about the great water supplies that we 
have.  I do agree with the hon. member for Winnipeg—Transcona 
that we should be husbanding our resources.  We should be 
conserving them. We should be recycling water.  We should be 
reusing water as many countries are now doing.  We have not done 
enough of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question I want to ask is extremely important to many 
Canadians, not just on the issue of water but on other issues 
pertaining to trade agreements. 
The United States has in all its trade agreements, whether the 
NAFTA or the WTO, a public interest clause which says that if it 
is in the public interest of the United States, its governments 
can make decisions superseding trade agreements.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member how our amendment would sit and whether we need 
to go further on the trade agreements to have a public interest 
clause for Canada as the United States does? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we do not think Canada 
should be a party to any international agreement that compels us 
to do things against our will, particularly when it comes to our 
freshwater resources.  I think this is very clear. 
<P><A NAME="LINK33"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I too want to congratulate my colleague 
from Winnipeg—Transcona for introducing this motion today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps by the end of the day we will look back at this being an 
historic occasion, when the Parliament of Canada for the first 
time in history says it considers water as unlike any other 
natural resource in Canada and wants to give it a special 
priority that it has not given other natural resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fair to say that one of the major issues of conflict in 
the early part of the 21st century will be access to freshwater. 
We understand that Canada has a relatively unique role in this 
regard in that we are the world's largest reservoir of freshwater 
with 9% of the globe's volume.  If we look at the almost 200 
countries identified in the world today, only 3 have an adequate 
supply into the future of fresh potable water. Canada is one of 
those. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is crucial for us.  As my friend from 
Winnipeg—Transcona indicated, it is absolutely mandatory that we 
have a thoughtful and strategic water policy in place as soon as 
possible.  Today we call on the Parliament of Canada to send a 
very clear message to those who would like to export bulk water 
from Canada into other jurisdictions as a business commodity. We 
are calling for an immediate moratorium on bulk water exports and 
we are asking for immediate legislation to protect Canada's water 
and to exert our sovereignty over this critical resource for the 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know to what extent nations will go to secure access to oil. 
We have seen wars over this issue in a variety of areas.  Let us 
face it, water is a whole lot more valuable than oil even today 
where we take it in a rather cavalier way.  Today a litre of 
water costs more than a litre of oil. Still we waste this 
resource more than any other country with one exception, the 
United States.  It wastes more water than we do but we are 
second. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some ask with all this water, why not sell it?  We have sold 
every other resource. Foreign interests have access to every 
natural resource in Canada except one.  As my friend indicated, 
why not make a stand as a country and say “This is it.  We 
consider water to be unlike oil, coal, codfish, timber or wheat. 
This is a resource of life itself”.  We can go without eating 
for seven or eight weeks but we cannot go without drinking water 
for more than a handful of days.  It is life itself.  Today we 
have to say clearly that Canada has no excess water to export. 
There is no such thing as surplus water in an ecosystem. The life 
along a river's course and watershed is the product of both the 
high flows and the low flows.  If you alter them you change the 
river. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Diverting water from a salmon river will mean traditional 
spawning grounds along the river bank will not flood.  Taking 
water from the mouth of a river will deprive the estuary, one of 
the most productive biological areas on earth, of vital 
nutrients. Clearly water is not a resource like all others and 
requires special protection and special strategy in terms of how 
we are to use it in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend has indicated there are many concerns. Being a country 
that holds 9% of the world's freshwater, it is crucial that we 
have a water policy in place as soon as possible. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1035"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot imagine a single thoughtful person in this country 
saying that we should not do this and that we should not do it as 
quickly as we can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not loose sight of the fact that today could be the 
beginning of a movement down this crucial pathway to developing a 
strategic water strategy for our country into the 21st century. 
Passing a motion in the House does not necessarily accomplish 
that.  The will has to be there as well.  In 1989 the House 
unanimously passed a motion to eradicate child poverty by 2000. 
Unfortunately things have become a lot worse since then.  We have 
a long way to go before we meet that goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, it is fair to say that we want to advance this cause.  We 
want to ensure that water in our country is preserved for the use 
of future generations.  Let us face it, if an American community 
becomes dependent on Canadian water we can imagine the reaction 
if in some future point we decide to cut it off.  We can replace 
wood with products from another country or with some other 
building material.  But we cannot replace anything with water. 
Water is a strategic resource.  It is a crucial life giving 
resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to dealing with water Canada's reputation is 
anything but sterling.  We have more water diversion projects 
than any other country on earth.  We have 600 dams and 60 large 
diversion projects that transfer water between basins.  Most of 
them are part of large hydroelectric projects.  We have shown 
ourselves more willing to alter the life of rivers and lakes for 
commercial purposes.  No other nation even comes close to us in 
that respect.  As my friend from Winnipeg—Transcona indicated, 
when it comes to dealing, preserving and conserving freshwater in 
our country our track record is anything but sterling.  Perhaps 
today is the beginning of a new era and a new trend to preserving 
and conserving Canada's water for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of the fact that a number of people have referred to 
many of the international agreements we have signed, it is 
difficult to pass legislation that would protect Canadians, 
protect the Canadian environment, protect water resources and 
protect the health of Canadians.  I refer back to the MMT issue 
of not long ago where in spite of the efforts of the elected 
representatives to preserve and save the health of Canadians by 
passing legislation banning MMT, the government backed off 
because of the pressure it felt was coming from the United States 
as a result of agreements that we had made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to propose an amendment to today's supply day 
motion: 
<A NAME="LINK34">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between the words “transfers” and “in”,  insert, 
“and should not be a party to any international agreement that 
compels us to export freshwater against our will”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The question is on the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have a question for my colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He made reference to the trade agreements and moved an amendment 
to the motion which has to do with international agreements under 
which trade agreements would fall.  He will know that the 
government has often said that when it comes to NAFTA water 
exports are not covered. Yet if not covered by NAFTA, and this is 
the position officially taken by the three governments involved, 
why is it so difficult to get the Canadian government to seek 
from these other governments an unambiguous memorandum of 
understanding having international legal standing equal to NAFTA 
which says so so that the matter can be cleared up once and for 
all? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1040"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT9"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT9"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1040
<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the absence of the Canadian government being willing to seek 
such an international memorandum, the suspicion lingers that 
somehow NAFTA does involve the bulk export of freshwater. 
Otherwise, why would the government be so reluctant to seek an 
unambiguous statement that it does not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder whether my colleague would like to comment on the 
Liberal reluctance to seek such a statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think it is fair to say 
that many in the legal field have argued that under agreements 
like the FTA and the North American Free Trade Agreement certain 
commodities were clearly excluded. Beer, logs and culture were 
named as exclusions and therefore, by implication, presumably 
everything else is left in.  Bottled water was also mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that once water enters a container for sale it 
becomes a good, a commodity or a product.  Whether that container 
is a vessel, a canal, a pipeline or whatever, the concern 
Canadians have is that we are not protected by the present 
wording of international agreements like NAFTA. I agree with my 
hon. friend that if the will is there by all countries then we 
should. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us face it, the northern part of Mexico, particularly in the 
Maquiladora zone where the big industrial belt is now developing 
as a result of NAFTA, and in the American southwest which is 
referred to as the sun belt where the large industries and 
populations are developing in the agricultural sectors, they are 
running out of water.  It is clear that they are running out of 
freshwater. The wells and rivers are drying up and every 
conceivable ounce of that surface water is either being used or 
is locked up in legal agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As those populations increase they are looking north to Canada 
as their obvious source to bail them out when the time comes, no 
pun intended.  The issue of having as many cards in our hands as 
we can when the dealing begins is absolutely crucial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While people will argue that we can pass legislation here 
banning exports and pass legislation in the provincial 
legislations of the country or wherever else, that trade 
agreement between three sovereign nations takes priority over 
national, state, provincial or local jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to do whatever we can to ensure that freshwater is in 
adequate supply for future generations of Canadians and that is 
why this motion is before the House of Commons today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK36"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in one of 
the comments from the other side there was concern about the 
export of water, sharing our resources with other parts of the 
world.  I wonder if the member could reference the fact that this 
motion does deal with the bulk shipment of water abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I agree with my hon. 
colleague.  We acknowledge that today there are a number of 
agreements sharing water between Canada and the United States on 
the small scale.  I am thinking Coutts, Alberta and Sweet Grass, 
Montana and others across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, let us also acknowledge that the country that wastes 
more water than any other is the United States.  Crops are being 
grown in parts where they should never be grown.  Swimming pools 
are filled with water from one end of Los Angeles to the other. 
Green lawns are all over southern California.  There is a car 
wash every third block. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The day is not far off before the United States runs out of 
water because it abuses it so much.  It pollutes and misuses its 
water resources.  We want to send a clear signal that we are not 
going to be an easy source of bailing it out.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I welcome the 
opportunity to participate in this debate and certainly welcome 
the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the exchanges in the debate would lead me to put forward 
the thought that one of the reasons why previous governments have 
not taken the water issue seriously is a lack of knowledge or a 
lack of individual knowledge about the state of water in this 
country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, my colleague on this side suggested that Canada 
held 25% of the world's freshwater supply.  Across the way the 
statement was 9% and in the notes I have information that it is 
20%, so this is an indicator that the message is not clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is clear is that water is a renewable resource.  The water 
cycle replenishes our water supply on a continuing basis, but 
there is an old adage that you never miss the water till the well 
runs dry.  This year in the province of Ontario the wells ran 
dry.  There are wells that are still dry in Ontario.  Farmers in 
the riding I serve are having either to buy water for their 
cattle or are having to move their cattle to other farms which 
have wells that are supplying water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year is the worst drought in recorded weather history in 
the province of Ontario.  That should give us an indicator that 
we must be very conscious and very careful about the way we treat 
water and the way we look at it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until the present time it has been very difficult to convince 
municipalities and engineers that create domestic water supply to 
conserve water.  It has always been the business of searching out 
bulk quantities of water without regard for water conservation. 
Yet many techniques could be put into place not only to help us 
conserve our water but to raise the consciousness of Canadians 
about the necessity to protect our water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concerns of members are very well founded.  This is a 
domestic and global priority.  Canadians feel strongly that water 
should not be removed from our country in bulk form.  There are 
global shortages at the present time.  The location of water is 
paramount.  There may be demands placed on Canada's water in the 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For environmental considerations more than anything else we need 
to protect our watersheds and the health of the ecosystems.  The 
government is acting now and has acted in the past on behalf of 
all Canadians to preserve what is one of our most precious 
resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Where is the legislation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed:</B>  Wait for it.  Not only has it been 
federal policy since 1987 to oppose bulk removal of water by 
tanker, diversion or other interbasin transfer.  Our provincial 
partners have or have been developing similar policies or 
legislation to protect our natural waters from commercialization 
beyond current usage.  Canadians can be assured that Canada is 
not on the verge of a major water giveaway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are federal and provincial responsibilities for the 
preservation of water.  I will try to spell out the differences 
between the two.  The federal government has a particular 
responsibility for boundary waters and transboundary waters along 
the Canada and U.S. border.  Extending back to the Boundary 
Waters Treaty of 1909 it is a responsibility that this government 
and many before it have taken very seriously, so much so that the 
government announced its intention—and my hon. friend raised 
this suggestion—to seek an agreement with the U.S. to make a 
reference to the International Joint Commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been consulting with provinces to ensure that our 
reference to the International Joint Commission will produce the 
kind of findings that will be useful to all governments.  We are 
confident that the IJC will produce sound recommendations, as was 
the case with the 1977 reference on the Garrison diversion 
project, with the 1985 reference on diversions and consumptive 
uses in the Great Lakes, and with the 1997 reference to the Red 
River flood. We will soon be in a position to announce the terms 
of reference to the IJC.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are legitimate concerns about trade obligations.  A 
handful of critics believe that through the North American Free 
Trade Agreement Canada has somehow ceded control of our water 
resources to multinational corporations.  The member has called 
for immediate steps on the part of the government.  I state 
categorically and for the record that water resource management 
in Canada is in no way subject to the whims of multinational 
corporations.  Nor is it directed by NAFTA.  Water is a public 
good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing in NAFTA that would prevent Canada from taking 
steps to prohibit the commercialization of our water resources. 
These principles date back to the 1947 General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade.  They are not new.  For the information of the 
hon. opposition member I refer to the 1993 joint statement of the 
governments of Canada, Mexico and the United States following 
NAFTA which reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless water in any form has entered into commerce and become a 
good or product, it is not a good or product. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That may seem like an obvious truth, but it leads to the next 
part of the same sentence which states in reference to water 
which is not a good or product that it “is not covered by any 
trade agreement including the North American Free Trade 
Agreement”. The statement goes on to affirm our sovereignty over 
water by stating: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And nothing in the NAFTA would oblige any NAFTA party to either 
exploit its water for commercial use, or to begin exporting water 
in any form. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing forces us to export water particularly in bulk.  That 
leads to the final explanation of the 1993 statement: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Water in its natural state in lakes, rivers, reservoirs, 
aquifers, water basins and the like is not a good or product, is 
not traded and, therefore, is not and never has been subject to 
the terms of any trade agreement. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada does not now take water from its natural state and 
package it in bulk form for sale.  We do not support the 
commercialization of water in bulk for any reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have chosen to put water in smaller quantities into bottles 
and to offer it for sale, but the total effect of such shipments 
is very small compared with the net effect of large scale 
removal.  Consistent with these provisions we will shortly be 
announcing measures aimed at preventing water from being taken 
from its natural state and converted into a good.  I hope all 
hon. members of the House will endorse that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces have a responsibility as well.  We consulted with 
the provinces especially during the last half of last year. Under 
the Constitution provinces have the responsibility for water 
management within their borders.  Permits to draw large 
quantities of water for an reason from natural sources are 
provided by provincial authorities.  Our provincial partners are 
opposed to interbasin transfers, so clearly the federal policy of 
1987 was on the mark.  They agreed the proper management of water 
resources is first and foremost an environmental issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps what we have learned most from these consultations with 
the provinces is that a collective approach to water protection 
by governments is needed now before too many mistakes are made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were impressed by the degree of consensus with the provinces 
that exists on these issues.  Our measures will be built on 
established and comprehensive environmental principles and on the 
concerns of all provinces and territories, not just on the 
question of exports but on the overall management of our water 
resources.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Such an approach is prudent and justified.  Not only must we 
work with the provinces and territories to develop this 
understanding.  We must work with our closest international ally, 
the United States, with whom we share the Great Lakes, the 
largest freshwater resource in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I regret to interrupt the hon. member 
but his time has expired.  He might be able to summarize his 
remarks in questions and comments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member has perhaps inadvertently made the case 
for why we are so concerned about the NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure whether the statement issued in 1993 amounts to 
some kind of combination between a tautology and a catch-22.  In 
any event it is not very reassuring when they say that water will 
not be treated as a good unless of course it is treated as a 
good, and it will be treated as a good if in any circumstance it 
becomes commercially exploitable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is precisely the point we are making.  We do not want it to 
become commercially exploitable and, if it ever should, under the 
conditions of NAFTA there would then be no turning back.  By the 
very act of commercially exploiting water in bulk we would be 
committing an irreversible act.  From there on other partners to 
the agreement in NAFTA would be able to argue that it has become 
a good and is therefore now to be treated like any other 
commodity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our point is that what is wrong with NAFTA is not whether it is 
treated as a good but rather that should it come to be treated as 
a good it would come under the terms of the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we want is an exemption stating that water is exempt 
whether it is in its natural state or whether it is being 
commercially exploited.  We do not want it to be commercially 
exploited, but we also think an agreement which states that 
should it ever become commercially exploited it is then to be 
treated like any other commodity is not a good agreement either. 
It does not seem to me that the hon. member gets that about 
NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed:</B>  Mr. Speaker, obviously there was a 
concern in 1993 about this whole question and about the 
interpretation of when water is a good and when it is not a good. 
To suggest an amendment is required in NAFTA is not on because 
there is nothing in NAFTA now that obliges any export of water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian would make a decision as to whether to declare water in 
bottles are a good or not a good.  There is nothing in NAFTA that 
demands an amendment.  I do not know how much clearer I can 
possibly make it.  It is not there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, we are concerned about the future of water.  Yes, the 
government is taking action on it.  I am sure the hon. member 
will agree with the statement when it is made, which we hope will 
be very soon.  The fact is that it is not part of NAFTA. 
<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in his speech the hon. member was talking about 
consultations with the provinces.  He stated that the provinces 
have a consensus.  They are opposed to interbasin transfers.  He 
made no statement about whether they were opposed to bulk water 
exports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member give us a clarification on where the 
provinces add up on that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not sure I can make it 
much clearer than I have.  The provinces to this point are 
opposed to interbasin transfers.  We have so far arrived at a 
consensus among the provinces that they share our concern.  I do 
not know how much further I can take the member on that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to ask the hon. member about comments in the 1993 red 
book where the Liberal Party said that it would take the 
opportunity before signing the NAFTA to correct any flaws that 
existed in the original free trade agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of Liberals who are currently sitting in this 
House who are on record as saying that one of those flaws was 
that Canada did not get protection over its water and that it 
would be part of the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the Liberal government not take the opportunity to 
correct those flaws before it signed the agreement? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed:</B>   Mr. Speaker, I will clear up a couple 
of things, if I might.  My hon. colleague asked about bulk water 
export and that is within the purview of the federal government. 
I should have known that off the top. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that in the NAFTA there is no provision.  Yes, there 
was concern about it and the concern was very legitimate because 
we do not want there to be any export of bulk water.  However, 
after examining the NAFTA we found that it was not there. 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo—Alberni, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to thank the House for the opportunity to address this 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion has been amended.  The original motion reads, in 
part: 
<A NAME="LINK42">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should, in 
co-operation with the provinces, place an immediate moratorium on 
the export of bulk freshwater shipments and inter-basin transfers 
and should introduce legislation to prohibit bulk freshwater 
exports and inter-basin transfers— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment reads: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—and should not be a party to any international agreement that 
compels us to export freshwater against our will— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The original motion then continues: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—in order to assert Canada's sovereign right to protect, 
preserve and conserve our freshwater resources for future 
generations. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly our water is of critical priority to all of us.  It 
directly affects Canada's agricultural sector, regional economic 
development, rural infrastructure, sustainable development, our 
environment and potentially our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform agrees with the basic principle of this motion.  The 
issue here is sovereignty and we agree that this House needs to 
take action to protect and control our water.  I believe that all 
sides of this House would not have any problem with that comment. 
However, how we deal with the problem I believe is the question 
of this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion is only a temporary solution.  It will not fix the 
problem that Canada is now faced with as a result of this Prime 
Minister's actions.  A temporary moratorium on bulk water exports 
will buy this government some time to negotiate a solution, a 
permanent solution.  That solution is an amendment to the NAFTA 
which explicitly excludes water from the NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note that before the Liberals came to 
power, when the Mulroney government was negotiating the NAFTA, 
the Liberals opposed the NAFTA deal and voiced their concerns 
about protecting our water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the 1993 election campaign the Prime Minister promised 
that he would renegotiate the NAFTA to exclude bulk water from 
the deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On November 19 the Prime Minister insisted “Water and the North 
America Free Trade Agreement do not mix.  Water remains under the 
control of the Canadian government.  I can guarantee that”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are more quotes from our present Prime Minister:  “I will 
make sure it is like that.  It is one of the elements I intend to 
discuss with President Clinton.  I want Canada to maintain 
control over our own water.  It is not for sale and if we want to 
sell, we will decide”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly the Liberals are leaving the door open for water to be 
sold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister said he had a message for President Bill 
Clinton, which was “I don't even dream that the NAFTA gives the 
United States unlimited access to Canadian water.  That is 
because water and the North American Free Trade Agreement do not 
mix”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are nice quotes, but they simply do not reflect reality. 
The reason we are debating this motion today is because Canada 
does not have control over its water.  That is a clear fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Mulroney government insisted that the NAFTA applies only to 
exports of water in containers and not to large scale transfers 
or diversions which the government maintained was never even 
discussed during the NAFTA negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly there has been a lot of misinformation and 
misunderstanding over this issue.  Since the government came to 
power it has denied the fact that when the Prime Minister signed 
the NAFTA without renegotiating to specifically exempt water 
Canada lost its control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservatives failed in 1988 and the Liberals failed in 1993 
to protect our water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I raised this issue in the House during the last parliament 
in my motion calling on this government to take steps to protect 
Canada's sovereignty over water, the government denied that our 
sovereignty had been compromised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are some of the facts.  My colleague, our international 
trade critic, will be speaking later to clarify some of the 
issues regarding the NAFTA and the free trade agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NAFTA implementation act states that nothing applies to 
water, except bottled water, and water is not excluded from the 
free trade agreement itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Article 309 of the NAFTA prohibits controls by Canada covering 
the sale or export of any goods destined for either the United 
States or Mexico. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only specific permission that the NAFTA gives for export 
controls is for Canadian logs and unprocessed fish.  This, in my 
mind, is the answer.  Right now Canadian logs and unprocessed 
fish are not in the NAFTA.  They are exempt.  If we add water to 
that list, that gives us the control that we are looking for. 
That is the solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also likely that if the government were to propose 
legislation to ban the export of bulk water, as proposed in the 
NDP motion, we could be challenged under the NAFTA. Our 
legislation could be shot down by a trade dispute panel as 
unacceptable interference in the free market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a dicey point and it is the difficulty I have with the 
NDP motion.  The motion proposes that by banning the export of 
bulk water the problem will be solved.  That is not the problem. 
The problem is the sovereignty, ownership and control of our 
water, which the Liberals have failed to fix.  If we fix that we 
do not need to worry about the rest.  Provincial control of the 
resource will then handle the next issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In passing any law banning water exports Canada would define 
water as a commodity and it would trigger the national treatment 
provisions of the NAFTA.  Trade experts say that Canada could 
face a challenge under international trade rules if we explicitly 
define water as a good by passing legislation banning its export. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of the Environment stated that she wants to ban 
water export through legislation.  However the minister has 
publicly stated that the government does not know how it will do 
this, simply because by putting water in legislation it will 
become a commodity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We often hear about the trilateral statement made by the Prime 
Minister, President Bush and the Mexicans that we have a side 
deal which protects our water.  We do not.  All that side deal 
says is that if we do not export bulk water, then it could be 
okay. However, as soon as we export it we cannot turn the tap 
off. That is all that side agreement was about.  It had nothing 
to do with fixing the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only way for Canadians to regain control of their water is 
for the federal government to negotiate a side agreement to the 
NAFTA that specifically excludes bulk water from the agreement.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation is getting urgent.  The U.S. is facing water 
shortages.  There have been at least 13 proposals for large scale 
diversions of water from the Great Lakes to the U.S.  Clearly the 
situation is quite volatile because we have read in the papers 
that companies such a Sun Belt of California, the Nova Group of 
Ontario and the McCurdy Group of Newfoundland are pushing to get 
permits.  It is the job of this government to fix the problem, 
and the problem is getting control over our water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, there are jurisdictional issues affected by this 
motion.  The management and protection of water as a natural 
resource is constitutionally provincial.  It is a provincial 
responsibility.  The only time the federal government gets into 
it is if it concerns trade.  Any legislation that the House is 
prepared to bring in clearly has to have the agreement of all the 
provinces.  My understanding is that that agreement would not be 
forthcoming at the moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on the Liberal government to take concrete steps to 
protect sovereignty over our water.  I call on the Prime Minister 
to negotiate a side deal that specifically exempts water from the 
NAFTA, as he promised in the 1993 election, as he has promised 
all along and as he has failed to do up to this point in time.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview—Greenwood, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I want to begin by congratulating the New Democratic 
Party for this motion today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My first campaign in Broadview—Greenwood was all about the free 
trade agreement.  I can remember that about a week into the 
campaign I received a phone call from an associate of mine from 
Houston, Texas who was close to Clayton Yeutter who was the free 
trade negotiator for the United States.  He said “Dennis, 
Clayton Yeutter spent his whole life studying water.  In fact he 
did his doctoral thesis at the University of Nebraska and in 1961 
published `North American Water Management'.  You had better make 
sure that when you are going through this free trade agreement 
you understand exactly where water sits in the agreement because 
this is a man who has dedicated his entire life to water”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I took the time to get a copy of Clayton Yeutter's Ph.D. thesis 
from the University of Nebraska.  I urge all members to get a 
copy of it.  It is a 600 page thesis.  If there was ever any 
doubt in members' minds as to whether water was a part of the 
free trade agreement, this Ph.D. thesis will take that doubt 
away.  It is a part of the free trade agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my very first speech in the House of Commons I begged former 
Prime Minister Mulroney to get a one page protocol letter from 
Ronald Reagan saying that water was exempt.  The then government 
would not do it.  I wrote several letters to Clayton Yeutter 
asking him to acknowledge that water was not a part of the free 
trade agreement.  He never responded to those letters.  I have 
them on file.  I also know that in the last few days someone has 
talked to Clayton Yeutter and he will now publicly admit that 
water is in fact a part of the free trade agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians do not even have a proper inventory of what our water 
assets are.  We waste a lot of water.  Before we export a gallon 
of water we should take stock of what we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the member the following question, keeping in mind 
that we have not done an inventory of water in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us imagine that we went through that exercise and discovered 
that we did have some excess water.  If it were properly metered, 
priced accordingly and Canadians were looked after first, would 
the Reform Party member then consider the notion of selling? 
Again, I want to say that would only be after it was excluded 
from the free trade agreement. 
What would the member's views be on sharing and selling of water 
only after we took the necessary time to take stock of it as an 
issue, province by province, region by region?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Gilmour:</B>  Madam Speaker, the issue of inventory 
is clearly under provincial domain.  The provinces own and 
regulate the water and it is for them to decide what they have 
and what they will do with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member said he pleaded with former Prime Minister Mulroney 
to get water out of NAFTA.  Has the member made the same plea to 
the current Prime Minister as he is now on the government side to 
make that happen?  The issue we are debating today is to get 
control over our water.  I would hope the member would approach 
his government to fix the problem.  The member has identified the 
problem.  Now it is up to the government to fix it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, permit me 
to start with a quote from Plato.  This Greek philosopher proved 
unequivocally the value we should place on this wealth, and I 
quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Water is the greatest element of nutrition ... but is easily 
polluted.  You cannot poison the soil, or the sun, or the air, 
which are the other elements of nutrition ... or divert them or 
steal them: but all these things may very likely happen in 
regard to water, which must therefore be protected by law. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Water then has been of concern to humanity for thousands of 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois cannot support the NDP's motion.  It means a 
significant step backward for the provinces in the area of 
responsibility for water, because the NDP is asking the federal 
government to intervene in two areas: to place a moratorium on 
the export of bulk fresh water and inter-basin transfers, and to 
introduce legislation to permanently ban fresh water exports and 
inter-basin transfers to affirm Canada's sovereign right to 
protect, preserve and conserve its fresh water resources for 
generations to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot agree with such a motion and such a procedure, which 
impinge on the rights of Quebec and the other provinces to 
legislate and manage their own water resources as they see fit. 
Once again, Quebec and the provinces of Canada are responsible 
for this resource and must remain so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing is certain: this responsibility must be assumed by the 
provinces and they must legislate and manage this resource in 
co-operation with regional stakeholders, because it is they who 
are familiar with the problems and are close to the realities 
and consequences of good day-to-day management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 109 of the Constitution Act, 1982, provides, and I 
quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ownership of lands and natural resources rests with the 
provincial crown. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec must protect this resource the best way it knows how. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my remarks, I will show, with two examples from the 
Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region, the importance and the absolute 
need to have those closest to the resource, such as our rivers, 
lakes and underground waters, manage them and be responsible for 
them.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Humanity's need for water has skyrocketed in the 20th century. 
In 50 years, the world's water consumption has increased more 
than fourfold. Meeting our need for water in the centuries to 
come is the challenge for which we must prepare.  Each of the 
provinces therefore has a responsibility to manage this resource 
carefully, in co-operation with the public, for one thing is 
sure:  it is a resource that will be highly prized in the 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as an example, there are various approaches that the 
provinces could consider and where the federal government would 
be of no help: create structures, functions and responsibilities 
with a view to integrated management of water resources; 
recognize users of environmental water in order to get them more 
involved, and be able to identify minimum water requirements of 
aquatic ecosystems; develop exchanges of information and 
educational strategies in order to improve the dissemination of 
information, the results of pilot projects, best practices, case 
studies, and much more; develop environmental impact assessment 
procedures in order to improve the water resources management 
knowledge base; and, finally, encourage the public to get 
involved and give it additional responsibilities and a greater 
say in the planning and management of water resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objective of all of these is to clearly illustrate the 
necessity for the provinces to be masters of their own water 
resource legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Water belongs to everyone.  It must be managed intelligently by 
the proper government levels.  The Government of Quebec offers 
an excellent illustration, moreover, of responsibility in this 
connection.  It has just announced broad public consultations on 
water management in Quebec, to be carried out by the Bureau des 
audiences publiques de l'environnement, a body which has 
unequivocally demonstrated its efficiency and its readiness to 
listen to public concerns.  This body is one of the best 
examples of successful public consultation anywhere in the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Its purpose in carrying out consultations in all regions of 
Quebec encompasses four basic and fundamental orientations: 
improving the quality of life for Quebeckers; responding to the 
social needs and individual aspirations of the people of Quebec; 
respecting environmental quality and the need for sustainable 
resources; and, finally, achieving the greatest possible equity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Attaining this is possible only if four major objectives are 
given priority: ensuring that the health of the public is 
protected, since water is necessary to life, health and 
well-being; seeking the sustainability of the resource, since it 
is our duty to leave future generations with the water supply 
needed for their development; raising awareness of the resource 
on the social, environmental and economic levels; focussing on 
balancing uses, so that legitimate needs are met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Promoting and raising awareness of water means also raising 
awareness of the great diversity of its uses and the conflicts 
that can ensue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This set of objectives are a clear illustration of Quebec's 
desire to have its own water policy, one that reflects the 
concerns of the people of Quebec.  This resource belongs to us, 
and we are fully in charge of deciding what we want to do with 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the expectations of the Government of Quebec with respect 
to this consultation, to quote Minister of the Environment Paul 
Bégin: “Our bottom line is to define a water policy to serve the 
interests of Quebeckers, while at the same time ensuring the 
protection of a vital resource that is part of the heritage of 
humankind.” 
This ultimate goal illustrates clearly Quebeckers' intention to 
determine the use of this resource according to the need for it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the Quebec premier said in a speech that water 
management should be built on sustainable development, hence the 
need for careful and responsible management.  This management 
must serve the public and its needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These statements and this consultation in Quebec on water will 
provide a clear picture for future Quebec water policy.  The aim 
of the Government of Quebec is responsible management of this 
invaluable and vital resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote remarks made by the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs, Mr. Lloyd Axworthy, on February 4, 1998: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have to determine the most effective means and mechanisms 
for ensuring Canada can effectively manage its water resources. 
That includes the very active involvement of the provinces 
because within their own jurisdictions they have full authority 
over water resources. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The remarks by the minister are reassuring, given that not very 
long ago, the federal government, with its Bill C-14 on potable 
water, unacceptably meddled in provincial jurisdictions by 
setting up national standards on the quality of drinking water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear, even for the federal government, that our resource 
should be protected under the aegis of each of the provinces, 
which are responsible for this resource.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview—Greenwood, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I congratulate the member for Jonquière for her thoughts 
on this very important issue.  I believe Quebec has done more on 
evaluating and studying the issue of water than any other 
province in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years I have been amazed at the public service 
commitment to this issue and some of the creative ideas on 
pollution control and security of the resource, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe passionately that the Government of Canada must speak 
for all of Canada.  There is no doubt in my mind that we can have 
all the consultations in the world but let us look at the 
challenge we will face in time of the stabilization of the Great 
Lakes.  Most experts on climatic control in this country will 
tell us that in time we will need to stabilize the Great Lakes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We share those lakes with the United States. If we go through 
the exercise of stabilizing the Great Lakes, the Americans in my 
humble opinion would have to pay their share of that 
stabilization exercise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the member for Jonquière is whether she can see 
and support the notion that the Government of Canada must be the 
ultimate voice for a national water strategy and policy? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold:</B> Madam Speaker, before replying to the 
member opposite, I must say that I do not see the point of his 
comment.  Right now, we are talking about drinking water, and 
which level of government has jurisdiction over that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My response to the NDP proposal is to again refer to the

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ownership of lands and natural resources rests with the

</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My authority is a constitutional document that says, beyond any

rests with the provinces.  This leaves the provinces free to 
develop a mechanism for managing the resources within their

protected and involved in decision making.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I would like to ask the hon. member to clarify the term 
riparian rights.  Dealing with the common law that has 
accumulated in Canada over a number of years, riparian rights 
have been misinterpreted as water rights.  Riparian being derived 
from the French language, the member may have an insight into the 
difference between riparian rights and water rights. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold:</B> Pardon me, Madam 
Speaker, but I did not quite catch the beginning of the member's 
question.  Could he please repeat it? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte:</B>  Madam Speaker, when we are dealing 
with a national resource, such as water, which we deem to be of 
vital importance, our legal statutes and our legal history of 
common law have dealt with riparian rights but that does not deal 
with water rights.  Riparian is more about the shore bed and 
property adjacent to water, but with respect to the actual body 
of water and the rights to that water, there is no legal history 
in this country. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold:</B> Madam Speaker, I can 
only repeat what I told the hon. member opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From a constitutional point of view, the management of water 
resources is a provincial responsibility.  It is up to them to 
pass legislation in line with what the public wants— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> I am sorry to interrupt the 
member, but her time is up. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity this morning to speak to the NDP 
supply day motion which stipulates that the federal government 
act in co-operation with the provinces.  I have to emphasize that 
very much.  I want to pick up on what my learned colleague from 
Jonquière spoke about. It is imperative that the federal 
government recognize that there are jurisdictions with respect to 
water; they are provincial in nature rather than federal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, the Progressive Conservative Party will 
support the intent of this motion that an immediate moratorium 
should be placed on the export of bulk freshwater shipments and 
interbasin transfers and that legislation should be introduced to 
actually do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps no country in the world lives off its natural resources 
more than Canada does.  It is intrinsic on us to ensure that we 
have a viable environment for us to cultivate a number of the 
industries which actually make our economy work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to bring a little bit of perspective to this 
debate.  In January 1984 the Conservative government established 
an advisory committee to make recommendations for a federal 
government water policy.  It was known as the Pearse commission. 
It reported in 1985 and formed the basis of the 1987 federal 
government document entitled “Federal Water Policy”. 
The policy clearly stated that the federal government would not 
support the bulk export of freshwater, nor would it support the 
interbasin transfer of water for the purposes of export.

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1988 amid growing fears from the public that water exports 
would be permitted under the FTA, the Conservative government 
introduced Bill C-156, the Canada water preservation act.  This 
reiterated the same position taken in the federal water policy 
document.  An election was called and the bill was dropped from 
the Order Paper.  However, when parliament resumed, the 
Conservative government opted instead to amend the Free Trade 
Agreement Implementation Act to specifically exclude bulk water 
for the purposes of export from the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate resurfaced again during negotiations for NAFTA. Once 
again the government was forced to argue that the agreement would 
not compel Canadians to turn the tap on for their American 
neighbours.  Michael Wilson, the former Minister of Industry and 
International Trade, said in this House on April 1, 1992 “Let me 
state categorically that there has not been under negotiation, 
nor will there be under negotiation, any provision for the large 
scale export of water”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nonetheless to calm the reoccurring fears of Canadians, the 
government promised to introduce a side agreement at the time of 
ratification with the U.S. and Mexico that ensured Canadian 
sovereignty over domestic waters.  Charles Langlois, the former 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Industry and 
International Trade, said the following in this House on February 
4, 1993: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for water exports, Canada's position is clearly stated in the 
federal water policy adopted in 1987.  This policy forbids large 
scale water exports from Canada through the diversion of lake or 
river water.  Furthermore, section 7 of the law implementing the 
FTA between Canada and the U.S. clearly states that the agreement 
does not apply to water, except for bottled water to be drunk or 
stored in reservoirs.  This law has been in force since January 
1, 1989. Similarly the NAFTA does not include large scale water 
exports: the law implementing NAFTA will have a clause confirming 
Canada's sovereignty over its water resources. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new Liberal government received the credit for the signed 
commitment as it was in power when the deal with respect to this 
issue was ratified.  The Liberals said in their red book promises 
back in 1993 that they would bring forth further accords with the 
Americans with respect to ensuring that Canadian sovereignty over 
water would be held true.  However, they are in the sixth year of 
their mandate and they still have not brought forth any 
substantive legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NAFTA and the FTA ensured we did not ship bulk water 
transfers to the United States or any other country, but things 
have changed.  The world's desire for water has increased so it 
is imperative that we take this to a new level now and bring 
forth legislation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I have a question for the hon. member who made clear his 
party's intention with respect to the main motion.  Unless I 
missed it, he did not say how his party feels about the amendment 
which states that Canada should not be a party to any 
international agreement which compels us to export freshwater in 
bulk form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member made an argument about NAFTA and the FTA which I 
might have expected from someone from the party that was the 
original architect of the FTA and NAFTA.  I contend that his 
analysis of NAFTA is wrong and he is free to contend that it is 
right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should the hon member's analysis prove to be wrong over time, 
would he or would he not agree with the following which is 
contrary to his own analysis but not contrary to mine?  If NAFTA 
proved to be an agreement whereby at some future date, after we 
had in some way commercialized the export of water and therefore 
subject to the terms of NAFTA were not able to put an end to 
that, should we no longer be a party to such an agreement?

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just to elaborate, under the investment provisions of NAFTA when 
the discussion here today has focused so far on whether or not 
NAFTA would prevent us from banning exports or putting a ban on 
exports after we had begun to commercially exploit our water 
resources for export, it might also be that the investor 
provisions of NAFTA would be a hindrance to the Canadian 
government acting.  We already know that there is a company in 
British Columbia which is bringing an action against the Canadian 
government pursuant to NAFTA in the investor state provision 
because of a provincial ban. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a lot of reasons to believe that the member might be 
wrong on this.  If time proved him wrong, would he be willing to 
support the kind of action we have recommended in our amendment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  Madam Speaker, I do not think it would 
be in Canada's interest to belong to any kind of an accord where 
we would be compelled to sell anything that we did not really 
want to sell, that being bulk water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to NAFTA as it currently stands, I would like to 
quote the current Minister of Foreign Affairs when he stated in 
the House last week “The minister knows from past decades that 
the issue debated in this House is whether or not Canada is 
obliged under NAFTA to export water.  Of course, it is not”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to refer to another position. Tom Hockin who 
was the minister of state for small business and tourism stated 
in this House on September 17, 1992 “Here are the provisions 
under NAFTA.  As in the FTA, only water packaged as a beverage or 
in tanks is covered in NAFTA and water itself was not discussed 
during the NAFTA negotiations with the U.S. or Mexico”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we engage in some kind of a trade dispute with the Americans 
or another country pertaining to water, should we step aside from 
the free trade agreement?  I would think that would be very wrong 
for Canadians.  I would like to point out to the member that if 
we have had any kind of record growth in this economy over the 
last number of years it has been largely due to our resource base 
and our export driven economy. Our trade with the Americans prior 
to free trade was about $90 billion in 1988. Today it is well 
over $240 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Free trade has been very good for Canada.  It has been very good 
for the growth of our economy.  However, Canadians want to ensure 
that we maintain our environmental sovereignty including that of 
bulk water. 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview—Greenwood, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I want to suggest to the member for Fundy—Royal that 
the fact that Clayton Yeutter who was the free trade negotiator 
spent his entire life studying and planning North American water 
management should give us a heads up. Clayton Yeutter is now on 
the record as saying that water is a part of the free trade 
agreement, something he would not say 10 years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important that this House gets its head around this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  Madam Speaker, if the hon. member and 
the government really were that concerned over this issue, they 
have had six years to bring forward legislation and that has not 
been done. 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I am very honoured to have an opportunity to speak on a very 
crucial issue, the debate on water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before us challenges the federal government to 
consider that the export of bulk freshwater could be a major 
detriment to this country's ecosystem and that the federal 
government act on this.

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also seen a diminishing responsibility by the federal 
government by its transferring of responsibilities to the 
provinces.  Water is fundamentally different from any other 
natural resource on earth.  Without water life would cease to 
exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at countries that are asking for our freshwater 
resource we must ask ourselves whether the unnatural transfer of 
water is enough to sustain everybody on the planet.  Interbasin 
transfers would require water to be moved over tracts of land 
that historically may not have been bodies of water.  We know 
that when hydro development floods areas the mercury 
contamination of that body of water is of vital concern. 
Environmental, ecosystem and human health concerns must be a 
large part of the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at Canada's freshwater on any geographical map or 
when we fly in small airplanes in northern Canada, we view Canada 
as an indefinite supply of freshwater.  I believe hon. members 
would see through that mirage because that is all it is.  The 
gift of water that has been given to us is very limited.  We have 
to treasure it for our use and under the principles of 
sustainable development extend it for future generations.  We 
must do this in a collective manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion also deals with Canada's sovereign right to water. 
Before any trade agreements are even considered or implicated in 
the issue of water our in house issue of sovereign right to 
jurisdiction over water must be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have had a wake-up call, I must remind the Chair that I am 
sharing my time with the hon. member for Winnipeg Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give a lesson to the secretary of state by referring to 
Winnipeg.  Winnipeg is a Cree term, Winnipek.  It means dirty 
water.  If we deem the sources of our water to be unclean, just 
imagine what we have done to the country and its sources of water 
with the impact of the industrial revolution on the continent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  The Winnipegization of North America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte:</B>  The Winnipegization of North America. 
I challenge the House to clearly define the jurisdiction of water 
in the country.  When the country was negotiated under treaty 
with the aboriginal peoples the term and rights to water were not 
defined.  Referring to the oral history of treaty negotiations, I 
will read a passage from a report called “Aski Puko” which 
means the land alone in which Daniel MacKenzie asked: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the land was sold what exactly was sold?  When the treaty

negotiated or sold.  The people mostly make their living from the 
water and also from the land.  However in the treaty there is no 
mention of water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The water was assumed as the lifeblood for all nations and all 
people.  Ownership of water was assumed.  It was assumed that 
everybody had access to it.  When we discuss interbasin 
transfers, bulk export, the whole concept of the ecosystem and 
the impact, obligations under the treaty are in breach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at our opportunities under sustainable development. 
Our challenge is to look after our environment and social and 
economic needs in an even manner.  Water will play a major role 
in our future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we start transferring water to deserted areas such as the 
desertification of the southwest, climate disruptions are 
forecast by science.  We have seen evidence of that.  If we 
transfer water prematurely it may not address the needs of urban 
and growing populations to the south or the urban populations of 
countries that need our exports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to look at how we can sustain our lives in this country. 
As more people move to Canada and find a home here they must have 
a place in which to live.  We cannot recklessly abandon our water 
resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>China will be the first country in the world to literally 
restructure its economy to respond to its water scarcity. 
Countries are making such changes.  We see examples of cities 
collapsing in some countries because water is no longer usable. 
We also have a UN commission on sustainable development that 
found water usage growing at twice the rate of the population 
increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we have an abundance of water in Canada we may be abusing the 
gift of water as we have it now.  Jurisdiction is of vital 
importance.  There are communities in northern Canada, most of 
which are aboriginal communities, that do not have running water 
or sewage treatment plants because the economic and commercial 
interests of those regions cannot afford it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an opportunity to create clean, fresh water in the 
country.  In terms of federal jurisdiction there was a major 
change in the early 1990s when Environment Canada started cutting 
budgets to deal with the science and research of water.  We must 
revisit our federal obligations to the rightful use of fresh 
water, to our jurisdiction over water in dealing with our 
provincial, federal and aboriginal obligations.  The Manitoba 
Natural Resources Transfer Act indicated in 1930 that traditional 
lands and waters for social and economic benefits must be 
considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this debate about water is by no means complete today. It is 
an opportunity for us to review the federal jurisdiction over 
water and to put a moratorium on the export and interbasin 
transfer of water.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to an issue that is very timely, very critical. 
I feel strongly about the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coming from the province of Manitoba, I would like to start my 
remarks by pointing out that I have some personal knowledge and 
background of how striking it can be when people get seized of 
the issue of moving water around on a grand scale in terms of 
moving water from one basin to another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a carpenter working on hydro projects, I personally witnessed 
the diversion of the Nelson, Churchill and Burntwood River 
systems to feed water to power hydro electric dams and the 
devastation that caused, certainly the flooding of the area, et 
cetera, they had to reclaim to create this great reservoir and 
the impact it had on aboriginal communities.  I think of that 
first and foremost as we deal with this subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to share a story with the House because it points to the 
absolute fixation generations have had on moving water around in 
a grand scheme.  Another reason I raise Manitoba as an example is 
that the current Premier of Manitoba is an engineer by trade. His 
engineering thesis was on an idea to use nuclear blasts to blow 
up the Red River Valley to divert the water from Lake Winnipeg 
and reverse its flow, as unbelievable as that sounds, to sell the 
water to the States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is recent history.  We are talking the mid-1960s.  People 
were seized with the issue.  People in universities were playing 
with ideas that today sound almost comical.  They are ridiculous. 
Serious people were dealing with the idea of moving our water 
around, never mind the impact on the environment or on future 
generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to what Brian Mulroney said in 1986, I believe Canada's 
water is not for sale.  I believe our freshwater is a public 
trust and not a private commodity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last May the foreign affairs minister of the current government 
promised to take measures to protect Canadian water after a 
public outcry greeted the news that companies were on the brink 
of exporting bulk water to foreign markets.  We were anxiously 
awaiting measures that might satisfy the fear of Canadians in 
this regard and nothing has been forthcoming.  It is all the more 
timely that the NDP used its opposition motion today to raise 
this critical issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A drain on our freshwater is a drain on the public trust.  This 
generation of Canadians has been charged with the responsibility 
to care for this precious commodity.  I use that term not in the 
marketing aspect.  It is a commodity, as the previous speaker 
pointed out, that is more precious than any dollar value we could 
possibly put on it, given the nature of the health implications 
of access to free water for any successful community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increasing water scarcity and the world-wide destruction of the 
health of the aquatic ecosystem are creating a global water 
crisis.  It is not overstating it to point out that virtually 
every country of the world, especially the developing nations, 
are seized with the issue of access to freshwater as a primary 
concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not only the developing nations.  Obviously the main 
pressure on Canada is our partner to the south, our main trading 
partner, which has serious water problems.  It should come as no 
surprise to us that the Americans are very interested in any idea 
that might help them to alleviate these problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Colorado River runs dry before it hits the ocean.  One of 
the great water systems of North America is being so taxed and 
resources are being siphoned out to such a degree that it no 
longer reaches the ocean.  There is such a screaming demand as 
the population booms in California that the Americans are willing 
to entertain any idea no matter how ridiculous it may seem to 
Canadians to get access to something we have an adequate supply 
of at least currently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I lived in British Columbia I remember one of the ideas of 
Wacky Bennett, another premier under whom I have lived who had 
some questionable ideas about water.  This was Wacky Senior, the 
original Wacky who wanted—this is wacky in itself—to flood the 
Skagit valley. 
He wanted to divert rivers to flood the Skagit Valley. Those 
members who have been to B.C. would know what a massive 
undertaking that would be, to divert huge river systems down that 
valley again into the United States and ultimately to the 
insatiable market of California.

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These ideas keep springing up.  This is what is truly worrisome 
to most Canadians.  Often free marketers, often right wing 
governments, will do almost anything to make water a marketable 
commodity.  It is very much a worry of ours when we heard the 
Minister of International Trade say: “Today's water will be 
tomorrow's oil”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any time we allow ourselves to think along those lines we are 
leaving ourselves open to the many people who would like to see 
water become a real trading commodity and would like to build it 
into free trade agreements, somehow have a default mechanism or 
some kind of tied selling mechanism. If we buy into the aspects 
of a trade agreement that we want and are interested in, we are 
also going to be tied into some aspect of having to share our 
water, maybe in a way far beyond whatever we wished or 
contemplated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would think the two examples I pointed out would be disastrous 
for the well-being of North Americans, using nuclear blasts to 
blast out the Red River Valley and divert Lake Winnipeg and then 
flood the Skagit Valley.  Those are only two schemes. All 
throughout history we have been hearing these ideas, recent 
history certainly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1959 there was an idea put forward by T.W. Kierans of Sudbury 
called the GRAND project, the great replenishment and northern 
development canal.  His idea was that the rivers feeding James 
Bay would be dammed up and a series of pumps would then lift the 
river flow upstream and over the great east-west divide and from 
there into the Great Lakes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that kind of massive restructuring, how could we contemplate 
being so arrogant as to use the technology that we now have to 
irreversibly change the flow of water, the great divide?  Imagine 
the impact on the ecosystem.  We talk about environmental impact 
studies.  We have never thought of anything on that grand a 
scale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1964 General McNaughton, chair of the Canadian section of the 
international joint commission, talked about the North American 
Water and Power Alliance plan, which again is to flood the Rocky 
Mountain trench. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have people wanting to flood the Skagit Valley and flood 
the Rocky Mountain trench and turn it into a giant reservoir for 
North America, again to divert water to the U.S. and Mexico. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it any wonder with ideas like this being floated by credible 
people, by knowledgeable scientists of the era, Canadians are now 
forming alliances to try to protect ourselves from those very 
ideas? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we speak today the Council of Canadians is in Ottawa speaking 
to this very issue, voicing its concern that water is to be the 
next marketable commodity and we are going to be somehow tied 
through free trade agreements to a relationship that we are not 
comfortable with and not ready for dealing with water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at the way our free trade agreements tie us into heating 
fuel, for instance.  There are clauses in the NAFTA and in the 
FTA that if we run short of heating fuel domestically, we are 
tied to selling at the same rate we are selling it currently to 
our partners to the south.  We are very fearful of similar things 
coming along to do with water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a few things we must keep in mind.  There is a global 
water crisis.  There are corporate water giants eager to use 
water as a for profit basis to serve the world's needs and our 
government has not done anything to clearly state what our policy 
is to be on the international trade of bulk water or the 
diversion of water from one basin to another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope this opposition day motion is dealt with favourably from 
all sides of the House.  We can feel comfortable that as we form 
new trade alliances water will not be one of those marketable 
commodities that we would forfeit.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
want to make a short comment to the member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going back a few years, long before he was born I suspect. 
I was not very old myself but I can remember a certain situation 
regarding the state of Colorado, the state of New Mexico and the 
state of Texas with regard to the Rio Grande River which starts 
in the state of Colorado and flowed down through the other states 
supplying a much needed water source for both drinking and 
irrigation purposes, as these farm areas are reliant on water for 
irrigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Somewhere around the 1940s, I believe, the state of Colorado 
decided to build what it called a continental reservoir.  It 
dammed up the Rio Grande River at its head in an effort to try to 
conserve much of the spring run-off and then distribute it over 
the year through some kind of agreement it tried to come up with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can remember during those years the emotions and how high they 
ran over water.  I never saw a group of people more emotional, to 
the point where they were ready to take up arms and have range 
wars.  They were willing to do anything over this supply of 
water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am thinking largely of tributaries that start in Canada and 
run through to the states. What extent does the member think this 
country should have over a natural resource such as water that 
flows to other areas of the world, particularly the United 
States?  What kind of control should we have over that water 
situation?  If he feels we should have strong controls, how do we 
enforce that without creating the emotional disturbance that I 
can guarantee it would cause through trying to control a water 
source? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Madam Speaker, I think that is a very 
reasonable question and a good example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think there are relationships that have been developed dealing 
with water rights even within rural municipalities where one 
creek will run through one person's property and on to another. 
At no time is the property owner allowed to cut off the supply of 
water altogether to create a backwater, a slew or a lake on their 
own property, a reservoir of any kind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are water rights agreements that are negotiated.  Right 
back to the Magna Carta there is reference to water rights I 
believe.  I do not think anything in our motion deals 
specifically with that international flow of natural sources of 
water.  We were more specifically talking about the bulk sale of 
water and the diversion from one basin to another to make water 
move in an unnatural way and force it into another basin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To answer the member's question, which is very legitimate, I 
believe there are international water rights treaties currently 
in effect just as there are interprovincial treaties. The most 
relevant example I can think of is the Garrison diversion project 
in southern Manitoba which deals with farmers in North Dakota. 
The river actually dips across the international boundary many 
times as it snakes its way along the North Dakota-Manitoba 
border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The farmers in North Dakota, worried about source, wanted to 
build the Garrison diversion project on the American side 
obviously which would nip off the flow back into Canada.  That 
has been stopped by very rancorous negotiating between the 
provincial government and the state government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am comfortable that we have the wherewithal to negotiate the 
free movement of natural sources of water across international 
borders.  Our motion does not specifically deal with that natural 
flow of water.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
will be sharing my time with the member for Waterloo—Wellington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Usually when I speak on the identity of Canadians I find myself 
speaking on our health care system.  Today I am pleased that I am 
able to speak on what is truly our Canadian heritage which is 
clean lakes and rocky shores.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This discussion is a welcome response to the efforts begun by 
the federal government over the last year to review and update 
the 1987 federal water policy.  Last summer we began a dialogue 
with all the provincial and territorial agencies with an interest 
in water management and on the development of a federal 
freshwater strategy.  Provinces and territories indicated their 
interest in working with us on solutions to the full range of 
freshwater issues.  Their involvement is important given their 
primary responsibility for water management in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada recognizes the priority that Canadians 
place on clean, productive and secure freshwater resources and 
ecosystems.  It recognizes its responsibility to provide 
leadership.  We believe that stewardship over waters is the 
responsibility not only of governments but of all Canadians. This 
dialogue in the House today advances participation, decision, 
commitment and action by all of us on the entire spectrum of 
concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to put the discussion on this topic in perspective 
in the context of our endowment of freshwater resources from 
coast to coast to coast and the full range of issues which 
challenge us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed federal freshwater strategy will focus on issues 
where we can strengthen co-operation and ensure a more effective 
response to the challenges we share in the management of our 
inheritance.  It will provide a snapshot of the state of 
freshwater in Canada, a review of the federal policy over the 
last 10 years and an overview of federal objectives, principles 
and strategies and a summary of issues and policy directions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the hon. member prepared this motion I am sure he was 
struck by the breadth, depth and complexities of the issues that 
define the scope of freshwater policy in Canada today.  I hope we 
can all agree that the policy concerns that face us are much 
broader and pervasive than the single issue of bulk water 
exports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada we are in situation unique in the world.  Our supply 
of water is abundant. In our rivers almost 10% of the world's 
renewable supply of water flows to the sea.  Our lakes cover more 
than 7% of our land and our wetlands cover almost 15%.  Our needs 
for water are many.  Essential for all life, water is required 
for irrigating crops, supporting fish and wildlife, commercial 
fisheries, farm animals, recreation, tourism, transportation, 
manufacturing, for living in a city or at home.  Most of our 
industry and population is located within that narrow band along 
our southern border.  Most of our rivers flow north to the Arctic 
Ocean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a group, Canadians are not doing a very good job of managing 
our supply of water.  At home each of us uses more than 300 
litres a day, twice as much as the average European.  But there 
is good news.  Manufacturers are making steady progress toward 
more efficient use of water.  In the steel, pulp and paper 
industries new technology, recycling and higher efficiencies are 
substantially cutting the amount of water used in production 
processes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As elected officials, custodians of our natural resources, we 
must meet the challenges of conserving, enhancing and passing on 
to our children and grandchildren our great wealth in water 
resources.  Some of the opposition today raised concerns about 
drinking water and sewage systems in our cities and towns.  This 
is an issue that must be addressed in the full context of 
managing our waters.  The provision of municipal water and sewer 
infrastructure is primarily the responsibility of provinces, 
territories and municipalities in Canada.  They are facing 
significant challenges.  Demand for water is increasing while 
water revenues have not kept up with maintenance costs. Canadians 
rank second in the world in their per capita water consumption 
and pay only half the costs of water supply. Over the next 10 
years the costs of maintaining this infrastructure are estimated 
at $40 billion to $70 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal water policy has been clear on this issue since 1987. 
We want to ensure that Canadians have ready access to safe, clean 
drinking water and to protect our freshwater systems from 
pollution for municipal sewage systems.  We have also worked 
through the council of Canadian Environment ministers on a plan 
to encourage municipal water use efficiency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the best ways we have to protect our water is to reduce 
the demand. Canadians must begin to take steps to conserve this 
precious resource.  In recent years the federal government has 
contributed over $700 million to water and sewer infrastructure 
improvements in Canadian communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In another area public attention is focused on atmospheric 
change.  Human induced changes to the atmosphere including 
climate change, ozone depletion and pollution have the potential 
to profoundly affect the health and viability of ecosystems. 
Increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases may play a role in 
increased frequency of floods, tornados, severe storms and 
similar events.

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These could cut down our supplies of clean, productive and 
secure freshwater sources in various parts of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will continue to co-ordinate and conduct research 
on the impact of atmospheric change on our freshwater ecosystems. 
The federal government's commitment to research into our water 
resources is reflected in the science, impacts and adaptation 
component of the climate change action fund.  This fund, which 
was created in the 1998 budget, commits $50 million per year for 
the next three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pollution is another important issue.  Merely looking at the 
lakes and rivers in our country, let alone entering the water or 
drinking it, makes it obvious that pollution is a most urgent 
concern. Federal legislation in recent years, along with such 
programs as pollution prevention, a federal strategy for action, 
has achieved some success in preventing the growth of pollution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increasingly aggressive management of toxic substances has 
responded to Canadians' concerns about the protection of public 
health.  The federal government is committed to having strong 
legislation and effective programs to protect human health from 
all forms of pollution, especially those that threaten safe 
drinking water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is co-operating with provincial and 
territorial governments to advance the science of flood 
prediction and provide information and services for weather 
warnings to enhance our forecasting capabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have indicated the water context in which this motion should 
be considered.  There are many aspects to federal freshwater 
policies and programs as urgent as bulk water exports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me for a moment address the opposition's concern related to 
the interbasin transfers of water.  The federal government, as 
clearly articulated in the 1987 federal water policy, does not 
support in principle interbasin transfers because of the 
potential impact on the social, economic and environmental 
integrity of our watersheds. Most provincial water management 
regimes also respect this principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Examples of impacts on interbasin transfers include the 
potential biotic transfer and contamination, the fragility of our 
ecosystems, particularly northern ecosystems which are very 
vulnerable to even small changes and recover slowly or not at 
all, the concerns of first nations whose ways of life are 
intimately tied to the cycles of abundance of water, depletion of 
water resources available to downstream communities and the loss 
of recreational and commercial benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I congratulate the hon. member for initiating a dialogue 
in the House on this important issue.  However, when we consider 
what legislation and regulation is required, it is vital that 
these encompass all the major issues.  We must not approach 
legislation piecemeal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must work in co-operation and collaboration with provincial 
and territorial governments which have primary and direct 
responsibility for the water resources of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate is timely.  We can support those parts of the 
proposed motion that call for co-operative action with the 
provinces and territories and for a focus on the prohibition of 
interbasin transfers.  The federal government continues to work 
with the provinces and territories to protect, preserve and 
conserve our freshwater resources for future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are applying a comprehensive approach that will examine the 
demands and environmental pressures on Canada's watersheds and 
water basins.  We will be inviting interested Canadians to 
participate in the development of a federal freshwater strategy 
this spring.  I look forward in the future to a debate on the 
full range of issues which comprise a proper federal freshwater 
strategy. 
<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, the hon. member spoke about the context 
in which today's motion takes place, and I agree that it is a 
much larger context than simply the focus of the motion.  She 
referred on a number of occasions to the co-operation required 
between the federal government and provincial and territorial 
governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could she comment as to whether she sees any role at all for 
aboriginal people in this co-operation and consultation process? 
Would she agree that, in spite of what some have referred to as a 
renewable resource, water is not necessarily a renewable 
resource?  If we upset the ecosystem or the drainage basin or 
whatever, we may find ourselves in a situation where it is no 
longer a renewable resource. I think of the Aral Sea situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Bennett:</B>  Madam Speaker, this past summer 
being in Nunavut and recognizing the importance those people 
place on water and how important it is to their everyday lives 
and in terms of the international perspective they feel in terms 
of Canada's responsibility to make sure the world, the north and 
all the polar nations look after their water, I heartily agree 
with the hon. member.

extremely important part of this government's next step in terms 
of the consultation process and that they will be involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the hon. member is right. We must on a daily basis 
remind all Canadians that we cannot count on anything.  We can 
ruin this resource and that we have to always be prudent 
caretakers of our most precious resource and that calling it 
renewable, if we are not taking care, is indeed incorrect and 
foolhardy. 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is an appropriate time for the House to discuss this motion 
regarding the issue of water exports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise in support of the motion before the House today calling 
on the government to work in co-operation with the provinces to 
implement an immediate moratorium on the export bulk freshwater 
shipments and interbasin transfers and to implement legislation 
giving this moratorium greater force.  I think that is very 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only are Canadians very concerned about this vital resource, 
global demands for water are continually increasing and this 
trend is unlikely to stop in the near future.  We must act now to 
ensure not only that domestic water resources are protected in 
times of future demand but that in times of plenty we maintain 
control of our water resources so as not to damage the ecosystems 
on which we all depend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several members have today mentioned the vital role which water 
plays in all our lives.  This cannot be emphasized too much. We 
cannot live without water.  That is obvious.  It is a source of 
life not only for human beings but for plants and animals and the 
entirety of our complex ecosystems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many ways we are in a privileged position today with roughly 
20% of the world's freshwater supplies falling within our 
borders.  It would appear at first glance that we have little to 
worry about when it comes to protecting our water from 
commercialization by domestic and foreign investors.  After all, 
since we have so much of it, it seems reasonable to suggest we 
might sell some of it off to increase our tax base or give it 
away to those in need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps it appears too reasonable.  In reality it is simply not 
that simple.  With privilege comes responsibility.  While we all 
understand in the most basic terms how water contributes to our 
daily lives, to agriculture and to industry, we do not understand 
the full extent to which water fuels each and every mechanism of 
life.  If we abuse our privilege we may neglect our 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have so much water in so many different forms, frozen, in 
marshlands and some of the world's largest lakes and underground. 
These different forms are interconnected but we do not fully 
appreciate how. We cannot afford then to permit actions, the 
consequences of which are uncertain. The cumulative impact of 
numerous withdrawals of water, whether for export or not, is a 
serious concern to all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a 1985 study the international joint commission repeatedly 
highlighted this issue in particular with respect to the Great 
Lakes.  Individual export projects of apparently minor effect 
could create pressure to open the Great Lakes and other bodies of 
water to other commercial initiatives. To be certain the 
consequences are unpredictable. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a duty to protect our water.  We have a duty to continue 
to develop advanced water management and conservation 
techniques, since the world's water resources are heading toward 
exhaustion and other countries are looking to Canada for 
leadership. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can best fulfil our future role in this regard by taking 
actions now to protect our water for future generations.  While 
there may be debate among members present on how best to prohibit 
future bulk water removal projects, whether for export or not, it 
is important that any public dialogue on this crucial issue be 
undertaken from a position of truthfulness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can I be clearer?  Canada is not on the verge of opening the 
floodgates.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first reason is grounded in simple economics.  No removal of 
water in bulk export from Canada now occurs because at present 
the bulk export of water is not economically viable.  Shipping by 
tanker, pipeline or other means is prohibitively expensive due to 
the high costs of shipping, infrastructure and the low present 
value of the product.  Entrepreneurs continue to explore and 
propose export initiatives but the likelihood of a profitable 
venture is remote.  For those few exceptions that do occur, none 
is undertaken for commercial purposes.  They are limited to the 
sharing of treated water with a few neighbouring U.S. communities 
and a few instances of the trucking of small quantities and 
volumes of groundwater to the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not expect a water export boom now or in the near future. 
Without the immediate threat of a water export boom or even a 
mild flow it is essential that we approach this very complex 
issue from a position of responsibility, bearing in mind that the 
global need for water could rise dramatically one day.  We must 
take steps now to ensure the protection of the health of our 
environment for future generations.  We must not be lured by the 
idea of quick votes or band-aid solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The comprehensive approach that recognizes shared 
responsibilities for water management is exactly what is needed. 
We must work with our provincial and territorial partners and 
others to develop an all round strategy that gets it right the 
first time.  We must ensure that in moving to stop bulk exports 
of water we do not mistakenly infringe upon existing uses of 
water, for example the case of the bottled water industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Value added products like bottled spring water are profitable 
exports.  There is little evidence available to suggest that 
small scale removals can be justifiably prohibited on 
environmental grounds. Export trade in bottled water amounts to 
240 million litres annually at a value of approximately $173 
million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few moments ago I mentioned a second reason why Canadians 
should not be unduly alarmed by the threat of multinational 
corporations thirstily waiting to suck our lakes dry.  Thanks in 
large part to the Canadian Constitution the provinces have 
embraced their responsibilities for water management.  The 
federal government has responsibilities for boundary waters under 
the boundary waters treaty of 1909.  Provinces have 
responsibility for water within their boundaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through its consultations this past summer and fall, the federal 
government discussed with the provinces the growing network of 
policies, regulation and legislation in place or that soon will 
be implemented to prohibit the interbasin transfer and removal of 
water in bulk from within provincial boundaries.  Six of ten 
provinces are pursuing or have formal legislation, regulations or 
policy dealing with exports or bulk removal from watersheds.  For 
example, in western Canada British Columbia's water protection 
act prohibits the removal of water from the province except in 
containers of 20 litres or less in existing tanker truck 
shipments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alberta's 1996 water act amendment came into force with the 
promulgation of regulations on January 1, 1999.  It prohibits the 
export of untreated water with special legislative approval. 
Manitoba opposes interbasin water transfers.  Saskatchewan 
recently announced that it will continue to introduce legislation 
regarding the removal of water from its watersheds.  Ontario has 
a new policy prohibiting the transfer of service water out of 
Ontario water basins, including the Great Lakes.  It has recently 
announced its intention to implement regulations to give this 
policy greater force.  Quebec is conducting a public review of 
provincial water policy at this time. Nova Scotia will soon 
release a water resource management strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have every reason to believe the provinces will address the 
issue of water export.  We know that will happen in the very near 
future.  These many legislative mechanisms are already in place 
or are in the works.  It seems clear that the support of today's 
motion will extend well beyond the confines of this House which 
is important to note.  I look forward to the results of today's 
vote so we can move forward quickly on this very important 
matter.  There is much work to be done in this area and I look 
forward to it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
happy to take part in the debate on the NDP supply day motion. 
The broad thrust of the motion is essentially to protect Canadian 
sovereignty over our water.  While I take issue with the way the 
NDP may want to achieve that, no Canadian would probably disagree 
with the objective that Canadians need to have control over our 
water. 
We need to decide what we will do with it and Canadians have to 
come first in that equation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been a longstanding Reform policy that we support the 
idea that Canadians have sovereignty over their water supply.  We 
indicated that we would have liked to have had the Canada-U.S. 
free trade agreement and the subsequent NAFTA amended to reflect 
that position.  Unfortunately that was not done, and we have to 
ask why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1988 when the Conservative government negotiated the free 
trade agreement with the United States water was not dealt with. 
Essentially the result of that left some concern as to whether 
water was on the table.  There was a great deal of debate as to 
whether water was subject to the free trade agreement between 
Canada and the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Leading up to the negotiations for the NAFTA there was a lot of 
debate and an opportunity to correct any misinterpretation that 
might have existed under the free trade agreement itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current Prime Minister was on record on several occasions 
stating that water would not be on the table in any agreement 
that he signed.  The Liberal red book said that the NAFTA was an 
opportunity to correct any flaws that existed within the free 
trade agreement with the United States.  Some of the comments 
made by the Prime Minister at the time suggested that this was a 
flaw, that water was not properly protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote a couple of his comments to verify what I am 
talking about.  On November 19, 1993 the Prime Minister said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Water and the North American Free Trade Agreement do not mix. 
Water remains under the control of the Canadian government.  I 
can guarantee that. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I doubt that is the case and I will explain why in just a 
moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few days prior to that he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not allow any large water exports to take place as long as 
I am Prime Minister.  Nor will I sign any international bilateral 
trade agreements that obligate Canada to export water. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us examine for a moment what in fact he got.  When the NAFTA 
was negotiated the Liberal government said it would not sign it 
unless there was a labour and environmental agreement within the 
main body of the NAFTA.  Presumably from his comments the Prime 
Minister was going to make the case that he would not sign the 
NAFTA unless he also received a specific exemption for our water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He got exemptions for raw logs and unprocessed fish, but somehow 
a provision concerning bulk freshwater exports was not included. 
What he got was a side agreement that was not adequate.  It does 
not in any way address the concern because it is an appendix.  It 
is not a part of the agreement itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The side agreement states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NAFTA creates no rights to the natural water resources of any 
Party to the Agreement.  Unless water, in any form, has entered 
into commerce and becomes a good or product, it is not covered by 
the provisions of any trade agreement, including the NAFTA.  And 
nothing in the NAFTA would oblige any NAFTA Party to either 
exploit its water for commercial use, or to begin exporting water 
in any form. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The essential portion of the side agreement states “Unless 
water, in any form, has entered into commerce and become a good 
or product...”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does that mean?  When could the United States or Mexico ask 
for Canadian water?  As we are aware, water comes under 
provincial jurisdiction.  Presumably any province could say that 
it wanted to export water, but I do not think that would happen. 
But that is not enough to cover it. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1235"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Water only has to come into commerce.  It can be done 
domestically between companies in Canada.  Then we could not say 
that American or Mexican companies do not have have access to a 
particular body of water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister blew it.  He said he was going to protect 
Canadian sovereignty over freshwater, but he did not achieve 
that.  He got a side agreement which essentially says that when 
bulk water comes into commerce, even domestically in Canada, then 
under the provisions of the NAFTA and the free trade agreement 
before it all parties have access to that particular body of 
water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us examine how that could take place.  There have been 
several proposals put forward by the provinces to have that come 
into effect.  If one province decided that it was going to drain 
a lake and sell the water to a Canadian company, that is all it 
would take to trigger the mechanism.  Then, under the 
non-discrimination aspects of the NAFTA, that province could not 
deny access to an American or Mexican company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That may not be a bad thing, but let us not try to fool the 
public.  We do not have sovereignty or control over our water as 
a result of the agreement signed by Canada, Mexico and the United 
States.  It simply does not exist.  The only way that we can stop 
the export of water is to work co-operatively with the provinces 
to build the awareness that if water from a particular source 
comes into commerce other companies will have access to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to support the NDP motion because we want to 
ensure that Canada maintains control of its water.  We need to 
set the agenda and that is one way we could do it.  The provinces 
do not have to give a licence to any particular company to build 
a domestic industry on water exports.  The provinces have the 
right to say yes or no, just the way they do when they give 
access to forest products.  In forest management areas in Alberta 
or British Columbia the provincial governments have the right to 
say “You have access to a certain amount of trees in this forest 
management area”.  However, the provinces do not have the right 
to deny access to an American or Mexican company if a Canadian 
company has access. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to be careful of that provision.  Let us not try to fool 
people.  That is the only way that control over our water can 
actually take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure what the Minister of the Environment envisions in 
the legislation which she will be introducing in a couple of 
weeks, but it appears that provincial-federal co-operation is 
necessary if we are to maintain control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that Canadians maintain control over their 
water.  What we decide to do with it has to be our agenda.  I am 
not suggesting that at some point down the road Canadians may 
decide there needs to be some sale of water, but I do not think 
that is the case now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very emotional issue.  Bottled water is sold on a 
commercial basis.  Then there is the other extreme, that of the 
interbasin transfer of water which scares the heck out of people. 
I farm in Alberta.  I know what can happen when people change 
water routes.  It is a very emotional issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important that we give serious thought to the NDP 
motion which is before us today.  We will be supporting the main 
motion and we encourage others to do so to try to bring some 
sense and reason to the whole idea that we need to have 
federal-provincial co-operation in order to have control over our 
Canadian waters.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion states “the government should, in co-operation with 
the provinces”, but there seems to be unfinished business with 
the treaty obligations that were made during the acquisition of 
this country and the rights to resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Water is a major concern, along with a lot of the aboriginal 
rights that have been discussed recently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my understanding 
that under the Canadian Constitution water is a natural resource 
that is under provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there are concerns in the area that my hon. friend is talking 
about, those concerns need to be discussed at the provincial 
level to see if some kind of an agreement or arrangement can be 
worked out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte:</B>  Mr. Speaker, another situation 
concerning jurisdiction is the issue of Canadian sovereign rights 
over the freshwater resources of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the member's view on the privatization of some of the 
water sources in this country, either drawn from wells or 
aquifers, at municipal sites?  I know that everybody has assumed 
that municipal and local governments have jurisdiction over and 
manage water, but there have been recent developments in some 
provinces which have privatized water and sanitary services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is his view toward this evolution of privatizing those 
sources of water, which inevitably might be a concern for 
freshwater as well? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very familiar with 
the whole aspect of water in terms of groundwater sources 
available to Canadian residents as a primary water supply.  It is 
a very important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Peace River a lot of our neighbours farm.  We have an oil 
industry that also uses freshwater from aquifers to recover more 
oil from the fields. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very important issue that has just been raised.  We have 
to make sure that we protect the water supply for residential use 
as a primary responsibility because there are other sources of 
water available to industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Saltwater aquifers can also be used to flood those oil 
formations.  They do not have to use freshwater.  It is a concern 
that I have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of people in the area that I live have water wells 
which are either drying up or levels which are going down.  That 
has probably been happening because the industry has been pumping 
for something like 100 years.  I do not think the industry in 
that case should have the right to our aquifers of freshwater 
that have taken in some cases hundreds of years to develop into 
the quality of water that we have now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to be very careful in allowing industry to use potable 
water.  It is a precious resource that takes time to develop.  It 
seems to me that industry should be allowed to use water in these 
endeavours, but it should have to use water that is not potable 
and does not compete with residential usage in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from an area that was initially explored by Palliser, who

it is unique because without it, we cannot live. We could learn 
to live without coal.  We could learn to live without wood and we 
could probably learn to live without precious metals.  Technology 
today has enabled us to become less dependent on raw natural 
resources but it has not enabled us to live without water.

their utility bill, it is impossible to put a price on the value 
of freshwater to people, plants, animals and ecosystems.

power to evoke strong emotions in the hearts and minds of 
Canadians.  It is no wonder then that when it is threatened, it 
provokes powerful emotions. Today we are here to discuss the root 
cause of these strong emotions.  We are here to discuss the 
future of our most precious resource, a resource that is being 
threatened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My NDP colleagues have introduced a motion that would 
immediately act to protect Canada's control over its water.  The 
motion with the amendment reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should, in 
co-operation with the provinces, place an immediate moratorium on 
the export of bulk freshwater shipments and interbasin transfers 
and should introduce legislation to prohibit bulk freshwater 
exports and interbasin transfers and should not be a party to any 
international agreement that would compel us to export water 
against our will, in order to assert Canada's sovereign right to 
protect, preserve and conserve our freshwater resources for 
future generations. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I am glad that we are finally being given the 
opportunity to discuss this issue in the House, I am sorry it has 
taken so long.  The Liberal government has promised time and time 
again that it would introduce legislation that would protect our 
water.  Still there is nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 the present Prime Minister promised that he would obtain 
a special exemption for water under NAFTA.  Exemptions were 
already obtained by Canada's negotiators for raw logs, cultural 
industries and some fish products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In November 1993 our Prime Minister assured Canadians that our 
water was not for sale.  He said “Water is not in NAFTA.  Water 
remains under the control of the Canadian government.  I want 
Canada to maintain control over our own water.  It is not for 
sale.  And if we want to sell it, we will decide”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, we know all to well that NAFTA was signed into effect 
without exempting water.  The problem was that water was never 
discussed in the appropriate fashion.  It was never given the 
weight of importance it needed to have in those discussions, the 
importance that it has to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In March 1996 the member for Kamloops introduced a bill that 
would prohibit the export of water by interbasin transfers.  It 
was during debate on that bill that the Parliamentary Secretary 
to the Minister for International Cooperation assured the House 
that the Liberal government was consulting Canadians, that his 
government was currently conducting a review of its programs and 
legislation relating to sustaining Canada's water resources. He 
promised that through this review a comprehensive approach to 
water could be developed, including legislative measures to 
address water export. This debate ended several years ago, and we 
have not seen a single line of legislation that would protect 
Canada's sovereignty over its water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 15, 1998 the member for Davenport asked the Minister of 
the Environment if she had plans to introduce legislation to ban 
the export of bulk freshwater.  The member was assured that he 
had nothing to worry about because the introduction of 
legislation respecting our water was a priority for her 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again in October when the government was asked about a national 
water policy, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs assured the House that water was of prime 
importance to the country and that his government would be laying 
out a comprehensive strategy on the issue in the fall. I have not 
seen any comprehensive strategies laid out by this government 
since the fall, let alone one on the protection of our most 
valuable resource, freshwater.

more and more important.  We have seen in recent times some 
actions by foreign countries in regard to our water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time and again this Liberal government has failed to protect the 
interests of Canadians.  I am concerned about the future of our 
freshwater resources.  We all know that Canada has the world's 
largest reserves of freshwater, possessing 25% of the world's 
supply and 9% of the world's renewable freshwater.  I would like 
to give some scenarios and examples of what has happened in the 
world and some of the things that have been proposed for our 
water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last century many of the wars fought across the world 
were fought over oil.  Oil was always considered our most 
precious resource.  It was worth more than its weight in gold. 
During the 1970s oil crisis our economies were almost shut down 
because they were denied access to cheap oil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have here a resource far more valuable than oil.  We have a 
freshwater resource.  It is estimated that the world's 
consumption of freshwater is doubling every 20 years.  By 2025 
almost two-thirds of the world's population will be facing 
restricted water supplies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The U.S. is the world's largest per capita user of water.  Much 
of the pressure to export our water has come from the Americans. 
Because of this, some scenarios have taken place in the past. One 
scenario which has been looked at is the North American water and 
power agreement, an agreement that would divert the headwaters of 
the Yukon, Skeena, Peace, Columbia and Fraser rivers for storage 
in a huge Rocky Mountain trench before it would be diverted to 
the thirsty American south.  The Grand Canal was another massive 
engineering project that would divert Canadian rivers to feed 
American industry.  I might also add that a member of the Liberal 
government has recently called for studies to re-examine the 
feasibility of some of these plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As populations shift and move and as droughts intensify, more 
and more water becomes the topic of discussion. The point I want 
to make with these examples is that it is more critical now than 
ever before in Canada's history to protect the power to manage 
our freshwater resources in the best interests of Canadians.  We 
need a comprehensive water policy, one that has been negotiated 
with the provinces to ensure the control over our water stays in 
the hands of Canada and the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces were given control over their natural resources 
under our Constitution.  The federal government is responsible 
for international trade.  It is crucial therefore that this 
government move immediately to enter into discussions with the 
provinces to establish a clear and comprehensive policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party supports the protection of Canada's sovereignty 
over its water and waterways.  It recognizes Canada's unique 
position as a steward of freshwater resources and the need to 
protect the quality of our water as an inherent part of our 
national heritage to maintain biodiversity, to protect health and 
safety, to support the quality of life for Canadians and to 
facilitate responsible economic development.  It is unfortunate 
that this government does not share those views. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that water is not specifically mentioned in NAFTA. We 
allow the export of bottled water.  However it is still 
recognized through a side agreement that water in its natural 
state in the lakes and rivers of our country is not considered a 
good.  There is concern among trade experts that this side 
agreement does not go far enough.  My colleague from Peace River 
mentioned earlier that we must open NAFTA through a trilateral 
discussion and demand that water be given an exemption similar to 
the exemption that is given to some other natural resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government, in fact the Prime Minister promised to all 
Canadians that he would protect Canada's water.  He guaranteed 
that water would remain under the control of the Canadian 
government to be managed in the best interests of Canadians.  He 
has not done that.  He has not reopened NAFTA and he has not 
obtained an exemption for freshwater.  In short, he has not 
adequately protected Canada's freshwater resources.  This failure 
to enact legislation has led to chaos and confusion, and as we 
have seen, some challenges to our sovereignty not to mention 
hundreds of millions of dollars in lawsuits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time for this government to act immediately to protect 
Canada's freshwater resources.  The time for talking has passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte:</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member is certainly creating a challenge of the 
jurisdiction of water and for the federal government to act. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1255"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT36"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT36"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1255

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to highlight for the record and for the knowledge of 
the hon. member that the legal status of Canadian water law seems 
to encompass riparian rights under common law that there is no 
right to ownership of water found in its natural state. The 
underlying policy to this rule is that the public at large has a 
right to reasonable use of water, in such cases as fishing and 
navigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is only when water is contained or controlled by someone that 
the characterization of personal property can apply. Examples 
would be swimming pools and bottled water and that personal 
property can now be sold. In its natural state under our law, 
nothing is said on the ownership of water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can look at surface water and surface bodies.  We know that 
rivers flow and lake bodies hold the water that flows into them. 
But the underwater, the aquifers, is a situation where owners of 
land not adjacent to water have no common right to the water. But 
when groundwater is governed by the rule of capture, an owner of 
land can take as much subterranean water as he can capture. That 
is a question of our law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we use the legal term capture, does that mean it is 
contained or controlled?  That is a major concern of the 
privatization and potential purchase of our water resources, 
either they are subterranean, underground, or surface.  That is 
the uneasy journey we are taking as Canadians here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless the federal government acts and clarifies these 
jurisdictions, responsibilities and rights, we are going into the 
millennium with uncharted water so to speak, because we are not 
protecting it for future generations of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the challenge is to deal with that now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my 
colleague for Churchill River for his question.  We spend a lot 
of time together on the environment committee and I appreciate 
his concern and his background in environmental issues and 
certainly in aboriginal issues and how they pertain to the 
environment.  Some of the member's revelations have been very 
revealing to us in how our native people look at the environment 
and how it interacts with their lives. Certainly the member's 
comments are what we are here for today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a resource that is important; it means life to 
everything.  Without properly managing this resource many 
scenarios and different laws come into effect.  Some people think 
that after building a dam, the lake behind that dam is a 
container.  Once that is done, is that water in a container?  Is 
it then treated differently?  Aquifers are treated differently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly we have to take the time and the government has to 
take the time to sit down with the provinces and work this issue 
out.  We have called for it.  It has not been done.  The fact 
that it has not been done has added to the confusion, has added 
to the concern of Canadians.  Canadians want control over their 
water.  Plain and simple.  Overwhelmingly. Very few issues can 
stir up emotions as discussions of water can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the 20 years of my involvement with municipal politics, 
clean water and a source of water to feed the citizens of our 
communities has been on the top of the list for every 
municipality in this country.  To ensure that we have the 
sovereignty over that, we have to get this government on the road 
to developing that policy. 
<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, as my colleague mentioned, water is quite an emotional 
issue with most Canadians.  We have great sensitivity to our 
reputation that we are hewers of wood and drawers of water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the NAFTA agreement, unprocessed logs are an exemption. 
Would it not be most appropriate if water also fit under that 
same category?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that was addressed in the speech but I want to carry it 
a bit further.  A contradiction in view has become apparent this 
morning, that is the role of the federal and provincial 
governments in terms of the whole question of bulk water exports. 
The parliamentary secretary said that this was federal 
jurisdiction.  We certainly have outstanding permits in Canada to 
this day where provinces have actually issued bulk freshwater 
export licences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would my colleague like to comment on the role of the provinces 
from his perspective? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my home province of Alberta 
recently passed a water act to control water and to deal with the 
issues we have come up with.  When it comes down to it, the fact 
that parliamentary secretary has said it is a federal issue, it 
is not.  The provinces have to be involved from the start to put 
the policy together. 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener—Waterloo, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, there is no question water is one of the more important 
topics we will be discussing in the future.  There is a real 
perception of that now.  The hon. member was talking in 
particular about groundwater. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the world's freshwater supply, water in the ground 
in aquifers, which are basically slow moving rivers, accounts for 
over 90% of the freshwater on the planet.  Many people think it 
is the lakes, rivers and glaciers, but the reality is that 90% is 
through the aquifers which are connected to lakes and rivers by 
the hydrological cycle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One very important issue is who is exactly responsible for what. 
Certainly in the province of Ontario it is the provincial 
government that gives permits for the drawing of water.  On the 
Great Lakes we have international treaties, but the fact of the 
matter is that a watershed is under provincial control.  It also 
passes to federal control and across the border because, as I 
said before, aquifers are slow moving rivers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This takes me to another point which is a very important part of 
the debate.  We need to be vigilant in protecting the aquifers. 
There are many examples where very good quality potable water in 
aquifers becomes contaminated and is lost for many decades until 
there is some way of taking remedial action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will put a question to the member from the Reform Party in 
terms of the debate on water.  He mentioned municipal 
governments, provincial governments and the federal government. 
Would the member agree that we virtually need a high powered 
conference on this matter to set— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  The time has expired 
for questions.  On a brief response, the hon. member for 
Lethbridge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, certainly discussions 
should take place at a very high level, the highest level 
possible because of the importance of the issue. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1305"></A>

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
seems to me only fair to say at this point in the debate that 
there seems to be fairly unanimous consent and support for the 
motion today, particularly on the part of those who believe in a 
role by the Government of Canada in protecting the interest of 
Canadians in all provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There seems to be, however, some confusion in connection with 
the alleged link between water and NAFTA.  Some speakers who 
preceded me seemed to labour under the impression that water is 
in the NAFTA.  It might be desirable therefore to dispel this 
notion once and for all because it only damages Canada's position 
vis-à-vis the United States and the NAFTA partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no reference to water in NAFTA except for bottled 
water.  The sooner we put our thinking to rest on this matter the 
better, so that we do not raise in the House the notion that 
water is in the NAFTA.  It is only in the form of bottled water. 
Anyone who can read and takes the trouble to read that portion of 
the NAFTA will see for himself or herself that is the extent to 
which water is mentioned in that agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore any debate on the motion which brings in through the 
back door the impression that we have to deal with the NAFTA only 
tends in the long term, and even in the short term, for that 
matter, to weaken Canada's position because certainly what is 
said in parliament has a certain weight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion, which is highly laudable, puts the emphasis on 
matters related to trade and that is where the pressures are 
coming from at the present time.  It is refreshing, however, to 
read what the British Columbia Wildlife Federation wrote some 15 
years ago as quoted in the report entitled “Currents of 
Change”, the final report of the inquiry on federal water 
policy, a commission launched under the Trudeau government in 
1983.  It says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is much broader than the consideration of habitat for 
fish, more than irrigation or energy development, more than jobs 
or recreation.  It is fundamental to the overall human condition. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is how water is described.  It is important to amplify the 
point of the B.C. Wildlife Federation because it is so well put. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the issue of how Canadians relate to water.  We 
have heard some very passionate interventions this morning on 
this subject and I would like to add one from the “Currents of 
Change” report on page 130 where it reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Water evokes special feelings among Canadians.  On the surface it 
appears unreasonable to object to exporting a renewable resource 
like water while supporting exports of non-renewable resources 
like minerals, coal and natural gas.  The explanation lies, at 
least in part, in the special heritage value that many Canadians 
attach to our water resources. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I underline the word heritage because it is extremely important. 
Those were inspired words by Mr. Pearse who was the head of that 
commission, who reported to the Conservative government in 1985, 
and whose recommendations are still waiting for action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Pearse at that time recommended a full range of water 
related policy initiatives including drinking water safety, 
research programs, intergovernmental arrangements and water 
exports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The central message of the inquiry's report, it must be said at 
this point of the discussion, in the words of Peter Pearse was: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must protect water as a key to a healthy environment and 
manage what we use efficiently as an economic resource. 
</UL>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We certainly can say that a lot of time has gone by.  Members of 
the opposition have already stressed that point.  We are now at 
the point where a decision must be made in this respect, not only 
within the confines of the motion but also going beyond so as to 
encompass water quality, conservation and the concept of 
security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Security needs to be redefined.  We have to move gradually away 
from a concept that limits itself to military security to one 
that is related to natural resources.  Certainly water plays a 
major role in providing the sense of security that any society 
needs for its present and future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today as we speak we can recite a number of applications on 
water exports that have been proposed in recent months: one in 
Ontario, one in British Columbia and very recently one in 
Newfoundland.  Evidently we have to take action at the federal 
level and give the necessary leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As recently as last July an interdepartmental panel of officers 
representing foreign affairs and Environment Canada debated in 
Toronto the matter of water.  A considerable amount of work has 
been going on within departments.  Now it is a matter that will 
have to emerge at the political level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the ultimate, as the motion suggests, it will have to be a 
decision that will assert the sovereign right of Canadians. 
Therefore parliament and the Government of Canada must play a 
leading role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question of quality of water deserves to be given greater 
emphasis than so far.  The confidence of Canadians in drinking 
water has over recent years declined as demonstrated by the 
increased sales of water filters, bottled water and the like. 
There is an impression which has not been dispelled to the effect 
that the quality of water is not as high as it used to be. 
Therefore we have to pay attention to that fact either by 
restoring confidence or by taking measures to improve the quality 
of municipal water as provided by municipal suppliers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The addition of chlorine is an issue that emerges from time to 
time in reports by the International Joint Commission.  In one of 
its reports three years ago it indicated its concern about that 
particular substance as it affects human health.  Evidently we 
are dealing with a very difficult issue because we all know the 
advantages of the use of chlorine in disinfecting water. 
Nevertheless we have signals to which we have to pay attention if 
our major concern, as I am sure it is for everybody in the House, 
is for the quality and the health aspect of water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been given an indication that I am splitting time with 
the member for Barrie—Simcoe—Bradford.  Therefore I will comply 
with that request in the assumption that my time is up. 
<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Davenport for his support of 
the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also raise a concern with respect to the issue he identified 
around NAFTA and the implications of NAFTA for bulk freshwater 
exports. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1315"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is a very distinguished and longstanding member 
of this House.  He knows that there are serious questions at this 
time about the possible impact of NAFTA.  There have been a 
number of challenges by American companies that seek to take 
advantage of what they allege are the provisions of NAFTA with 
respect to bulk water export. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Judging by the lawsuits that have been launched, for example Sun 
Belt claiming over $100 million in damages under the provisions 
of NAFTA, does the hon. member not agree that if Canada, the 
United States and Mexico really believe NAFTA does not apply to 
freshwater exports that there could very well be a memorandum of 
understanding that would have equal force and effect as the NAFTA 
itself just to clear up any misunderstanding? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the absence of that, of course, there is still the 
possibility of ongoing legal harassment and actions.  In light of 
that, would the hon. member be prepared to support both the 
amendment and the main motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
having raised again the question of NAFTA and water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could allege that the moon is made of Gorgonzola and 
ask for a memorandum of understanding that it be disclaimed. 
Having read several times the portion of the NAFTA that covers 
water, I am fully satisfied that the only reference 
in that section is to bottled water.  If there are 
certain business interests in the United States that wish to 
allege the contrary that is their business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I do not think we should fall into the trap of those 
who claim that assumption in the NAFTA because we just reinforce 
that kind of notion.  The text is clear.  It refers only to 
bottled water.  There is no way Canada would go for any agreement 
in the NAFTA arrangement that would include water. I do not think 
any government in its right mind would ever agree to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I must confirm what I indicated earlier.  This motion 
ought to be disallowed and should not be given new life in this 
parliament because it just gives credence to those outside 
parliament who would like people to believe that water is 
included in NAFTA. 
<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo—Alberni, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the member for Davenport may be missing the point. Because water 
is not specifically excluded, it is therefore in. The problem is 
that it is in the pot.  Raw logs and unprocessed fish are 
exempted from NAFTA because they are on the list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are suggesting is that we add water to that list.  It 
would take water out of NAFTA.  Because it is not specifically 
excluded, it is by definition in.  That is the difficulty we are 
dealing with today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there may be a long 
list of items that are not specifically excluded that one would 
like to have reference to.  However, the fact is what the 
agreement states is what the agreement is all about.  If the 
agreement specifies water in its bottled form and nothing further 
than that, it seems to be pretty clear and evident.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Aileen Carroll (Barrie—Simcoe—Bradford, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, this is a major issue that we address today and one that 
relates very much to my riding of Barrie—Simcoe—Bradford, 
impacted as we are by the health of and the need to preserve one 
of Ontario's major lakes, Lake Simcoe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a water rich nation.  We are stewards of 9% of the 
world's renewal freshwater.  But in the context of the motion 
under debate it is important that members realize that export is 
but one facet of how we manage this life giving resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While Canadians enjoy one of the highest standards of clean 
water in the world, pollution remains an important problem in 
some of our waters.  In some areas people cannot swim or eat the 
fish they catch or drink the water without it going through 
extensive purification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The quality of Canada's freshwater and marine areas is affected 
by three major water pollution problems, toxic substances, excess 
nutrients and sedimentation. Toxic substance from industrial, 
agricultural and domestic use form major pollutants in our water. 
These include trace elements of PCBs, mercury, dioxins, furans 
and some pesticides.  Some of these substances accumulate through 
the food chain rather than breaking down in the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These substances enter our water in a variety of ways, including 
industrial sources such as mining, steel production, accidents 
such as oil or chemical spills, and contaminated sites such as 
the Sydney tar ponds in Nova Scotia, municipal waste water 
effluents and atmospheric deposition from Mexico, the U.S. and 
Europe in Canada through rain and snow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Excess nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous compounds come 
mainly from municipal sewage and farm run-off containing 
fertilizers and animal waste.  These nutrients can cause excess 
growth of aquatic plants which then die and decay, depleting 
water of dissolved oxygen and killing fish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sedimentation which we have difficulty with in Lake Simcoe is an 
increase in the amount of solid particles in water caused 
primarily by human activities, coming from farming, from forestry 
and construction.  When sediment settles it can smoother the 
feeding and spawning grounds of fish and kill aquatic organisms. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Water pollution affects our health, our environment and our 
economy.  Some of the toxic substances in water have been found 
to cause cancer.  Others pose a threat to reproductive and 
immune systems and have already been found in the milk of some 
mothers.  The health of all Canadians is threatened, especially 
that of young children, seniors and natives in the north, who 
depend on local wildlife for their survival. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pollution lowers the value in the eyes of industry and raises 
the household cost of this resource.  The economic value of 
Canadian fresh water used in homes and industry is estimated to 
be between $15 million and $20 million annually. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has made progress in reducing many important water 
pollution problems.  For example, 30 years ago Lake Erie was 
largely considered to be dead due to excessive nutrients from 
municipal waste.  Today several of the original wildlife species 
have returned and the lake supports a commercial fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recent improvements in water quality have resulted in a decline 
in levels of DDT detected in the breast milk of mothers in 
southern Ontario and in Quebec since the early 1970s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pulp mills have reduced dioxin and furan discharges since 1988 
as a result of tougher federal and provincial regulations on pulp 
and paper effluents.  Many B.C. shellfish and bottom fish 
harvesting areas which we closed because of these pollutants have 
now reopened. 
Ecosystem initiatives in several major watersheds have helped to 
improve water quality.  Under the St. Lawrence action plan 
pollution from 50 priority industries has been reduced since 
1988. Under the Great Lakes action plan the harbour in 
Collingwood, Ontario is restored.  The Fraser River action plan 
has led to a 90% reduction in the release of toxic wood 
preservative chemicals.

toxics and the worst polluters, broaden the participation of 
Canadian businesses and establish Canadian-wide standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has significantly reduced the flow of pollution into its 
waters, but the future continues to hold tremendous challenges as 
environmental issues become larger and more complex.  Global 
demands for pesticides, manufactured chemical goods and products 
are rising. The number of substances known or strongly suspected 
to be toxic continues to grow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The challenge for Canada is to continue to build international 
co-operation, in particular on heavy metals and persistent 
organic polluters.  Domestically we must continue to build and 
encourage leadership and partners with communities, industry and 
provincial and territorial governments. But it is the federal 
body which must provide the leadership and initiative to provide 
the legislative framework which will ensure the protection of 
Canadian water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is this broad approach and not just a focus on water export 
alone that will provide Canadians with the clean water they need 
now and in the future. At this critical time I would agree with 
the motion before us that the government should in co-operation 
with the provinces and the territories place an immediate 
moratorium on interbasin transfers and the export of water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Interbasin transfers can negatively impact the social and 
economic well-being of people who live in watershed areas. In my 
community around Lake Simcoe we are tremendously impacted by a 
watershed area.  Indeed it is this major concern that we are 
debating here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This action should be a joint action taken in co-operation with 
provincial and territorial governments.  I have promoted these 
policies with my colleagues and I stand in the House to do so 
today.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate my colleague on her comments.  She focused on two 
areas that I think are critical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One obviously is that this is an environmental issue. The other 
is the importance to Canadians, particularly in municipal areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding of Oak Ridges is part of the Oak Ridges moraine, a 
very sensitive area in Ontario and one where there are studies 
being done currently to deal with water issues.  We have rivers 
such as the head waters of the Don. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few years ago a commentator made the pronouncement that the 
next conflicts in the 21st century will be over water, that water 
is the critical issue.  I certainly support the comments I have 
heard from all sides of the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the issue which clearly involves federal, 
municipal and private sectors, what type of elements does she see 
as critical in the development of a federal freshwater strategy 
for Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Aileen Carroll:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I agree with an emphasis 
the member has brought to the discussion on the need to be 
working with colleagues at the municipal level because they are 
perhaps most closely connected with the issues on a daily basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that regard, I make reference again to Lake Simcoe, a very 
large and major lake in Ontario, one impacted tremendously by 
growth and development in the watershed from urbanization and 
from the agricultural and industrial base as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As he mentioned, it is imperative that in developing a 
freshwater strategy we work closely with our municipal partners 
as well as our provincial partners to contain and to deal with 
those issues they are encountering on a daily basis as a result 
of watershed problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We look to an overall freshwater strategy as one that has to 
encompass before us today, the export of bulk water and a 
moratorium on interbasin transfers but we look at a larger view. 
We will be looking to legislation that we know is in process with 
regard to a freshwater strategy from the federal perspective but 
again in partnership with our provincial colleagues.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to speak on the motion before the House today on the 
marketing of water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before getting into the commercial aspect, I would like to 
address the environmental aspect. We are all familiar with 
water, as we use it on a daily basis. We need it as part of our 
diet and for washing. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1335"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT44"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT44"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1335

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But that is not our only use of water.  Water is found in the 
environment, in the form of rivers, lakes and oceans.  By fresh 
water, we mean water that contains no salt, the water in 
streams, lakes and rivers, as opposed to that in oceans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where does this water come from?  It comes from rain, which runs 
off hills and mountains to become streams, which flow into 
rivers, which become lakes, which in turn empty into streams, 
and then rivers to finally reach the ocean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If these patterns are disturbed, we change the way in which the 
lands through which these waters pass are irrigated.  If we 
change the way in which these waters reach the ocean, we will 
eventually alter the salinity of parts of the ocean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Water, however, does not just irrigate land or quench our 
thirst.  It also transports heat.  And one of the by-products of 
differences in salinity is that ocean currents transfer heat 
from the south to the north, where waters cool, drop to the 
bottom of the ocean and return south. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This creates a thermal equilibrium on the planet and large-scale 
changes. 
Therefore, if quantities of soft water were to end up in a 
specific part of the ocean, its salinity would be affected, and 
this could have a significant impact on the climate of the 
planet.  When reference is made to transfers between catchment 
areas, we are speaking specifically and definitely of measures 
which could affect the runoff of freshwater into an ocean or 
oceans.  The consequences of such a transfer might be 
considerably greater than we were able to foresee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The greatest caution is therefore necessary, on the engineering 
level alone, when contemplating changing the movement of water 
from one basin to another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois shares the concerns that have been expressed 
by a large number of members of this House since this debate 
began this morning. 
We must, however, touch on the aspect of commercialization. Here 
it is possible that the Bloc Quebecois has concerns that are not 
shared by all hon. members in this House, particularly if they 
do not come from Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where the commercialization of water is concerned, we are 
looking at water as a natural resource to be exploited, and no 
longer as an element of our environment.  I have already 
addressed the question of the environment, and it must not be 
lost sight of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look as the aspect of exploitation of a natural resource, 
nevertheless.  Small quantities of water are readily moved from 
place to place to meet humanity's needs. 
For instance, a municipality can draw water from a lake to pipe 
it into our homes.  In the country, people drill up to hundreds 
of feet below the ground to tap the groundwater table for their 
drinking and washing water.  These are small transfers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If, however, these small transfers multiply, the consequences 
can be dramatic.  In the southwestern United States, for 
instance, farmers and municipalities have made heavy use of the 
groundwater table for agricultural irrigation as well as other 
needs.

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The water table has been lowered and is drying up.  We recognize 
that water, our natural resource, must be treated in a very 
circumspect manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Water does not renew itself quickly or readily.  Today, as it 
rains, there is an abundance of water.  Next year, maybe it will 
rain less, maybe there will be less snow.  The level of the 
lakes will drop.  We must be very careful therefore on matters 
involving water; still, it remains a renewable natural resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So the question arises: Whose responsibility is it to manage the 
use of this resource on a daily basis?  I think that, in all the 
provinces and in Quebec, municipalities have regulated the 
careful use of drinking water.  A number of municipalities 
already meter the quantity of water used, ensuring that 
consumers are aware of the quantity consumed, and keep the cost 
down, with consumption limited to what is needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other municipalities have regulations on watering.  Occupants of 
even-and odd-numbered houses water their lawns on alternate days. 
Why?  To make careful use of a limited natural resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The municipalities are also treating the environment with 
respect by processing waste water. 
Waste water containing matter in suspension that could harm the 
environment is not released back into nature, either 
domestically or industrially.  Who is responsible for making 
sure such measures are in place?  To my knowledge, it is the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, water as a natural resource may be used commercially, 
industrially or municipally in compliance with regulations that 
are put in place and applied by the provinces and by Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, we have a motion indicating clearly that this government 
should adopt regulations and impose measures to make better use 
of our fresh and drinking water resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very aware of the importance of caring for our natural 
resource, water. 
But I also have a dilemma:  the federal government has never had 
to do anything to ensure communities' access to water resources. 
It was the provinces, and Quebec, which introduced water 
conservation, protection, filtration and purification measures. 
Quebec and the provinces have always shouldered their 
responsibilities in this sector.  So why is the federal 
government butting in now? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can understand the federal government, in consultation with 
the provinces, being given a mandate to make representations 
internationally, in order to negotiate international accords and 
amendments to agreements such as NAFTA.  This was done in the 
past, and will no doubt be done again in the foreseeable future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But if we are talking about authority for marketing the natural 
resource, I think the federal government is overstepping its 
bounds.  Furthermore, this is an issue in which Quebec has taken 
an interest for many years and one which has already been in the 
news for several months in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of a sudden, the federal government wakes up and begins to 
make a fuss, without realizing that others have already taken 
the matter in hand, for the very reason that it was their 
responsibility to do so, not the federal government's.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I share the concerns of our friends in the New Democratic 
Party, I differ with them on who has responsibility for 
marketing this natural resource.  We in the Bloc Quebecois will 
therefore be voting against this motion, which would basically 
deprive Quebec of its historic rights to manage its water 
resources and turn those rights over to the federal government, 
which, to all intents and purposes, has never really concerned 
itself with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would submit to the House that, if it were serious about 
playing a useful role in this respect, the federal government 
would have done so 50 or 60 years ago, by protecting the Great 
Lakes against the shameful pollution that travelled down the St. 
Lawrence River, turning it into a gigantic sewer for a number of 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can remember swimming in Wolfe's Cove, in Quebec City, in my 
youth. On a nice summer day, there were 5,000 people on the 
beaches at Wolfe's Cove. There were beautiful sandy beaches and 
the water was clean enough for swimming. Only 10 or 15 years 
later, the water had become a public sewer. And as members may 
suspect, the City of Quebec was not to blame for all this 
pollution; it was coming from down from the Great Lakes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, with the international agreements on both the American 
side and Ontarian side, pollution has been controlled to a large 
extent. In another 10, 15 or 20 years maybe, we can look forward 
to having our river back, and swimming will be safe and will not 
pose a health risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members can see, the federal government's record on 
protecting our environment and the issue of freshwater and 
drinking water is not great. I have a problem with a motion like 
this one being put forward today as if this government, here in 
Ottawa, were some kind of saviour for the planet, the country or 
Quebec. So far, the provinces have successfully taken their 
responsibilities. Arrangements are already in place in British 
Columbia, and steps are being taken in Quebec. What business 
does this House have debating a motion on a topic under 
provincial jurisdiction? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>]

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview—Greenwood, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I can remember my very first question in the House of 
Commons.  It was 11 years ago and it was to the then environment 
minister for the Conservative Party who is now the Premier of 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My first question dealt with the challenge that the national 
government had in cleaning up the hot spots of the Great Lakes, 
including the St. Lawrence River.  I remember vividly how Mr. 
Bouchard stood in the House of Commons to courageously and 
proudly proclaim the responsibility of the Government of Canada 
to deal not only with the problems of the hot spots on the Great 
Lakes, but also the St. Lawrence River.  In no way shape or form 
did Mr. Bouchard ever walk away from the responsibility of the 
Government of Canada to deal with issues related to water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think for a second that the national government can 
absent itself from this debate, we well as the fact that it has a 
major national role to play.  Any suggestion by the Bloc 
Quebecois that taking inventory and managing our water resources 
is strictly a provincial issue is something I would oppose to the 
death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the record will show that over the years the Government 
of Canada, the people of Canada, not just in Quebec but in 
Ontario, have spent hundreds of millions of dollars not only 
attempting to reclaim some of our water resources but also making 
sure that the proper infrastructure is in place so the water 
resources can be maximized through municipal infrastructure, 
grants and programs.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge members of the Bloc Quebecois not to become so parochial 
or territorial so as not to interact.  These waters flow back and 
forth from one province to another.  We share the Great Lakes.  I 
would appeal to Bloc members to view water as a national issue. 
The Government of Canada must have a responsibility and a role to 
play and the Bloc should encourage the Government of Canada to 
assume that role. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye:</B> Mr. Speaker, if, at some point in 
time—and I am talking about 40 years ago, not 11—the 
Government of Canada had taken appropriate measures to make sure 
our American neighbours did not dump their wastewater into the 
Great Lakes, thus polluting the St. Lawrence River, which is the 
backbone of Quebec's development, we would not have the pollution 
level that exists today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But this is not what the federal government did 40 or 30 years 
ago. I am not surprised that the issue was raised 11 years ago 
in a question. 
I do not have the wording of the question or of the answer, but 
the crucial role that the federal government had to take in 
negotiating with the Americans to ensure the protection of the 
quality of our water was overlooked. In fact, the same question 
could be raised on acid rain. The federal government had, and 
still has, a duty to negotiate on a bilateral basis with the 
Americans regarding this issue. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of water in Quebec, the member said that it flows back 
and forth.  I am sorry, with Quebec it is only forth.  It comes 
from here.  It goes down to our place. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec has assumed its water management responsibilities for 400 
years. The hon. member's claim that Canada has a major role to 
play in showing us how to do things right—something which it 
has never done, while we have been taking action and achieving 
good results—is just not valid. The water in Quebec belongs to 
Quebec. 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to point out to my colleague from the Bloc Quebecois that I 
find it most unfortunate that he would once again be so 
narrow-minded in his interpretation of this rather broad motion, 
which encompasses the federal government and the provinces.  I 
would like to inform him that, when there was a major federal 
program on cleaner water for Canada, in the 1970s, Quebec was 
the only province that did not take advantage of this program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec was the last province—and I know what I am talking about, 
having been the Quebec minister of the environment—to establish a 
water purification program.  To start telling us that this is a 
purely federal, or purely provincial, affair, that Quebec is as 
pure as the driven snow in this matter, and that the federal 
government has full responsibility for this, is to once again 
start up this business of picking quarrels, blaming the other 
guy, without even looking at one's own faults. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is most unfortunate, because the question of water goes far 
beyond narrow-minded parochialism.  It is a question that defines 
the cycle facing us.  We should look at the far bigger picture, 
and try to associate ourselves with a motion that refers not 
only to the federal government but also to the association of 
federal and provincial governments in the development of a 
shared water policy.  This, I feel, is the key to everything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye:</B> This is not 
narrow-mindedness, Mr. Speaker.  The motion before us is very 
clear.  It states that the government should place an immediate 
moratorium on the export of bulk water shipments.  It goes on to 
say “in co-operation with the provinces”.  Such co-operation ought 
to precede the motion.  It ought to be verified with the 
provinces, and with Quebec, whether the moratorium is necessary 
and desirable.

is something wrong with the government when the Department of

of the insane spending in my latest waste report.  It shows that 
there is plenty of rot in the system.  Taxpayers deserve better

line at the food bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the government is spending $4,000 on the provincial 
flags unity project.  The concept is to express national unity, 
which is quite appropriate because if it keeps spending money

However, many small and medium size enterprises have not yet 
addressed the issue. Firms should begin testing now if they have 
not already done so. Businesses must realize they could be fully

contingency plans and business resumption plans to ensure that

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the article Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada

hear from Reform Party members.

overwhelming.

his failure to attend the King of Jordan's funeral.  This was 
another error in judgment, because the facts are there for

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker,

</I></B></P><P align=left>We had done all the planning and a PMO team was already on site

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the

former presidents in the delegation accompanying President 
Clinton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the Prime Minister whether he does not think his first 
error in judgment was to head off skiing last Thursday, instead 
of remaining in Ottawa, when the entire world knew that the king 
was near death?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  No manners, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxes are going up $2.4 billion this year.  The finance 
department is saying it will cut taxes by $2 billion.  That means 
Canadians are going to be worse off again this year for the sixth 
year in a row under this finance minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the minister square his self billed proclamation as 
being a tax cutter when taxes are going to go up once again this 
year?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we made it very clear in the last budget as we will in 
the next and in fact in each and every budget, that we will be 
bringing down taxes. In addition to that, we are going to 
preserve the health care system.  In addition to that, we are 
going to invest in productivity and research and development, in 
the very sinews of our modern economy.  We are going to give 
Canadians the tools they require to triumph in the 21st century.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for Sydney—Victoria last 
week raised a question of privilege which involved the hon. 
Minister of Natural Resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe, if I can put it into context, that there was a 
meeting which took place either in or near the member's riding. 
He said, I believe, that he was unable to make it and a member of 
his staff was not allowed to enter the meeting.  Is that correct? 
<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it was a lock-up in my riding having to do with the announcement 
regarding Cape Breton Development Corporation. I received notice 
of that meeting early in the morning.  I made arrangements to be 
in my riding.  During the lock-up, my understanding is that 
journalists were allowed in and my staff was not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I thank the hon. member.  The hon. minister 
who was named is here.  Perhaps he could respond. 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Natural Resources and 
Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want to address the complaint that was raised by the 
member for Sydney—Victoria after question period on Monday last 
week. It had to do with two separate events associated with the 
announcement of the government's plans with respect to Cape 
Breton Development Corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In commenting, I am at a bit of a disadvantage because I was not 
personally involved in either event.  However, I have been 
assured by those with direct knowledge that the following is an 
accurate recounting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first issue raised by the member dealt with the scheduling 
of the announcement.  On January 27 at about 9 o'clock in the 
morning the member for Sydney—Victoria and the member for Bras 
d'Or—Cape Breton were in the waiting room of my office in the 
Confederation Building. At that time the member for Bras 
d'Or—Cape Breton indicated that she had heard that an 
announcement with respect to Devco was coming in the next two or 
three weeks. The members were told by a member of my staff that 
an announcement was imminent and that it would take place sooner 
rather than later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact later that day, January 27 at about 5 o'clock in the 
afternoon, we received confirmation from the Privy Council Office 
authorizing me to make an announcement on the future direction of 
Devco. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1505"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT62"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT62"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1505

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So there can be no confusion, allow me to once again emphasize 
the chronology of that day.  On January 27 at about nine o'clock 
in the morning my staff informed the two MPs that an announcement 
was imminent and that it would take place sooner rather than 
later.  At about five o'clock in the afternoon on that same day, 
that is about eight hours after the conversation between my staff 
and the two MPs, my office received a call from the PCO informing 
us that we were authorized to make an announcement. Given our 
desire to end the uncertainty faced by the people of Cape Breton, 
the decision was made to announce the next day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second issue pertains to a media briefing by officials which 
took place on the day of the announcement.  My office advised a 
staff member in the office of the member for Sydney—Victoria 
that the media briefing was, as the words themselves imply, for 
the media.  In addition his office was also told that it would be 
receiving a copy of the information package prior to a media 
conference at which the announcement would be made. Copies of 
that information package were hand delivered to both the 
Parliament Hill and riding offices of both the member for 
Sydney—Victoria and the member for Bras d'Or—Cape Breton.  As 
promised by my office, these packages did arrive prior to the 
beginning of that media conference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the key point is that the media and the members for 
Sydney—Victoria and Bras d'Or—Cape Breton were not the only 
people to receive the information prior to the media conference. 
While officials briefed the media, I met personally with union 
leaders and others and most important with miners and their 
families to describe the impending announcement and to answer 
their questions.  I can confirm that the member for Bras 
d'Or—Cape Breton was in the room for that discussion with the 
miners and others and the member for Sydney—Victoria and/or his 
staff could well have been there too. Both members of parliament 
were present at the subsequent media conference for the 
announcement itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that we tried very hard to treat everyone fairly and 
appropriately in what were very difficult and emotional 
circumstances.  It was certainly no one's intention to cause any 
offence. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The matter has been raised 
by the member and he put his case before the House.  It is always 
sad when all of the things we would like to mesh in our busy 
lives do not mesh.  It seems that we have a grievance on the part 
of the member that neither he nor his staff were present at the 
meeting he mentioned.  We now have an explanation from the 
minister. This is an interpretation of the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would rule this is not a question of privilege.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I want to address myself to the whip of 
the Reform Party who sent me a note during question period with 
regard to a question of privilege raised by the hon. member for 
Macleod.  This question of privilege named specifically the 
Minister of Health who is here in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is my problem.  Whereas I have ruled in the past that the 
two members who are involved should be in the House at the same 
time, for whatever reason, the member for Macleod is not here 
today. Although we have asked the hon. Minister of Health to be 
here, I believe that in keeping with our precedents of the past, 
we should hold until the Minister of Health can respond directly 
to the member for Macleod.  Unless I get some direction 
otherwise, or there is full agreement, that is the way I would 
rule.

unanimous consent of the House, to stand in for the member for 
Macleod and to listen to the conversation and deal with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  As all members know, by unanimous consent we 
can do whatever we want in this House.  Do we give ourselves 
permission as a House to hear a response by the hon. Minister of 
Health on a question of privilege? Is there agreement? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed.

the point of privilege? 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
you are very kind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank my colleagues opposite for raising this point, having 
brought to my attention that some days ago a news release left my 
office in relation to the appointment of a Liberal Party caucus 
committee on an issue.  The news release was inappropriately on 
the stationery of Health Canada.  It ought to have been on the 
stationery of my riding office or my office as a member of 
parliament. I am grateful to the member for bringing it to my 
attention and to the House's attention.  He is right. It ought to 
have gone on the other stationery and I regret that it did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want the House to know that I asked the member for 
Waterloo—Wellington to look into this issue because we are very 
concerned about the issue of youth smoking.  At the end of the 
day I hope that members will agree that that issue and how we do 
something about it is more important than the issue of 
stationery. 
<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  As I recall the circumstance, the issue 
that I was looking at primarily was that this announcement went 
out on paper from the department and that was the point of 
privilege which was brought up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have the hon. Minister of Health, the member of 
parliament, rising to tell us that indeed it was an error.  From 
my understanding he has said it was an error and he is correcting 
it as best as he can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to put words in the minister's mouth but basically 
he apologized for what went on.  Is that correct? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is correct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Just a small one.  It is going to be so 
small that by the time I hit I am up again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, just to clarify, I thank 
the minister for that.  It has also been posted to the Health 
Canada website.  In other words it is on the Internet.  I would 
just like assurances that it has been removed from there as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I accept the minister's apology and thank him for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Could the hon. Minister of Health address 
himself to the point on the website? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will direct that it be 
removed from the website and put in the appropriate place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Good.  This matter is settled and I will not 
have to rule on it.

question by the member for Wild Rose.  May I be permitted to 
continue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  If it is clarification, it has to be very 
short.  It is not debate so make the clarification now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos:</B>  Mr. Speaker, yesterday a question 
was raised by the member for Wild Rose regarding two cases 
involving sentencing of aboriginal offenders.  I stated that 
these two cases were on appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada 
when in fact there are two other cases.  There was confusion in 
terms of the cases that were before the supreme court under 
section 718.2(e). One of these cases, R. v Gladue, has been heard 
and is on reserve.  The other, R. v Wells, also involves 
conditional sentencing and has not yet been heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to also put on record that the sentencing judges clearly 
stated that although they considered the offenders' aboriginal 
background, this was not a factor that affected the sentences 
that were ultimately imposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please. I think we have got to the point 
where the hon. member has made her clarification.  The rest is

</I></B></P><P align=left>As our pulse beats every 60 seconds we lose 50 hectares of 
forests around the globe.  That means every year we are losing 30 
million hectares of forests or well over twice the size of Nova 
Scotia.  As a result the desert is gaining ground at the rate of 
10 million hectares per annum or almost the size of Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The environmental organization UNEP, United Nations 
Environmental Program, has shown through its statistics that if 
we were to add the desertified lands of the world together we 
would have a surface in deserts equal to North America and South 
America combined.  This gives us an idea of the immensity of the 
water challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our forests are disappearing.  The desert is gaining ground at 
an exponential rate.  Our rivers are silting and drying up.  Our 
groundwater is being depleted again at a huge rate.  For all 
these reasons a country's water resources have become its most 
precious asset, its most valuable resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of us live under the comfortable but false assumption that 
our water resources are so immense as to be inexhaustible. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But it must be remembered that our freshwater resources 
represent only a fraction of the planet's total water resources. 
In fact, 97% or more of the planet's water resources are salt 
water.  Only 3% are freshwater.  And of these, the freshwater 
resources visible to us, our lakes, our rivers, the waterways 
that seem so never-ending to us, represent only a tiny proportion 
of the total freshwater resources, the great bulk of which lie 
beneath the earth's surface to form the water table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is that, in many American states today, 
particularly in the West and Southwest, the water table has been 
seriously depleted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The more the water resources of certain American states dwindle, 
the more the U.S. has its eye on our resources in Canada. 
Certain companies, even in this country, see this as a golden 
business opportunity. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus pressure grows for Canada and its provinces to sell our 
water resources for commercial reasons and for profit.  Those who 
would sell and buy our water resources would argue that we are 
blessed with water resources which are among the world's most 
prolific.  This is true.  Indeed the St. Lawrence and Great Lakes 
basin alone accounts for something like 20% of all surface fresh 
water of the globe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we should put this in perspective.  May I take the 
example of the same Great Lakes and St. Lawrence basin to show 
how much we use, overuse and abuse our water.  Every day out of 
the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence we draw 655 billion gallons 
of water or 2.5 trillion litres of water.  This is equivalent to 
putting water into 19 million jumbo tank cars each 65 feet long 
and with a capacity of 34,000 gallons.  If we strung them 
together one after another they would stretch for 237,000 miles 
or 9.5 times around the earth at the Equator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These mind-boggling statistics give us an idea of how much we 
have abused and used, day in and day out, the resources of just 
one water basin.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We should reiterate that of all our natural resources water is 
by far the most precious.  I back the remarks of my colleague 
from Davenport that NAFTA has nothing to do with that.  NAFTA 
provides for water in bottled form.  We should not be constrained 
by ideas that we have to ask the Americans for permission to 
protect our water resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the mover of the motion.  We cannot at any price 
sacrifice our water resources for export whether on a large 
scale, medium scale or small scale.  As parliamentarians and as 
Canadians we must send strong signals to the Americans and 
anybody else, to those who would sell our water for profit, to 
those who have grand designs for grand canals and small canals 
and bulk exports to make money, that our water and our water 
heritage are not for sale.  They are not for sale at any price, 
not now, not tomorrow, not the day after, not the day after that 
or at any time thereafter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I agree with the motion.  We must move without delay 
to protect our water resources.  This is why I will support the 
motion when it comes to the vote. 
<P><A NAME="LINK235"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, my question is for the hon. member and his colleague 
from Davenport for whom I have tremendous respect for their work 
on the environment committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is saying that we do not have to be concerned over the NAFTA 
when it comes to bulk water shipments or sale of our water.  We 
recently lost a court decision.  Actually we did not lose it. In 
our perspective we caved in to the MMT decision and gave the 
Ethyl Corporation $13.5 million U.S.  We were unable to ban 
within our borders what is known as the manganese additive in 
gasoline which is a neurotoxin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is he and his party that confident in terms of the current court 
case in California against the British Columbia government?  I am 
assuming from his projection that they will not be successful in 
the courts in suing British Columbia or the federal government in 
their prevention of bulk water shipments from British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln:</B>  Madam Speaker, there is a very 
significant distinction between the MMT case as it was 
adjudicated in the internal provincial-federal trade tribunal. 
The gist of the case was the banning of interprovincial trade in 
MMT which was found by this particular tribunal to be invalid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of water it is very clear that this issue does not 
arise.  It is also clear that NAFTA, as my colleague from 
Davenport underlined, does not refer to water except for bottled 
water.  The very fact that it mentions bottled water and no other 
water means that the design or the intention of the drafters was 
not to cover other water resources than bottled water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would seem to be begging the question to try to introduce 
into NAFTA something that is not there in the first place.  Also 
it is such a huge issue for us, far larger than any other, that 
we should move forward.  We should produce legislation.  We 
should challenge the Americans with the fact that this is our 
natural heritage.  It is our water.  They are our water 
resources.  We have every right in the world to protect them and 
we will.  I really believe our resolve should be there.

is an issue that should lead to a very close partnership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln:</B> Madam Speaker, I could not agree more with 
the hon. member for Chicoutimi.  In fact the gist of the motion 
is that the entire issue of protecting our water is one that 
naturally affects all jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One cannot think of water as coming under the jurisdiction of 
one government or another.  All governments must work together, 
that is the meaning of the motion.  My reading of the motion, 
which I support, is that there must be closer interaction 
between the provinces and the federal government.  I think that 
all of the municipalities must be involved as well.

after a long period of drought no one can deny the feeling of 
exhilaration and renewal that a summer rain provides.  I remember 
that as a small child wearing a light summer dress running along 
the street of my neighbourhood I was drenched while the rain came 
pouring down from the sky.  The joy of the refreshing shower 
dances in my memory to this day.

Thunder Bay, along the shores of the largest freshwater lake in 
the world, Lake Superior.  At night snuggled deep under my covers 
I would listen to the fog horns guide the ships safely to and 
from the harbour.  I would play on the beach and swim with my 
cousins in the chill bracing waters of Lake Superior.  With my 
father and mother I would walk along the harbour and watch the 
sailboats zip along its chalky blue surface, their tiny white 
triangular sails filled with the full force of the wind.

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for his question.  Certainly the hon. member was a very 
active member of the standing committee on environment and 
sustainable development in the previous session of the House. I 
think it is important to note, as I outlined in my speech, that 
we have to think about the quantity of water we have to preserve 
and about the quality of water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked about airborne pollutants and pollutants that come by 
other means.  These pollutants and toxic substances enter into 
our ecosystems and they enter into our groundwater as well.  As 
the hon. member well knows, there was a recent case at the 
supreme court which upheld the federal government's role in 
controlling toxic substances, that it was indeed a matter of 
federal jurisdiction.  We all know as well informed members on 
both sides of the House that pollution knows no boundaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that if we want to ensure the quality of our 
groundwater to ensure that Canadians, whether it is in their 
homes or in their businesses or on their farms, have access to 
good quality water, water that is coming from the ground. 
Groundwater, as the hon. member has pointed out, is a 
responsibility of the federal government in that the federal 
government has by the Supreme Court of Canada clear jurisdiction 
in the area of managing toxic substances.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
will be sharing my time with my hon. colleague from Vancouver 
East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to speak today on the motion by the New Democratic 
Party to ban the bulk export of our water. This issue is very 
important to me and to my constituents in the riding of Churchill 
and indeed to all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of Churchill's most important natural resources is its fresh 
water.  My riding is known for its clear blue lakes and rivers. 
They are one of our best tourist attractions. Every year they 
draw thousands of campers, cottagers, hunters and fishers.  The 
waters are also the lifeline of our commercial fishing industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health of our lakes and rivers is the backbone of that 
important industry.  Lakes and rivers are also extremely 
important to the way of life of my aboriginal constituents.  They 
too understand the environmental damage that would result from 
the bulk export of our water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very disappointed in the lack of action from the Liberal 
government to protect our freshwater up to this time.  Its lack 
of action is what has prompted the New Democratic Party to bring 
forth this motion before the House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not as though the Liberal government did not know this 
issue was coming.  Last May the Minister for International Trade 
said: “Today's water is tomorrow's oil”.  We all know we can 
live without oil but we cannot live without water, and it is the 
telling tale of this government when it considers water as a 
commodity like oil rather than the vital element it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For years the government has been assuring Canadians that the 
North American Free Trade Agreement would not affect water.  Now 
we see that these assurances are not holding true.  An American 
company is suing through NAFTA because of a B.C. law that bans 
the bulk export of water.  At least B.C. has a law to strike 
down.  The Liberal government has done nothing at the federal 
level to protect our water.  It has left B.C.'s New Democratic 
Party government to fight alone to protect Canada's freshwater. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The heart of this issue is whether we are to treat water as a 
market commodity.  Some free market theologians argue that 
everything should be a commodity.  We in the New Democratic Party 
have nothing against free markets.  However, we believe there are 
things that belong outside the free market.  There are things 
that society should make a conscious decision to deal with 
differently and not leave to the whims of the market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure most Canadians would agree with this.  One good 
example of something that most Canadians think should not be on 
the free market commodity is drugs.  To steal a line from film 
maker Michael Moore, if absolutely everything was a free market 
commodity, General Motors would sell crack.  This seems like a 
funny and strange thing to say, but it shows that some things do 
not belong on the free market.  Society has decided that drugs 
should not be available on the free market and government has 
made the laws to make that happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing that Canadians do not want to see treated like a 
commodity is health care.  All we have to do is look south of the 
border to see what a disaster it would be if we treated health 
care like something to be bought and sold.  Millions of Americans 
do not have the security of health insurance.  The American 
health care system also blows away the argument that the free 
market is always more efficient than a public system.  Americans 
spend more per capita than Canadians on health care.  Yet 
Canadians have universal coverage.  Our public system of health 
care costs us less and covers the entire population.  So much for 
the myth that free market is automatically more efficient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians rightly believe that health care is a right.  It 
should be available to everyone, not only to those who can afford 
to pay for it on the free market.  This is the principle that 
drove New Democrat Party founder Tommy Douglas when, as premier 
of Saskatchewan, he introduced public health care to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the New Democratic Party believe that freshwater, like 
health care, should not be treated like a commodity.  Like health 
care, water is a necessity of life.  We all need it to survive. 
We use it to water our crops and raise the animals we eat. 
Comments like the trade minister's comparison of water to oil 
show that the government does not see it that way.  The trade 
minister apparently thinks water is a commodity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Removing large amounts of water from our ecosystem would be a 
disaster.  It would damage our forests and our fish habitats. 
These habitats are vital to our tourism and our commercial 
fishing industries.  On top of all that, we cannot predict how 
exporting large amounts of water from our ecosystem will affect 
our rain and weather patterns.  If I were a farmer on the 
prairies I would be very concerned about this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our ecosystem cannot afford to lose those large amounts of 
water.  If the government is sincere about wanting to protect our 
water and our environment, it will support our motion and it will 
move with great speed to initiate the required legislation. 
Canadians are tired of the government telling them our hands are 
tied by trade deals.  We have seen a pattern of cave-ins from the 
government.  It caved in on protecting Canadian magazines. It 
caved in on MMT. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each time it points to the trade deals and says “it is not our 
fault, we have to obey our treaties.  It is the government's 
fault.  If our trade deals are to prevent the government from 
doing what is right for Canadians, then we should not be signing 
those deals.  I am all in favour of trade deals but we should use 
some common sense and not sign deals that strip away power from 
our democratically elected governments.  If this government will 
not stand up for Canada's sovereignty, it should move aside and 
let someone else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whenever I hear the Liberal government say we have to honour our 
trade deals, I cannot help but think about our treaties with the 
first nations, treaties that are as legitimate as the trade deals 
with other countries like the United States.  I cannot help but 
notice the double standard.  The Liberal government treats its 
treaties with foreign countries like they are carved in stone but 
feels free to ignore aboriginal treaties whenever it wants. 
It is interesting to note that our treaties with the first 
nations include rights and title to water resources, but it does 
not just apply on reserves and it applies to all traditional land 
use.

environment and not a commodity to be sold.  I urge my colleagues

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member for Churchill is firmly opposed to selling freshwater. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding, there are a number of places that sell water. 
Obviously, it does not mean redirecting a river or emptying a 
lake, I agree.  It is a natural resource.  All the parties are 
satisfied, including the producer, that is, the owner of the 
farm where the water is drawn, and the companies that buy this 
water of exceptional quality.  Everyone is happy in this market. 
And I do not think I am exaggerating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What if the people of Alberta were asked, for example, to stop 
selling oil because it is not renewable—there is a limited 
quantity of oil in the subsoil and once that is used up there is 
no more—what if someone came up with a similar motion, whereby 
the sale or extraction of oil would be banned, and the oil would 
be kept for domestic use? I do not think that would be so 
intelligent, because we in the east import oil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some countries do not have enough water.  We, it appears, have 
over 20% of the world's drinking water and we say “We are going 
to keep it just for us, regardless of what you might offer us”. 
I remind you that while there is one extreme, there is another 
extreme too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder whether the member for Churchill could tell us how far 
we could go with her motion. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for the question.  I do not think there is any question 
that the reasonableness of what happens with water in general is 
of concern here.  We do not want to see the bulk export of water 
and large quantities of waters going outside their normal area. 
No one has ever argued that the sale of water in bottles should 
not take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is really coming into question is the export of water to 
the point that we need something in place where we are not going 
to have a pipeline that brings water out of Canada to somewhere 
else.  I was in Arizona during the break for a very short period 
of time and saw thousands of Canadians down enjoying the weather 
and also listened to those thousands of Canadians saying they are 
getting back up to Canada after because they know it will get too 
hot down there. They also commented on the way the water is being 
used there and how dried up the water is by the time it hits the 
Mexican border. If we take the approach that it is okay to send 
the water down to one area and use it all up, there will not be 
enough for everybody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is reasonableness out there.  No one is saying that if 
people are dying of thirst somewhere that Canada is not going to 
help them out.  That is not what we are talking about.  We are 
talking about using water as a money making, money grabbing way. 
We are talking about the owner of an area selling his water where 
he can make the most money, and for what.  For someone to have an 
extra swimming pool.  That is what we are talking about.  We are 
talking about having water available for things that are not the 
necessities of life and they want the export of Canadian water to 
do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Canadians would not be understanding if countries or people 
were in need of water would not happen. Canada is not that kind 
of country.  We are saying that we need to protect the resources 
we have.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Management of water is a shared responsibility between the 
provinces, territories and the federal government. The federal

waters treaty of 1909. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's position has been consistent.  We stated our 
position in 1988 and stood by it in 1993.  We stand by it today. 
The government has consulted with the provinces and the

the member care to dispute any of those facts? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais:</B>  Madam Speaker, with regard to the 
NAFTA situation, I do not think we are absolutely comfortable 
that NAFTA would protect the water.  There is no question that

Canadians feeling vulnerable to what could happen with water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to wait until they say sorry, NAFTA does not

am very proud today to participate in the debate on the motion

a number of members have already noted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion calls on the House to place an immediate moratorium 
on the export of bulk freshwater shipments and to assert Canada's 
sovereign right to protect, preserve and conserve our freshwater 
resources for future generations.  This is something that 
obviously is very significant.  It is important that it be 
debated in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Listening to the comments of my colleague in the NDP from 
Churchill and understanding that in her constituency of northern 
Manitoba, water as a resource, as a way of life, as a part of the 
environment, as part of the history of that province, is very 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I represent a very urban riding.  Water does not pop up on the 
agenda every day.  I deal with issues of drug abuse and 
homelessness and poverty.  Yet when I talk to constituents in my 
riding of Vancouver East about the importance of having a sense 
of national purpose around the very precious resource of water, 
there would be very strong agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am certainly not an expert in this area and many of us in the 
House are not experts.  However, we fundamentally understand as 
Canadians that one of the things that makes this country very 
great and one of the things we are very proud of is our natural 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Canadians we have a very strong sense that one of the 
purposes and roles of our federal government is to preserve and 
protect the natural resources we have been endowed with.  We are 
the custodians of those resources for future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the motion before us today is very important.  It is 
here to be debated because regrettably we do not have a national 
policy about the protection of this resource.  That is why we are 
here debating this motion today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have certainly heard from members opposite, from the Liberal 
government.  We have heard many debates, many promises, many 
campaign slogans that water as a natural resource is something 
that will be protected by legislation and by national policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have yet to see that happen.  I think it is a real tragedy. 
I hope today in debating this motion there will be an 
acknowledgement and a recognition that this issue is now very 
critical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my province of British Columbia I am very proud that we have 
had a provincial government with the courage to enact legislation 
to protect water as a very precious resource.  That legislation 
is being challenged by a foreign corporation under NAFTA which is 
now claiming damages in the order of $300 million from the B.C. 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one hand, it is very important for us as parliamentarians 
and as policy makers to make it very clear that we do agree there 
should be national legislation, that there should be a moratorium 
as an immediate measure to prevent the bulk export of freshwater 
from Canada to other places.

that different promises have different kinds of policies around 
this question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the New Democratic Party we are saying this issue goes to the 
very heart of what it means to be a sovereign nation.  It goes to 
the very heart of what it means for democratically elected 
governments to be able to enact public policies around issues 
like health care or the management and protection of water.  That 
is what this debate is about today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think Canadians would agree that we cannot afford to continue 
along a direction where basically water is up for grabs in this 
country where under different situations provincially we may have 
various licences that are handed out, we may have bulk export and 
it becomes something that a province may or may not pass 
legislation about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need leadership from the House.  We need leadership from the 
federal government to make it very clear that there is a 
commitment to put into place what has been stated so many times. 
There is a public consciousness about this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Council of Canadians, which has a very broad and diverse 
network and membership across Canada, has made this one of its 
key issues.  In its recent <I>Canadian Perspectives</I> there is a 
very good article entitled “Our Water's Not for Sale” by Maude 
Barlow: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before this goes any further, we need a public debate in Canada. 
I believe that water is a public trust.  It belongs to the 
people.  No one has the right to appropriate it or profit from it 
at someone else's expense.  An adequate supply of clean water for 
people's daily living needs is a basic human right and is best 
protected by maintaining control of water in the public sector. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wholeheartedly agree with those comments and call on the 
government to basically bring in that legislation that has been 
promised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope this will be a unanimous vote in the House of Commons 
today.  I have heard debate from all sides of the House and I 
think we understand the importance of this issue.  We need to 
unite on this issue, represent the interests of Canadians and 
protect the future of our environment and say that we are willing 
to stand up for this resource and not just see it treated as a 
good or commodity that can be traded away for vast profits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must take the honourable course and say there is a public 
interest here that overrides private interests.  The public 
interest is that we have to protect that water resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members of the House to basically support this motion 
and for Liberal members to ask themselves why their government 
has not brought forward the legislation and see this motion as a 
first step to a real commitment to take the legislative steps 
necessary to make this motion a reality in terms of protecting 
this resource. I urge all members to support the motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
think the hon. member of the New Democratic Party is right to 
say that the federal government was all talk in the past. It has 
been all talk and no action with respect to the export of 
drinking water. Nothing has been done to protect the quality of 
our water, this vital resource for humanity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what I am so uneasy about in the NDP motion before the 
House today. 
After all is said and done, this government has indeed done 
nothing. Some provinces, like British Columbia, passed 
legislation on water exports. Others have seen to it that 
anything having to do with their freshwater or drinking water 
requires legislation to be passed; this way they are in control. 
This motion would be putting in this government's hands Canada's 
sovereign right to protect, preserve and conserve our freshwater 
resources for future generations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sorry but I think that what this motion is saying right now 
is “You the provinces have done what you had to do; now that the 
bandwagon is on the move, let the Canadian government jump on 
and take over everything you have done”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do hope that is not 
the intent, but that is how I interpret it. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for her comments and her question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out the intent of the motion presented by New 
Democratic Party.  Very clearly the motion is calling on the 
government, in co-operation with the provinces, to place an 
immediate moratorium on the export of bulk freshwater shipments, 
et cetera.  I think we are very mindful of the fact that in this 
day and age we need to develop an approach to federalism that is 
co-operative and responsive to provincial needs.  That is why the 
motion was written in that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think the motion has been brought forward because all 
of a sudden we have noticed there is a problem.  This has been an 
issue of public debate for a very long time.  There are 
environmental groups, organizations, individuals and even members 
of the Liberal cause, as well as other members of the House, who 
have campaigned to ensure there is a sense of national purpose 
around the preservation of this precious resource.  This motion 
has not suddenly popped up on us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I would point out that there is a very critical 
situation in B.C. because of claims being made by Sun Belt, which 
is, in effect, taking on the B.C. government.  It is very 
important that the response to that be based on what is our 
national policy.  Unfortunately we do not have one.  It is very 
important to have that so it is not one province at a time which 
is trying to take on this issue. 
<P><A NAME="LINK245"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
the member will know that the Sun Belt case is not about our 
right to manage Canadian waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a brief question for the member.  She probably is aware 
that the government does not support the bulk selling of water 
and that in fact the motion states support for the existing 
government policy with regard to the export of water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member suggesting that this motion is to reaffirm a 
position which this government has already taken? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Madam Speaker, first of all, the issue 
involving Sun Belt is about dealing with this resource and 
managing it in terms of the public interest.  It raises very 
serious questions about the kinds of trade deals we have signed, 
like the NAFTA, which place in jeopardy our ability to have a 
public policy around these issues.  Therefore I would disagree 
with the member's assumption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of it already being policy, I think that begs the 
question:  If it is already in place and operable, then why do we 
have these kinds of situations developing?  The fact is, there is 
no national legislation, and legislation has been promised by the 
Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member believes that it is already in place, then I would 
assume he would enthusiastically support the motion and carry it 
further to ensure the legislation comes forward. 
<P><A NAME="LINK246"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to speak to this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently I had the occasion to be in Washington.  While there, I 
and some of my colleagues had the opportunity to speak with 
Ambassador Chrétien about this particular subject.  His comments 
were quite interesting. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1605"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT74"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT74"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1605

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He made the point, which I thought was very valid, that in some 
states in the United States a litre of water is actually more 
expensive than a litre of gasoline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about water we get into all kinds of emotional 
conversations about nationalism and how precious this resource is 
and things of that nature, but I think the point the ambassador 
was making was that water has already been reduced to being a 
commodity.  It is a commodity with a price.  It is a commodity 
that can be bought and sold, and the pressure for it to be a 
commodity will ever increase upon us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The irony is that a litre of gasoline or coal, or oil for that 
matter, is a litre of product that is dug up, transported and 
consumed, much like a litre of water can be transported and 
consumed.  Therefore the question becomes:  What is the 
significant difference between a litre of water and a litre of 
any other product? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As other speakers have alluded to over the course of the debate, 
the real difference is that a litre of water is something on 
which life depends.  Therein lies the distinction between a litre 
of another resource based product, a product that is dug up, 
transported and consumed, and this particular product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to continue to emphasize the point that water is a 
commodity that will continue to be subject to trade disputes and 
that it is a limited resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada we live under some illusions.  We occupy something in 
the order of 7% of the world's land mass and we have about 9% of 
the world's freshwater resources.  That would be good if we 
stopped there, but of that 9%, 60% drains north, while 90% of our 
population is south.  Therefore, 90% of our population has access 
to only about 40% of our water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the population spread and the concentration of our 
population that should be adequate.  But, arguably, we are not a 
water resource rich country.  We have more water resources than 
do many countries; nevertheless, we do not have water to 
squander.  We do not have water to give away.  We do not have 
water to use in a way that would be an improper stewardship of 
the resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How should we, as a House, respond to the resolution that is 
before us?  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should, in 
co-operation with the provinces, place an immediate moratorium on 
the export of bulk freshwater shipments and inter-basin transfers 
and should introduce legislation to prohibit bulk freshwater 
exports and inter-basin transfers and should not be a party to 
any international agreement that compels us to export freshwater 
against our will in order to assert Canada's sovereign right to 
protect, preserve and conserve our freshwater resources for 
future generations. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would refer my hon. colleagues on the government side to the 
joint statement made by the governments of Canada, the United 
States and Mexico following the NAFTA in 1993, which reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless water in any form has entered into commerce or become a 
good or product, it is not a good or product covered by any trade 
agreement, including the NAFTA. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing in the NAFTA would oblige any NAFTA party to either 
exploit its water for commercial use or begin exporting water in 
any form, and I emphasize “in any form”.  The thrust of the 
resolution, as I understand it, is that it is with respect to 
bulk transfers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The joint statement goes on to affirm that Canada and every 
NAFTA partner has sovereignty over their water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Water in its natural state—in lakes, rivers, reservoirs, 
aquifers, water basins and the like—is not a good or a product, 
and that is critical phraseology with respect to these trade 
agreements. 
It is not a good or a product.  It is not traded.  Therefore it 
is not and has never been subject to the terms of any trade 
agreement.  Nothing forces us to export water in bulk.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose the distinction is that water is a resource on which 
all life depends.  Therefore it is a resource that is 
significantly different than other resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to the text of the NAFTA, but I also refer to the fact 
that this is an area of joint jurisdiction.  Usually at this 
point in my speeches I tend to beat up on the Government of 
Ontario because I profoundly disagree with the attitude of that 
government in many areas.  But in this particular case I think 
the Government of Ontario is moving in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Initially it had a bit of a brain cramp.  It issued an export 
license with respect to what is known as the Nova project.  It 
was prepared to export water and saw nothing wrong with doing 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, quite a number of people saw something wrong with it. 
Representatives from the United States governments, both at the 
state and federal levels, saw something wrong with it. Many 
federal members as well saw something wrong with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Initially and immediately the Ontario government revoked its 
license.  It has entered into a public process to review how 
licenses are to be granted pursuant to the Ontario Water 
Resources Act, which states “The purpose of this regulation is 
to provide for the conservation, protection and wise use and 
management of Ontario's surface water because Ontario's water 
resources are essential to the long term environmental, social 
and economic well-being of Ontario”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on in article 3 to talk about the considerations that a 
regulator is to enter into with respect to export licenses. These 
are the issues:  protection of the natural functions of the 
ecosystem; private domestic uses; livestock and other uses; 
municipal water supplies; groundwater that may affect or be 
affected by the proposed surface taking; other existing and 
planned uses; whether it is in the public interest to grant the 
permit; and such other matters that seem expedient to the 
director. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view, those are intelligent regulations which need and 
deserve the support of this House and this government. The 
resolution of the Government of Ontario is worth supporting, 
which is something that I frankly thought I would never say in 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is not a party to any agreement which compels it to 
export water in bulk.  It is not a party to any agreement in the 
NAFTA.  It is not party to any agreement outside of the NAFTA.  In 
fact in the joint management provisions under the International 
Joint Commission, the reference that that body acts in the best 
interests of the basin, as opposed to the best interests of each 
individual country or jurisdiction, is an area that is well 
protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontario has done something which is quite cleaver.  It has 
entered into the protection of the watershed area.  That, in and 
of itself, takes it out of the trade jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, water is a product.  The pressure is building.  It 
will continue to be a product and we need to be wise stewards. 
Jurisdictional initiatives on the part of the federal government 
and on the part of the provincial governments are, in my view, 
wise initiatives.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
Lavoisier, the great 16th century scholar, brought us the 
principle of the conservation of matter.  There is a set amount 
of water on the planet and this amount does not change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, my colleague, the member for Chicoutimi, reminded me of 
the floods in the Saguenay region and in Manitoba.  The fact 
that it rained heavily in these two places does not mean that 
there is more water on the planet.  If more rain falls in 
Chicoutimi one year, less will fall in Washington, Tel Aviv or 
Paris the following year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The planet's resources in water—or ice, of course—x number of 
years ago are the same resources it will have x number of years 
from now. 
This is known as the water cycle, and we have Lavoisier to thank 
for our understanding of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the member for Scarborough East and I will 
use Newfoundland as an example, rather than Quebec.  I am sure 
the member has seen Churchill Falls.  The number of cubic metres 
of water that go over it per second is mind-boggling. 
Newfoundland could fill a huge ship with containers of water and 
sell it somewhere like New York.  It is said that, in that city, 
a litre of water costs more than a litre of gas.  Newfoundland 
could make a lot of money that way.  It would be more lucrative 
to sell water than oil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to believe what we are hearing, Newfoundland will not 
have this opportunity. 
If not just a truckload, but a whole boatload of water is 
removed from the Churchill River as it flows to the Atlantic 
Ocean, nothing is lost and the water will eventually return to 
the Atlantic Ocean via New York, because of the principle of the 
conservation of matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, I too will object to major changes in the courses of 
rivers or to draining lakes dry, but when we look at examples as 
simple as these, I do not see why the sale of water in 
containers would be prohibited when, in fact, it does not 
deplete the ecosystem in any way. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Madam Speaker, the hon. member's question 
has a certain logic to it which needs to be addressed in an 
unemotional and logical way.  It is true that the volume of water 
remains constant in the environment.  It may be placed here or 
placed there or misplaced or misused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The response to the question as to why not, that if the people 
of Newfoundland can make a bit of money what is the harm, is 
another law of physics which is for every action there is an 
equal opposite reaction.  I do not think we are at the point 
where we can remove water in bulk and not expect an ecosystem 
reaction of some kind or another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Ontario government's regulation in this area is wise.  It 
deals with the entire watershed, the entire basin, and how all 
the streams, rivers and lakes, et cetera, are impacted with 
respect to the removal of water in bulk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that is the response to his very logic question.  In 
principle there should be no good reason but there inevitably has 
to be a reaction of some kind once water is continuously removed 
in bulk.  It is not as if the boat backs up and takes it once. 
It is there time after time after time.

issues, and certainly the debate today on freshwater is such an 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Water is very important to all of us.  In Canada we must learn 
how to care for this resource. 
Freshwater, a primal resource, has always been valued highly 
throughout history and has often been referred to as the font of 
life.  Water is a substance of great spiritual and sacramental 
significance for Christians and for those of many other faiths 
and beliefs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Freshwater sustains our life and health on a daily basis.  We 
depend upon water for food production, transportation, commercial 
purposes, recreation and tourism.  The sight, sound, feel and 
taste of clean water nourish our sense of well-being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For Canadians freshwater has important real and symbolic value. 
Nine per cent of the world's renewable freshwater resources and 
twenty per cent of the world's freshwater resources including 
waters captured in glaciers and polar ice caps are found within 
Canada.  We are proud of our beautiful lakes, our powerful rivers 
and waterfalls and the majesty of our natural heritage which 
frames our water resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet even in Canada our abundant water supplies are vulnerable on 
a daily basis to a host of outside influences and activities. 
These range from inadequate waste water treatment to hydro 
electric generation, industrial activities, pollution and the 
effects of climate change, cycles of flood or drought that have 
devastating impacts on people's lives.  As well, how we as 
individuals treat our freshwater resources is an issue for 
consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians rank second in the world for their per capita water 
consumption and yet pay for only half the cost of water supply. 
Over the next 10 years costs for maintaining this infrastructure 
in Canada are estimated to be $40 billion to $70 billion. 
Therefore we as custodians of freshwater must manage this 
resource wisely not only for today but for our grandchildren. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is leading several initiatives to 
restore, conserve and protect major Canadian watersheds.  Current 
initiatives are focusing on the St. Lawrence River, the Great 
Lakes, the Fraser River and Georgia Basin, the Atlantic coastal 
action plan and the northern rivers ecosystem initiative in 
Alberta and the Northwest Territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A study of the northern river basin has provided information on 
the cumulative impact of development of the Peace, Athabasca and 
Slave rivers.  The new northern ecosystem initiative is in the 
design phase and will focus on Canada's Arctic regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These initiatives are built on the principle that we cannot 
manage water simply on a resource or sector basis.  We must take 
an integrated ecosector approach that looks at the full range of 
pressures affecting both water quality and quantity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each of these initiatives addresses specific regional needs and 
priorities in each watershed, promotes partnerships that involve 
all sectors and encourages community involvement.  Each results 
in the development of basin-wide action plans to resolve complex 
environmental issues, particularly deteriorating water quality 
that threatens human and environmental health in these areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through these programs we have seen a 96% reduction in toxic 
effluent discharges by 50 major industrial plants along the St. 
Lawrence, reductions in contaminant levels of targeted pollutants 
in the Great Lakes, clean-up of contaminated harbours such as 
Collingwood harbour, the implementation of best practices and 
pollution prevention plans in many businesses and industries 
along the Fraser River. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Watersheds include much more than lakes or rivers. They are 
complete ecosystems in which the waters are drained toward a 
common waterway or drainage basin. A single watershed, such as 
the Great Lakes, can include a large segment of the Canadian 
landscape because, in addition to the lakes themselves, it 
includes all the waterways and their tributary streams. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether it is through a channel, by ship, by water tanker truck, 
or through a water system, the removal of large volumes of water 
from a watershed has a direct and major impact on water 
resources and the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bulk removal can adversely affect the quality of a watershed. It 
is important to better understand the immediate and cumulative 
effects of such removal, and to know how to improve the 
management of our freshwater resources. By contrast, the taking 
of small volumes of water for the purpose of bottling that water 
does not have the same adverse effect. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Major water extraction may change the environment, altering the 
habitats of native species and possibly introducing new exotic 
species not normally found in that ecosystem. 
These changes to the ecosystem could also impact on how people 
live and work.  Water resources everywhere face growing pressure 
from urbanization, industrial activities and the sheer growth in 
the number of people on the face of the earth.

increase over an extended period.

of the climate change action fund.

development and implementation of a greater number of 
technologies that are respectful of the climate.

national action on water.  Internationally the federal government

through in terms of consulting with aboriginal people who have an 
obvious interest, many of them in water resources?

over the last part of the year, in particular the Nova request to

company to withdraw water in Newfoundland.  There was a request 
to withdraw water from B.C.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):</B> Madam Speaker, I would first 
like to say that our party will be supporting this motion, not 
because we find it a rigorous or well defined motion but rather 
because we find it a motion that sounds a sort of alarm with 
regard to freshwater. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main point of the motion is simply to act to ensure that 
throughout Canada there is an effective freshwater management 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is a little hard to accept is the fact that the NDP motion 
gives us the impression that life starts today only. 
I would point out to my NDP colleagues that considerable effort 
has been made in recent decades—not 100 years ago, but in 
recent decades—because that is a fact. Parliamentarians, like 
their fellow citizens, evolve at a normal rate.  Problems arise, 
we become aware of them and we develop ways to resolve them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current government and the previous governments acted to 
protect flora and fauna, for example with the acid rain treaty. 
We realized that massive destruction was going on.  The 
agreement was signed by the previous government, and I think it 
was effective.  Sometimes we forget too easily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the area of the St. Lawrence action plan, I can tell members 
that tens of millions of dollars have been invested to protect 
our waterways, particularly the Saguenay fjord, where whole 
pockets of shrimp have been flooded with industrial waste. Some 
changes take place slowly, but at an acceptable rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think we should address this motion as one that is 
dogmatic and that will make everything better.  No, indeed.  The 
issue requires realistic treatment.  Things were done in the 
past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our NDP colleagues put everything in terms of the free trade 
agreement.  People have spoken today confirming that the 
agreement protects this aspect, protects our country against 
massive exports of freshwater.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote later from the speech that was made at the time on 
the protection afforded freshwater by the FTA and NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This proposal is also somewhat petty and lacking in solidarity. 
Freshwater is Canadian property and international property as 
well. My colleague from Frontenac—Mégantic referred earlier to 
the whole commercial aspect of renewable resources. I think we 
must devise a work plan for efficient management, “in 
co-operation with the provinces”, as the motion states, I might 
add. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that commercialization not be excluded from the 
word go. We can never tell what the future holds. At present, 
there are situations which we feel could potentially take on 
dramatic proportions around the world. In the early stages of 
developing a management plan, one cannot say “We are closing the 
door completely on providing any support to countries where 
there is a clear lack of other resources”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the technology ever be developed to take salt out of 
seawater? Maybe, maybe not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must put in place an efficient management plan. That is what 
makes me say that there can be no jurisdiction. This is an 
objective we must set for ourselves as a nation, in fact as a 
continent. 
Nothing more clearly transcends municipal, provincial, national 
and continental jurisdictions than the introduction of a plan 
that will help us improve management of our resources on a large 
scale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Large-scale plans are fine but, as a general rule, this calls for 
effective municipal action.  I remember the water purification 
program of the 1980s.  Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons, 
many municipalities in Quebec were denied the benefits of the 
national water purification program, but there is no doubt about 
the importance of having such a plan in our municipalities, 
however costly or technically challenging.  Furthermore, it has 
not yet been completed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must approve this motion for its very laudable goal of having 
all levels of government work together to implement something 
sensible and intelligent, without closing the door to 
continental or international exchanges of assistance, because 
one never knows what the future holds in store. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important that the government be able to react 
positively to this issue, because major changes are under way. 
Right now, we are not in a position to forecast future climatic 
changes.  These changes are apparently happening faster than 
anticipated.  This is therefore one more reason to urge the 
government to take rapid action in a sector that we feel is 
vital to our future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my hope that, as was the case for the St. Lawrence action 
plan and the creation of a marine national park in my region, 
among other initiatives, the development of a national, 
provincial and even continental plan can take place without any 
bickering, since this would only make us waste time. I have 
often seen a lot of time being wasted during federal-provincial 
negotiations. In the end, the losers are our fellow citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was pleased to see government members confirm that both the 
FTA and NAFTA guarantee total protection against bulk exports of 
freshwater. Indeed, I was pleased to see this confirmation from 
government members, since they voted against free trade at the 
time.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1988 election campaign was run on that issue. The Liberals 
claimed that the Americans would come and take all the water 
from our lakes. It was going to be terrible. Yet, at the time, 
we had confirmation that freshwater exports in very small 
containers were the only thing that had been agreed to during 
the negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This shows that demagoguery often rules in politics. We must 
live with that reality. Over the middle and the long term, 
history eventually vindicated those who negotiated that 
agreement in good faith. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a quote that shows the position taken at that time. It is 
from Mr. Wilson, the Minister of Industry, Science and 
Technology and Minister of Foreign Trade, who said “Permit me to 
repeat what the free trade agreement expressly provides, and 
which will also go for the North American free trade agreement 
as well.  It is clearly understood that neither this nor the 
agreement applies to water, meaning surface and underground 
water”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He continued “What I said in my initial response describes the 
position and the policy of the Government of Canada with respect 
to the export of water.  Water may be exported in bottles.  Bulk 
export of water, especially the diversion of waterways, is not”. 
It was clear at the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, we will support this motion, which is a motion of 
principle sounding an alarm on the importance of having a 
management plan, in co-operation with all other levels of 
government, and I thank my colleagues for putting it to the 
House.

Canada's sovereign right over water, why does he believe then 
that the United States, especially the state of California, has 
launched a $220 million lawsuit against the province of British 
Columbia? The province has forbidden bulk water tanker shipments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer again to the MMT case in which Canada capitulated and 
gave $13.5 million U.S. to a foreign national and maintained the 
gasoline additive MMT, which is a neurotoxin, within our borders. 
I suspect that the state of California and the companies that 
are there suspect they may have a legal loophole or a legal 
avenue in which to approach or sue the Government of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey:</B> Madam Speaker, the free trade agreement was 
signed; the North American free trade agreement was signed. 
There is a tribunal to provide dispute arbitration.  As far as I 
know, the trade agreement exists.  In the past ten years, as far 
as I know, James Bay and the Great Lakes have not been moved to 
Las Vegas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must look to the future.  We had legal guarantees in the 
agreement.  Now, in the spirit of the motion, it is vital Canada 
do everything possible to create an effective plan to manage 
freshwater.  It is a finite resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not forget it represents 3% of all the planet's 
reserves.  That means that we have about one quarter of one per 
cent of these reserves. 
It warrants effective management, but it must be management in 
consultation with local governments, both municipal and 
provincial, and the federal government, which has the vital job 
of co-ordinator.

water there is on the planet, just one seed.  That is not much, 
compared to a whole grapefruit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of that amount, 98% is salt water, and only 2% fresh.  Of that 
2% freshwater, 20% is located in Canada, and a very large

would be in agreement to the extent of seeing areas of 
provincial jurisdiction, including that of Quebec—he being a 
Quebec MP—encroached upon, in order to comply with the motion by 
the NDP.  I await the response of my colleague and friend from 
Chicoutimi. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague from 
Frontenac—Mégantic, who always has highly pertinent questions, 
and whom I have the pleasure of seeing in the House on a daily 
basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concerning this question, yes indeed, I see that as inevitable, 
since this matter, in the framework of negotiations, while 
honouring the respective jurisdictions of the various levels of 
government, calls upon common sense as well as upon a concept 
very dear to the heart of my colleagues of the Bloc Quebecois, 
the concept of partnership for attaining objectives of 
importance to our people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the spirit in which all governments must pool their 
efforts in order to find a global solution.  This affects not 
only the riding of Chicoutimi, but the riding of 
Frontenac—Mégantic as well, not only just Quebec or Ontario, but 
all Canadians, and all the people who live on this planet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must, therefore, speak to each other.  There is nothing on 
this earth that brings out interdependency more than anything to 
do with the environment.  I believe that a healthy dose of

results.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
welcome the attention being paid today to protecting Canada's 
freshwater resources.  I am also very pleased that this concern 
extends beyond potential trade of our water resources.  I refer 
more broadly to how we manage our watersheds and specifically to 
the need to prevent transfers of water between drainage basins or 
watersheds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed the watershed is recognized as the fundamental ecological 
unit in protecting and conserving our water resources.  Bulk 
transfer or removal of water, whether for use elsewhere in Canada 
or for export purposes, could potentially have a significant 
impact on the health and integrity of our watersheds. It is 
important that Canadians work together to ensure that we take a 
comprehensive and environmentally sound approach to protect our 
resources and our watersheds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Water is an essential part of all ecosystems, from the functions 
and life support provided by lakes, rivers and streams to the 
role of the hydrological cycle in sustaining water in its various 
forms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I have to

unwittingly was taking the space of a Conservative, which they 
seem to have done a lot of since 1993.  That being the case, that

</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue and the motion before us is one of critical 
importance.  It is very positive that the New Democrats have 
brought forward this motion for an important debate today and for 
an important debate in the future on the issue of water and more 
specifically on bulk freshwater exports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some concern about the motion upon first glance. 
I will quote the motion specifically.  It recommends that the 
government “should introduce legislation to prohibit bulk 
freshwater exports and interbasin transfers”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would support and our party is supporting this motion.  We 
want to ensure that a debate on this very important topic occurs 
here in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that the government should introduce legislation such 
that there can be a debate in the House of Commons on this issue, 
a full debate that can delve into this extremely serious issue. 
That being the case, I think we all need more information before 
we would necessarily support in the future the legislation which 
the government brings forward in terms of prohibiting bulk 
freshwater exports and interbasin transfers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be supporting the motion today because of the importance 
of this debate.  That being the case, if and when the legislation 
is actually brought forward, we would appreciate the opportunity 
to debate fully the pros and cons of the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was noted earlier, and it is very important to recognize, 
that the PC Party did in the NAFTA negotiations move to protect 
freshwater.  During an earlier exchange between my hon. colleague 
from the New Democratic Party and a member from my party, some 
questions were raised as to the sanctity of water and the 
protection of water under NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that trade agreements and trade negotiations are 
ongoing. This is not a static process.  A trade agreement is not 
reached and then that is the end of it.  An ongoing process of 
negotiation and discussion occurs, not just between countries, 
but between subnational governments within a sovereign state like 
Canada. That is an important issue which has to be discussed more 
fully within this House once the legislation is brought forward. 
We have to discuss the jurisdictional authority over water within 
Canada and the roles of subnational governments with the federal 
government in terms of the jurisdiction and beyond that, the role 
in terms of the conservation of water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Water is a unique commodity.  It is more fundamental obviously 
to human life than any other commodity and certainly any 
potentially exportable commodity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just a trade issue, it is not just an environmental 
issue, it is even a foreign policy issue.  In a post cold war 
environment with an increasingly complicated world in terms of 
foreign affairs, with the declining role of the nation state, 
water is going to be—it is not a matter of will it be—but water 
is going to be the source of conflict in the future. In the past 
it may have been oil or some other commodity, but water in the 
future will be more important in the role it plays in our foreign 
policy and in terms of world conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an age where we talk more of human security versus national 
security, water certainly plays a role in both. Those will be 
issues that we have to delve into with significant debate. This 
type of debate has to exist in the committees for example, 
environment, trade, intergovernmental affairs, as well as in this 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The U.S. and Canada have no shortage of things to fight over. 
We have beer, wheat, lumber, magazines, all kinds of trade issues 
to deal with on an ongoing basis.  Canada has 20% of the world's 
freshwater supply, most of it in the Great Lakes.  The remainder 
is pouring unchecked into three oceans.  The United States with 
one-tenth of our freshwater has nearly nine times as many people, 
a great deal of whom want to live in the scenic but dry 
southwest, but all of whom need water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly there is growing pressure on Canada to export water in 
bulk.  These attempts of course have run afoul of 
environmentalists, the Canadian government and Canadian 
nationalists.  Naturally it has ended up in the courts as part of 
the ongoing process of international trade engagement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The latest battle in California between Sun Belt Water company 
and the province of British Columbia is just another example of 
the types of ongoing negotiations and legal battles that we will 
have within the NAFTA framework.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We should always expect that these will occur periodically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important that we do not dismiss at hand the export 
of water.  Some estimates are that 60% of our freshwater supply 
is wasted.  All someone has to do is spend a rain soaked winter 
in Vancouver to recognize that we have a significant supply of 
freshwater.  A significant amount of our water is running 
unchecked into oceans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly water is different.  Maude Barlow and the Council of 
Canadians argue that water is different.  Maude Barlow and the 
Council of Canadians believe that nothing should be traded.  She 
and her organization do not believe that in any way, shape or 
form trade can benefit Canadians.  I disagree fundamentally with 
that principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are supporting the motion today because we feel it is an 
important debate.  We will not be supporting the amendment, 
however, because the amendment is unequivocal and says that 
Canada should not be party to any international agreement that 
compels us to export freshwater against our will.  The word 
compels has its inherent ambiguity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe that any member of this House has all the facts 
to make that kind of unequivocal judgment at this time.  We need 
the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently the government will dither and dilly-dally as it is 
wont to do with a number of these types of issues.  Water export 
opportunities are appearing. In Gander, Newfoundland McCurdy 
Enterprises, formerly a construction company, has a proposal to 
load water from Gisborne Lake into oil tankers and ship it to 
parched souls in Asia. There are issues in British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an economic opportunity but we cannot partake in 
economic opportunities if they compromise our environmental 
policy in this country.  That is something I would argue no 
member of parliament would want to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot separate economic and environmental arguments.  The 
separation of economic and environmental arguments has led over 
the years to the degradation of the environment.  It is 
extraordinarily important that these two areas, economics and the 
environment, are inextricably linked in public policy.  We have 
to get our heads around this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be supporting the motion.  We will not be supporting the 
amendment.  We look forward to a legitimate debate in the House 
of Commons about this very important environmental and economic 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would hope that when that debate occurs we can consider all 
the spheres of influence involved, including our foreign policy, 
our policy in terms of foreign aid and our obligations to people 
in a human security and not just a national security context, and 
that we deal very seriously with an issue that could very easily 
be turned into a political issue and not a public policy issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I would 
just like to ask the hon. member about being compelled.  That is 
part of the amendment we have put forward here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask him how he would describe the whole MMT 
issue that occurred recently with the federal government.  The 
federal government was challenged on its legislation banning MMT 
by the Ethyl Corporation which sued it for damages and won. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems the federal government capitulated entirely in face of 
the NAFTA challenge.  I would say it was compelled to capitulate 
by the nature of the trade agreements we have entered into.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Compelled is a strong word but we have to start using some 
strong language at this point given the history of what we have 
seen happen on the trade floors and in the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the member for 
her question.  It is a very important question.  We have two 
areas of government policy in question here.  One is domestic 
legislation on the environment brought forward by the current 
minister of trade when he was minister of the environment, and 
the other is trade policy.  There are two separate areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue the MMT legislation brought forward by the current 
minister of trade was badly designed legislation that was not 
designed to effectively stand up to the rigours of NAFTA and to 
the questions of national treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>National treatment is a fundamental part of trade agreements and 
our obligations under NAFTA.  But national treatment simply means 
we are obligated in Canada to treat companies from another 
country with the same treatment that we would provide to our 
domestic companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If legislation is designed effectively that would apply for 
instance to our domestic companies in a non-discriminatory way, 
to protect the environment, that legislation would be tenable 
under NAFTA.  If legislation is designed very specifically to 
target one foreign company it may not be tenable. That is why we 
have to become more rigorous as legislators in developing 
legislation that can stand up to the rigours of national 
treatment and the questions therein.  I would argue that it was 
bad legislation.  It was poorly designed and it did not stand up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole question of national treatment boils down to one 
fundamental question.  If we would not allow a Canadian company 
to participate in environmentally unsound behaviour then we would 
not allow a foreign company to participate in environmentally 
unsound behaviour.  It is a national treatment issue. Pollution 
and environmental externals do not know national boundaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not see and have not been convinced by any of the opponents 
of liberalized trade how national treatment can jeopardize our 
environment if legislation in Canada is designed to stand up to 
the rigours of those trade agreements that we have signed and 
received the benefit of as Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
welcome the attention being brought to the House today regarding 
the protection of Canada's freshwater resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased that this concern extends beyond potential trade of 
our water resources by referring more broadly to how we manage 
our watersheds and specifically to the need to prevent transfers 
of water between drainage basins or watersheds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed the watershed is recognized as the fundamental ecological 
unit in protecting and conserving our water resources.  Bulk 
transfer or removal of water, whether for use elsewhere in Canada 
or for export purposes, could potentially have a significant 
impact on the health and integrity of our watersheds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that Canadians work together to ensure that we 
take a comprehensive and environmentally sound approach to 
protecting our water resources and their watersheds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Water is an essential part of all ecosystems, from the functions 
and life support provided by lakes, rivers and streams to the 
role of the hydrological cycle in sustaining water in its 
various forms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Access to adequate supplies of clean water is crucial to our 
health, to our quality of life and to Canada's competitive 
position.  Much of our economy and jobs are tied directly or 
indirectly to our supplies of water, from farming, forestry and 
industrial development to tourism and the recreational sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With 9% of the world's renewable freshwater resources it is easy 
for us to assume that Canada has an abundance of water. Given 
that Canada's land mass is approximately 7% of the world total, 
9% of its water does not seem disproportionate. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1710"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT87"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT87"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1710
<A HREF="#LINKT88"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT86"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we consider the imbalances in geographical distribution of 
water resources, the question of abundance becomes more relevant. 
About 60% of Canada's water flows northward while 90% of the 
population and most of Canada's industrial activity are found 
within 300 kilometres of the Canada-U.S. border where freshwater 
resources are increasingly in demand and some areas are polluted 
and unsafe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to these geographical variations in water abundance, 
Canada also experiences significant variations over time in water 
availability.  For example, the Red River in southern Manitoba 
has experienced flows ranging between 1 cubic metre per second 
and 2,700 cubic metres per second.  The Great Lakes watershed, 
which is home to 9 million Canadians and 33 million Americans, is 
experiencing its lowest level in 15 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Compounding these short term variations, climate change is 
expected to result in significant changes to water availability 
in different parts of the country.  Thus although Canada would 
seem to possess substantial water resources, there are regions in 
Canada in which scarcities exist or will exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must therefore have a strategy to ensure that water resources 
are managed and protected for future generations.  It is clear 
that interbasin transfers involving man-made diversions of large 
quantities of water between watersheds have the potential to 
cause the most significant social, economic and environmental 
impacts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we cannot ignore other means of bulk water removal such 
as by ocean tanker or pipeline which may cumulatively have the 
same impact on watersheds as large scale interbasin transfers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this reason I consider it of paramount importance that the 
issue of bulk water removal, including for export purposes, be 
considered in its entirety and that we not develop solutions to 
one problem at a time at the expense of a more comprehensive 
approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last 30 years concern about large scale export of 
Canadian water resources has risen primarily as a result of 
proposals to divert massive amounts of water to the United States 
to deal with water shortages or to allow for increased 
agricultural, industrial and urban development in areas of the 
United States with limited water supplies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several of these proposed megaprojects are worth mentioning. One 
of the largest continental water transfer proposals and probably 
the best known is the North American Water and Power Alliance 
project of the 1960s.  This project would have involved the 
diversion of water from Alaska, northwestern Canada and 
watersheds surrounding Hudson Bay and James Bay to arid areas in 
the western United States, the prairie provinces and northern 
Mexico. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another proposed megaproject was the grand recycling and 
northern development canal which would have transferred James Bay 
into a freshwater lake by building a dike between it and Hudson 
Bay and impounding the rivers that empty into the bay.  The flows 
of rivers would have been reversed to deliver water to the Great 
Lakes and from there to other destinations in North America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These megaprojects, while having the potential to create jobs 
and investments in Canada in the short term, would not benefit 
Canadian society in the long term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal water policy of 1987 addresses Canada's experience 
with interbasin transfer projects by advocating caution in 
considering their need and by endorsing other less disputed 
alternatives such as demand management and water conservation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current focus of water exports proposals, however, is by 
tanker ship using water from lakes and streams such as last 
year's proposal to export water from Lake Superior to Asian 
markets, or by tanker trucks or pipelines carrying water from 
surface to groundwater sources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only have the economics of water export clearly changed in 
terms of capital investment needs, but so has our understanding 
of the scope and the extent of potential environmental social and 
long term impacts. As I have already stated, bulk water removal, 
including export, must be viewed from a watershed approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This leads to the second concern that we take action to address 
the broad range of concerns facing freshwater in a comprehensive 
way rather than limiting ourselves to one export of water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support this motion.  I believe a comprehensive approach is 
what Canadians deserve and what Canadians will get.

</I></B></P><P align=left>About the point of order, I asked the speaker who was in the

and report back to the House as soon as possible, probably 
tomorrow.

fairly easily.  I presume it could be done with the unanimous

we were going to vote against it.  I did say “on division”, but 
I was at the back and may not have been heard.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If unanimous consent was being sought to start the process all 
over again with respect to the supply day motion and the 
amendment, that would be one thing.  But the fact of the matter 
is that we did not stand as we had planned to cause a vote to be 
taken on the motion and the amendment because we were under the 
impression there was unanimous consent, that no opposition had 
been expressed, in spite of the fact that the motion had been 
talked against throughout the day.

square one and start all over again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> The Speaker in the chair at 
the time did not hear the words “on division”.  The Speaker did 
not hear them. Therefore I would rule that no one having heard 
it, unless you give me time to review <I>Hansard</I>, perhaps it 
was heard there or on television, then I would come back.  We 
would then put it before the House and see what was happening at

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK271">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from November 17, 1998, consideration of the 
motion that Bill S-11, an act to amend the Canadian Human Rights 
Act in order to add social condition as a prohibited ground of 
discrimination, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK272"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to the merits of supporting Bill S-11, an act to 
amend the Canadian Human Rights act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill, sponsored by my colleague the hon. member for 
Shefford, was originally proposed in the Senate by my friend and 
Progressive Conservative colleague Senator Erminie Cohen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been fortunate enough to speak to a number of very 
important bills since being elected in June 1997.  I am very 
pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this particular bill 
because it addresses probably the most important right of all, 
that of human rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Senator Cohen comes from a province with an outstanding 
tradition of championing human rights issues.  Gordon 
Fairweather, the former member of parliament for Fundy—Royal, 
the riding I represent, was also Canada's first human rights 
commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>John Humphreys, the world renowned principal author of the 
United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, was born 
and buried in the town of Hampton which is in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Senator Cohen, like our fellow New Brunswickers, understands how 
difficult times affect Canadian families and the community as a 
whole when the local plants shut down.  Families have to make 
sacrifices that they never dreamed would happen to them.  She 
knows about the closures at the Potocan mine and the impending 
job losses at Lantic Sugar.  These are hardworking Canadians with 
an uncertain future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that anyone should be surprised that Senator 
Cohen has tabled this bill.  Bill S-11 shows her ability to care 
for individuals.  I have known Senator Cohen for a number of 
years.  I also know the member for Shefford.  They are caring 
individuals who want to ensure that we do the best for those 
persons at the margins of our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is about ensuring access to the basic tools people 
need to get back on their feet.  It is about maintaining pride 
and dignity despite the tough times life sometimes has to offer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently the Canadian Human Rights Act prohibits discrimination 
on the basis of race, religion, nationality or ethnic origin, 
colour, sex, marital status, family status, disability, 
conviction of an offence for which a pardon has been given, and 
sexual orientation.  By explicitly listing Canada's vulnerable 
groups, the poignantly absent qualification in the 22-year old 
act is a reference to social condition. Seven out of ten 
provinces in Canada prohibit discrimination on the basis of 
social condition, social origin or sources of income in their 
respective human rights legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the United Nations in its review of Canada's 
compliance with the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights signed in 1976, this great nation of ours 
received a failing grade on our ability to protect the rights of 
the poor.  We parliamentarians have an opportunity to take a 
tremendous leap forward and rectify this tragic situation by 
supporting Bill S-11.  The time for Canada to bring forward 
federal legislation is long overdue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 10 we celebrated the 50th anniversary of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  As I already mentioned, 
this document was drafted by native New Brunswicker and former 
resident of my riding of Fundy—Royal, John Humphreys. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1825"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT94"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT94"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1825

<A HREF="#LINKT93"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The declaration states essentially that all human beings 
regardless of their circumstances are born free and equal in 
dignity and rights.  This bears repeating.  All human beings 
regardless of their circumstances are born free and equal in 
dignity and rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a shame that Canada's own human rights act does not fully 
respect the goals and the intent of this important document, a 
document drafted by a Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 50th anniversary of this world renowned declaration also 
marked the end of the first year of the United Nations 
international decade for the eradication of poverty.  However, 
being poor in Canada continues to be one of our greatest hurdles 
for achieving equality.  There is no better time for us to act 
than now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One in five Canadian children live in poverty.  We recognize 
that when children are poor, it is because their families are 
poor.  As Canadians we are fortunate enough to live in a wealthy 
country but the marginalized are in need both physically and 
psychologically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding we try to address the physical needs of the poor 
through food basket programs run by great charitable 
organizations like the Sussex Sharing Club, the Lakewood 
Headstart Association, Kennebecasis Valley Food Basket, Chipman 
Community Care, the Minto Community Resource Centre and the 
Hampton Food Basket.  I am very proud of the sense of community 
that exists in my riding of Fundy—Royal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-11 addresses this inadequacy in our Constitution and 
offers the poor relief from negative stereotypes that affect 
their psychological well-being.  It promotes human dignity, the 
very essence of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While provincial legislation addresses the rights of the poor 
for issues under that jurisdiction, the federal human rights act 
covers issues under federal jurisdiction such as banking, housing 
and telecommunications.  As it stands today, the poor are too 
often denied housing or barred from opening bank accounts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-11 does not provide any special status for the poor. 
There is nothing contained in the bill that is not already 
afforded to other Canadians.  There is nothing to fear from 
endorsing this plan, yet I understand the government has no 
intention of supporting the legislation.  It instead promises to 
review the human rights act in its entirety for several possible 
changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This promise has been on the table since the Liberals took 
office and still no new legislation is planned.  Senator Cohen 
and the member for Shefford chose to take action now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is our duty as parliamentarians to serve on behalf of all 
constituents.  That is why it is incumbent on us to support this 
bill.  If we choose not to, then we are nowhere near the great 
moral authority our Prime Minister likes to call Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1989 the Progressive Conservative government took bold and 
persuasive action and succeeded in unanimously passing a 
resolution to eliminate child poverty by the year 2000.  Since 
that time, Canadians are unfortunately no closer to their goal 
due to the massive cuts in transfer payments to the provinces by 
this current government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we have the possibility to announce to Canadians that 
discrimination on the basis of social condition will no longer be 
tolerated.  Let us not waste that opportunity. 
<P><A NAME="LINK273"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I want to begin by stating that contrary to what was said, the 
Minister of Justice strongly endorses the premise of Bill S-11 
and the hon. member's desire to take a concrete step forward to 
assist the poor in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be denied services, accommodation or employment because one 
is poor is totally unacceptable in Canada and totally 
unacceptable by this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All Canadians are justifiably proud of their human rights 
protection.  We believe strongly in the inherent worth and 
dignity of each member of society.  If we are serious about 
protecting the poor, I believe we should do it right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government will soon be announcing a comprehensive review 
of the Canadian Human Rights Act.  This review will give us the 
opportunity to look very seriously at how we can best enhance 
human rights protection for the poor in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we really wish to ensure adequate human rights protection for 
all Canadians, then we must proceed in a thoughtful and 
principled manner.  We need to look at what human rights need to 
be protected and how they can be protected in the federal sector. 
In our opinion, this can best be done in the context of examining 
the Canadian Human Rights Act as a whole.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present government is proud of its human rights 
achievements.  We amended the Canadian Human Rights Act to 
prohibit discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and 
we brought in legislation requiring that all victims of 
discrimination be accommodated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently, we passed a bill to facilitate the integration of the 
disabled into the criminal justice system. 
We also increased compensation to victims of human rights 
discrimination and improved the structure of the human rights 
tribunal.  We have brought about advances in the protection of 
human rights in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government's efforts to improve the rights of the disabled 
recently won recognition.  During a visit to the United States, 
our Prime Minister was presented with the Franklin Delano 
Roosevelt award, an award given to the country that has most 
advanced the rights of the disabled. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has improved the CHRA in a time when some would 
limit or dismantle the protection given to the most vulnerable in 
our society.  The Minister of Justice is not content to rest on 
these improvements.  She is committed to an examination of the 
act in its entirety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In September the auditor general indicated, first, that the 
current act needed to be modified to better serve Canadians and, 
second, that the Canadian Human Rights Commission needed updating 
in order to process complaints more efficiently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are some recommendations that merit a careful review.  We 
understand that there are other concerns that also need to be 
addressed.  This is why the Minister of Justice will soon be 
announcing the process for the comprehensive review.  It is 
because we are launching the review that I am saying let us wait 
for the review to examine how we can best prevent discrimination 
against the poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems curious that we would begin to launch into examination 
of the prohibited grounds of discrimination under the CHRA on the 
eve of a more fulsome review of all aspects of the legislation. 
To simply add a new ground that is not well understood and may 
not produce the results that we all desire will not help the 
poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An overly simplistic response in the absence of a detailed 
analysis on this very important issue could result in endless 
litigation.  That is not what we all want.  We want changes to 
policies and programs to ensure that the already disadvantaged in 
our society are not further disadvantaged by attitudes and 
treatments that do not respect the dignity of all members of the 
human family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we believe it would be responsible at this time for the 
government to expand the prescribed ground of discrimination to 
take into account the real needs of the poor, I would like to 
make it clear we are not suggesting for a moment that we do not 
need to ensure that the act provides protection for the poor. For 
example, I am well aware of the recent provincial report on 
homelessness released in Toronto known as the Golden report which 
clearly demonstrates the need to address many of the problems 
facing the poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the top of the list the problems confronting the poor in 
Canada is the issue of affordable housing.  I would like to 
discuss this problem in some detail as it is a problem raised by 
some of the senators in supporting the bill and by many of the 
witnesses that appeared before the Senate committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without question discrimination and accommodation is a serious 
problem that must be addressed.  Individuals on social 
assistance, particularly single, separated or divorced mothers, 
face many burdens in obtaining any form of accommodation.  The 
Golden report documents that the face of homelessness has changed 
and indeed there are now entire families that are homeless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An Ontario Board of Inquiry, the Human Rights Code, December 22, 
1998 decision in Kearney v Bramale Ltd., questioned the rules 
pertaining to the portion of an individual's income that can be 
allotted for accommodation.  This income testing rule was held to 
be unfair as it unduly limited the small pool of housing 
available to the poor.  There is a wide divergence across Canada 
in human rights codes and the use of terminology covering 
discrimination against the poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Ontario, for example, the Ontario Human Rights Code prohibits 
discrimination on the basis of receipt of public assistance.  It 
is this ground, along with the grounds of sex, marital status, 
citizenship, place of origin and family status, which is used in 
the Kearney case to challenge the income testing rules used by 
some landlords to determine eligibility to rent an apartment and 
which has as its impact the effect of denying housing to many 
individuals with a low income.  It should be noted that the 
existence of a social condition type ground in Ontario is limited 
to occupancy and accommodation situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By comparison, in British Columbia the residential tenancy act 
prohibits discrimination on the basis of lawful source of income. 
Yet it is interesting to note that these two provinces only use 
this ground to prohibit discrimination in the field of 
accommodation. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1835"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT95"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me continue to review the provincial human rights 
legislation on this issue.  In addition to Ontario and British 
Columbia, which I have already mentioned, in Alberta the human 
rights and multiculturalism act includes source of income as a 
prohibited ground of discrimination.  Manitoba and Nova Scotia 
have a ground called source of income.  Newfoundland protects 
social origin.  Saskatchewan protects receipt of public 
assistance.  Yukon, Northwest Territories and P.E.I. do not 
protect any poverty related ground directly.  New Brunswick on 
December 9, 1998, introduced an amendment to the human rights act 
to add social condition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overall we can see there is diversity in the use and application 
of the term social condition.  For the most part the term is used 
to apply to situations involving accommodation.  In the federal 
sector there is very little residential accommodation outside 
housing for military, RCMP or foreign service officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Adding the ground of social condition to prohibit discrimination 
in housing is not necessarily a practical solution as housing is 
primarily a provincial matter.  In this it may be that in the 
provincial context that the ground of social condition may have a 
greater impact. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time, Quebec is the only province to ban 
discrimination on the basis of social condition. It added this 
to its legislation texts in 1976.  It would be worthwhile to 
examine the repercussions arising in Quebec from its inclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The term “social condition” refers to an individual's place in 
society.  This is determined by a number of factors, 
particularly family background, employment, level of education, 
and physical capacities.  The connection between social 
condition and the discrimination must be proven.  A cause and 
effect relationship must be demonstrated in each case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even in Quebec, where the definition of “social condition” is a 
broader one, the majority of complaints relate to cases where an 
individual has been refused accommodation. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this province there has been a few limited cases involving 
employment situations.  In the case of Lambert v. Quebec, 
ministère du Tourisme, the complainant was in receipt of social 
security benefits.  He participated in a government work program 
that provided him with less than the minimum wage.  To permit 
someone on social assistance to receive less than the minimum 
wage was held to be discriminatory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now let us turn to the federal context.  As I have stated, there 
is less scope for discrimination against the poor in the context 
of residential housing as this field is primarily a provincial 
jurisdiction.  However there are other issues that do need to be 
examined in the federal sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have all heard from Canadians about concerns raised with 
regard to situations that may arise in the banking and the 
telecommunications sectors, although the banks have made more 
recent changes to ensure that low income individuals have better 
access to banking services.  Groups such as the National 
Anti-Poverty Organization have alleged that the banks may in 
certain situations discriminate against the poor.  I am not in a 
position to judge or even comment on these allegations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, before we can amend the law we need to know the exact 
nature of the problem and how and whether we can resolve it with 
the human rights legislation.  In other words the government is 
proposing a comprehensive review of the Canadian Human Rights Act 
in order to make sure that we do it properly. 
<P><A NAME="LINK274"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, when I saw the bill come before the House I specifically 
asked to speak to it.  I immediately thought that the bill 
encompassed both some of the best intentions and worst ideas that 
I have ever seen in a piece of legislation to come before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not uncommon for good intentions and poor execution to be 
commingled in the same political project as we have before us 
today, which of course is to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act 
to essentially prohibit discrimination on the basis of social 
condition, whatever that means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am disturbed that this is a Senate bill originating in that 
other place which would happen to be the one that does not have 
any democratic legitimacy.  That would be the chamber filled with 
unaccountable, unelected, patronage hacks.  Dozens of thoughtful 
private members' bills have come forward from members of this 
place who happen to be elected and accountable, whose ideas 
happen to come from the voters and not from their ivory tower. 
Private members' bills that originate from this place ought to be 
deemed votable by the private members' bill committee but rather 
it gave one of the very few votable spots available to empower 
individual MPs to a senator in the case of Bill S-11.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That in my humble opinion is sufficient grounds to vote against 
this or any other bill that originates from a completely absurd 
anachronism of an institution which should have died with the 
19th century from whence it came. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think there is a member of this place or citizen of the 
country who does not oppose poverty and unjust discrimination.  I 
certainly do not.  I prefer to demonstrate my compassion for 
those who have economic circumstances less fortunate than my own 
through private charitable activities and contributions. I happen 
to believe that compassion as Mother Teresa reminded us literally 
means to suffer with.  It does not mean to legislate good 
intentions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I hear the intentions of the movers of the bill, when I 
hear the member for Shefford say, as I believe she did in this 
place, that Canada's obsession with the debt and the deficit 
demonstrate that we really despise the poor, I frankly find that 
bizarre in a country that has spent untold billions of scarce 
resources by taxing money away from struggling families, many of 
whom are below the so-called poverty line.  In this enormous 
project of wealth redistribution to say that Canadians somehow 
despise the poor because they want to pay their bills is a gross 
statement of hyperbole which does not belong in this place or 
this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would the bill seek to do?  I do not think anybody really 
knows.  I read the transcripts of the Senate committee where Bill 
S-11 was examined.  Witness after witness was asked how social 
condition is defined.  There appeared to be no clear consensus or 
no clear definition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing is clear.  To prevent the public sector, parliament, 
from discriminating against people on the basis of their social 
condition, it would have some very interesting but unintended 
consequences.  For one thing it would take what is right now a 
steeply progressive tax system and turn it into a completely flat 
tax system.  Right now the top 1% of income earners, those who 
report income of over about $150,000 a year, represent about 9% 
of the income reported in Canada but pay over 20% of the taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current tax laws very clearly discriminate against people on 
the basis of income.  The lowest income people, I would argue 
quite appropriately, pay no taxes.  We have this enormous case of 
discrimination on the basis of social condition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do the movers of the bill intend that it ought to be interpreted 
in such a way that the tax laws of the country would no longer be 
able or that social benefits should no longer be able to be 
targeted on the basis of income? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do they suggest the clawback that exists for various social 
payments ought to be eliminated and that billionaires ought to 
have the same entitlement to social payments as do the indigent 
poor?  Probably not but they have not addressed that question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is it that they are attempting to do?  I would suggest they 
are trying to impose a radical egalitarian, frankly socialist 
idea which is Marxist in its origins on the private sector to 
restrict liberty and freedom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We just heard the parliamentary secretary suggest that if this 
law were passed it would change the way that banks deal with the 
poor, with people who are in poverty.  What do these people mean 
by that?  Do they mean that if such a statute or amendment were 
passed a bank or a financial institution would be compelled by 
force of law, as interpreted and implied by an unelected and 
unaccountable human rights tribunal, to supply a loan to somebody 
with no income, no assets and no reasonable prospect of assets or 
income?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that what is implied?  If it is not, then why have we not 
defined that kind of interpretation in the bill? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lack of definition surrounding social condition is wide 
open.  Is it merely an oversight?  No, it is clearly not. 
Clearly the advocates of this radical egalitarian socialist idea 
have in mind allowing a wide open interpretation so that our 
friends, the robed Solons on the bench, may interpret and apply 
this law in whatever manner they deem appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the advocates of potentially radical legislation 
such as this do not want to paint a picture for democratic 
discussion as to what the consequences of such legislation would 
be, they want the courts to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to Professor Martha Jackman of the Faculty of Law at the 
University of Ottawa who appeared at some length before the 
Senate committee on this issue both in November 1997 and May 
1998.  She made some very interesting statements defending the 
lack of definition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She says “I would strongly discourage you from including the 
notion of a definition within this bill because this would be 
anomalous.  There is a significant amount of literature about the 
idea of race being essentially an artificial concept”.  We have 
race, religion and other grounds within the bills that courts and 
commissions have wrestled with successfully from the perspective 
of radical leftists such as Professor Jackman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She goes on to say “I would discourage the committee from the 
idea of defining social condition within the bill because that 
freezes the definition at a particular time that is antithetical 
to the approach that has been taken in human rights statutes”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She goes on to talk about the case of Vriend in Alberta where 
the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the sovereign democratic 
legislature of the people of Alberta was contravening the charter 
of rights by not having included in a particular statute a term 
which now exists in the charter of rights.  In other words, 
the courts decided to legislate from the bench in the Vriend 
decision.  She says that if we pass this well-intentioned 
amendment of social condition we will be empowering the courts to 
do the same thing in respect of social condition as they did with 
respect to social orientation in Vriend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said “Based on precedence, recognition under provincial and 
federal human rights statutes is in itself a criteria for finding 
an analogous, non-enumerated ground under the charter”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What she is saying is “Please, parliament, pass this bill so we 
can then empower the courts to use this bill as the basis of 
reading in a new constitutionally protected ground of 
non-discrimination”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit that if the proponents of this remedy wish it to be 
entrenched in the Constitution they ought to do it directly, 
honestly and transparently by introducing an amendment to the 
charter of rights and freedoms and not through the nefarious back 
door of this statute.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise 
today, with a great deal of personal conviction and interest, in 
support of the initiative by my hon. colleague from Shefford, 
whose bill is aimed at amending the Canadian Human Rights Act by 
adding social condition to the prohibited grounds of 
discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be admitted that poverty is the worst enemy, not only of 
human development, but also of social and economic development, 
and represents our civilization's greatest failure.  We are 
forced to admit that the increase in poverty is a source of 
great shame as the third millennium approaches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion by the hon. member for Shefford reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill S-11, an act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act in 
order to add social condition as a prohibited ground of 
discrimination, be now read a second time and referred to the 
Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the Canadian Human Rights Act is a masterpiece.  It 
protects against discrimination and guarantees opportunity, but 
one of its weaknesses is that it does not directly recognize 
poverty as a source of inequality.  As we know, the figures on 
the increase in poverty, and on everything being poor in Canada 
represents, are shocking.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Daily, newspaper headlines remind us, and I will quote a few 
“Poverty gaining ground in Montreal”, “Greater Montreal, of all 
metropolitan areas in the country, has the most low income 
families”.  In Saint-Georges, “Moisson Québec distributes over 
1,300 Christmas hampers”.  And here is another headline “Street 
kids, 14 and 15 year olds living one day at a time”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Around Quebec City “Moisson Québec, two million kilos of food”; 
“The agri-food industry manages its stocks much better than in 
the past, but now we need to go further to find the items we 
need”. Here is another , “The poor children of the universal 
declaration of human rights”.  Every day, newspaper headlines 
recall this sad state of affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is surprising, to say the least, that the Canadian Human 
Rights Act does not recognize social condition as an illicit 
grounds, because, as a signatory to many international and 
regional instruments on human rights, Canada has made a 
commitment to guarantee the rights contained therein for 
Canadians, without distinction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a number of provinces, much progress has been made in 
including social origin as discriminatory in certain codes. 
Newfoundland, for example, prohibits discrimination on the basis 
of social origin. 
The Ontario human rights code prohibits discrimination in the 
area of housing, discrimination based on the fact that a person 
receives welfare.  The Alberta, Manitoba and Nova Scotia codes 
of human rights prohibit discrimination based on sources of 
income and Saskatchewan's on the receipt of social assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While these initiatives are praiseworthy in their attempt to 
eliminate discrimination based on poverty, the provisions are 
limited to the fact of being on welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we all know that it is possible to work and remain 
poor.  That is why we may rightly be proud of the Quebec 
legislation, which is the only one to include the expression 
“social condition” without limiting its scope to apply only to 
those on welfare. 
That is why the Quebec charter of rights and freedoms is 
considered, and rightly so, as the most progressive and modern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Closer scrutiny reveals that the changes proposed in Bill S-11 
are in line with provincial legislation and Quebec legislation 
in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before going any further, we must ask ourselves whether the 
issue of poverty warrants such an amendment to the Canadian 
Human Rights Act. In the face of this ever-increasing poverty and 
given the ineffective policies developed by the Liberals to 
remedy the situation, the answer is clear: yes, and the sooner 
the better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking back about 10 years, we can see why. On November 24, 
1989, the House of Commons unanimously passed the following 
motion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House express its concern for the more than one 
million Canadian children currently living in poverty and seek 
to achieve the goal of eliminating poverty among Canadian 
children by the year 2000. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Strangely enough, nearly 10 years later, the number of children 
living in poverty has increased by 60% to a record level of 1.5 
million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several organizations involved in denouncing poverty and 
assessing the various policies implemented by the Liberal 
government point at decisions that defeat the stated purpose of 
eliminating poverty in Canada, and they criticize and condemn 
the government's social policies. These organizations include 
the National Council of Welfare, the Canadian Council on Social 
Development and Campaign 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The National Council of Welfare made the following statement: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The child tax benefit should be fully indexed to the cost of 
living effective July 1, 1999. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are therefore still waiting for this government to take 
action.  In a report released December 7 entitled “The Progress 
of Canada's Children”, the Canadian Council on Social 
Development was critical of the fact that, and I quote: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—improvements in the lives of Canadian children and youth have

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Council blames the low benefits received by unemployed 
workers and also calls for the federal government's contribution 
to the national child tax benefit to be increased to a total of 
$2.5 billion annually for the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has its work cut out for it in the fight against 
poverty in Canada.  As well, on November 28, Canada was accused 
of obstruction by representatives of a UN committee looking at 
Canada's efforts to reduce poverty and social inequality. 
Committee members expressed dissatisfaction because of the 
imprecise nature of responses to specific questions on 
homelessness, welfare cuts through the Canada social transfer, 
and the other social problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its report, which was released last December 4, the UN 
committee severely faults Canada for the rapid deterioration of 
Canadians' living conditions.  Canada is not ranked first, but 
tenth, according to the United Nations human development index. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Campaign 2000, a poverty fighting organization, recently 
released its 1998 report on child poverty, and its findings are 
shocking.  The number of children in families with an income 
under $20,000 has risen by 65%.  The number of children in 
families where unemployment is chronic has risen by 33%. 
The number of children whose families are on welfare has risen 
by 51%.  The number of children living in housing their families 
cannot afford has risen by 91%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the fact that all these figures point to the very 
opposite conclusion, the federal government continues to claim 
that the measures presently in place are appropriate and respond 
to the needs of children and families suffering from poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to offer an illustration of why I believe the 
government continues to claim that the measures presently in 
place respond to the needs of children. 
In response to one of my questions in the House, the Minister of 
Human Resources Development said “I want to reassure the members 
of this House by telling them that eliminating child poverty is 
a priority and that all our programs reflect that priority”, but 
beyond all these figures and all these observations, there are 
men and women and children suffering and they must remain 
foremost in our concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Poverty means being hungry and not knowing after the second week 
in the month how to find enough food.  It means going to school 
hungry.  It means being cold and having to choose between a coat 
for one or boots for the other.  It means having one's dreams 
dashed and seeing Christmas arrive for others and a hamper for 
oneself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fight against poverty and social injustice has always been 
at the core of my political involvement. 
In the light of the devastating effects of poverty and the 
Liberals' lack of will to resolve it, we must work even harder 
to get this House to do everything to remedy the injustices that 
have been continuing for too long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed amendments to the Canadian Human Rights Act 
represent a significant milestone.  As the Canadian Human Rights 
Commission noted in its 1997 annual report: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is now time to recognize poverty as a human rights issue here 
at home as well.

ideology of having a Senate or with the Progressive Conservative 
Party, I am proud to stand to support this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is about our Canadian Human Rights Act.  Human rights 
are our finest instincts, our best wishes, our dreams and our 
visions for now and the future.  This is about how we will change 
this country to make it better; take what is good and make it 
solid; take the weak parts, look at them and change them to make 
them better and to bring some life to this act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has always been a place where we could succeed on our 
merit, work and determination.  Everything is here.  It does not 
matter if we are born poor.  We have public schools. 
We have health care.  We have homes.  We can do whatever we want 
in this country. For us to have to step back and look at the fact 
of social conditions which generally refers to the poor as being 
an obstacle to anyone accomplishing their dreams is really 
shocking.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an example.  My mother had eleven children.  Three 
died. My father died when I was young.  We were poor.  That meant 
there were days when there was no food.  That meant there were 
nights when there was no heat.  In the north when it is minus 30 
or minus 40, living without heat is no joke.  That means living 
in a room with all your brothers and sisters, every coat in the 
house piled on top of you and you are praying that somehow you 
can get some money for food or to get some oil or wood for your 
house. Poverty is not a lifestyle.  It is not anything anyone 
chooses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My mother was of a generation that went through the war and they 
wanted change.  They wanted this country to be here for every 
child, whether born poor or rich.  They had an opportunity.  They 
fought for it and made changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there was no public school, I would not have had an 
education.  If there was no subsidized secondary school, I would 
not have been able to accomplish that.  I certainly would not 
have been able to make it to this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As our country recedes in the support we are willing to give to 
the poor, it means more and more people will be born poor and 
they will stay poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last 10 years we have seen family income go down by 5%. 
Twenty-one percent of our families are low income.  Sixty percent 
of single mothers are poor.  There has been a 47% growth in the 
number of children living in poverty. For me these are not just 
words, they are not statistics.  I know what it feels like and I 
know what children are going through when they live in poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If my mother were alive I would never bring up the fact that we 
were poor because it was a matter of shame.  For this woman it 
meant absolute shame that she would have to beg for food for her 
children, which is what she had to do.  She had to go to a food 
bank.  It was not called a food bank at that time but that is 
what it was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Adding this social condition to our human rights act is 
important.  It is important because it says of the country that 
we care enough to think about poverty.  We care enough to want to 
say it, to entrench it and to make change that will make a 
difference for the people in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can do it.  I think all Canadians want that.  We want to make 
sure we have health care, education and housing. We want to help 
those who are in between jobs, those who lose jobs, to make sure 
employment insurance is there for them when they need it so they 
do not have to go on social assistance, they do not have to be 
degraded every day they are without a job because we place a lot 
of value and worth in being able to work and support our 
families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Poverty increases depression, malnutrition, sickness and early 
death.  I was poor but I was never without a roof over my head. I 
cannot imagine living without a home, yet more and more we are 
seeing people without a blanket or roof of any sort over their 
heads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes that have gone on in our country in the last 10 
years have meant that education is farther and farther out of the 
reach of ordinary people, certainly out of the reach of the poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have public schools to send children to.  If someone cannot 
afford a school book or running shoes for their children, they 
certainly cannot afford a musical instrument or sporting 
equipment for their children to participate in the social life of 
their community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a human rights issue.  It is an issue on dignity.  Even 
though there may be reasons not to include this social condition 
in the human rights act because it would take a bit of time, it 
might affect other laws or institutions that we are not sure of, 
it does not mean we should not do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know my Reform colleague said we could force banks to give a 
loan to someone who cannot pay it back. That is not the case at 
all.  That would not happen.  But we could expect a bank to cash 
the cheque of a poor working person. I know of quite a few 
instances where banks refused to cash their cheques. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A woodcutter in Yukon received his payment from the government 
because he delivered wood to people on social assistance.  This 
man would receive his cheque from the government. His working 
clothes were torn and dirty because that was the nature of his 
work.  He did not have a bank account and the bank refused to 
cash his cheque.  Why?  Because he was poor. 
Fortunately in this country we are lucky enough to have more rich 
people than poor people, but more and more people are becoming 
poor.  We need to make changes in public policy to make sure the 
elements that cause poverty are not there and we also have to 
recognize the indignity of living in poverty.

country are the poorest of the poor. By taking this step forward 
we would be recognizing their suffering which is far greater than

great sorrow that I rise in the House to debate Bill S-11, an act 
to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act to add social condition as 
a prohibited ground of discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say with great sorrow because as we continue to debate the 
merits of this very important piece of legislation millions of 
Canadians are still struggling to survive while living in 
poverty. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on figures for 1996, the UN report shows that 17.6% of 
Canadians, including 20.9% of our children, live in poverty; 
Canada ranks 10th out of 17 industrialized countries. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Putting all political differences aside, the fact is there are 
over 1.5 million children living in poverty in Canada.  For such 
an affluent country to have such a horrendous record when it 
comes to poverty is truly unacceptable. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister himself said this was unacceptable, yet he is 
not doing anything to change the situation. I am not sure that 
the government grasps how dangerous it is for a society to have 
so many young people living in poverty. These children are part 
of our future and, unless we find a way to deal with this 
threat, a whole generation of Canadians may end up alone, 
rejected and poor. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is well understood that children who are the products of 
families living in extreme poverty have significantly less 
opportunity to succeed than those who were fortunate enough to 
grow up in a more prosperous environment. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those living in daily poverty, the possibility of a 
prosperous future is almost unimaginable.  Every day, I receive 
calls from people facing the misery of poverty, and it seems the 
problem is not getting better but worse. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The prevalence of poverty within this country has grown in leaps 
and bounds in the past few decades.  Food banks, which were 
nowhere to be found in the 1970s, now number in the thousands and 
can be found in 450 communities.  Compounding the problem is the 
fact that affordable and adequate housing has now become a full 
blown crisis.  Almost 400,000 Canadians live in substandard 
housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All Canadians deserve an equal opportunity to succeed in our 
society.  However, this is unfortunately not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the often recognizable characteristics of poverty, there 
is another obstacle that is often less recognisable or understood 
by members of the general public but which is an unfortunate part 
of their everyday life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am referring to the prevalent discrimination these individuals 
are forced to live with on a daily basis.  In addition to having 
to endure the material hardships that accompany poverty, poor 
Canadians are always having to face ostracism and negative 
stereotyping, particularly in dealing with financial 
institutions, as my hon. colleague from the NDP just mentioned, 
businesses and their staff, officials, the legal system, 
neighbours, strangers and the media.

of poverty and its related attributes, such as being a welfare 
recipient, and to prohibit discrimination against the poor in 
areas under federal jurisdiction.

discrimination in sections 2 and 3.1 of the act will finally 
recognize a huge segment of our society that has been 
marginalized.  It will provide it with the same protection 
presently offered to other groups within Canadian society.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The poor have nobody to protect them from the injustice of 
society, which too often wants to close its eyes to the reality 
of poverty.  It is vital that these individuals be given 
protection under the Charter. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that each day I hear horror stories of welfare 
recipients being unfairly treated when seeking essential 
services.  I have been told of chartered banks that refuse to 
cash welfare recipient cheques because of insufficient pieces of 
ID.  Others have been denied the right to open their own bank 
account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Landlords, utility companies, the legal system and even the 
media routinely discriminate against the poor either by refusing 
them services or by providing them with inadequate service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our justice minister's response to Bill S-11 is to wait and to 
explore other problems that might exist in the human rights act 
before considering implementation or implementing social 
condition in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those living in poverty have been waiting for this government to 
implement these changes for years.  They can no longer afford to 
wait for this government to take poverty seriously.  Something 
has to be done immediately to try to address some of their 
immediate problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government's answer to many of the problems facing 
Canadians is to wait and study the situation further, hoping the 
problems will eventually go away on their own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most recently, this Liberal strategy has come to light with the 
justice minister's decision to ignore calls to have the child 
pornography decision referred to the Canadian supreme court. The 
justice minister would rather let this case proceed through a 
lengthy appeal process than come to the defence of defenceless 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal agriculture minister as well was aware of a farm 
income crisis when he was first appointed as minister over 18 
months ago, yet he chose to do nothing about it until this 
country was faced with the distinct possibility of losing 
thousands of our farmers to bankruptcy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those living in poverty cannot afford any further delays from 
this insensitive government.  Action must be taken immediately so 
that we can offer renewed hope to those less fortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-11 was initially introduced and passed in the other place 
by Senator Cohen.  Since then, both she and my caucus colleague, 
the member for Shefford, have worked diligently with concerned 
citizens and fellow MPs representing all political stripes to try 
to remedy this huge injustice that weighs so heavily against 
those who are most vulnerable in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask all hon. members to please not turn their backs on those 
who need us the most.  Help protect the millions of Canadians 
living in poverty.  Help eliminate discrimination that is 
presently based on their social condition by supporting Bill 
S-11.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I support the 
essence and spirit behind Bill S-11, an amendment to the Canadian 
Human Rights Act to add social condition as a protected ground 
under the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the drafters of Bill S-11 intended it to provide 
protection to the poor, to prohibit discrimination based on 
economic discrimination.  That is laudable and should be 
supported by members.  How could we do otherwise? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern is not with the object and aim of Bill S-11, but 
rather with an overly broad and confusing nature of the exact 
wording.  Simply using an open-ended term such as “social 
condition” I believe will add confusion to the act that will 
result in an endless sea of litigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine the hay day the lawyers would have with this kind of 
wording.  Maybe there are too many lawyers in the Senate. I will 
give an example in terms of the remarks made by the hon. member 
of the Conservative party.   He talked about this government 
waiting and studying.  That is not the case at all.  Where has he 
been since 1993?  Look at the budgets and look at what we have 
done in those budgets for training, education and other things in 
trying to grapple with these problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member mentioned the Minister of Justice and the child 
pornography issue.  We believe in due process on this side.  We 
do not believe in using the notwithstanding clause every time a 
judge makes a ridiculous decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the member talked about the minister of agriculture and the 
farm crisis.  It is a little off topic, but I think I should 
correct him.  The point I am trying to make is that the broad 
term of social condition could be given all kinds of different 
interpretations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the House can see from my explanation how wrong the 
member opposite is in terms of how he views some of the things 
this government is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of agriculture acted very quickly prior to 
Christmas.  In fact, one of the problems that the minister of 
agriculture has is getting the Progressive Conservative 
government on side in Manitoba to pick up its share of the 
funding so that those cheques can get to the farm community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  What about Saskatchewan? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter:</B>  The member opposite asks about 
Saskatchewan.  I understand that finally the premier of 
Saskatchewan has come through this afternoon and is going to pay 
its 40% share.  That of course is due to the good persuasive 
powers of our minister of agriculture and our Prime Minister in 
having them come to the table to do what needs to be done to 
support the farm community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to get back to the issue at hand, Bill S-11.  As I said, 
simply using an open-ended term such as social condition will add 
confusion to the act that will result in an endless sea of 
litigation.  I want to re-emphasize that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are serious about assisting the poor and the disadvantaged 
in our society, then we must create opportunities for jobs.  That 
is what this government has been doing.  We must lower 
unemployment.  That is what this government has been doing.  We 
must provide education.  Look at the last two budgets.  Look at 
the millennium scholarship fund about which hon. members opposite 
are so critical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must provide training and we must provide the necessities of 
life so people will be able to participate as full and equal 
partners in our society.  We must provide a remedy through our 
human rights legislation for prejudicial treatment of the poor in 
a manner that makes that protection meaningful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year we are celebrating the 50th anniversary of the UN 
declaration on human rights.  It is a fitting time to review our 
current human rights legislation to ensure that it protects the 
most vulnerable in our society.  In Canada we have honoured our 
commitment to the declaration for 50 years.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, my question is for the Parliament Secretary to the 
Minister of Transport.  It is further to a question that I asked 
in the House to which the minister responded that the province of 
Nova of Scotia and the province of New Brunswick, in particular, 
did not violate an agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since that time, through the access to information program, we 
have become aware of another letter in which the minister said to 
the province of New Brunswick that it could charge tolls on this 
federally funded highway under two conditions.  The first 
condition was that the amount of the federal contribution would 
still have to be cost shared with the province on a 50:50 basis. 
The second condition was that any revenue from the tolls would be 
an additional source of funds to be dedicated solely to the 
project in question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sent to the parliamentary secretary a quote from <I>Hansard</I> 
wherein the minister of finance for New Brunswick said “We had 
always made it clear that the provincial money we invested in 
these sections of road would be recovered”.  That totally 
contradicts the minister's letter which says that the province 
must maintain its cost share ratio of 50:50 on this highway. 
There is a contradiction.  The province has totally contradicted 
the words of the federal minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the second condition, the minister said that any 
revenue from the tolls must be totally dedicated to the project 
in question.  Again I sent to the parliamentary secretary a 
newspaper article which quoted the premier of the province of New 
Brunswick as saying “Yes, there is some money coming back and 
it will be applied to health care”.  They used the figure of 
$321 million.  Again the federal minister said that all the 
revenue from the highway must go to the project.  The province 
now says it is going to health care or general revenues or 
whatever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the parliamentary secretary to address this letter and the 
absolutely unambiguous statements and conditions that the 
minister applied to the province of New Brunswick if it was going 
to charge tolls on a federally funded highway: that is, that the 
province must maintain its share, which it has not, and that the 
province must dedicate all the revenue to that specific project, 
which it has not. 
<P><A NAME="LINK282"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, my hon. colleague 
asked earlier about New Brunswick taxpayers in relation to paying 
tolls for highways and where the money was going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member certainly knows that we on this side will investigate 
every morsel of information that he has put before us because we 
want to be clear and articulate in what we say.  He does 
understand the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Constitution of Canada highways are a provincial 
responsibility.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the instance of the new Fredericton to Moncton highway, the 
federal government did contribute a portion of the highway's 
overall costs.  New Brunswick has chosen to operate the new 
highway as a public-private partnership with the Maritime Road 
Development Corporation using tolls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member should note that the Government of New Brunswick 
has indicated that the federal contribution was already deducted 
against the cost base used to establish the tolls and the annual 
provincial payment for the remaining capital costs.  In effect, 
the federal funds have reduced the overall capital costs to this 
project for New Brunswick taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concerns raised about tolls and federal contributions 
certainly deserve further study.  We will grant the member that. 
Transport Canada as usual is providing some leadership in 
developing a future policy on tolls in the event the federal 
government were to launch a new national highway program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, with respect to the hon. member's allegation of 
inappropriate federal spending, I would like to quote directly 
from the auditor general's report: “We found in all the 
negotiated agreements that the program objectives, funding levels 
and cost sharing ratios to be maintained throughout the life of 
the agreement reflected the government's directives”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am up on the same topic and the same question to the 
minister.  I hope that I do not get the same reply from the 
parliamentary secretary.  He is dodging the real question of what 
happened to that federal money when the agreement was broken by 
the province of New Brunswick.  That is the big unanswered 
question in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only thing I can agree with in terms of what the 
parliamentary secretary said is that the federal government is 
examining future agreements.  It has admitted that this agreement 
was violated. It goes beyond the violation of the agreement that 
upsets me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreement was made by the former Minister of Transport in 
this House, a man by the name of Doug Young.  He now happens to 
be the chairman of the Maritime Road Development Corporation, 
MRDC.  His company is taking control of what is truly a 
provincial constitutional issue.  His company will determine the 
weights on that highway, the tolls on that highway and the 
maintenance on that highway. Basically, the province of New 
Brunswick has abrogated its responsibilities. The feds are 
sitting back here nodding their heads in agreement, protecting 
their old friend, Doug Young. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is wrong because at the end of the day it is going to cost 
the citizens, the taxpayers of the province of New Brunswick more 
money than if they had built the highway themselves.  This is 
ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also another difficulty in terms of transportation.  It 
now costs one single truck $20,000 a year to use that highway if 
it is used 365 days a year.  That is a $20,000 increase in the 
operation of just one vehicle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have sat back and allowed them to set those tolls which is 
absolutely indisputably wrong.  We are asking for a correction. 
We are also asking for leadership in this House from the Minister 
of Transport to renege on that type of an agreement and to take 
the province of New Brunswick to task on that type of agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is double jeopardy for taxpayers.  The toll payers and the 
taxpayers are one and the same person.  Why should they pay twice 
for the same piece of highway?  The only reason they are going to 
pay twice is because it is going into the hind pocket of their 
friend, Doug Young, the former Minister of Transport, who set the 
deal in motion right here in this House.  They reneged on their 
own signature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The premier of New Brunswick is finally admitting that there is 
going to be money coming off this deal.  Where is it going? It is 
going into what they consider their own little fund but it has 
nothing to do with paying off that highway and kicking Doug Young 
and the rest of them out of the deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we want to see happen:  leadership at the federal 
level. 
Anyone who can stand in the House to defend Doug Young does not 
understand how this toll highway works.

make sure deals like this one do not happen in the future. 
Taxpayers can only stand so much punishment and this is 
extraordinary punishment brought on by a Minister of Transport 
who does not dare to stand up to his old friend.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I sometimes think 
this is supposed to be the House of reason, but we had quite a 
rant against an honourable former member of this House.  He used 
the word ridiculous and I would say to the hon. member opposite 
that the charges he is laying are in fact ridiculous.  He has no 
basis on which to make those charges against the particular 
individual.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We found in all the negotiated agreements that the program 
objectives, funding levels and cost sharing ratios to be

</I></B></P><P align=left>I said in an earlier response, and I do believe this is 
important, we recognize that we do not want to face a system of 
tolls right across Canada.  The concerns raised about tolls and 
federal contributions deserve further study.  Transport Canada is 
developing a future policy on tolls in the event that the federal 
government were to launch a new national highway program.

member is doing all these things that he resents.  I cannot 
recall them all.  Really the provincial government decides on its

financing, as well as subsequent operations and maintenance.

create an interprovincial trade barrier, the agreement on
