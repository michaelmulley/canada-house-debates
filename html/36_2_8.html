</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP)</B> moved for leave to 
introduce Bill C-259, an act to amend the Criminal Code (criminal 
liability of corporations, directors and officers). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said:  Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to have the 
opportunity today to reintroduce a bill that establishes the 
criminal liability of corporations, of their executives and 
officers, for criminal acts or omissions carried out knowingly by 
them which put the health and safety of their employees at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a bill that arises out of a recommendation from the 
public inquiry into the disastrous Westray tragedy in Nova Scotia 
that killed 26 miners unnecessarily.  It will establish once and 
for all the public responsibility to protect employees in the 
country against any such disastrous outcome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is long overdue.  It is specifically a recommendation 
of the Westray inquiry and Canadians will benefit from such 
protection in the future.

NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, once again it is an honour and a pleasure 
for me to stand, pursuant to Standing Order 36, to present a 
petition on behalf of a number of my constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are very concerned about the fact that we have a Senate in 
our country.  They consider it to be undemocratic and composed of 
unelected members that are unaccountable to the people of Canada. 
They point out the fact that there is a $50 million price tag 
attached to this.  They say that this is something from another 
era and should not be taking place as we enter the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also say that we need to modernize our parliamentary 
institution, Mr. Speaker, which is something I know you feel 
strongly about.  They are calling upon the parliament of Canada 
to take whatever measures are necessary to abolish the Senate of 
Canada.

I rise on a point of order. The adoption of this ways and means 
motion which is the first step in implementing legislation in 
regard to the Nisga'a agreement is out of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only is this issue very controversial and will have a 
precedent setting impact on the entire country, the House should 
know this agreement is before the courts.  Beauchesne's sixth 
edition, citation 505 states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members are expected to refrain from discussing matters that are 
before the courts or tribunals which are courts of record. The 
purpose of this sub judice convention is to protect the parties 
in a case awaiting or undergoing trial and persons who stand to 
be affected by the outcome of a judicial enquiry. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should not be allowed to proceed any further with 
Nisga'a legislation since it affects one of our most fundamental 
rights of free speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beauchesne's also talks about respecting the sub judice 
convention in the interest of justice and fair play. 
Notwithstanding the fact that legislation enabling the Nisga'a 
agreement was passed by the most unpopular government in the 
history of British Columbia with a paltry 35% of the vote of the 
electorate, we in this House must respect the objections and the 
objectives of the other 62% of British Columbians and many other 
Canadians, including parties to several litigations on the 
matter, including the B.C. Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When considering this point of order, Mr. Speaker, you must 
understand that we will stand up for the equal rights of all 
Canadians, including the Nisga'a.  We will do our utmost to 
convince the Liberal government to reconsider its position and to 
inform Canadians of the very significant mistakes that are being 
made.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on this point of order.  The 
hon. member of course has a right to feel very profoundly about 
any issue, just as I have a right to disagree with him and any of 
us who similarly feel about an issue. That is not what is before 
us today.  It is whether or not the ways and means motions that 
was just passed is in order or out of order.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, the speech we just heard is actually a reflection 
upon a vote in the House and I would say that in itself offends, 
at least in my view, our standing orders.  The standing orders 
say that the adoption of the ways and means motion—and that ways 
and means motion has now been adopted—is an order of the House 
to bring in a bill based thereon.  Therefore, this gives the 
minister the right, and some would say the obligation, to give 
first reading to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member made a reference in his remarks with respect to 
issues that are before the courts and how we should refrain in 
debates from taking sides on issues when, at a criminal level, 
charges have been laid, or at the civil level once an issue 
reaches trial stage.  That is meant to ensure that members in 
their remarks in the House do not prejudice the outcome.  It does 
not have application to the adoption of a ways and means motion 
by this House.  The entire House, I am sure, knows that. 
Therefore those points that were raised are not valid.  This 
motion is indeed in order and has in fact been passed in the 
House.  I believe that now is the time to introduce the bill 
pursuant to the motion that we have now passed by a vote of this 
House, democratically held.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in reviewing some of the sections of Beauchesne's 
one is hit square in the face with the fact that the sub judice 
convention deals specifically with debate, and that is not the 
case with the matter that is before the House.  There is no bar 
whatsoever on the House itself considering legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you would be well aware of the fact that if that 
was the case every time a matter wound up before the courts 
parliament would be completely impotent and paralysed from 
considering legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that the point of order from the hon. member of 
the Reform Party is completely out of order. 
<P><A NAME="LINK23"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I would want to concur in the opinions offered by the government 
House leader and by the House leader of the Conservative Party. 
I find it very odd that a party that is always talking about 
power seeping away from parliament to the courts is today arguing 
that parliament cannot deal with an issue as important as the 
Nisga'a treaty. 
<P><A NAME="LINK24"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, since first 
being elected to this place in 1993 I have witnessed over and 
over again that the government is not willing to respond to 
questions in this House when the matter is before the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I ask you, how can we properly debate this 
fundamentally important issue to all Canadians and the Nisga'a 
people when the matter is before the court?  This flies in the 
face of the conventions that I have understood since I came to 
this place in 1993. 
<P><A NAME="LINK25"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The Chair would like to thank all 
hon. members who have participated in this for their assistance 
in dealing with this point of order, which was raised by the hon. 
member for Langley—Abbotsford. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He cited at the opening of his remarks citation 505 of the 6th 
edition of Beauchesne.  I would also draw to his attention and to 
the attention of all hon. members citation 506, which reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sub judice convention has been applied consistently in 
criminal cases. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I skip on to citation 507, which reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No settled practice has been developed in relation to civil 
cases, as the convention has been applied in some cases but not 
in others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In civil cases the convention does not apply until the matter 
has reached the trial stage. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Langley—Abbotsford has not brought to the 
House any indication that there is a criminal proceeding 
involving this case, nor is it possible to imagine how there 
could be at this time. 
Accordingly, I feel that given the past practice of the House and 
given the fact that the House is master of its own procedure, I 
do not believe the House is bound by proceedings in the courts 
until the court has made a ruling that binds the House.  Until 
the court has made a ruling that has bound the House under the 
constitution of Canada, I feel that the proceedings so far today 
are entirely in order and I intend to proceed with the bill 
pursuant to Standing Order 83(4).

Bill C-3, an act in respect of criminal justice for young persons 
and to amend and repeal other acts, be read the second time and

<P><A NAME="LINK33"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure this morning to speak at second reading of Bill 
C-3, the youth criminal justice act. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the throne speech, the government indicated its intention to 
work with Canadians to ensure that our communities continue to 
be safe.  Its focus will be balanced, combining prevention and a 
community-centred approach with action to deal with serious 
crime.  This balanced approach is clearly reflected in Bill C-3 
which we are debating today. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs extensively 
studied our youth justice system, travelling to all regions of 
the country and listening to Canadians.  The members visited over 
23 sites, involving a variety of facilities and programs.  The 
committee also held a number of round table discussions at which 
it heard from many interests, both inside and outside the youth 
justice system.  The committee produced an excellent report 
entitled “Renewing Youth Justice” and the government has 
responded to that report with excellent legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of justice first introduced the youth criminal 
justice act during the last session of parliament as Bill C-68. 
The minister has had the benefit of having heard views on the 
bill in this House and from others with an interest in the 
complex issues surrounding youth justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While a range of views has been expressed, some find the bill too 
harsh.  Others find that it is not harsh enough.  The government 
and many others continue to believe that the bill reflects a 
comprehensive, balanced and flexible framework for youth justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of justice has reintroduced this bill and looks 
forward to hearing the views of Canadians through the 
parliamentary process.  We believe this legislation will 
establish a youth justice system that strikes the best balance to 
deliver fair and effective measures that Canadians want and 
deserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians believe that our current youth justice system is not 
working as well as it should in many significant areas and it 
needs to be overhauled.  We know that it will take a sustained 
effort, involving all levels of government and many other 
partners to tackle the complex problem of youth crime and to 
build a fair and effective youth justice system.  We look forward 
to their participation in a constructive fashion for the benefit 
of our children in crisis.  That process is under way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998 the minister of justice and the solicitor general 
launched the government's national crime prevention program. 
Since then several millions of dollars have been invested in 
community based crime prevention initiatives across the country, 
dealing at the front end with the root causes of crime, with a 
special focus on children and youth at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since its launch the national strategy has supported more than 
600 crime prevention and community safety projects throughout 
Canada.  These projects are the products of communities and of 
Canadians.  The Government of Canada is proud to support these 
grassroots efforts to make our country a safer place for all its 
citizens.  These are investments in our communities and in our 
youth.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Replacing and repealing the Young Offenders Act with the youth 
criminal justice act is the next step in a process of tackling 
youth crime.  The new legislation signals to Canadians that a new 
youth justice regime is in place.  The new legislation reflects 
in its preamble and principles the message Canadians want from 
their youth justice system:  that it is there first and foremost 
to protect society; that it fosters values such as respect for 
others and their property; that it insists on accountability; 
that it provides both violent and non-violent young offenders 
with consequences that are meaningful and proportionate to the 
seriousness of the offence; that it be a youth justice system 
that is inclusive and that engages Canadians in their response to 
youth crime; and that it does a better job of responding to the 
needs of victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, the needs of youth will always be considered. 
The new regime will be one which offers hope to youth and will 
give those who get in trouble with the law a chance to turn their 
lives around, for their sake, for the sake of their families and 
their communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the minister of justice has made clear in the House on many 
occasions, we on this side of the House are not prepared to 
criminalize 10 and 11 years olds.  This is not the best way to 
address the needs of children who are faced with situations 
involving unacceptable behaviour.  We believe that in those 
circumstances where a formal approach is required child welfare 
and the mental health systems are the preferred approaches. These 
systems have access to a wider array of services that are more 
age appropriate, family oriented and therapeutic than those 
available through the criminal justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are committed to working with our provincial and territorial 
partners and non-governmental organizations on developing a 
comprehensive strategy for dealing effectively with children 
under 12, particularly the small number of children in this age 
group who are involved in serious offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I attended a conference sponsored by the minister of justice on 
September 27 to 29 of this year.  It was called “Working 
Together for Children:  Protection and Prevention”.  The 
conference was an important step in developing a collaborative 
approach to address problem behaviour by children.  Participants 
from across the country exchanged information and ideas regarding 
best practices in dealing with the interrelated issues of child 
offending and child victimization.  Again, prevention is always 
the ultimate objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The youth criminal justice act includes provisions for more 
meaningful consequences for the most serious violent young 
offenders.  It expands the list of offences and lowers the age at 
which youth would presumptively receive adult sentences.  In the 
legislation, youth 14 years and older who are convicted of 
murder, attempted murder, manslaughter or aggravated sexual 
assault will receive an adult sentence unless a judge can be 
persuaded otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, a fifth presumptive category for repeat violent 
offenders would be created.  Young offenders aged 14 and older 
who demonstrate a pattern of violent behaviour will receive an 
adult sentence unless a judge can be persuaded otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 contains an important change to what may be the most 
controversial aspect of our youth justice legislation, the 
publication of names.  The debate on this issue essentially 
involves two legitimate and competing values:  the need to 
encourage rehabilitation by avoiding the negative effect of 
publicity on the youth versus the need for a greater openness and 
transparency in the justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed legislation now before the House strikes an 
appropriate balance between the competing views.  It will permit 
the publication of the names upon conviction of all young 
offenders who qualify for an adult sentence.  Publication of the 
names of 14 to 17 year olds given a youth sentence for one of the 
presumptive offences could also be permitted.  However, the 
legislation provides the crown with the flexibility to give 
notice at the beginning of a trial that it will not seek an adult 
sentence.  Thus, at the provincial or territorial crown's 
discretion a young person would receive a youth sentence and his 
or her name would not be published. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The youth criminal justice act would also replace the current 
procedure for transfer to adult court by empowering all trial 
courts to grant adult sentences so that the youth retains age 
appropriate procedural protections and justice can be provided 
quickly, placing less of a burden on victims and their families. 
This will also ensure that the offender, the victim or victim's 
family and the community see a clear and timely connection 
between the offence and its consequences.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 contains other important reforms to the youth justice 
system.  In response to concerns by the law enforcement 
community, judicial discretion would be permitted to allow 
voluntary statements by youth to police to be admitted into 
evidence. I spoke to many crown attorneys on this issue. This was 
the only section of the previous young offenders act that they 
would like to see changed.  In response, we have done so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also in response to the concerns of victims, victim impact 
statements would be introduced in youth court and victim's access 
to information regarding proceedings would be improved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also provides for an increased sentence for adults who 
undertake to the court to respect bail conditions involving 
supervision of a young person who would otherwise remain in 
custody and who wilfully fails to comply with those conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill provides that provinces may recover the costs of court 
appointed counsel from parents and young people who are fully 
capable of paying.  The record keeping system for youth records 
would be simplified and would allow for greater access by 
authorized people in the interest of the administration of 
justice and research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that the majority of young people who 
get in trouble with the law are non-violent and commit only one 
offence.  Unfortunately there are too many examples in our 
current youth justice system of young people serving time in jail 
for minor offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We incarcerate youth at a rate four times that of adults, a 
statistic which is hard to believe but is true.  We incarcerate 
youth despite the fact that we knowingly run the risk that they 
will come out more hardened criminals.  We incarcerate them 
knowing that alternatives to custody can do a better job of 
ensuring that youth learn from their mistakes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 includes criteria on the use of custody so that it is 
used appropriately.  Further, the bill includes provisions for 
dealing with less serious offences outside the formal court 
process.  Police would be asked and encouraged to consider all 
options including a formal alternative to the court process 
before laying charges.  The police, key partners in this 
strategy, will be given more authority to use verbal warnings or 
cautions to direct youth to informal police diversion programs 
such as family group conferences or more formal programs 
requiring community service or repairing the harm done to 
victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While every effort would be made to reduce the over-reliance on 
incarceration, where necessary youth will be sentenced to 
custody. Bill C-3 includes provisions that respect an obligation 
to ensure that all young people, particularly the most serious 
offenders, receive effective treatment and rehabilitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That reminds me of a visit the standing committee on justice 
made to the Pinel institute.  We spoke with a number of young 
individuals who had been involved in very serious crimes. One was 
a young boy who had attempted to murder his mother and father. 
That facility had worked very hard with the boy. In fact he had 
been released when he spoke with us and was back living with his 
mother and father.  Rehabilitation works.  Youth should be given 
the opportunity to participate in such programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, with respect to the United Nations Convention on 
the Rights of the Child, youth will serve their sentences in 
youth facilities in almost every case.  Successfully 
rehabilitated youth means fewer victims, restored families, safer 
schools and stronger communities.  To this end Bill C-3 includes 
an intensive custodial sentence for the most high risk young 
offenders who are repeat violent offenders or have committed 
murder, attempted murder, manslaughter or aggravated sexual 
assault. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These sentences are intended for offenders with serious 
psychological, mental, emotional illness or disturbances.  The 
sentence will require a plan for intensive treatment and 
supervision of these offenders and will require the court to make 
all decisions to release them under controlled reintegration 
programs.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed legislation also makes an important reform to youth 
justice sentencing to foster the safe and effective reintegration 
of youth back into the communities.  Under the new law, judges 
will be required to impose a period of supervision in the 
community following custody.  This will allow authorities to 
closely monitor and control the young offender and assure he or 
she receives the necessary treatment and programs to return 
successfully to the community. The period of supervision 
administered by the provinces will include stringent mandatory 
and optional conditions tailored to that individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 provides a comprehensive, balanced and flexible 
legislative framework for youth justice.  It was developed after 
consultation with the provinces, the police, the bar 
associations, youth justice workers, youth themselves, victims 
and other Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next important phase of the renewal of youth justice is 
directed at implementation of new youth justice legislation. 
Youth justice professionals, community members and others will 
need information about the new system and sometimes training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best answers to the complex problems of youth crime lie in 
integrated approaches.  Effective youth justice involves 
educators, child welfare and mental health systems, voluntary 
organizations, victims, families, youth employers, neighbourhood 
groups.  It involves just about anyone who works with or cares 
about kids, our communities and our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Additional federal resources have already been made available to 
support this important challenge of renewing our system of youth 
justice.  The government's youth strategy opens the door to 
greater public and professional involvement in dealing with youth 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister welcomes input from Canadians who have an interest 
in youth justice.  I also urge members of the House to move Bill 
C-3 into committee where Canadians' voices may be heard. 
<P><A NAME="LINK34"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, before I get into the text of my remarks, because there 
are no questions and comments for the first three speakers in 
this morning's debate, I would like to refer briefly to some of 
the comments made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister 
of Justice, the member for Erie—Lincoln. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note at the outset that the member's speech is virtually 
identical to the speech of the minister herself when she spoke to 
the bill on March 22. One of the member's colleagues across the 
floor just heckled and said, “Why not?”  I am trying to point 
out to anyone who would care to assess the situation that there 
is a pat Liberal line to this.  Quite simply the parliamentary 
secretary, the member for Erie—Lincoln, merely read what the 
minister said.  He probably had her speech sent to him, changed a 
few things and then stood up and presented it as his own 
position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member said that first and foremost the bill is to 
protect society.  He went on to talk about consequences, of which 
there are very few in the legislation. He talked about a new 
regime, when everyone who studies the bill and compares it to the 
Young Offenders Act knows it is the same old crap that is merely 
dressed up and put forward with a new name. It does not change 
anything. The member said that the government is not prepared to 
criminalize 10 and 11 year olds.  He went on to say in his 
remarks that the minister listened and consulted with Canadians 
from coast to coast and listened to the words of her own standing 
committee, a Liberal dominated standing committee I might add. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we find is that the government did not listen at all.  Yes 
it consulted and went through the motions of listening, but when 
we look at what is in Bill C-3, we see that it is just the same 
old stuff. I say at the outset that not much has changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am honoured to rise today on behalf of the official opposition 
to address this important issue of youth justice.  Reforming the 
Young Offenders Act was one of the cornerstones of the Reform 
Party's movement.  It is an issue close to the hearts of 
thousands of concerned Canadians, many of them victims, or the 
families of victims which of course makes them victims as well.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The role of a responsible government is to listen to the 
concerns of its citizens and to respond promptly with legislation 
that is fair, effective and in the best interests of those same 
citizens.  The role of a responsible opposition is to critique 
the actions of the government, to offer support in areas of 
agreement, to criticize the areas where we disagree and to offer 
constructive alternatives to resolve those areas of disagreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I intend to address the status of youth crime in Canada, 
identify the areas in which Canadians want change, commend the 
minister on those areas addressed in this bill, bring to her 
attention the areas of the bill that do not live up to the 
expectations of Canadians and list the changes Reform wants to 
see in the bill.  Those changes will be moved as amendments in 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will first discuss the state of youth crime in Canada.  I have 
spoken many times in the Chamber about communicating with my 
constituents through a weekly newspaper column.  I began writing 
this column long before I became an MP.  I have written several 
times on the issue of youth crime, approximately 10 times over 
the past seven years.  The response to these columns has been 
overwhelming in support of the changes Reform has been advocating 
for well over a decade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my column of February 10, 1993, about eight months before I 
was elected for the first time to the House, I said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What greatly disturbs me is not just the increase in the number 
of crimes being committed by our young but their apparent total 
disregard for authority.  Almost daily we can find instances 
where truly heinous crimes are committed by these young people 
with no outward signs of remorse. In fact quite the opposite, 
because they know their punishment will be very minor, if any, 
they actually boast of their crimes and how they're above the 
law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view this attitude has been created and laws presume that 
criminals are not really “bad” people but rather simply 
products of “bad” social conditions.  Why is it most of us 
believe we live in the best country on earth and yet we persist 
in mollycoddling our criminals because it's not really their 
fault they do the things they do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party believes that our justice system must place the 
punishment of crime and the protection of law-abiding citizens 
and their property ahead of all other objectives.  This is not to 
say that other objectives such as the protection of the rights of 
the accused or rehabilitation of criminals, are unimportant.  It 
is simply to say that protection of society is the reason for 
having a criminal justice system in the first place. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is amazing that these words were written almost seven years 
ago and that nothing substantial has been done to fix the 
problem. Canadians are fed up with young people who have no 
regard for authority, the community or the law.  These young 
people need to be taught that there are consequences to their 
actions.  In my opinion, the YOA created more criminals than it 
ever cured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be honest.  The majority of us were not angels growing 
up.  I believe that sometimes kids must be kids. In about a week 
it will be Hallowe'en which traditionally is a time when kids 
like to play pranks.  It comes from the very statement children 
make when they come to our doors, trick or treat.  If we do not 
give out a treat we might get a trick played on us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember being a youngster growing up in rural Canada, in 
northern British Columbia.  We used to like to go around, tip 
over the odd outhouse, soap a car's windshield and things like 
that. The reality is that we have moved far beyond that over the 
past 30 or 40 years.  Now we see outright acts of vandalism 
because of a gradual deterioration of consequences for criminal 
activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not the pranks that are the problem.  It is the crimes 
that erode communities, damage property and destroy families.  It 
is the acts of violence that strike fear in the hearts of the 
elderly and the children who endure the harassment and brutality 
of a generation held unaccountable for its actions.  It is the 
families that hold dear the memories of lost loved ones and the 
scars of a justice system that slaps the wrists of young 
offenders who beat, rape or murder.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my home province of British Columbia, the names of Reena 
Virk, Dawn Shaw, and Trygve Magnusson represent just a few 
victims who died at the hands of violent youth.  Their senseless 
deaths demand laws from the government that punish and deter 
those who commit violent acts and provide mandatory 
rehabilitation programs during incarceration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject of those types of cases, I am reminded of 
something that seems to be quite new in our society, tragically. 
It has been referred to in different newspaper articles as 
swarming.  This is where children, for no apparent reason, band 
together as a group and kick some unfortunate person to death or 
stab someone in a wanton act of violence.  Something serious must 
be done about this.  We cannot continue to allow these acts of 
random violence by youths to go unpunished with a slap on the 
wrist.  Because these people who commit these crimes are young or 
are teenagers, they end up serving only a few months in 
incarceration, if that.  It is not right that there are no 
consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young people naturally think they are invulnerable.  Some would 
argue that this is due to inexperience or an inability to 
understand the consequences.  This may be true for some, but many 
young offenders are fully aware of the limits of the law and feel 
they have a free ticket to do as they please until they turn 18. 
Police officers themselves tell me stories of kids who say, “You 
cannot touch me, I am only 14.  What are you going to do about 
it?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This attitude is the direct result of the Young Offenders Act. A 
piece of legislation intended to give troubled kids a second 
chance at a successful future has become a means of abetting 
criminal behaviour.  The Young Offenders Act failed to establish 
a deterrent to crime and, I would suggest, it helped promote it. 
The tragedies of Taber, Alberta, Columbine High School in 
Colorado and several other places are horrific reminders of just 
how bad things can get and how vulnerable we are to senseless 
acts of violence whether by youth or adults. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The emergence of video games, the Internet and the subject 
matter emphasized on television, movies and music dictate that 
parents, society and government must work together to establish 
parameters for our children.  As parents, we must take an active 
role in screening what our kids see and do and intervene before 
things get out of hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role of society is to establish standards by consensus and 
ensure that these standards are represented in the laws passed by 
our governments.  I believe the government's role in this is 
twofold;  first, to provide a justice system that protects 
society, truly deters crime and rehabilitates criminals; and 
second, it must address and repair social flaws, dysfunctional 
families, economic hardships and deficiencies within the 
education system through effective programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to state that it is not the role of the justice 
system to fix the social inadequacies of society.  That has been 
the major fault with the Young Offenders Act.  Its purpose was to 
deter people from breaking the law and to punish and rehabilitate 
those who do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to move on to what Canadians want changed.  It is 
interesting that the minister chose to add the word justice to 
this act because that is exactly what Canadians want.  They want 
justice.  They want sentences to be just, to balance the need to 
protect society by deterring and punishing crime with the need to 
rehabilitate offenders and get them back on track.  There are no 
shortcuts to this goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no greater deterrent than fear of the consequences. 
Young offenders laugh in the face of authority due to the lack of 
deterrents.  That must change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have waited a long time for the government to deliver 
on their promise to make youth justice a priority and to deliver 
a youth justice system that actually works.  Canadians want: 
first, sentences to fit the crime; second, violent criminals 
removed from society; third, effective crime prevention programs; 
fourth, safe schools; fifth, younger children brought into the 
system; sixth, older teens and violent criminals to face adult 
court; seventh, names of violent sexual assault criminals to be 
published; eighth, the rights of victims to be paramount to that 
of the criminal irrespective of age.

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what Canadians are looking for.  That is what we hear 
daily when we consult with them.  That is what the government 
heard, if only it would listen and respond appropriately with 
meaningful legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will not take long, but I would like to briefly address what 
we agree with in Bill C-3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While much of the bill is a reconstituted YOA there are a few 
notable changes.  These were outlined by the hon. member for 
Surrey North when he spoke to the bill the last time it was 
introduced.  Anyone interested in a thorough analysis of the 
issue of youth justice and the bill should look up his speech in 
<I>Hansard</I>, March 22, 1999.  I strongly recommend that people 
should look up that speech and read it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am disappointed that the bill was reintroduced in the same 
form it was the last time, with only technical changes.  The mere 
fact that the bill languished for months on the Order Paper is a 
testament to the level of priority the government gives it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the House prorogued and the bill was still on the Order 
Paper, I rather foolishly hoped that the government had seen the 
light and would have introduced a new version that better 
represented the concerns of Canadians, the concerns that I just 
outlined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aside from that, there are some small victories in the bill for 
Canadians.  The increased emphasis on police discretion will 
ensure that minor youth indiscretions can be addressed by police 
officers with warnings rather than laying charges.  This 
initiative was proposed by the hon. member for Crowfoot in his 
minority report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister makes a big deal out of dealing with violent and 
non-violent offenders differently.  I believe this is an 
excellent initiative as well, but it was also outlined in the 
Reform minority report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young people who commit non-violent crimes are more suitable for 
programs such as diversion, restorative justice and community 
service.  It is not necessary to remove these individuals from 
society, only to ensure that they learn the error of their ways 
and develop a healthy respect for authority and the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In March 1995, in response to the first so-called changes to the 
Young Offenders Act that the now health minister made in Bill 
C-37, I wrote in my newspaper column the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our justice system must distinguish between young, first time 
offenders who commit minor crimes and those who engage in 
habitual or violent criminal behaviour with no respect for 
property or even life itself.  Despite what some advocates would 
have us believe, not all young offenders who commit non-violent 
property crimes are harmless.  Many are already habitual 
criminals with no moral conscience and a warped value system. 
They do not understand why they should respect the lives and 
property of other Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These youth need to know the punishment for their crimes will 
not be a slap on the wrist like raking leaves at the local park 
on weekends.  These youth need a stronger reason to think before 
stealing another car.  We need to strike a balance between 
deterrents and accountability, between punishment and 
rehabilitation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most non-violent offenders are excellent candidates for 
alternative measures, such as conditional sentences, for they 
pose little or no threat to society, only a need for restitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third area I would like to commend the minister for 
including is the issue of holding parents and legal guardians 
responsible for breaches of court ordered conditions by an 
offender under their care.  This initiative was introduced by the 
hon. member for Surrey North in his private member's bill, Bill 
C-210, in the first session of this parliament.  I know he is not 
seeking acknowledgement for that, but I certainly know he 
deserves it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to commend the minister for taking the first steps in 
publishing the names of those young offenders who commit serious 
crimes, although I am not convinced that the minister is going to 
actually get that accomplished.  In her speech on Bill C-68, Bill 
C-3's forerunner, on March 22, 1999 she had the following to say 
about the publication of names: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The names of 14 to 17 year olds given a youth sentence for 
murder, attempted murder, manslaughter, aggravated assault or 
repeat violent offences could be published in certain 
circumstances. 
</UL>
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1140"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT12"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT12"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1140

<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does that mean?  The use of words like “could” and 
“certain circumstances” did not give the impression that the 
minister is serious about this matter.  She has once again 
abdicated her responsibility to the lawyers and the courts. These 
may be loopholes that she as a lawyer would like to see in 
legislation, but I can tell her that these words are the last 
thing that victims of crimes and their families want to see in 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Referring to the minister's comments in <I>Hansard</I> that day, 
I would also draw attention to another comment she made in 
referring to the publication of names.  She said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate on this issue essentially involves two legitimate and 
competing values, 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the parliamentary secretary say much the same thing in 
his remarks a few minutes ago. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>the need to encourage rehabilitation by avoiding the negative 
effect of the publicity on youth versus the need for greater 
openness and transparency in the justice system. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at this.  She referred to the need to encourage 
rehabilitation by avoiding the negative effect of the publication 
on our youth.  I would contend, and I think most Canadians would 
contend, that in some way the only thing that is going to 
rehabilitate these youngsters is if their peers and their 
community know who is committing the crimes.  If their name is 
perhaps splashed on the front page of the paper when they commit 
a violent crime like this, they will be held accountable by their 
community, their peers, their parents and their families.  It 
would be a bit of an embarrassment factor if nothing else.  I 
think it is very misguided to state that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young people themselves are among the most outspoken, demanding 
the necessary change to the publication ban.  If for no other 
reason than to protect the majority from the minority, our young 
people must know the identity of their violent peers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will move on to what the Reform Party recommended. I will 
begin by congratulating two of my colleagues for the tremendous 
amount of work and time they have dedicated to the issue:  the 
member for Crowfoot, who just yesterday reintroduced a private 
member's bill on this very issue; and, the member for Surrey 
North, whose tragic life experiences and need to implement change 
in this area motivated him to actually run as a member of 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will pause and remark that I am blessed with a son who is 16 
years old right now.  That is the very age that Jesse Cadman was 
when his life was tragically snuffed out by a young offender.  As 
a parent who also has two daughters aged 20 and 18, I do not want 
to imagine the horror of finding one of my children murdered.  I 
worry about it every night and pray to God that my children are 
safe.  I cannot understand a government that turns its back on so 
many senseless deaths and does not bring forward meaningful 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of the justice committee, the member for Crowfoot 
travelled across Canada hearing from concerned Canadians 
frustrated by the system.  It is puzzling to think that Liberal 
members heard the very same testimony but only Reform party's 
recommendations reflect the concerns of Canadians.  The Liberal 
recommendations reflected the concerns and interests of the 
justice minister and her bureaucrats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The following are just some of the recommendations the Reform 
party presented in its minority report:  first, make the 
protection of society the first and guiding principle of youth 
justice; second, allow police officers to use discretion in 
resolving minor incidents without laying charges; third, lower 
the maximum age of the youth justice act from 17 to 15 years of 
age; fourth, lower the minimum age limit of the youth justice act 
from 12 to 10 years of age; fifth, differentiate between 
non-violent and violent crimes; sixth, increase the maximum 
length of all sentences; seventh, youth facilities need mandatory 
rehabilitative programs; eighth, minimum six month probation 
after all prison sentences; ninth, move all 14 and 15 year old 
violent offenders automatically to adult court while limiting all 
other transfers; tenth, the person who commits two or more 
violent offences must be designated a dangerous offender; 
eleventh, allow for community based juvenile committees in every 
jurisdiction for non-violent and first time offenders; twelfth, 
establish federal standards for alternative measures with well 
defined parameters; thirteenth, publicize the names of violent 
young offenders, all of them and not just some of them; 
fourteenth, adult young offender records to be treated the same 
as those of adults; and fifteenth, require parents or legal 
guardians to appear at all court proceedings.

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to highlight the recommendations calling for the 
reduction of the minimum age to 10 years old and the 
recommendation referring to alternative measures, as they are of 
particular importance to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister and members opposite have portrayed Reform members 
as mean and nasty because we want to lower the minimum age to 10 
years old.  I have news for the minister.  Despite her 
accusations, Reform would never lock up 10 year olds, throw away 
the key and feed them bread and water.  Nothing could be further 
from the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, by including 10 year olds in the legislation the 
government would be protecting these youngsters from those who 
use them to perpetrate crimes.  Many drug dealers use 10 and 11 
year olds to sell drugs for two reasons.  One is access to other 
kids.  The other is because 10 year olds are exempt from the law. 
These kids are targets and their participation is a crisis on the 
rise, especially in lower mainland of B.C. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister refuses to acknowledge that the provinces and the 
police were interested in these changes and that even the Liberal 
dominated standing committee supported the idea.  It was a 
recommendation from their own standing committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bringing 10 year olds under the act is a head start to setting 
them on the right path from a early age.  Sadly too many kids are 
experienced criminals by the time they reach 12 years old and by 
then it is almost too late to set them straight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another recommendation is alternative measures.  Alternative 
measures include several initiatives such as diversion, 
restorative justice and community service.  I am most interested 
in what is known as conditional sentencing because this is a 
particular area of critic responsibility for me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been a number of horror stories from adult courts 
regarding the use of conditional sentences.  I state emphatically 
that those convicted of violent crimes, whether adult or child, 
must not be given conditional sentences.  It is imperative that 
violent offenders be removed from our society to protect society 
and provide punishment and rehabilitation and thus a deterrent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is conditional sentencing?  Conditional sentencing is a 
criminal code amendment giving judges the authority to impose a 
sentence to be served in the community.  This means the offender 
would not go to jail but would remain living at home and going on 
with his or her daily routine of work or school under certain 
conditions.  That is the title. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When does it apply?  Conditional sentencing applies in cases 
where an offender would have normally been sentenced to less than 
two years in custody.  This amendment was the attempt of the 
Liberals to ease the burden on Canada's overcrowded prisons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conditional sentences were never intended to be used in violent 
crime cases.  However the sentencing guidelines are vague and 
have been interpreted to include all crimes.  In an August 1997 
decision the B.C. Court of Appeal stated that “if parliament had 
intended to exclude certain offences from consideration under 
section 742.1 it could have done so in clear language ”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many judges have interpreted this law broadly, allowing violent 
offenders to serve their sentences in the community.  Judges have 
handed down conditional sentences for crimes such as sexual 
assault, impaired driving, rape and even murder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our communities are at risk.  I will cite a few examples.  In 
Montreal three men were given 18 month conditional sentences 
after raping a 16 year old pregnant women and holding her upside 
down from a balcony.  The judge thought that this was part of 
their culture.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Winnipeg a youth previously convicted of theft and seven 
armed robberies and on temporary leave from a Manitoba youth 
centre received a one year conditional sentence and three years 
probation for the drive-by shooting of a 13 year old.  This is 
horrific. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Edmonton a 57 year old man who swung a machete at a 21 year 
old male, cutting his face and cutting a third of his ear off, 
got 240 hours of community service and a curfew for that crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Orleans, close to home here, Paul Gervais confessed to 
sexually assaulting nine boys.  He got a two year conditional 
sentence and a curfew.  He is serving his sentence at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Ottawa, right here in the nation's capital, Robert Turcotte 
strangled his mother to death.  He received a two year 
conditional sentence, 100 hours of community service and a 
midnight curfew. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government's conditional sentencing law allows some 
convicted violent criminals to serve their sentences in the 
community, not in prison.  What message does this send?  It sends 
the message that in our justice system there are minor 
consequences for major, serious crimes.  Eighty-four per cent of 
Canadians believe that people convicted of violent offences 
should be ineligible for conditional sentences, according to a 
recent national poll. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Amending the legislation is as simple as changing one clause. If 
the justice minister really wanted to change the law she could do 
so in one day with the co-operation of the House.  Rather than 
responding to the clear will of Canadians she prefers to let the 
courts decide these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am about to reintroduce my private member's bill which lists 
the crimes that if passed would be excluded from consideration 
for conditional sentencing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along with a large majority of Canadians we support amending the 
criminal code to exclude dangerous crimes from conditional 
sentencing eligibility.  Someone convicted of a dangerous crime, 
including murder, manslaughter, armed robbery, kidnapping, sexual 
assault, assault, domestic violence and drug trafficking, should 
be ineligible for conditional sentencing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A recent survey of 450 Canadian judges revealed that 80% of them 
were leery of imposing conditional sentences due to lack of 
supervision.  They are effectively giving criminals a slap on the 
wrist.  If we cannot supervise criminals we cannot protect 
society from their acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a child commits a violent crime and causes pain and hardship 
for another person, what lesson is learned from being grounded? 
We are not talking about a minor incident of shoplifting or a 
minor incident of vandalism, perhaps by a temporary wayward 
child. We are talking about serious crimes.  Being grounded is 
effectively what a conditional sentence is because it limits 
freedom.  That is all it does.  How can those who have been 
injured by a youth feel justified if the offender is allowed to 
go home and play Nintendo or watch television? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about other youth who see the lenient sentence handed down 
to their friend for hurting someone else?  What have they 
learned?  Will they consider the consequences prior to committing 
a crime?  The answer is no, because that is what the YOA did and 
that is what Bill C-3 will continue.  It will not change that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister must learn from the mistakes of conditional 
sentencing for adults and ensure that those mistakes are not 
repeated with our youth through the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to move on to the minister's actions.  As I just 
mentioned there are three initiatives in the bill which address 
the concerns of Canadians.  I have to wonder what the heck took 
so long when there are only three. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The justice minister was appointed 864 days ago when she stated 
that the overhauling of the Young Offenders Act was her top 
priority and that changes were to be made in a timely fashion. 
The bill is on pace to hit 1,000 days.  I guess we should all be 
thankful that this is her priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The figure of 864 days seems like a pretty obscure one and it 
does not mean much.  It is just a statistic.  What significance 
does it serve?  In the 864 days Canadians have been waiting for 
new youth crime legislation, which they were hoping would include 
deterrents, over 30,000 violent crimes have left more than 30,000 
victims in their wake. 
That is about 34 violent crimes per day and unfortunately Bill 
C-3, about which the government is so busy bragging, misses the 
mark and provides little in terms of real solutions like most 
justice initiatives of the government.  In order for Bill C-3 to 
be deemed a success it must stand up to one test, and one test 
only:  Does it address the concerns of Canadians?

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will run through them again.  Do sentences fit the crime?  No. 
Are violent criminals removed from society?  Not likely.  Does it 
implement effective crime prevention programs?  Some.  Will our 
schools be safer?  No.  Are younger children brought into the 
system?  No.  Do older teens and violent criminals face adult 
court?  At the discretion of the courts they may.  Will the names 
of violent and sexual assault criminals be published?  Maybe. Are 
the rights of victims paramount to those of criminals?  No. They 
are not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I am informing the House that the official 
opposition is, reluctantly I might add because we have waited as 
long as Canadians have waited for the legislation, unable to 
support the bill without serious amendments.  Our members on the 
justice committee will be moving amendments that are in the best 
interest of public safety, deterrence and rehabilitation 
respectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can just hear the minister in future question periods when 
asked why violent young criminals are still out reoffending due 
to lenient sentencing.  The minister will probably say something 
like the government made significant changes to Canada's youth 
justice system but the Reform Party voted against them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me set the record straight right at the outset.  Bill C-3 is 
deeply flawed.  It is not good enough for Canadians who have 
waited so long.  The legislation does not go far enough to 
protect society.  It does not include any measures to ensure 
mandatory participation in meaningful rehabilitation programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister again has brought forward a bill that is full of 
loopholes and allows lawyers and judges to maintain the status 
quo when it comes to youth justice.  Status quo is not what 
Canadians were hoping or praying for in the area of youth 
justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, Bill C-3 is not good enough.  It is not good enough 
for the Reform Party of Canada.  It is not good enough for 
Canadians, and most important it is not good enough for our youth 
who cried out the loudest for change.  Bill C-3 is simply not 
good enough.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
whole issue of young offenders is extremely important, because 
everyone knows that young people will eventually be part of 
society.  This is why the Bloc Quebecois has paid keen attention 
to everything surrounding the debates on the Young Offenders 
Act.  It has repeatedly called on the minister not to touch the 
bill, which works successfully in Quebec.  I will explain that 
in detail in the time allotted me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to try to prove that it is a good law, that it must 
not be touched and that it must simply be implemented as Quebec 
has done since its passage. 
The results in Quebec have been very good. I think everyone in 
this House agrees with that.  Even the former Minister of 
Justice acknowledged this at a first ministers conference.  He 
even expressed the hope that all the provinces would implement 
this legislation like Quebec.  Unfortunately, we have before us 
a bill that is changing some things. I will speak of that in a 
few minutes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened with much interest to the speech by the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Justice—I find it all odd that the 
minister did not come to the House to defend the bill herself at 
second reading, instead of her parliamentary secretary—but I 
think he has failed to grasp the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government seems to have understood nothing of Quebec's 
approach.  Worse yet, the parliamentary secretary is quoting 
people from the Institut Pinel, who have said repeatedly they do 
not want Bill C-3, or Bill C-68, as it was called during the 
previous session.  The parliamentary secretary quotes people 
from the Institut Pinel.  One has to be in a really difficult 
situation to have to quote people opposed to this bill in order 
to sell it in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also listened with interest to the comments made by the Reform 
Party. True to their vision of justice and to everything they 
have done since 1993, Reformers unfortunately gave a twisted 
picture of the situation. The Reform Party member called upon 
God and prayed. He does not want his children to get attacked by 
young people, and so on. This is a very negative and demagogic 
speech, one that should not be made here on legislation on young 
offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make such remarks is to mislead the public. These comments do 
not reflect the actual figures, which are not those of the Bloc 
Quebecois nor of the Government of Quebec, but those of the 
federal government and they show that the crime rate is 
declining among young people. 
That rate is dropping even for violent crimes, not by much, but 
it has been steadily falling in recent years, to the tune of 
about 1% to 2% per year. Quebec is the only province where this 
legislation is fully applied, and Quebec has played a major 
factor in that decline, since it has been getting very good 
results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In English Canada, the further west we go, the higher the rate 
of recidivism and the percentage of young offenders. This is 
interesting, because application existing Young Offenders Act is 
less consistent as we move from east to west in English Canada, 
and least of all in the west. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Strange as it may seem, under the Liberals' current system, the 
less a province applies the Young Offenders Act, the more money 
it gets. I will get back to this later on. 
There is a bill that has been outstanding for years for which 
the government opposite has not reimbursed the Government of 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Quebec has decided to invest in people, and 
particularly in young people so that they can regain their 
anonymity as quickly as possible on leaving custody and become 
full-fledged members of society, while westerners are investing 
in concrete.  The way the program is set up, the folks investing 
in concrete and prisons in which to hold young offenders as long 
as possible get money from the federal government, while those 
who enforce the legislation passed by the federal government, 
the government opposite, are penalized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can see why the former Minister of Justice did not keep his 
post for long: he supported the Government of Quebec's claim. 
I will come back to this a bit later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude my remarks about what the previous speaker said, I 
would like him to take a closer look at the statistics.  I would 
like him to take a closer look at what is going on in his 
immediate surroundings and try to depersonalize the debate, look 
at objective figures.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let him come to Quebec and see what is going on.  Let him talk 
to people like those at the Institut Pinel.  Let him read what 
eminent criminologists and university professors have written. 
Let him observe the approach taken by crown lawyers in cases. 
Let him examine the results in Quebec.  I am certain that he 
will see that the approach he is recommending is not the right 
one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, I will develop my argument further.  I 
will begin with an extremely important quotation, just to make 
the point that it is not only recently that Quebec has been 
addressing the issue of young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After several years of application of the Young Offenders Act, a 
judge was mandated by the Government of Quebec to investigate 
how the legislation was being implemented, whether there was 
room for improvement in its day to day application.  This made 
it possible to see whether the government could provide more 
support, more backing, to the agencies applying that act daily, 
and whether the legislation could be improved in order to help 
them more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to the report by Justice Jasmin addressing the young 
offender issue.  His report was released in 1995.  The debate 
has been going on for some time.  Today we are discussing Bill 
C-3, which was numbered C-68 during the last session.  Nothing was 
done over the summer, but I will get back to that later.  I have 
a great deal to say and I doubt 40 minutes would be enough.  I 
will try to give hon. members the main thrust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The quote I am about to read from the Jasmin report fits in very 
well with today's debate.  He writes: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is often easier to amend legislation than to change our 
approach to a problem.  It may be tempting to think that tougher 
legislation is the answer to the problems of delinquency. 
Simplistic responses blind us to the full extent of complex 
problems and create the false impression that we are doing what 
is necessary to resolve them. One such simplistic response is 
substituting get-tough measures for educational approaches.  This 
loses sight of the fact that adolescents are still in the 
process of evolving and laying the entire blame for their 
delinquency at their door is implying that society and their 
environment were of no importance. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was no weak conclusion that Mr. Justice Jasmin reached 
following his consultations.  I support his conclusions 150%. 
If a young person 14 or 15 years of age commits a violent crime 
or kills someone—at the start of his life—I think society's 
approach is at fault.  I think society is responsible for that 
somehow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying that society must assume all the blame.  When we 
look at the case a little, when we see a 14 year old or 15 year 
old committing such a crime—repugnant, I agree—when we look at 
this young person's situation, level of education, community and 
friends, we realize quite often that the parents are totally 
absent,. We realize that the young person has committed a very 
serious crime but is not the only one responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is “being locked up”, as they say in the lingo, going to resolve 
the problem? 
In the short term perhaps.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A 14 year old going to prison will be released one day, but the 
problem will not be resolved when that young person comes out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, this is the approach advocated by the Reform 
members and, very disappointingly, no doubt in order to garner a 
few votes in the upcoming elections in Alberta, represented by 
the Minister of Justice, the minister gave in to the very right 
wing demands of the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as justice is concerned and especially as far as young 
offenders are concerned, Reformers and Liberals are tarred with 
the same brush.  It makes no sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, I said that this was not the first time we have debated 
this bill, because it was first introduced by the Minister of 
Justice on March 11, 1999 as Bill C-68.  Immediately after the 
bill was introduced, just reading the preamble and the first few 
clauses I felt that a major amendment was called for and that 
the government was tearing down huge portions of the Young 
Offenders Act, when there was nothing wrong with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Little by little, support grew. 
In Quebec, there was a significant public outcry at the time—we 
are talking about the months of March, April and May, 1999.  The 
Government of Quebec defended its stand and then kept the heat 
on the Department of Justice.  It brought out quotes from the 
former Minister of Justice in the same Liberal government to 
show that there had been a change in approach and that what one 
minister had said was plainly contradicted by his successor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have thought the Minister of Justice would have given 
this issue some thought over the summer, because it is without a 
doubt one of the most important bills she will introduce in this 
parliament.  What is passed today will affect generations to 
come. 
We cannot amend the Young Offenders Act every six months, or 
whenever the government appoints a new justice minister. This is 
probably the most important bill that the hon. member will 
introduce in her capacity as Minister of Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought, wrongly, that the summer vacation would help the 
minister come to her senses. But no. Today, she is coming back 
with her old Bill C-68, which, through some administrative 
sleight of hand in the House, has now become Bill C-3. Nothing is 
changed in this legislation, even though many people clearly 
showed that it should be amended and even withdrawn, so that the 
current Young Offenders Act would remain in effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I told members that, as early as in March, April and May 1999, 
people in Quebec were unanimous in their opposition. In fact, I 
challenge the government to quote or to name a single Quebec 
organization applying the Young Offenders Act on a daily basis 
that supports the amendments proposed by the minister. 
Criminologists, social workers, police forces, legal experts, 
everyone is saying that the minister is headed in the wrong 
direction.

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, opposition is significant. It is very significant 
within the provincial government and I believe it will grow even 
more in the next few days. It may be that we have to send an 
even stronger message to the federal government. The Liberals 
may not have got it the first time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am told that, while opposition voiced in Quebec and the 
message sent by the coalition against the reform of the Young 
Offenders Act was ignored by the Minister of Justice and the 
Quebec Liberal caucus, it was well received by certain groups 
outside Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Opposition to this bill is increasing, not for the reasons 
advanced by the Reform Party but for the ones advanced by the 
Quebec coalition, which is against the amendments the minister 
proposes to make in this important area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a minister decides to intervene in something, no doubt this 
is because he feels justified in doing so.  I indicated earlier 
that there had been a drop in the crime rate. It has dropped by 
23% since 1991.  In Quebec, where the young offenders 
legislation is enforced, the results are even more conclusive . 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intention of the bill before us is not to amend the Young 
Offenders Act.  I say this because there are still members on 
the government side who maintain it is so. They say “The bill 
before you, members of the Opposition, is a bill to amend the 
Young Offenders Act”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not true.  Bill C-3 repeals the existing young offenders 
legislation.  It starts completely from scratch.  The government 
ought perhaps to acknowledge this.  Regarding the Young 
Offenders Act as it is applied today—and I cannot get into it 
clause by clause because it is a highly complex piece of 
legislation—but I think that the hon. members will understand 
clearly why we are opposed, just from its main thrust, its main 
principles and orientations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time, it is section 3 of the Young Offenders Act 
in its present form—all judges up to and including the justices 
of the Supreme Court agree on this—that shows the true policy 
thrust the legislator wished to give to the legislation and what 
he intends to do with young people in conflict with the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 3 is very long and I will not read it in full, but I 
will read some of the principles by which a judge must be guided 
when he hands down a decision involving a young offender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This section says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Crime prevention is essential to the long-term protection of 
society and requires addressing the underlying causes of crime 
by young persons. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on to say: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>a) While young persons should not in all instances be held 
accountable in the same manner or suffer the same consequences 
for their behaviour as adults, young persons who commit offences 
should nonetheless bear responsibility for their contraventions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>b) Society must, although it has the responsibility to take 
reasonable measures to prevent criminal conduct by young 
persons, be afforded the necessary protection from illegal 
behaviour; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not true to say that the purpose of the present act is not 
to protect society.  In the first three paragraphs of section 3, 
that is most certainly put forward as its purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This section also says: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>c)  young persons who commit offences require supervision, 
discipline and control, but, because of their state of 
dependency and level of development and maturity, they also have 
special needs. 
</UL></UL>

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Special needs” is an extremely important phrase in section 3(c) 
on which many judges, including those in the supreme court, have 
commented, pointing out that Quebec approached things 
differently by taking into account the special needs required in 
a given situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also says, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The protection of society, which is a primary objective of the 
criminal law applicable to youth, is best served by 
rehabilitation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that members opposite, including the parliamentary 
secretary who is paying close attention to my comments, realize 
that the existing act, passed by this government, provides that 
the social rehabilitation of young offenders is preferable to 
any other measure. This is what the current act says. In some 
cases, extrajudicial measures known as alternative measures 
should be considered for young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also said that while the Young Offenders Act provides for 
jail sentences, taking measures other than judicial proceedings 
should be considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act also says that “Young persons have rights and freedoms 
in their own right, including those stated in the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms or in the Canadian Bill of 
Rights”. And so on. 
These are extremely important provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does Bill C-3 include anything similar? As members know, a bill 
is made up of a title, sections, parts and schedules. The 
content of the act itself is more important than what is found 
in the explanatory notes or in the preamble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Supreme Court of Canada has ruled on this issue and stated 
that while the preamble provides guidelines, one must look at 
the wording of the act itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>None of what I read, which comes from the declaration of 
principle found in section 3 of the existing Young Offenders 
Act, is to be found in Bill C-3, which is before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, the government has included, probably to keep people 
quiet, a vague reference to these principles in the preamble of 
its proposed legislation. 
It is as if it were saying “Come on, you folks in the Bloc 
Quebecois, the principles are there in the preamble”.  It is a 
meaningless sham.  There have been court decisions that say so. 
When the whole bill is read, it becomes evident that the 
preamble is not reflected in the application of the legislation. 
The judges will have to interpret it, that is certain, but they 
will do so according to what is in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It can be seen, then, that there is a considerable difference 
between the two texts, the current Young Offenders Act and the 
bill we have before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another argument that is often raised by those on the other side 
of the House is flexibility.  The Minister of Justice, or her 
department, has managed to cast a spell over a number of the 
Quebec Liberal MPs, or maybe the Prime Minister himself, since 
he must have had a hand in it all. 
They, because there is more than one, have told me “What are you 
complaining about?  Quebec will be able to do as it pleases, 
there is flexibility; there is the possibility of opting out”. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1225"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT21"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT21"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1225
<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, upon examination, we find there is no flexibility.  The 
flexibility the Minister of Justice talks about, to the effect 
that Quebec can do what it wants, the flexibility the minister 
claims there is in this bill and would make it possible to 
continue to apply the Young Offenders Act, is nowhere to be 
found. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let someone show me where it is stated.  I have gone through the 
bill more than once.  I could not say how many jurists have 
looked at it in Quebec, how many institutions have studied it. 
No one, whether criminologist or lawyer, no one has found any 
clause that offered this flexibility to Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there is an indication that, under some circumstances, 
it could be done on a case by case basis.  That is not funny. 
The minister can do what she wants with the bill, may I say, 
because she is introducing it, but she will not be applying it. 
That will be left to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She is putting undue pressure on the crown attorneys who are 
going to evaluate, in each case, whether they will treat the 
young person as an adult or as a young person, who is therefore 
not fully responsible for his actions and deserves special 
attention.  The Minister of Justice is not going to be the one 
to carry this burden. The Minister of Justice of this 
“beautiful, great, finest country in the world” known as Canada 
is not going to feel the pressure, but Quebecers will, because 
they will be implementing this law in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all the demagoguery I am hearing today, it will be easy to 
get a crowd together and put huge pressure on the crown attorney 
who will have a given case, who will have to draw conclusions, 
who will have to make recommendations.  I think the minister 
lacks courage.  If she wants to act this way, let her take on 
the burden and insist that young people in specific situations 
be treated as adults.  She should not put that burden on the 
shoulders of one or more others.  She should say so clearly, 
which she has not done in her bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the whole principle of our not living in a closed 
society in Quebec.  Even if we wanted—something I wish with all 
my heart—Quebec to be able to do as it wished in all areas, 
including justice, because we would be sovereign, we must for 
the time being live with the tools we are given. 
Quebecers must live with legislation passed by the Parliament of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They cannot completely shut it out of and say “We will have 
nothing to do with what is going on in English Canada concerning 
the implementation of the new act”. Incidentally, the title of 
the bill is rather telling. It reads “An Act in respect of 
criminal justice for young persons and to amend and repeal other 
Acts”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It refers to “criminal justice”. Whatever happened to the 
guiding principle of the Young Offenders Act? We will not be 
able to remain silent. We will not be able to say that we will 
completely ignore what is going on. The lower and upper courts 
in the other provinces will interpret this legislation. Some 
day, their rulings will have a bearing on what goes in Quebec. 
Comparisons will be made and it will be difficult to reconcile 
flexibility with the imposition of similar sentences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, the imposition of similar sentences is also a principle 
included in the new legislation. What does it mean? Does it mean 
that Quebec will have to impose a jail sentence on a young 
offender because Ontario does it? What does it mean in concrete 
terms? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly, this is a useless and dangerous bill. It provides for 
harsher sentences. The government obviously decided to crack 
down on young offenders, but this bill does not reflect today's 
reality.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take something else that is completely ridiculous, the 
publication of names.  In what way will publishing the names of 
young offenders in newspapers help their victims?  How will it 
advance the justice system to brand these young people for life? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are no studies indicating that it would do any good to 
make their names public.  There are no experts who think that 
publishing names will in any way reduce crime.  I have never 
heard anyone say “I think that victims would feel better if they 
saw the name of the 14-year old who attacked them, raped them or 
killed someone's child in big letters in the newspaper. 
I think it would do me good.  I think it would help me to get 
through all this”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ones pushing for this are the ones looking for 
sensationalism, the ones looking for easy votes on the backs of 
those dealing with these situations.  What I fail to understand 
is that the so-called Liberal government across the way has 
decided to go along with them and allow the publication of names 
for certain crimes, specific ones I admit. This is completely 
unnecessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the cost of a radical change in approach where 
young offenders are concerned.  Even the minister admits that 
the reform she is proposing in Bill C-3 will involve additional 
costs.  Even the Department of Justice is prepared to pay, since 
the government is getting tough and it looks good. How it is 
perceived by the public is more important than whether the 
public's real interests are being served. 
It is so easy to use a bill like this one for political gain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not support that.  I believe there is a better way of doing 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before introducing a new system, before introducing new 
principles, seeking new interpretations, trying to get the young 
people locked up, printing names, trying to solve the problem by 
getting it out of sight behind prison doors—when everyone agrees 
that prisons are the universities of crime—why not instead, 
keeping that in mind, say “We will free up $343 million more 
over three years for crime prevention and application”. I see 
the parliamentary secretary nodding in agreement, those are his 
department's figures.  But before the government thinks of 
putting new funding into that, it ought perhaps to think of 
paying its bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government owes the Government of Quebec the tidy 
sum of $87 million, because the Young Offenders Act is being 
enforced in Quebec and prisons are not being built as they are 
in western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The former Minister of Justice acknowledged at a 
federal-provincial conference of ministers of justice that the 
federal government owed Quebec money.  The government ought to 
give some thought to paying us.  It ought to think about writing 
us a cheque before it starts investing new money in a piece of 
legislation no one in Quebec wants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In western Canada, the harmful effects of this legislation are 
becoming more and more evident, and people are beginning to 
understand the non-repressive approach used in Quebec.  Ours is 
an approach of social rehabilitation.  We believe that we are 
helping young people by investing in them when they are having 
problems with the law. 
When they are given help, I believe that 90% or 95% of them go 
back to being regular members of society, after their release.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There are very few repeat offences when the young people have 
properly followed the mandatory plan mapped out for them, when 
they have had the proper follow-up by specialists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since my time is getting very short, I will address my remarks 
particularly to all the Quebec members of this House sitting on 
the government benches.  Where are the hon. members for Beauce, 
for Laval-Ouest, for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine, for 
Verdun—Saint-Henri, for Outremont?  Where is the former president 
of the Quebec bar association and now the member for 
Brome—Missisquoi?  Why are they not opposing this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> I must remind the hon. 
member that we do not speak of the absence or presence of 
members in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Madam Speaker, I think you perhaps 
missed this subtlety of the French language.  It means: where do 
they stand with respect to this bill and not whether they are in 
the House or not.  I know; you did not need to remind me, but I 
hope that you will give me back the few moments you took away 
from me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where do these members stand?  Why do they not rise to criticize 
this bill?  The member for Brome—Missisquoi, a member from Quebec 
and the former president of the Quebec bar association, which is 
supposed to represent its members properly, where does he stand? 
“Elect me, I will defend you, the legal community, in Ottawa”. 
I heard him say that at a forum, perhaps he should be reminded 
of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close very succinctly, by listing the persons or groups 
who have spoken out in Quebec against this bill: the Commission 
des services juridiques, the Conseil permanent de la jeunesse, 
the École de criminologie of the University of Montreal 
represented by Jean Trépanier, Aide communautaire juridique de 
Montréal, the Fondation québécoise pour les jeunes 
contrevenants.  The Institut Pinel, quoted by the parliamentary 
secretary in support of his bill, spoke out strongly against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The police chiefs' association, the Conférences des Régies 
régionales de la santé, the Association des centres jeunesse du 
Québec, the Commission des droits de la personne et des droits 
de la jeunesse, the Quebec Crown Prosecutors' Office, the 
Association des CLSC et CHLSD du Québec, l'École de 
psychoéducation de l'Université de Montréal, the Regroupement 
des organismes de justice alternative du Québec, the Ligue pour 
le bien-être de l'enfance du Canada, the Canadian Criminal 
Justice Association, the Association des avocats de la défense 
du Québec, the Société de criminologie du Québec, not to mention 
the Government of Quebec and all the judges who, through the 
messages they are sending, stress the merits of the current 
Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I move: 
<A NAME="LINK36">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That 
the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the word 
“That” and substituting the following: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Bill C-3, An Act in respect of criminal justice for young 
persons and to amend and repeal other Acts, be not now read a 
second time but that the Order be discharged, the Bill withdrawn 
and the subject-matter thereof referred to the Standing Committee 
on Justice and Human Rights.” 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government must go back to the drawing board. It must do its 
homework and consult, among others, the Government of Quebec, 
which has been asking for weeks to meet with officials from the 
Department of Justice. The Minister of Justice must also realize 
that things are done differently in Quebec, and she must come to 
her senses.

is in order. Debate is now on the proposed amendment. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
after the passionate comments of my colleague from the Bloc 
Quebecois and his reference to the demagoguery of the Reform 
Party, I am afraid my salty comments from the east coast may not 
be quite so dramatic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do think it is important that we reflect upon the nature and 
the reasons for the introduction of the new youth criminal 
justice act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was stated by a member earlier that the old Young Offenders 
Act was appropriate, that it worked well in Quebec. I concur with 
the member. I think he is right.  I think Quebec took the Young 
Offenders Act when it was introduced, applied it in the way it 
was to be applied, spent the resources in the areas where they 
needed to be spent and showed how that act could work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately other provinces did not have the resources, or 
chose not to implement the Young Offenders Act in the same way. I 
say that having had some experience with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I began my career as a lawyer just as the Young Offenders Act 
was introduced and became law.  I can say unequivocally that in 
the province where I practised it was an exercise in frustration 
to appear day after day in the courts with young people charged 
under the Young Offenders Act. It was an exercise in frustration 
for the judiciary who did not have access to the types of 
programs the Young Offenders Act envisioned.  It was an exercise 
in frustration for the crown.  It was an exercise in frustration 
for the defence counsel, to say nothing of the frustration felt 
by both the families of the young offenders and the victims of 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we approach a new piece of legislation it is important that 
we examine whether or not that legislation can correct some of 
the problems that have arisen over the last few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do note that this legislation is now Bill C-3.  It was Bill 
C-68 in the last parliament.  Perhaps the government changed the 
numbering because it always seems to have problems with bills 
numbered C-68. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The symbol of justice is the scales of justice.  They are an 
important symbol for a number of reasons.  They indicate the need 
for balance. They indicate the need to balance the rights of the 
accused against the rights of society.  They indicate the need to 
balance what goes on in the courtroom against what is perhaps 
demanded by society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Justice is not a simple matter; it is complex. Justice and crime 
affect all communities and all the people in those communities. 
Children are a responsibility.  All of society has a role in the 
upbringing and concern for our young people. When we deal with a 
bill that affects justice, crime and children, that bill requires 
careful examination by those people who represent all of the 
people in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some things in the bill which I wish to address.  I 
should point out this is the third time I have addressed this 
piece of legislation in some depth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation will continue to apply to young offenders 
between the ages of 12 and 18 years.  There was some call for the 
bill to apply to children who were 10 and 11 years old.  I say 
unequivocally that is not the position of the New Democratic 
Party.  We believe that for children who are 10 or 11 years old 
the appropriate place to deal with them when they do not follow 
the rules of society, when they appear to be misled, is through 
social services and help to the family by the community. I am 
glad to see that the Minister of Justice listened to those many 
groups who came before the justice committee, of which I am a 
member, and argued that the law not apply to 10 and 11 year old 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be interesting to contrast that with the children's 
agenda in the Speech from the Throne which we heard two weeks ago 
the focus of which was on children. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1245"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To somehow say that 10 and 11 year old children have the 
capacity to distinguish between right and wrong in the way that 
we demand of those who are charged with criminal offences is a 
stretch.  The Minister of Justice listened to those groups and I 
can say that we concur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an emphasis on prevention and alternatives to jail for 
non-violent offenders.  They are found at clauses 4 and 5 of the 
proposed legislation.  Those too are appropriate issues for the 
minister to introduce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know, and again I can give some evidence of my own, that in 
many cases what happened with the old Young Offenders Act is that 
there was an absence of discretion, that police officers, school 
teachers and people who routinely came in contact with young 
people ended up referring matters to the courts, even if they 
were the most simple matters where some cautioning or some 
exercise of discretion may well have dealt with the matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have seen in the courts young people coming in charged with 
damage to property because they got into an argument with a 
schoolmate over a school locker or where young people end in 
court on trespassing charges because they walked across a 
neighbour's lawn.  There is no need to clog the courts up with 
these kinds of offences when we have serious matters that have to 
go before the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We applaud the sections of the act that provide for cautioning 
by police and for the exercise of discretion by those in 
authority.  It increases the emphasis on community based 
sentencing with which we concur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some other areas that are perhaps more contentious and 
some areas that require further debate and examination.  There is 
a reverse onus in the legislation on young people between the 
ages of 14 and 17 years who are charged with serious violent 
offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I say there is a reverse onus I mean for particular 
prescribed offences these young people will be tried as adults 
unless they can prove to the court that they should not be.  That 
is a fundamental change from the other Young Offenders Act where 
the burden was on the state to prove that the young person should 
be tried as an adult.  It places a reverse onus on young people 
to make the case that they should not be. It is a heavy and 
onerous burden. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about resources to the provinces one thing we have 
to think about is that the young person is also given the right 
to counsel in the legislation.  That is appropriate.  It is very 
difficult for an adult lay person to argue a reverse onus without 
legal counsel, let alone a 15 year old. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to ensure that a young person has the right to counsel 
it begs the question who will pay for it.  Where is counsel to 
come from?  There is some provision in the act that when parents 
can afford to pay they will pay the legal costs of their 
children, but the statistics will tell us that there is a huge 
portion of young people who come before the courts whose families 
cannot afford to pay for legal counsel, never mind the ethical 
considerations as to whether or not a non-accused person should 
be paying the costs of counsel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see the beginnings of what flows through the act and that is 
a downloading of costs on to the provinces.  While there is some 
contribution by the federal government toward legal aid programs 
across the country, we can see that the role of legal aid lawyers 
will increase dramatically with the legislation and its reverse 
onus, and that will be a further cost to the provinces.  We have 
to examine that very carefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, there is a provision that requires some other 
consideration, and that is special sentencing for young people 
who suffer severe psychological problems.  We have to question 
whether or not the place for people who have severe psychological 
problems is in the courts in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the criminal code there is an understanding that adults can 
be found not criminally responsible because of psychological 
problems.  That is an area I will be examining carefully on the 
justice committee.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have a problem with the publication of names of young 
offenders convicted of serious offences unless a judge determines 
otherwise.  The public has called for and demanded that in some 
situations the names of young offenders be published so the 
community and other young people will know if there is a serious 
offender among them.  My party and I concur with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Reform Party objected to the minister's comments 
when she said “in certain circumstances”.  The act provides for 
some judicial discretion in that regard.  I comment on that 
because it has been said that there ought not to be that 
discretion, that these are loopholes.  I think that is how they 
were referred to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reality we have to provide some discretion to the courts.  We 
cannot foresee each case that will come before a court.  That is 
why we have judges.  If it were easy to say that every person 
charged with this crime will face this penalty, we would not need 
the judiciary.  We would have a clerk who could tick off the list 
and say what is the absolute penalty for someone charged and 
found guilty of violating a certain section of the criminal code, 
and nothing else would have to be taken into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sentencing process is a complicated process because no two 
offenders are the same.  Nor are two victims.  Nor is the impact 
of a crime the same on every person.  Within parameters the court 
needs some discretion on how it deals with offenders, especially 
young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the publication of names each case will require 
certain thoughts, which may well be best left to the judge who 
hears the case.  That is why the discretion is there and why we 
would consider it important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some concerns about the sections of the act that change 
the rules governing confessions of young persons and the 
admissibility of those confessions in the courtroom.  I say that 
only because young people are not as sophisticated in many ways 
as adults.  They do not understand their rights in the many ways 
adults do.  We must be somewhat careful when we make a 
determination of a confession given to a person in authority. The 
way it worked under the old act was that any statement to a 
person in authority, whether or not a police officer, had to be 
examined very carefully by the court.  We will examine that very 
carefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I began by talking about the right to counsel of the young 
person and the downloading of that cost on to the provinces.  I 
am afraid that many of the positive aspects of the legislation, 
and there are some, will simply not be affordable for the 
provinces.  I am afraid we will make the same mistake with this 
legislation that we made when the Young Offenders Act was 
introduced.  We said that there were all kinds of principles. The 
government said that there were ways to deal with young people, 
but the provinces did not have the resources to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This act provides even more methods of dealing with young 
people.  I have mentioned police discretion and community 
sentencing are good ideas but they cost money.  Let us be frank. 
To have special sentencing provisions for young people who suffer 
from psychological problems will cost money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately many people do not realize that the cost of the 
administration of justice falls to the provinces.  For a province 
like Nova Scotia, which faces a huge deficit and has just 
cancelled programs for charities, it is questionable whether or 
not it will have the funds to prepare for some of the positive 
aspects of the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice and the government will say that they 
have committed funding to help the provinces, that they have 
committed $206 million.  What they do not say is that it is over 
a number of years.  It is not in one year that $206 million will 
be given. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1255"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT27"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT27"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1255

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no clear indication of how that funding will be 
distributed across the country.  I have made this statement 
before. The last time I spoke to the legislation I indicated my 
concern was that the $206 million committed by the government 
were not enough, especially if we looked at it on a per capita 
basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the money is to be distributed to the provinces on a per 
capita basis, it will mean very insignificant funds for provinces 
with smaller populations and there will not be enough funds that 
are necessary to fulfil the purposes of the act.  That would 
represent perhaps $2 million in Nova Scotia.  For that province 
with its debt load to administer what the federal government is 
asking it to administer will simply not be possible.   Again we 
will have an act that will frustrate the victims, the judiciary, 
the families of young offenders and counsel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party and I have some concerns about other aspects of the 
act.  I will indicate to the House some of the statistics.  Right 
now provinces are paying upward of 70% of the costs of 
administering the youth justice system.  As we implement a more 
complex system with wider parameters those costs will escalate 
and the provinces will have a very heavy burden in trying to 
fulfil their responsibilities under the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other areas that cause us some concern.  Life 
sentences for youth convicted in adult court give me some 
concern.  I know I differ from my colleagues in the Reform Party 
on this point, but we have to wonder whether or not sentencing 
young people to a full life sentence will ever serve to 
rehabilitate them.  My colleague from the Bloc Quebecois said 
that the prisons are our training schools for further crime.  We 
know that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support measures to increase the emphasis on youth in 
community based diversions and alternatives and the increased 
focus on rehabilitation.  There are not as many details as we 
would like to see in the act and I am concerned about the costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been said that it is not the role of the justice system 
to deal with social problems.  When we deal with young people in 
particular we cannot divorce the two.  It is no accident that 
there are huge numbers of young people who come before the courts 
from families in poverty.  It is no accident when we look at 
jails, especially those south of the border, that they are full 
of people from poor sections of the United States, especially 
minority groups.  It is no accident that our prison populations 
have a greater proportion of aboriginal people who come from poor 
reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot address the problems of dealing with crime unless we 
can also deal with what causes crime.  The prevention of crime 
should be our ultimate goal.  Clearly, when someone breaks the 
law and commits a heinous crime, it has to be dealt with swiftly, 
in a meaningful way as stated in the act and in some cases 
severely.  However we cannot say there is no room for social 
issues in justice issues.  The two are so inextricably linked 
that it is almost impossible to talk about one and not the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to recognize the groups such as the Church Council on 
Justice and the Canadian Association of Police Chiefs that 
appeared before the justice committee.  They have been mentioned 
in the Quebec context by my colleague from the Bloc.  All of them 
had recommendations.  They had my word, and I think the word of 
members of the justice committee, that we would take into account 
their concerns when we examined the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to say that the provinces addressed concerns to the 
Minister of Justice which have not been addressed. 
We will now have an opportunity to see how Manitoba responds to 
this with its new government, which has expressed concerns about 
youth gangs, about young people 10 and 11 who were coerced into 
crime and how we could best deal with them.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the fact that my time is at an end, those are just some of 
the concerns we have.  I can indicate at this point, given the 
costs associated with the program and the inability to implement 
it because of funding, that we have serious questions about 
supporting the legislation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I have 
listened to what my colleague from the NDP has said with regard 
to this bill and I always appreciate his comments.  I sat on the 
justice committee with him for a short time and I was always 
impressed with his clarity of thought, although at times we 
differ from a political point of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He touched upon the fact that we cannot separate the role of the 
justice system from dysfunctional families and the problems in 
society that lead to youth crime.  I would like to ask the hon. 
member this question.  If poverty contributes to youth crime, 
inasmuch as we have seen, according to the statistics, that there 
has been a dramatic increase in youth poverty since the Liberal 
government took over in 1993, does he suggest that the policies 
of the government have contributed to the extent to which youth 
crime has either grown or remained constant during this period of 
time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  Madam Speaker, I would be happy to 
respond to the question.  As indicated by the hon. member for 
Crowfoot, we did work together on the justice committee.  In 
fact, I remember us having a debate, I think at the University of 
Ottawa, on the proposed legislation.  I think it is helpful to 
always hear two sides of the argument.  When I talk about a 
balanced approach, I like to think that sometimes we manage to 
find that ground. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He raises an important question.  We know that the economic 
policies implemented by the government have resulted in more 
children and more families in this country living in poverty than 
was the situation when the government took office.  We know that 
despite a pledge to eradicate child poverty by the year 2000, in 
fact the gap between the haves and the have nots has increased. 
When I talk about poverty and community, I mean more than simply 
ensuring that all children have the same material goods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk about what is happening in my part of the 
country, which I think is happening in other parts of the country 
as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at children and children who are at risk of 
committing crime, the most important thing we can do is to make 
sure that they have a sense of community and community values. 
If children belong to a community, then they respect that 
community. Children need to have a sense of place, a sense of 
connectedness to place and they need to have a sense of history. 
We know that in the maritimes and I think other communities know 
it as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Children in my community know who their grandfather and their 
great grandfather was and they have an extended family.  While 
they may not have all the material things that are necessary, 
they have that sense of value from the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are creating a nation of migrant workers.  That is what the 
economic policies have done.  People from the east have to move 
to the west and people from the north have to move to the south 
and leave behind their values, their communities and their sense 
of place.  As that happens children are affected.  It is serious 
when that happens to children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two kinds of poverty.  There is the poverty that 
happens to a child when they are deprived of their community and 
their community values.  When we say to people in certain parts 
of the country which are not in the centre “Too bad about your 
economic problems.  Move.”, we do something to those children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also the material things.  There are children who live 
without adequate shelter.  We know that homelessness is 
increasing in this country. 
There are children who live without adequate food.  I commend my 
colleague, the member for Crowfoot, who introduced a motion 
concerning headstart programs to make sure that children in this 
country have breakfast before they go to school.

needs and requirements of those children?

Madam Speaker, I am the next speaker, so I will ask a brief 
question.  I would address it to my colleague and fellow Nova 
Scotian.  I have listened very closely to his remarks.  As well, 
the intervention by my friend, the member for Crowfoot, was very 
timely and well placed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I embrace much of what the hon. member said when he spoke of the 
feeling of disconnected children in the country, in particular in 
places that he is familiar with, the maritimes, where there is a 
transitional way of life that often leads families to move 
elsewhere, to uproot from their communities, perhaps in the hope 
of returning some day.  This often leaves children drifting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know as well that the commentary with respect to the economic 
impact on those who get involved in criminal activity is very 
real. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No matter how far-reaching and how interventionist the 
legislation may be, without the proper funding it is not going to 
achieve the desired effect.  Throughout the commentary on the 
bill, both in the House and later at committee, I think we will 
see that the emphasis and the philosophy is perhaps correct, to 
put it on the front end and to try to address the root causes and 
intervene in an early fashion, as opposed to waiting until a 
crime has been committed.  However, without the resources it is 
going to be virtually impossible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend touched on this in some detail in his speech.  I am 
wondering if he could elaborate on where those resources should 
be placed specifically, as well as the programming that is 
envisioned by the bill, the programming that talks of getting 
children involved in sports programs, for example, locating 
difficulties with respect to education, perhaps diagnosing 
psychological illnesses, perhaps even going to the drastic step 
of removing a child from a home, which child welfare has the 
authority to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It appears to me that this legislation, as well intended as it 
may be, is simply going to further download the responsibilities 
that are already being carried by the existing agencies.  It is 
going to put further pressure on these agencies, which are 
currently underfunded.  We know, and the hon. member touched on 
it, that the legislation does not carry with it sufficient 
financial backing to accomplish all of these wonderful goals and 
these airy principles that are to be accomplished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would my hon. friend comment on that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  Madam Speaker, I will be as brief in 
my response as my colleague was in his question, because I know 
he is speaking next and I am always anxious to hear what he has 
to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give an illustration as to where the funding might be 
placed.  Community group after community group has come to see me 
in my office with ideas on how to deal with the issues of youth 
crime.  These are grassroots communities.  These are people who 
come together and say “We know there is a bit of a problem and 
we want to deal with it”.  They have put forward all kinds of 
plans, some of which I have given to the minister of justice, 
dealing with youth centres. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the best examples that is tragically falling short of 
funding in my community is having a police officer in the junior 
high school; community based policing where young people have a 
role model who is an officer of the law, who can help them work 
out problems, who can relate to them on a day to day basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This program has operated in a junior high in my community, 
Sherwood Park Education Centre, and it has been an excellent 
program.  Unfortunately, as money dries up there are real 
questions as to whether that can continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those would be some of the programs which I think would help at 
the community level to deter crime.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am extremely pleased to rise to speak to Bill 
C-3.  I am pleased as well that the reconvening of parliament and 
the gathering of members of parliament back to this place will 
allow us to continue the debate of the Liberal government's youth 
criminal justice act, now known as Bill C-3, formerly Bill C-68, 
which was another poorly put together bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed replacement of the current Young Offenders Act is 
one which has received a great deal of attention, and rightly so, 
and a great deal of consternation throughout the country.  It 
will be an entirely new piece of legislation that pertains 
specifically to youth in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Youth justice is certainly a matter of great concern for all 
Canadians, for the Progressive Conservative Party, the government 
and all opposition parties.  In my riding of 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough I hear regularly from people who 
are affected and who are extremely concerned about the direction 
in which youth criminal justice is going in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also find that the concern that is expressed very often by the 
government has resulted in an extremely lengthy waiting period 
with respect to the introduction of this legislation.  We know 
that it was throughout many election campaigns a priority that 
was spelled out in documents.  However, it took the government 18 
months before first introducing this bill in its original form, 
Bill C-68.  With much fanfare, in March 1999 the bill was finally 
tabled by the minister of justice.  We also know, as is very 
often the practice, that much of it had been media tested and 
leaked prior to its introduction here in the House, or I should 
say its introduction through the press gallery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then, on the eve of parliament reconvening this fall, there was 
a prorogation.  This delayed the opening of the House by three 
weeks and we know that there were huge issues burning in the 
country at the time:  the proposed hostile takeover, the 
fisheries crisis that is absolutely a tinderbox which is about to 
explode on the east coast, as well as the refugee crisis.  We 
also know that there are problems within our justice system.  It 
is absolutely shameful that the government again chose to delay 
dealing with problems which I have mentioned, as well as the 
introduction of this very necessary legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One would have thought that throughout the summer months of 
reflection this might have prompted the minister of justice to 
strengthen or perhaps revise some of the act.  This did not 
happen.  There are no sweeping changes in the legislation that 
appears before us.  Bill C-3 is the mirror image of Bill C-68, 
but for the fact that the justice department did, in fairness, go 
through the problem of spell-check to correct some of the 
language so that at least the French and English languages 
correspond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have waited an eternity for Bill C-3, but it is, we are quick 
to acknowledge in the Conservative Party, an attempt to replace 
what was a very ineffective and in many instances a very 
dangerous piece of legislation.  I am talking about the former 
Young Offenders Act.  However, this particular bill, I personally 
feel, will not live up to much of the billing that has been 
placed before the Canadian public.  In response to overwhelming 
public pressure to toughen up the act the Liberal government has 
employed a process of smoke and mirrors to give the appearance 
that this is in fact what is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say with all honesty that this is not the case.  That is not 
to say that simply toughening up the act is going to address the 
problems that exist with youth crime in this country.  That is 
not to say that there are not any positive elements in this bill. 
In fairness, all opposition members and government members who 
have preceded me in speaking in this debate have indicated that 
there are indeed some very positive elements in Bill C-3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are not new nuances.  These are not changes that have not 
been contemplated in the past.  In fact I find it almost ironic 
that much of what we are talking about in this debate is actually 
a return to philosophies and methodologies in the criminal 
justice system that we have used in the past under previous 
legislation such as the juvenile offenders act, legislation which 
has come full circle now in terms of how we react to young 
persons who become involved in criminal activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is certainly one very positive element of this bill that I 
would be quick to recognize and that is the concept of parental 
responsibility.  This bill attempts to bring adults, and parents 
specifically, more into the system. 
One can agree very quickly that this is a necessary element. 
There has to be a more holistic approach, a family style 
approach, to the problems that often lead up to and continue to 
exist when a young person runs afoul of the law.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This degree of accountability, not only for the young person but 
for the parent, is crucial in addressing youth crime.  It is a 
fair question, I suggest, for a judge to ask a parent in a 
courtroom in an open fashion, “Where were you when your 14 year 
old was breaking into your neighbour's house?  Why was your child 
out on a school night under the influence of alcohol or drugs 
committing a criminal offence?  Why is your child acting out in 
such a violent way?” These are relevant questions, and questions 
that I feel a parent should be held to account for as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The entire issue of the age of accountability is something that 
is dodged by this particular piece of legislation. I am quick to 
point out that it is a suggestion that has been certainly echoed 
by members of the opposition, but it originated in a report that 
was commissioned by the government itself.  This was an idea that 
was not just floated by opposition members and it is not just an 
attempt I suggest to try to find fault with the act. This was a 
recommendation by an expert under the financial auspices of the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It raises the hackles on the necks of government members when 
they hear the suggestion, and they point out that we already have 
many agencies in place to address youth under the age of 12 who 
are not encompassed by the old act or the new act, that these 
agencies are the ones most properly suited to deal with youth in 
contravention of the law.  However, I am very quick to remind the 
government and the House that the legislation does not bolster 
the support that is needed in the areas of child welfare and 
early intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are an increasing number of youth under the age of 12 who 
are completely untouched by our criminal justice system. It is 
the rapid response, I would suggest, that is most important in 
dealing with crime at an early age, and allowing our criminal 
justice system to react.  This is not a bar on placing children 
into those agencies.  We already know that our justice system 
works very much hand in glove with those social services, with 
those agencies.  This is not to suggest for a minute that the 
criminal justice system will be solely responsible for children 
under the age of 12 who run afoul of the law.  It is simply to 
suggest that we have to have a mechanism that will bring them 
into the system in a quick and effective way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Police officers are often faced with an extremely frustrating 
situation where an 11 or sometimes even a 10 year old—and it 
seems unthinkable but it does happen on occasion—is involved in 
a very serious offence perhaps involving a weapon, perhaps 
involving threats or a violent act.  Under the current system and 
under the system that the new legislation will put in place, 
police officers are virtually powerless.  They can contact the 
agencies, but they do not have at their discretion the same 
elements that would exist under the criminal law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one of the many reasons that I have introduced a private 
member's bill that would do just that.  I know other members of 
the House have some reservations about this, but it is not solely 
to hammer youth under the age of 12.  It is simply to widen the 
net, to broaden what the act encompasses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there are positive elements, and there certainly are positive 
elements in the act, why would we not want to have those early 
interventions, those elements that will hopefully focus our 
attention on the root problems of crime, applied to a broader age 
group of young people in the country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other sections of the act that I would like to address 
as well.  Bill C-3 certainly does not address the financial 
responsibilities that are also encompassed by the administration 
of criminal law in the country, and that is true of the old act. 
It has been declining since 1984.  It has been getting steadily 
worse when it comes to the federal government's commitment to the 
provinces and the administration of criminal law in the country. 
I am not going to broaden that by discussing criminal law 
generally, but with respect to the administration of the Young 
Offenders Act, the federal government has completely abrogated 
its responsibility in holding up its financial end of the deal. 
That is true in the province of Quebec, Nova Scotia and right 
across the country.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is something I know the province of Quebec, in many 
instances, has focused its attention on.  It has in fact 
initiated more programs and put more provincial funding into it, 
perhaps at the expense of other programming, because it 
recognizes the importance of it.  The province of Quebec is 
perhaps a leader in many of the areas of programming that the 
government envisions will be brought about as a result of changes 
in the act. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 gives the provinces increased responsibilities; they 
will have to offer with more programs and become more involved 
in the administration of this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For now, there is no new funding in sight from the federal 
government.  A number of experts, including the government's, 
agree that the age of accountability should be lowered from 12 
to 10.  This is not designed to punish young people, but to make 
them accountable to the justice system. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Intervention at the earliest possible juncture is the most 
effective way to get youth back on track before its too late. The 
government says that it will do this with the new bill and, to an 
extent, it does focus its attention on that area of the law. 
Clause 34, for example, is the medical and psychological report 
clause to determine if a youth is in fact suffering from some 
affliction or disorders that need to be treated and not 
necessarily punished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a new concept.  It is certainly one that the 
Conservative Party, others in the House and those in the criminal 
justice system are quick to embrace and recognize.  However, we 
do know that there is a lack of federal commitment to provincial 
rehabilitative programs and to mental health counselling.  This 
commitment is what are needed.  This is where the focus has to 
be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the act does, in simple terms, is to identify the problem 
as a priority and drop it in the provinces' lap and walk away. 
That is simply not good enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young females in conflict with the law is a rising problem in 
the country.  There was a very serious case that drew a great 
deal of attention across the country involving a young woman 
named Reena Virk in the province of British Columbia. This again 
is something that is highlighted across the country. Young women 
are becoming more increasingly involved in the criminal justice 
system as a result of many of the other social problems that 
exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is again why I hearken back to earlier comments.  If the 
government, through this legislation and this initiative, wants 
to focus its attention on the front end problem and on bringing 
about change that will assist young people to stay out of 
difficulty with the law, the preventative side of justice, the 
restorative justice side which is at the end but which puts 
greater emphasis on personal interaction with victims and those 
who can truly assist, identify and perhaps cure or treat some of 
the problems that led to the difficulty in the first place, that 
is fine.  Philosophically, members of the House would agree that 
that it is the right approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the government is not putting in place the resources 
that are necessary.  It has identified what it wants to do.  It 
has made a great deal of fanfare and drawn a great deal of 
attention to itself as having brought this bold new initiative 
about, yet it is not prepared to pony up and pay for the 
programming that is going to be necessary.  It has increased the 
responsibilities and the burden that is going to be carried by 
the provinces, the agencies, the police and the judicial system 
for those programs that are specifically aimed at addressing the 
problem.  It has walked away because there is not one dollar more 
that is going to go into this program as a result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty itself is a very complex one.  Sometimes in this 
place we suffer from oversimplification in telling people what 
they want to hear.  This is not a problem that is going to go 
away quickly. 
As with previous legislation aimed at the criminal justice 
system, I would suggest that there is going to be a lag time. The 
true effects of the legislation may take years to actually 
develop in the country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the complexity and diversity of the country, it may 
have a different affect in some provinces.  I am focusing 
specifically on the ability of the provinces themselves to 
administer the act because we know there is a huge discrepancy in 
the country currently as to the financial ability of the 
provinces to provide services to their people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It only stands to reason that if we increase the provinces' 
responsibility without increasing the proportionate resources 
then it will be exacerbated further.  The differences that 
currently exist means that the have not provinces will be further 
burdened and will fall further behind.  This is truly a very 
broad sweeping problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The focus in the Chamber is most often between the province of 
Quebec and the provinces in English-speaking Canada. I come from 
a region in Atlantic Canada where we are suffering grave 
differences between our ability to provide for our people through 
social services, through criminal justice and through employment 
than the rest of the country.  This will be played out through 
this legislation as it is with all legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians expected more and they were led to believe that they 
would get more through the legislation.  They were led to believe 
that there would be a tougher response in certain instances for 
youth involved in violent acts, acts involving the use of weapons 
or sexual violation.  That is not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The transfer provisions that were touched on by many of the 
previous speakers are a bit of a ruse in a way.  They give the 
impression that we are taking a young person into the adult court 
system. This may cause many people to shudder and think, “Oh, my 
goodness, we are bringing a 14 year old or 15 year old into an 
adult court where he or she will be treated in a much harsher 
way”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that in many instances the sentences that are 
handed down at the end of the day are actually less in terms of 
the time that the person would be incarcerated as a young 
offender because—and I hate to use this expression because it is 
somewhat of a misnomer—but truth in sentencing existed under the 
old Young Offenders Act.  That is to say that if young persons 
were sentenced to 18 months they would serve every day.  They 
would remain in a young offender facility for that full period of 
incarceration.  We know that is not the case in the adult system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not to say for a moment that incarceration is always the 
way.  We know that the programming that is often available is not 
sufficient.  We also know that simply removing a person from 
society will not fix them.  It is often the last resort brought 
about to protect society when necessary from a person who has 
exhibited violent, anti-social behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concept of simply bringing a person into adult court and 
saying that it will fix the problem because he or she will be 
treated in a harsher fashion is not necessarily the truth of what 
has happened.  I believe it is incumbent on the government to be 
very up front about what the system change will really amount to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The programming that is available in a youth facility is often 
the more appropriate one.  Often times bringing them into adult 
court exposes them to this atmosphere that has been discussed, 
which is that they will learn more sophisticated ways to commit 
crimes.  They may be further victimized in an adult facility. 
There is an extremely dangerous element to this quick fix type 
solution that is being proposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been stated many times, there are elements where this 
particular legislation has moved in the right direction.  I, like 
all members of the justice committee and of the House, look 
forward to participating at the committee level and to the 
changes that may be brought about through that level of 
participation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the participants who have taken part in the 
debate, as well as those who participated at the committee with 
their testimony.  I look forward to further following the 
legislation as it moves through this place.

listened very carefully to what the hon. member had to say and I 
note that he at least admits that we do things differently in 
Quebec and even that it is a model the government should follow, 
and that Quebec is a leader in this field.

want it either.  According to some retired judges, if the law

disastrous for the 16 year investment, in Quebec, in an 
approach, a very Quebec model. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I provided a list earlier of all those who are opposed, and I 
think that anyone involved to whatever extent in applying the 
Young Offenders Act would repeat it before a parliamentary

minister's bill, or this amendment.

to the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The simple answer is no.  I certainly would not support, and I 
know members of the Progressive Conservative Party would not 
advocate, a system of justice that was different in one province 
as compared to the other provinces in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very quick to recognize the fact that the province of 
Quebec has very much been a leader in the administration of 
justice and the administration of many of these innovative 
programs, restorative justice model programs that are most 
effective when dealing with youth.  Why should we and the rest of 
the country not celebrate that and embrace some of those 
initiatives that have been taken by the province of Quebec? We 
draw a great deal from Quebec in all sorts of areas as do they 
from the rest of Canada.  It is part of the great partnership 
that we enjoy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would not in any way envision why the province of Quebec would 
want to opt out of this legislation.  I do recognize that there 
are many elements of the justice system in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was part of the committee which heard from many witnesses.  I 
know there are groups within the system that do not want to see 
all of the changes that are encompassed by this bill.  But there 
are very positive and practical elements that I think even the 
member would admit are necessary.  Changes with respect to the 
admissibility of statements.  Changes with respect to the 
inclusion of parents in the process. Changes that in some 
instances are going to require greater attention and a shift of 
focus from the current way things are done in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec is a very adaptable province.  I am sure Quebec is going 
to see that there are positive elements that it can work with.  I 
am sure all members of the House look forward to bringing some of 
those other changes forward that we would like to see happen at 
the committee.  I have every confidence that my learned friend

the years from the people of Canada.  They signalled the changes 
they wanted so strongly to the government and to the justice 
committee of which I was a member when we travelled about the 
country and listened to them.  However, this bill is couched 
almost entirely in terms of what the legislation will allow the 
courts to do.  It does not grant authority to the courts to move 
16 and 17 year olds who commit serious offences into adult court. 
It says that the trial will occur in juvenile court and then the 
crown prosecutor will have the opportunity to argue that an adult 
sentence should apply.

this country.  It is going to be left in the hands of the courts 
to decide based upon the circumstances, regardless of what the 
people want, whether or not the names of those convicted of 
violent offences will be published. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the member, being a former crown prosecutor and I 
understand a good one, would be prepared to comment on this 
aspect of the bill.  Is it not leaning to greater complaints, 
whether right or wrong, of judicial activism?  The courts are 
going to be left with having to make a decision that the 
legislators, in this case the Liberal government, have refused to 
make and implant within the legislation. Rather than the 
legislators telling the courts what we want done on behalf of 
Canadians, again we are going to leave it in the hands of the 
judges of this land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would my hon. friend be willing to comment on this aspect of the 
bill in light of the criticism some of the courts are receiving 
concerning judicial activism? This is simply because legislation 
is being passed by the government, legislation that is so open 
ended that the judges can go in a number of different ways.  In 
this case it is contrary to what we have heard Canadians say they 
want done about the Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Madam Speaker, I will try to address 
the points made by my colleague from Crowfoot who was a valued 
member of the justice committee.  I know he has tremendous 
practical experience having worked as a police officer within the 
justice system for many years.  I will not comment as to my own 
abilities as a crown prosecutor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will try to address the issue with respect to transfers.  I 
personally took part in a number of transfers from youth to adult 
court under the old system.  They were extremely cumbersome, 
perhaps even more so than a trial itself.  At the end of the day, 
one was left to wonder whether one could even call upon the 
victims who were often forced to testify two, three and four 
times as a result of those old provisions. I welcome this change 
in terms of having one trial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I take issue, as the hon. member has pointed out, with 
the decision being made at the very end of the trial after it has 
taken place in youth court, which is often subject to different 
rules of admissibility, and with whether this is actually the 
proper focus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question addressed to me is more specifically aimed at 
judicial activism.  This perhaps should form the focus of an 
entire debate.  It is not something we can deal with very quickly 
in this context.  I agree we have to empower judges, but with 
legislation such as this we sometimes have to put parameters in 
place.  The way to do that in some instances is to have 
definitions of certain crimes that require mandatory minimum 
sentences.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to enter the debate on Bill C-3, the youth 
criminal justice act.  At the very outset, I want to indicate 
that it is a very important piece of legislation.  It underscores 
the commitment of the Government of Canada to deal with a very 
complex issue as it relates to youth justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the former chairman of the Waterloo Regional Police, I sat on 
that board for 10 years.  I can tell the House firsthand that the 
senior officer and rank and file levels, along with all members 
of the police service, worked diligently in this area to ensure 
that we had a justice system in place, especially as it related 
to our young people.  With 700 police officers and civilians, we 
were cognizant of the fact that this was an important area and 
one that required the kind of attention the Government of Canada 
is now prepared to move on. From that sense I am very pleased to 
see this legislation proceed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By quick way of review, I remind all members of the House that 
our government launched a strategy for the renewal of youth 
justice on May 12, 1998.  This process has been going on for 
quite a while.  Subsequent to that, the youth criminal justice 
act was introduced.  Then the federal budget announced $206 
million over three years to ensure that programs were put in 
place to help achieve the objectives of this legislation.  The 
point in indicating that is to say that now is the time to move 
on with this, get it to committee and let Canadians have their 
say with respect to this area.  I am pleased that we are moving 
in that direction and doing so expeditiously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's strategy for the renewal of youth justice 
recognized the foremost objective of public protection.  It 
distinguishes legislation and programs appropriate for the small 
group of violent young offenders and those appropriate for the 
vast majority of non-violent youth offenders.  It takes a much 
broader and more integrated approach that emphasizes prevention 
and rehabilitation.  That is very key to this whole debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue facing those of us who are interested in the youth 
justice system is not whether the system should be tough or 
lenient, but whether it should be made to deal with crime in a 
sensible way.  The proposals as outlined indicate clearly that 
youth crime should be met with meaningful consequences.  What is 
meaningful depends in large part on what the young offender has 
done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, most of us believe that youths who commit minor 
thefts or have been in possession of stolen property should be 
held accountable for their actions and rightfully so.  However, 
last year we sent 4,355 youths into custody when their most 
serious offence was one of the minor property offences.  Another 
4,332 youths were put in custody for the offence of failure to 
comply with a disposition, typically violating a term of a 
probation order. These are both offences.  Those who are found to 
have committed these offences should be held accountable and we 
know that. These two groups of offences constituted over 
one-third of the custodial sentences handed down to youth last 
year.  That quite frankly is unacceptable.  Being the lead jailer 
of children in the western world is surely not the preferred 
answer to youth crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The median custodial sentence for youth is 45 days.  As 
taxpayers this will cost us as much as $9,000.  No one is saying 
that these youth should not be held accountable for their 
actions.  They should be and they must be.  Their offences should 
result in meaningful consequences, but we must ask ourselves 
whether taking these youths to court and sending them to prison 
is invariably the best way to accomplish this.  We need to ask 
ourselves whether it makes sense to spend $9,000 locking up a 
minor thief or someone who has violated a curfew. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The choice is not one of doing nothing or putting a young person 
in prison.  There are programs in all parts of Canada, including 
my area, for holding young people accountable for what they have 
done that do not involve courts or jails but involve the victims. 
The youth criminal justice act recognizes that extrajudicial 
non-court measures are often the most effective way to deal with 
less serious youth crime. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1345"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT37"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT37"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1345

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act supports the use of such measures wherever and whenever 
possible that would be capable of holding the young person 
accountable.  The act clearly provides that these measures should 
encourage the repair of harm caused to the victim and to the 
community.  They should also promote the involvement of families, 
victims and the community in ensuring an appropriate, meaningful 
consequence for the young person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to encourage the use of creative and effective 
consequences for young people, the act supports the appropriate 
exercise of discretion by police officers and prosecutors.  The 
act also recognizes that a range of approaches can provide 
meaningful consequences, including police warnings, formal police 
cautions, referrals to community programs, cautions by 
prosecutors and extra judicial sanctions, for example apologies 
to victims, restitution and community service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the formal court process is required many sentences other 
than custody can provide meaningful consequences for youth crime. 
Community based alternatives, for example, are often more 
effective than custody.  They are encouraged by the new 
legislation, particularly for low risk, non-violent offenders, 
alternatives that require young people to repay victims in 
society for the harm done, teach responsibility and respect for 
others and reinforce societal values, Canadian values.  When 
these front end measures and non-custodial sentences are used 
effectively the provinces can reinvest the money saved into crime 
prevention strategies that will address the legitimate concerns 
of Canadians about crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of its strategy for the renewal of youth justice the 
federal government has committed itself to a wide range of 
prevention programs.  In this context it was not surprising to 
learn that public opinion polls show that over 85% of Ontario 
residents would prefer money to be invested in crime prevention 
than in additional prisons for youth.  Almost as many, 79%, would 
prefer us to invest in alternatives to prison for youth rather 
than prison construction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other side of the coin is that by dealing sensibly with 
minor crime we can refocus the system on serious crime that 
Canadians have legitimate concerns about.  The new act's 
sentencing principles make it very clear that youth sentences 
should reflect the seriousness of the offence and the degree of 
responsibility of the young person.  Custody, then, will be 
targeted to youth that commit violent and serious repeat 
offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the new legislation judges will be required to impose a 
period of supervision in the community following custody that is 
equal to half the period of that custody.  This will allow 
authorities to closely monitor and control the young person and 
to ensure that he or she receives the necessary treatment and 
programs to return successfully to the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The period of supervision administered by the provinces will 
include stringent mandatory and optional conditions tailored to 
the individual.  If a youth sentence, for example, would not be 
adequate to hold a young person accountable, the court may impose 
an adult sentence.  The new legislation would make it easier to 
impose adult sentences for the most serious violent crimes.  We 
are expanding both the list of offences and lowering the age at 
which youth can receive an adult sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the legislation is passed, youth 14 years of age and older 
who are convicted of murder, attempted murder, manslaughter or 
aggravated sexual assault will receive an adult sentence unless a 
judge can be persuaded otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also creating a fifth presumptive category for repeat of 
violent offences.  This too underscores a commitment of the 
Government of Canada to move in this area and do it in an 
appropriate Canadian kind of way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed legislation also provides for a new sentencing 
option for the most violent, high risk young offenders.  The 
intensive rehabilitative custody and supervision order provides 
greater control and guaranteed treatment to address the causes of 
the young person's violent behaviour.  This is a kind of 
individualized treatment of intensive supervision which must be 
approved by the court and will assist us in curtailing youth 
crime in these areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to conclude by saying that youth crime cannot be 
legislated away.  I think we all know and understand that.  We 
can, however, deal more appropriately with it than we do at the 
moment.  We can set up an effective set of programs outside the 
youth justice system and custodial and non-custodial 
rehabilitation programs within it which would reduce crime and 
hopefully will.

effective way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me simply conclude by saying that certainly the residents in 
my area of Waterloo—Wellington, and I believe those across 
Canada, support our balanced approach to this very complex issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now is the time to act.  Let us move the bill on to committee. 
Let us have Canadians have their say with respect to this area. 
Let us do so expeditiously.  With great foresight we have brought 
forward legislation in the best interest of all Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK44"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I congratulate the hon. member for 
Waterloo—Wellington on his remarks and his contribution to the 
debate.  As a former police officer he speaks from a very 
practical viewpoint, which is extremely important when dealing 
with matters of criminal justice.  He also brings a very 
non-partisan tone to the debate, which I applaud.  It is 
something that we need more of on matters of criminal justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for him is with respect to the elements of the bill 
that would put greater power into the hands of the police to 
exercise discretion in the field, that is for them to make 
judgment calls on whether this is a matter which should proceed 
through the criminal justice system.  The police are put in the 
often unenviable position of making that first call, making the 
decision on whether it is something for which they lay a criminal 
charge, lay an information, or perhaps proceed to a crown 
prosecutor for greater advice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member agree that increased discretion also 
carries with it obvious increased time, increased resources and 
increased necessity of the police to spend time doing something 
that perhaps they traditionally have not been entrusted with? 
Does he believe therefore that the requests of the Canadian 
Police Association, many of the stakeholders and many of the 
provinces in calling for greater resources to be attached to the 
bill are on the right track and that his government will have to 
respond by laying down more dollars? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
opposite for the very good question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those of us who are working with community based policing know 
full well the importance of getting out into the community, 
especially with respect to young people, to ensure that we deal 
with them in an effective and meaningful way.  We have done it in 
the past and we continue to do so.  It underscores the commitment 
of not only the police but also the wider community to do the 
right thing when it comes to young people wherever they live in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to resources and the kind of commitment that are 
necessary to deal with young people, the hon. member makes a very 
good point in terms of the local police agencies having the kind 
of resources necessary to do the job effectively and well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we give the kind of discretion that is being proposed it 
requires additional work, but I have to tell the hon. member that 
the policing profession is very professional.  It carries out its 
duties with a great sense of loyalty and dedication, knowing that 
it must do the right thing, especially for young people.  The 
kinds of training programs that are put in place underscore that 
kind of commitment to professionalism and dedication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced that with the proper and necessary resources the 
police will act in the appropriate way.  They really are unsung 
heroes.  They put their lives on the line daily for all of us. 
We need to congratulate them repeatedly for the kind of work that 
they do, especially in the all important youth area.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened to the government member's speech and we agree on one 
thing: when it comes to the Young Offenders Act, Liberal, 
Conservative and Reform members all see problems where there are 
none. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the hon. member said in support of the bill, with his quotes 
and statistics, is that Ontario taxpayers were in favour of 
reinvesting, of the rehabilitation and reintegration of young 
offender. But this can already be done through the Young 
Offenders Act, and I am wondering if he is aware of it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the examples he gave in support of Bill C-3 are things that 
can already be done through the YOA. This is why, in Quebec, 
there is a unanimous consensus against the justice minister's 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with the YOA is not its wording, but its 
enforcement. In Ontario as in the western provinces, it is not 
being enforced. However, when it is, the re-offending rate for 
serious crimes such as murder and armed robbery is less than 5%—I 
believe it is 2%, but I do not want to mislead the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the statistics you get when you enforce the Young 
Offenders Act properly. And the fundamental changes being 
proposed here will not improve the legislation. The government 
is taking the positive aspects of the current legislation and 
adds to it such ridiculous provisions as the publication of the 
names of young offenders in the newspapers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What purpose would that serve? It would only brand them for the 
rest of their lives. One day, the 14 year old who was sent to 
prison or went through the highly repressive system we want to 
set up, will get out. And he will be what, 24 or 25 years old? 
But once he is out, what will he be able do after having been 
branded a criminal for the rest of his life? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will not in any way help the society whom we claim to be 
fighting for, whom we are trying to better protect by improving 
the legislation. 
The existing legislation does. Did the hon. member take the time 
to read the current Young Offenders Act and did he notice the 
so-called major changes the minister wants to make? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, does the hon. member realize that the only province where 
everyone agrees the legislation is enforced properly, and I am 
talking of course about the province of Quebec, has a very high 
success rate? Why change the law, when it is in the western part 
of the country that things should be changing. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member opposite 
for the question.  I have read the existing legislation and I am 
also very cognizant of the new proposed legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government launched the strategy to look into the whole 
youth justice initiative and the renewal we are now presenting we 
certainly looked at the Quebec model as a model that had a lot to 
offer in terms of what it represented for Canada and Canadians, 
wherever they are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So it is that we incorporated those kinds of facets into the new 
legislation, recognizing that we have a lot to share and a lot to 
offer.  We did so in a spirit of co-operation, knowing that for 
young people across Canada we could bring the best from all areas 
including Quebec and do so in a very positive way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly what we have done.  We have done the kinds of 
things that are necessary for our young people to put systems in 
place that benefit them and society as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  We still have a few minutes remaining.  I 
will come back to questions and comments, if members wish, after 
question period.  However I would like to go to Statements by

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, today is 
International Credit Union Day.  All of this week millions of 
Canadians are also celebrating National Co-op Week.  The theme 
for this week is “Co-operation—Shaping our Future”, 
emphasizing that the co-operative model is a potent economic 
force in the Canadian economy and a leading source of jobs, 
incomes and community stability in many regions of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the world moves toward a global economy and downsizing 
continues to claim jobs, co-operatives bring about a sense of 
equilibrium in meeting the social and economic needs of 
Canadians.  Co-operatives aim at building a strong Canada and 
offer an alternative business model. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this reason I would ask members to join with me in 
recognizing and congratulating the co-operative sector which has 
and continues to make such a large contribution to our country. 
Currently co-operatives, including caisses populaires and credit 
unions, have a membership of 15 million Canadians and have 
combined assets of over $167 billion.  Co-operatives employ over 
150,000 Canadians and over 70,000 volunteers offer their time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For co-operatives, serving the needs of members always takes 
precedence over the bottom line.  It is for that reason 
co-operatives have grown.

no interest at all to this government.  The agriculture minister

</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of these deaths and injuries could and should be prevented 
but are not because of negligence by company managers who care 
more about profits than lives.  Company managers who knowingly or 
negligently allow workers into unsafe conditions are criminals 
and should go to jail.  The New Democratic Party bill will make 
sure that they can be charged.

sad day for the individual rights of aboriginal people in Canada. 
The Nisga'a agreement fails to provide Nisga'a people with

same rights and protections enjoyed by all other Canadian women 
and puts in peril the charter rights of each and every Nisga'a

reserve and off reserve.  We want aboriginal people to have the

to the member across the way that the first thing he should do is 
read the agreement.  We purposely sent the agreement over to the 
member a number of months ago in order for him to have a chance 
to read it.  In the agreement it states specifically that it is 
under the constitution, the people are under the charter, the 
Nass Valley and the Nisga'a people themselves.  Also the member 
will notice in the agreement that aboriginal women are under 
provincial law and they will continue to be under provincial law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make one more point.  This member said in the press 
not too long ago—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister 
knows that no private property rights are created under this 
agreement.  He knows that without private property rights 
aboriginal women cannot possibly hope to enjoy the same rights 
and protections as all other Canadian women in the event of a 
marriage breakup. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the minister agree to sign on to this treaty when there 
is no provision for private property rights for Nisga'a people?

there are property rights, let me read what the member said not 
too long ago.  On Saturday, September 11, Mr. Scott said that the 
successful negotiations of recent treaties in British Columbia 
are a good indication the system is working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me make one further point.  In this agreement land is held 
in fee simple, which allows people to go to the provincial 
registry to register land, which allows individual people to 
register their land.  In fact it is not communal.  The member 
should read the agreement.

since the beginning of this case, the Minister of Canadian

somewhat prematurely, that the whole issue was an urban legend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage. Will the 
minister admit that since Friday, when she claimed not to know 
anything about this issue, she has learned, thanks to the Bloc 
Quebecois, that there are at least four cases of people whose 
names were used, that other producers might be implicated, and 
that, for the time being, this whole thing only involves

how could the minister tell us that she found out about the 
whole issue of Friday, considering that an investigation took 
place in 1997, that shocking statements were made early in the 
fall by some prominent figures from that sector, that the Quebec 
Minister of Culture decided to order an investigation through 
SODEC to shed light on this issue, and that her deputy minister

question is for the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farm families are facing the worst crisis since the great 
depression and still the government stalls.  It is not just 
farmers who are affected; it is suppliers, equipment 
manufacturers and dealers who are being forced to lay off 
workers.  Everybody is holding their breath waiting for the 
minister to respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the minister stop stalling?  When will this minister 
end the anguish and introduce a decent farm aid package? 
<P><A NAME="LINK105"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this government started to act nearly a 
year ago when we contributed $900 million before the budget was 
introduced last year.  That is being used by producers.  It will 
all be used.  It will also be added to by $600 million from the 
provinces.  We made changes to the net income stabilization 
account which made another $121 million available across Canada. 
There is still more money in the net income stabilization account 
that has been triggered by farmers as well.  I am encouraged by 
the fact that they are now using that account. 
<P><A NAME="LINK106"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we are 
talking about an adequate response.  We are talking about a 
decent response.  No one is buying the minister's line.  No one 
believes that this government has responded adequately to this 
crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many farms will go under?  How many small businesses will

<P><A NAME="LINK110"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member should read the Canada

is done so only with the authority of not only the Minister of 
Transport, but the Minister of Industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, the Minister of Industry, and I have worked on 
this file in concert from the beginning.  We continue to do so. 
The section 47 process that we brought forward on August 13 is

the restructuring of the airline industry. 
<P><A NAME="LINK111"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the minister has only one answer for every question and 
it is the wrong one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to read to the House a tribunal report dated 1993.  If 
the minister has the final say in future reports, we will never 
hear words like these.  The tribunal report states that if 
Canadian Airlines is forced to merge with Air Canada, the 
tribunal finds that competition in domestic airline markets will 
likely be substantially lessened.  It goes on to say that charter 
carriers cannot compensate for Canadian's removal.

as far as the future of air travel in Canada goes, there are two

other an illegal one from Onex, which would require the law to 
be changed before it could be entertained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Minister of Transport.  Are we to

<P><A NAME="LINK119"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr.

Canada shareholders to decide which is best for them.  After, 
when the government has received a conditional agreement, we

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is bad enough that the Nisga'a agreement entrenches taxation 
without representation.  It is incredible that it gives 
aboriginal women fewer rights than non-aboriginal women.  It is 
mind-boggling that there are 50 sidebar agreements yet to be 
negotiated.  It is shameful that there are overlapping land 
claims on this same area.  It is pitiful that British Columbians 
have never been allowed to affirm this agreement in a referendum. 
It is incomprehensible that the minister would stand at a press 
conference and say that he looks forward to limiting the debate 
here in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why has the government decided that democracy also has to be a 
victim of the Nisga'a agreement? 
<P><A NAME="LINK144"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, democracy will be reflected by what goes on in the House 
because we will debate the bill on second reading.  There will be 
hearings on it in committee.  There will be debate on report 
stage and on third reading.  This is democracy in action. 
<P><A NAME="LINK145"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
there will also be closure and time allocation, I am sure.  After 
two weeks of work, the minister has quite a track record. 
He decrees that parliament will not be allowed to fully debate 
the Nisga'a agreement.  He accuses British Columbians of being 
unable to understand this agreement.  He refuses to allow 
amendments that will protect aboriginal women.  He forces one 
group of Canadians against another.  He intrudes into provincial 
jurisdiction and gives away mineral and timber rights.  He 
destroys the economic prospects on both coasts.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
here is a factually correct statement.  Residents and local 
governments across Ontario, including Thunder Bay, Sault Ste. 
Marie and Nepean, have all understandably voiced objections to 
the federal government's plan to ship MOx fuel containing weapons 
grade plutonium through their communities.  It is unacceptable 
that such a potentially hazardous scheme is being undertaken 
without the support of the public or indeed parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why will the government not address the legitimate safety and 
environmental concerns of Canadians and put an end to the 
project? 
<P><A NAME="LINK149"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Natural Resources and 
Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we both have and are addressing those concerns.  We have 
held public consultations with all the local officials.  We have 
held public open houses to provide complete information.  We have 
provided a public comment period to the Department of Transport, 
which ended a week or so ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the Department of Transport will take all that information 
into account before it makes a final decision on whether all the 
laws are being properly respected to ensure that the public 
interest is fully protected. 
<P><A NAME="LINK150"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the minister may want to have a public discussion with Ontario 
Power because it appears today that Ontario Power and the 
province of Ontario oppose the federal government's plan to burn 
MOx in Ontario nuclear reactors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontario Power is not even studying the option.  Given that the 
main purpose and rationale for the federal government's plan was 
to import it for use in Ontario, something Ontario does not even 
want, why is the government still considering this action? 
<P><A NAME="LINK151"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Natural Resources and 
Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, again the hon. member forgets that this is very much a 
foreign policy initiative in the interest of promoting world 
peace and reducing the threat of nuclear weapons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have said we are prepared to consider the principle and to 
conduct the tests.  We are not committed to anything beyond the 
testing.  The testing is covered under existing regulatory 
authority.  If there is ever to be any further commercial 
activity, it would be subject to a full environmental health and 
safety review.  The proponents would need to negotiate a 
commercial contract with the utility in Canada that was prepared 
to undertake the activity, and that would be a decision to be 
taken by the utility.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I will deal with the question of 
privilege which was raised by the hon. member for South 
Surrey—White Rock—Langley.  She brought up a question of 
privilege the other day. I said I would hold any decision in 
abeyance until I heard if there was a response from any other 
members who wanted to deal with that specific question of 
privilege which was brought up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also said at the time that I would not limit myself to simply 
a question of privilege but that I would hear her representations 
also with the possibility that there might be a contempt of 
parliament.  I am looking at this particular intervention by a 
member on two aspects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there are people who want to contribute to this question of 
privilege, I will hear them.  I notice that the government House 
leader does have something to add on the specifics. 
<P><A NAME="LINK195"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in response to the 
question of privilege raised by the hon. member for South 
Surrey—White Rock—Langley.  In her statement she referred to 
the misconduct as she alleges, and general misuse of authority 
she further alleges, by the Canadian Security Intelligence 
Service in the exercise of extraordinary powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She further noted that in her view CSIS deliberately misled the 
federal court and frustrated her ability to resolve her lawsuit. 
She alleges that this was done to intimidate her as a member of 
parliament and it is therefore in her view a breach of privilege 
and she contends, a contempt of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a matter of public record that this lawsuit by a private 
litigant stems from the actions taken by an hon. member outside 
of the House of Commons.  In her statement the hon. member in 
question raised three broad allegations: one, that CSIS 
improperly collected and disclosed information; two, that CSIS 
took an active and thereby inappropriate role in the preparation 
of a lawsuit against the hon. member; and three, that CSIS 
misused its authority to protect national security and 
deliberately misled the court, so she said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the collection and disclosure of information by 
CSIS, document 17 of the documents provided by the hon. member 
indicates at Q.36 that CSIS was collecting public information to 
maintain an awareness of current events and public issues that 
may affect its mandated investigative responsibilities.  It then 
disclosed this public—I add public—unclassified information to 
the plaintiff who, as indicated at Q.10, was a former employee of 
CSIS. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>None of the documentation provided any prima facie evidence, in 
my view, that the behaviour of CSIS in this case was contrary to 
law nor motivated by any desire to affect in any way the 
behaviour of the hon. member, let alone intimidate her, in her 
capacity as a member of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now turn to the express desire of the hon. member to have this 
matter heard by a committee of this House.  I believe that the 
information provided by the hon. member does not amount to prima 
facie contempt of the House, nor does it constitute a prima facie 
breach of privilege.  Any actions taken by CSIS during the course 
of this private lawsuit were completely unrelated to the ability 
of the hon. member to perform her duties in parliament, I 
contend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member may have a complaint about CSIS and of course 
with time we will judge whether or not that complaint is valid. 
However, on the basis of the evidence submitted, I maintain that 
any such complaint is not within the realm of parliamentary 
privilege or contempt.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most appropriate vehicle for an examination of this matter 
is the recourse mechanism established by parliament for all 
Canadians who disagree with the conduct of CSIS, including its 
collection and disclosure of information. It is our view that the 
far more appropriate course would be for the Security 
Intelligence Review Committee, better known as SIRC, to examine 
this matter.  This committee was established by parliament to 
review all complaints against CSIS, including those from members 
of the House.  It is composed of a number of distinguished 
Canadians, including former members of the House, and a person no 
less than the former House leader from the opposition party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I submit that the hon. member has not submitted 
sufficient evidence to justify a prima facie finding of contempt 
or breach of privilege but that, if otherwise there is a 
substantive complaint against CSIS, the proper recourse is to the 
Security Intelligence Review Committee.  We believe this process 
was established by statute law to protect the rights of all 
Canadians, including members of parliament and that it ought to 
be properly followed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  As I asserted before, I want to hear direct 
submissions with regard to this question of privilege.  I do not 
want to get into a debate about what was said or what was 
interpreted.  I will do the interpretation.  I will go to the 
opposition House leader for comment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK196"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I would like some clarification from the Chair.  Was the member 
for South Surrey—White Rock—Langley given notice that this was 
going to come up?  She is not here to hear what the members in 
the House are saying about this issue.  Did you make contact with 
her? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  In direct response to the question, no.  The 
hon. member for South Surrey—White Rock—Langley was not 
notified.   If the question was posed, this is my statement and 
not the hon. member's, I will not be taking a decision at this 
very moment.  It is not my intention to take a decision at this 
moment.  I want to review everything that has been said in here 
with regard to this question of either contempt or privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my point is if this were a 
court of law or any other such tribunal in this nation, the 
individual would rightly be requested or advised to be there. The 
government House leader has made statements which to the 
individual's knowledge may or may not be accurate.  I think she 
has the right to hear them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I offer this as a counterproposal as to what 
we might do.  These statements made in the House not only will be 
made available to the hon. member who raised the question of 
privilege or contempt, but she will also have time to study them. 
I will go this much further.  If there is something further she 
would like to add without entering into a debate per se, but to 
give me more information on which I could make a decision, then I 
will wait until I hear from her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the hon. member was not notified is my responsibility.  I 
take responsibility for that.  It was an error on my part but I 
did not get the information until just today and I thought it 
best that we had a response of some kind.  I did not know the 
member would not be here, but that is my responsibility and I 
take full responsibility for this error on my part. 
<P><A NAME="LINK197"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will leave it to the member for South Surrey—White Rock—Langley 
to get a hold of you and go through <I>Hansard</I>. 
I think that is a poor way overall for this to be handled. 
Suffice it to say that the points the House leader brought up 
were covered in the documentation, most of which the hon. member 
gave to the Speaker some time ago.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is not protesting the fact that it was private 
litigation against her.  She has never said that there is 
anything wrong with that, nor should there be.  She is not saying 
that CSIS was able to collect information that was classified or 
top secret.  What the hon. member is saying is that after they 
got the information together, people at CSIS gave to the 
plaintiff in a private law suit help.  That information was given 
to this private individual to conduct a private law suit.  In 
other words, people at CSIS helped another individual.  They 
collected newspaper articles.  They collected clippings from 
newscasts.  They collected all of this and then, unsolicited, 
gave it to a plaintiff in a private law suit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, after that the CSIS lawyer was in contact with a 
private lawyer to a private litigant, the plaintiff in a private 
case, to help them with their case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I do not know where the House leader is coming 
from, but what he is trying to argue does not jibe at all with 
the facts that the hon. member for South Surrey—White 
Rock—Langley gave you late last week. 
<P><A NAME="LINK198"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  That is precisely the point, my dear 
colleagues.  I want to review myself what has been said by the 
hon. member who brought forth either the point of privilege or 
the point of contempt.  I will also look at all of the other 
interventions in this particular case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member for Calgary—Nose Hill has something which 
deals specifically with this point of privilege, I will hear it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK199"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, briefly, I would point out that the government House 
leader kept saying that there is no evidence, there is no 
evidence, there is no evidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I, and I am sure all members of the House, as well as yourself, 
Mr. Speaker, have the greatest respect for the hon. House leader 
of the government.  However, as a member of this House I would 
submit to you that it is not for the House leader to decide what 
evidence there may or may not be, but for a committee of this 
House to make that finding. 
<P><A NAME="LINK200"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  As I said, I will undertake to review 
everything that has been said and I will get back to the House in 
due course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have received notice of a second question of privilege.

<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan—Coquihalla, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on behalf of the people of Okanagan—Coquihalla on a 
question of privilege with respect to interference of members of 
this House by Aldege Bellefeuille, who National Defence memos 
indicate was a special assistant to the Minister of National 
Defence and to the assistant deputy minister of finance and 
corporate services at National Defence, and Mr. David Robinson, 
former executive assistant to the Minister of National Defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Bellefeuille's role at National Defence was to intentionally 
delay the issuance of responses to access to information requests 
from members of parliament in order to prepare the minister for 
question period.  Mr. Bellefeuille deliberately delayed this 
information for reasons that this information was intended for 
use in parliament by members of the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Robinson interfered with the release of access requests by 
knowingly issuing an instruction to senior officials at the 
Department of National Defence to not release access requests 
until communication needs of the minister had been dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Joseph Maingot's <I>Parliamentary Privilege in Canada</I> at page 
70 defines a proceeding in parliament as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since two of Parliament's constituent elements, the House of 
Commons and the Senate, were established for the enactment of 
laws, those events necessarily incidental to the enactment of 
laws are part of the “proceedings in Parliament”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, parliament has also always been a forum to receive 
petitions and the crown's satisfying the grievances of members 
before granting supply eventually led to straightforward requests 
for information. 
Therefore, the events necessarily incidental to petitions, 
questions and notices of motions in parliament in the 17th 
century and today are all events which are part of “proceedings 
of parliament”.

<A HREF="#LINKT55"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since Mr. Bellefeuille and Mr. Robinson intentionally delayed 
information with the full knowledge that this information would 
be used in preparation for question period, they are in contempt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 5 I wrote a letter to the information commissioner 
charging that Mr. Bellefeuille's position was an unwarranted 
infringement on the rights of Canadians to obtain information 
through access to information in a timely manner.  I made three 
specific allegations:  that Mr. Bellefeuille's position caused 
delay in obtaining records, was political interference and 
resulted in improper disclosure of access to information in the 
applicant's name. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On September 30 I received the results of the information 
commissioner's inquiry.  The investigation took over six months 
because my allegations contributed to, and I quote from the 
information commissioner's report, “improvements in access to 
information policies and processes at National Defence”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to delay, the information commissioner agreed that 
Mr. Bellefeuille caused a bottleneck in the access process as he 
reviewed 95% of all requests by the Canadian public.  This 
process resulted in delays of several months for documents that 
were otherwise ready to be released. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Additional delays at the public affairs division of National 
Defence were the result when Mr. Bellefeuille identified the need 
for a media line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When sent to the minister's office, delays of several months 
were noted while the minister was briefed about the upcoming 
access to information release and possible response lines for the 
minister in order for him to prepare for questions by the media 
and opposition members of the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to political interference, in addition to the 
interference caused by the delays imposed by Mr. Bellefeuille, 
the information commissioner also concluded that the minister's 
former executive assistant, David Robinson, issued instructions 
to “departmental officials not to answer access requests, no 
matter how late they may be, until the minister's communication 
needs had been met”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The information commissioner goes on to say:  “In my view, this 
instruction constituted improper interference with the lawful 
processing of access requests at National Defence”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to disclosure of the identities of access 
requesters, the information commissioner confirmed that Mr. 
Bellefeuille had routinely informed the Minister of National 
Defence of the names of access to information requesters that 
were members of the House.  The minister used this information to 
help prepare for questions.  The information commissioner 
concluded that this was not “a consistent use of this 
information as defined by paragraph 8(2)(a) of the Privacy Act”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Privacy Act prohibits departments from using or disclosing 
personal information except for the purpose for which the 
information was collected.  The information commissioner said 
that the minister should not have the name of an access to 
information requester to avoid the appearance of political 
influence or bias against the requester. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The information commissioner said that only the access to 
information office at the Department of National Defence needs to 
know the identity of the access requester.  The minister's office 
should only be informed if it is necessary and only if it is 
necessary to process the request, and definitely not in 
preparation for question period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I received this response from the information commissioner 
it is my understanding that the minister has replaced Aldege 
Bellefeuille with someone else who will perform a similar 
function as Mr. Bellefeuille. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, my question of privilege deals with the 
deliberate delays in information for the purposes of proceedings 
in this parliament, in particular the scrutiny of a minister in 
the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind this House that contempt, as Erskine May describes it, 
is any act or omission which obstructs or impedes either house of 
parliament in the performance of its functions, or which 
obstructs or impedes any member or officer of such house in the 
discharge of his duty, or which has a tendency, directly or 
indirectly, to produce such results that may be treated as 
contempt, even though there is no precedent for the offence.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that deliberately delaying information to a member 
of parliament obstructs the member and the House in the same 
manner as omitting information or offering misleading 
information.  The intent is to obstruct and impede members of 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, if you so find a prima facie case of contempt of 
parliament, I would also move an appropriate motion so it can be 
dealt with. 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have no idea as to whether the 
accusation by the member against an official who previously 
worked there and no longer does is valid.  That in itself does 
not constitute privilege.  If indeed the privacy commissioner, 
the information commissioner, or both have ruled in this matter, 
that does not constitute privilege in itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw the attention of the Speaker to citation 31 of 
Beauchesne's, which states in part:  “The failure of the 
government”, if there is such a failure, which I do not admit, 
“to comply with the law”, which again I do not admit, “is not 
a matter for the Speaker, but should be decided by the courts”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he alleges that someone did not obey the Access to 
Information Act, or even another statute, that does not 
constitute privilege.  There has to be an argument regarding 
privilege, not as to whether someone obeyed the law per se. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, citation 27 states that a question of privilege ought 
rarely to come up in parliament and that it should be dealt with 
by a motion.  Citation 28 states that it is clear that many acts 
which might offend against the law or the moral sense of the 
community do not necessarily offend the privileges of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We really are stretching it.  If we are going to start saying 
that every time someone thinks, rightly or wrongly, that an act of 
parliament, in this case the allegation that something that was 
judged by an officer of this House, so there was a remedy, 
constitutes privilege, that is really overstating it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I want hon. members to stick to this 
question of privilege.  Please do not go too far astray.  I do 
not want to get into a debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will not get into the debate as to whether this House leader is 
right and that one is wrong.  Let me put a little better 
perspective on what that one said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government really could argue that the minister dealt with 
the matter, so it is no longer an issue.  Or, there is the 
argument that members have the option to question the minister in 
question period.  Or, it could argue that the official is no 
longer working with us, so it is no longer a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To address the issue of ministerial responsibility, I draw 
members' attention to the Speaker's ruling of November 9, 1978 at 
page 966 of <I>Hansard</I>.  The then Speaker said: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—while I do not think there is a procedural significance to the 
doctrine of ministerial responsibility, it appears that we are 
now embarking on a different course in having the House, through 
a question of privilege, reach around the minister and examine 
directly the conduct of an official. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speaker went on to say:  “It seems to me that it is not a 
procedural matter”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speaker did not consider ministerial responsibility as a 
consideration when he determined that there was a prima facie 
question of privilege in that case.  There is no procedural 
significance in this case either.  The gist of the question of 
privilege today is that someone deliberately impeded a member of 
parliament from carrying out his duties.  That is really what 
this is about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The former official committed an act which constitutes a prima 
facie question of privilege and that act must be considered by 
the House.  The House must determine if further action is 
necessary to protect itself from this sort of activity in the 
future.  We should not leave the impression that interfering with 
opposition members of parliament is a career advancing move.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week we had a member of parliament on her feet seeking 
protection from the House and the activities of CSIS.  If members 
are being watched, intimidated or interfered with, and 
information is deliberately withheld from them, then what is next 
in the House, Mr. Speaker?  That is why we have come to you with 
the appeal.  That is all I have to add. 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will, in my own small way, attempt to frame this matter of 
privilege that has been put forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member knows and all members know that they have the 
ability in the House to request documents through established 
procedures in the House.  In this particular case, it appears 
that the member did not so request.  The member chose to rely on 
the provisions of the Access to Information Act, an act and a 
procedure set up by parliament for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In electing to use the access to information process, the member 
or any member of the House who uses that process are essentially 
using their shoes as a citizen to make access requests to 
government.  They are simply making access requests as citizens 
not as members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There may have been a dysfunction in the process.  I am advised 
that from time to time there are dysfunctions and there may well 
have been in this case.  If there was a dysfunction in the 
process, a delay or whatever, I do not think it is correct for a 
member here to say that a dysfunction in a procedure becomes a 
matter of privilege just because he or she is a member of 
parliament.  That would allow the House procedures inside this 
place to be cast out throughout the whole country.  Every time 
there was a dysfunction on a Bell telephone line involving a 
member of parliament it would essentially be a case of privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would not want to deal with the issue of just what happened 
with the access request in this case or in other cases.  There 
may well be a real dysfunction and the commissioner may wish to 
advise parliament.  It may be a real issue for the House, but in 
my view it would be important, before it becomes a matter of 
privilege, that a direct parliamentary function be directly 
impaired by the problem that the member brings to the House's 
attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I thank members for their interventions.  I 
will review what has been said and I will come back to the House 
with a decision.

Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to a former Speaker of the House, 
the late Alan Macnaughton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alan Macnaughton was born in Napanee, Ontario, in 1903.  He 
graduated in law from McGill University and after post-graduate 
study at the London School of Economics he began practising law 
in Montreal.  He was a crown prosecutor for many years.  But more 
important for us, in 1949 he won his first of six consecutive 
elections as a Liberal.  In fact, in the Diefenbaker sweep of 
1958, he was so regarded by his constituents that he was the only 
English speaking Liberal to win a seat in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After 1958, Mr. Diefenbaker decided to adopt the British 
practice of having an opposition member chair the public accounts 
committee.  Alan Macnaughton was the first member of parliament 
who chaired that committee as an opposition member, which he did 
with great distinction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Liberals won the 1963 general election, it was not 
surprising that he was appointed Speaker of the House of Commons. 
He served as Speaker during the Liberal minority government of 
1963 to 1965, a very difficult and fractious period in the House. 
It was marked by such acrimonious debates as the famous flag 
debate.  But Mr. Speaker Macnaughton was able to preside over 
these debates and these tensions with a great deal of skill, tact 
and diplomacy and was able to keep the House on an even keel.

</I></B></P><P align=left>One of his great achievements as Speaker was to start a wide- 
ranging process of parliamentary reform.  Many of the things we 
take for granted in our procedures and our committee system, for 
example, were first developed and proposed during his 
speakership.  Many of these reforms came into effect after he 
left the chair, but he was the precursor, the instigator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1965, Alan Macnaughton did not stand again for parliament. 
His successor was none other than Pierre Elliott Trudeau.  Alan 
Macnaughton went on to serve, again with great distinction, in 
the Senate of Canada to 1978.  After he left the Senate, he was 
active in the business community, but most important, in 1967 he 
founded the Canadian branch of the World Wildlife Fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to conclude by saying that Alan Macnaughton was a person 
of great warmth and charm.  He was especially helpful to new 
members of the House of Commons, as I once was.  I had the honour 
of serving in the House with him.  As an MP, as the first 
opposition chair of the public accounts committee and, above all, 
as Speaker, he treated everyone with the greatest tact and 
courtesy. But underneath it all was an essential firmness and a 
strong belief in the importance of the centrality of our 
parliamentary institutions.  He certainly made an impressive mark 
when it came to the reform of the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say to his family and his many friends that, on behalf 
of the government and all MPs on the government side, we want to 
express our profound sympathies on their loss.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Alan Macnaughton was a great Montrealer, a great Quebecer, a 
great member of the House, a great Speaker and a great Canadian. 
His record will live on in the smooth functioning of the House 
because of the reforms he undertook and the work he did in his 
years as Speaker.

Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of Her Majesty's Official 
Opposition to pay tribute to a former Speaker, Alan A. 
Macnaughton.  He presided over the Chamber from 1963 to 1966. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Macnaughton is remembered as a man and a Speaker who 
displayed a fairness in his deliberations and rulings, a deep 
love for democracy and a diligence to his task.  Mr. Macnaughton 
was Speaker of the Chamber during some very turbulent and bitter 
times.  More than once his quiet but compelling nature pulled 
proceedings from the brink of catastrophe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had some pages talking about his background, but the Deputy 
Prime Minister has done that and I will not repeat that because, 
as a Speaker, he would not want me to be longer than I should be, 
even in a tribute to him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was a great Canadian and the scope and breadth of Mr. 
Macnaughton's professional activities were impressive.  He was a 
former president of the Canada-U.S. Parliamentary Association, 
the Canada-France Parliamentary Association and he served more 
than 30 years as a director-adviser to European and American 
banks. He was chairman of the World Wildlife Fund, chairman of 
the Roosevelt Compobello International Park Commission and deputy 
chairman of the historic 1973 United Nations Conference on the 
Environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Macnaughton also served on many corporate boards after he 
left Ottawa.  Alan Macnaughton was a gifted gentlemen.  His 
unassuming and distinguished manner was respected by all who knew 
him.  As a lawyer, politician, Speaker, businessman and 
philanthropist, Mr. Macnaughton brought a dignity and a 
competence to whatever he pursued. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995, his contribution to this institution and to his country 
was acknowledged when he was awarded the Order of Canada.  There 
was nothing mediocre about this man.  The words brilliant, 
refined, dignified and accomplished will mark his contribution. 
We will all miss him, but appreciate the great job he did for 
Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on behalf of our party to pay tribute to Alan 
Macnaughton who was the Speaker of the House from 1963 to 1965. 
He was first elected in 1949.  He stayed in the House for seven 
terms until 1965. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though I did not know him personally when I came here in 
1968—of course the member for Windsor West was here at that 
time—I heard about Mr. Macnaughton's reputation, which was a very 
positive one.  He had a great influence on members on both sides 
of the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason he stepped aside in 1965 was to make way for a 
gentleman who some people may have heard of from the riding of 
Mount Royal, a fellow named Pierre Elliott Trudeau who became the member 
of parliament for that riding at that particular time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Mr. Macnaughton was the Speaker of the House, we should 
remind ourselves that it was only for two years but it was during 
a very difficult time in terms of being in your chair, Mr. 
Speaker.  That was the other time in history when we had five 
political parties in the House of Commons like what you have 
today, Mr. Speaker.  This makes refereeing this place a 
bit more difficult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was also during the days of the famous Diefenbaker-Pearson 
debates which became rather acrimonious at times and, as I 
understand, very heated.  Mr. Pearson had just won the election 
from Mr. Diefenbaker in 1963.  Mr. Macnaughton, who was respected 
by both sides of the House, was made the Speaker of the House of 
Commons by the prime minister of the day, Lester Pearson. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was also a time when the House had a very divisive debate on 
the flag.  I understand the debate went on for weeks and weeks 
before the days of time allocation or closure.  Mr. Macnaughton 
made a very controversial but wise ruling at that time to split 
the resolution in two.  He made his mark as a Speaker after only 
two years in the Speaker's chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was a lawyer and a very successful business person.  He was a 
very learned person, a very good academic and a very fine 
gentleman. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of our party I express our condolences to his family 
and to his many friends.  He was a great Montrealer, a great 
Canadian, a great Quebecer and a great member of the House of 
Commons for 16 years.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join in paying tribute to the late 
Alan Macnaughton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those of us who sit in the House today, and as has been 
previously mentioned by speakers, the late Alan Macnaughton 
presided over the House at sometimes very contentious times.  The 
flag debate, which was a lengthened version of the debate similar 
to that which the Speaker has presided over, and the pressures 
that were facing Speaker Macnaughton at that time were certainly 
historic in 1964. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With emotions running high during the months of parliament 
proceedings, the Speaker's job would certainly have been 
extremely difficult.  It is a measure of Alan Macnaughton's 
ability that historians have judged him so favourably.  During 
such a contentious time in our history, he contributed greatly to 
the House, conducted himself with class and dignity as both a 
member and a Speaker.  He contributed greatly to the country at 
large. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After a distinguished career in law, he pursued his career as a 
parliamentarian with the same vigour and the same level of 
decorum and class.  Canada is fortunate to have people of the 
calibre of Alan Macnaughton prepared to serve in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a 1965 speech delivered at a dinner at the Guild Hall in 
London on the occasion of the 700th anniversary of Simon de 
Montfort's parliament, Speaker Macnaughton reflected on the 
democratic spirit which for him connoted equality, the 
brotherhood of all men and his definition of the civilized 
person.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The annals of the House and the Senate as well as the records of 
the communities which benefited from his charitable work all 
testify to the fact that Mr. Macnaughton was by his own 
definition a civilized man.  He was a man who gave to the world 
more than he took from it, which fits Governor General 
Tweedsmuir's definition of a true aristocrat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We rejoice in Mr. Macnaughton's long life.  We are thankful that 
he chose to enter public life, and on behalf of the Right Hon.

appreciation and our condolences to the family of the late Alan

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I will permit myself a few words on this 
occasion of the passing of a brother Speaker who did indeed 
preside in this chair.  I would like to put a human face on Alan 
Macnaughton.  I am sure that parliamentarians and all Canadians 
who are watching today might appreciate this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About a year and half ago there were eight living Speakers who 
had occupied this chair and presided over the debates of the 
House of Commons, but it seems in rapid succession we have lost 
two of them.  In July 1998, Mr. Speaker Lamoureux died very 
quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had an idea for some time to convene the Speakers from 
wherever they were across Canada just to bring us together to 
share an evening.  This is where the human face of Mr. 
Macnaughton comes into it.  Of the seven of us who were still 
alive, one of them was not able to make it.  That was Mr. Speaker 
Lambert from Edmonton.  However six of us did come to the dinner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I called the former Speakers, one could not come in the 
month of October and another could not come in the month of 
November.  Although I knew of Mr. Macnaughton, I had not been 
that close to him before and I did not know how old he was.  When 
I called Mr. Macnaughton I said “Speaker Macnaughton, I am 
having a dinner for the former Speakers.  Would you care to join 
us?”  He said “Oh, yes, I would like to do that'.'  I said 
“You have two choices, sir.  Would you like to have the dinner 
on September 30 or December 5?”  He said to me “At my age I 
would rather go sooner than later”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not know exactly what he meant so I looked him up in the 
parliamentary guide.  Mr. Speaker Macnaughton on July 30 of this 
year was to have been 96 years old.  He lived through a great 
deal, virtually all of this century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was at a hockey game with him in Montreal.  When I was a boy 
growing up I said that Rocket Richard was my hero.  I asked him 
if he remembered Rocket Richard.  He said “Rocket Richard? Heck, 
I remember Howie Morenz”.  That goes back into the early part of 
this century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All that is to tell you that none of us here except the Deputy 
Prime Minister had the honour to serve with him.  I am not sure 
if the Prime Minister did.  I take great pride in saying that I 
am one of the great admirers of Speaker Alan Macnaughton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member for Regina—Qu'Appelle mentioned, in a time 
of turbulence he remained calm and he brought us as a House and 
us as a nation through the very déchirant flag debate that we 
went through.  He served the House well.  He served the members 
of parliament well by giving them the best that he had. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can only reiterate what all speakers today who have taken the 
floor to remember Mr. Macnaughton have said.  In my view he was 
one of our outstanding Speakers. 
He was a wonderful member of parliament and ever so human.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-3, an 
act in respect of criminal justice for young persons and to amend 
and repeal other acts, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee; and of the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
with the consent of the House I would like to split my time with 
the member for Surrey Central. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addressing this bill I would talk about a number of matters. 
The question of what exactly makes young offenders or how do they 
get to be young offenders always goes through my mind.  One has 
to ask these days if it is parents, family problems or an 
educational system where people fall through loopholes and do not 
get picked up.  Is it the drugs that menace society today which 
encourage more and more crime to feed a habit?  Is it the fact 
that role models are different today?  Is it television and all 
those other things young people watch and are influenced by?  Or, 
is it government legislation that more or less encourages or 
motivates certain things to happen? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that it is a bit of all of those things.  Having 
worked with a number of young offenders, it comes out that all 
these things put together creates a problem in society.  The job 
of the House is to try to deal with all those issues and package 
something called legislation for young offenders that is 
meaningful and tries to change their ways, if individuals become 
young offenders, as fast as possible so they do not get too far 
down the line, become incorrigible, and we end having to 
incarcerate them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will get something off my chest, to start with.  I can 
remember in 1991 setting out things we would like to see changed 
in the Young Offenders Act.  We even fought an election in 1992 
on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the new Liberal government took office in 1993 I really do 
not think it understood the difficulties Canadian were having 
with the Young Offenders Act.  It took us quite a while to 
convince them.  It was not just the Reform Party.  It was many 
people:  young offenders, victims rights groups and so on.  It 
took time to let it sink in over there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What particularly galls me is that once the government saw there 
was a problem it went the route of promotions, public relations 
and media advertisements saying that it would do something.  All 
along since 1993 and here we are in 1999 on the eve of the new 
millennium still debating this issue in the House.  It is just 
amazing to me how the government gets away with that with the 
Canadian public.  It is extremely disappointing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another point I want to make.  One member from across 
the way in the Liberal government said that the Young Offenders 
Act hit on the hard crimes and was lenient on the soft issues. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1555"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with the government and what it does not understand 
is that it would not be bad if it was one B and E by an 
individual.  Then we could say do not do this again or we will 
escalate it, much like progressive discipline in a business or a 
home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are individuals, young offenders with 10, 20, 30 and 40 
convictions and little or no progressive discipline.  This is a 
serious problem.  They fail to acknowledge that perhaps five or 
six break and enters, three or four possessions of a weapon, one 
or two robberies, and two or three minor assaults amount to 
something that is far more serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the courtroom today lawyers will say that their young clients 
do not understand.  They will say it is simple possession, a 
minor robbery or a B and E, and the judges say “Yes, I know. 
Poor young fellow”, and off they go.  They do not tend to look 
at the cumulative effect of consistently not making a serious 
issue out of it for the individual.  It is a flaw in the whole 
issue of justice but in particular with young offenders.  It is 
not being addressed here.  Accumulation of numerous minor 
offences means there is a problem and it is more serious than one 
minor offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In one year we had 14,035 B and Es from young offenders, 2,077 
possession of weapons, 2,338 robberies, and on and on it goes. We 
had 30 murders.  We must remember that those who murdered 
probably had a lot of B and Es, a lot of drug charges and so on. 
We failed to deal with it at that level and that is what is wrong 
with the young offenders philosophy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk briefly about some of the issues in my area in

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
after the great long police beat report from the west, I would 
like to make a few comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to hear the speech he made. 
He is very critical of cases happening in his own riding or in 
ridings in western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everything he says points to there being a problem.  I agree 
with him, there are problems in western Canada, because the 
Young Offenders Act is not being properly applied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is so true that even in Ontario—he spoke of Mike Harris—a 
pilot project has just set up.  There are figures to show that 
repression has been increased.  Camps where repression is 
abusive have been established for young people. 
What are the results?  Thirty per cent of these young people 
become repeat offenders after their release. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members should look at what is happening in Quebec.  There, the 
focus is on rehabilitation, returning to society.  There is 
practically no recidivism.  The opposite is the case.  Young 
people who have been duly followed under the law and the powers 
accorded us under the Young Offenders Act are returning to 
society.  They are becoming ordinary citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, we do not see the horror occurring in western Canada, 
which the member has just described.  The member should perhaps 
look to see what is happening outside his province.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope that the Reform Party never comes to power, because 
their policy on justice would be awful.  The Reform Party is 
mistaken, and what I find deplorable is that by crying wolf they 
have frightened the government, which has given in to Reform 
Party policies. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that comes from an 
individual standing in the House of Commons who wants to separate 
from Canada.  Is that not interesting. I find it ironic that the 
member may find the Young Offenders Act satisfactory to him in 
Quebec, but I can assure him that in my area the individuals do 
not.  The difference is that the people in my area want me to 
come here and change it, not to quit and separate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We asked for some things in this bill.  We said that young 
offenders facilities need mandatory rehabilitation programs. Does 
that not sound like a rational thing to do?  What does the 
government say?  The government says that with the charter of 
rights and freedoms that sort of thing cannot be mandated.  In 
fact, many young offenders say that if they had a little more 
discipline in their lives, that if they had been taught the right 
way, they could have learned a little better and changed 
themselves.  But no, the government will not take that step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We asked to establish a victims bill of rights under the YOA. 
This was not done.  We asked that a person who commits two or 
more violent offences be designated as a dangerous offender. 
This was not considered.  We asked for established federal 
standards for alternative measures with well-defined parameters. 
This was not considered. We asked that young offenders records be 
treated the same as adults.  This was not considered.  We asked 
for the publication of the names of violent young offenders.  The 
government left this to the discretion of the courts, in other 
words, status quo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the government really think that leaving things to the 
discretion of judges today is a good idea?  I cannot believe it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want good legislation, if we want things to be consistent, 
then we should have the courage in the House of Commons to say it 
and do it.  We should not say, like on the child pornography 
issue, that we will be a little general about this and we will 
leave it to the courts to determine whether or not the possession 
of child pornography should be legal. That kind of cop-out is 
really hurting our country. It is hurting the issue of youth 
crime. 
<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
for over 10 years Reform members have been calling for reforms to 
the youth criminal justice system.  It has taken at least four 
years, more like six years, for the Liberals to reach the point 
where we are at today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of changing our youth criminal justice system, it has 
been 864 days since the current justice minister was appointed to 
her cabinet position.  Ever since, she has been saying that she 
would change the Young Offenders Act in a timely fashion.  I do 
not know what is timely about 864 days.  We know that 35 violent 
crimes are committed each day in Canada and 864 days is a long 
time for my constituents and all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many violent crimes committed by youth could have been 
prevented in the last three years if the government had provided 
youth crime legislation sooner rather than later?  The Liberals 
spent millions of dollars, had months of hearings and promised 
for years that it was coming.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Extensive committee hearings were held on the bill last spring, 
yet the government allowed the changes to our youth criminal 
justice system to die before third reading in the last session of 
parliament.  That is an indication of how unimportant this bill 
is to the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have Bill C-3, the government's proposed changes to the 
Young Offenders Act, that will create a new youth criminal 
justice system.  Now we are back in the House debating at second 
reading stage of the bill.  It has a new number but it is the 
same old bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parents and families of the victims of youth crime become 
victims too.  I have two young sons, Mr. Speaker.  You met with 
my younger son when he was here.  When I put myself in the shoes 
of the hon. member for Surrey North whose family has gone through 
a tragedy, and when I put myself in the shoes of the parents and 
families of victims, I feel like going home every weekend.  I 
worry because the government is not doing enough.  I can hardly 
imagine what it must be like when a young person is a victim of a 
violent crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reforms to the Young Offenders Act called for by the public 
and advocated by Reform have been numerous in detail but the most 
substantive reforms can be grouped under eight categories which I 
will discuss. There is clarification of the purpose of the act; 
strengthening parental responsibility; recognition of victims 
rights; the provision of support services for victims; stronger 
differentiation between violent repeat offenders and non-violent 
first time offenders; strengthening sentencing provisions; 
publication of the names of young offenders; changes to the age 
of application in the Young Offenders Act; and provisions for 
rehabilitation and prevention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be fair, there are some positive changes offered in the 
proposals before us but there are areas in which we feel the 
government has been inadequate or misguided. We must continue to 
urge constructive alternatives and amendments to the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first category is clarification of the purpose of the act. 
The old juvenile delinquents act made it clear that its primary 
purpose was the welfare of society, whereas the Young Offenders 
Act introduced by the Trudeau government focused more on the 
welfare of the young offender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the commendable features of the bill is clause 3.1.  It 
states that the principal goal of the youth criminal justice 
system is to protect the public, a protection to be pursued 
through the prevention of youth crime through the punishment of 
convicted offenders and through efforts to rehabilitate.  That is 
progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition has been carrying the flashlight for the 
Liberals who have been walking in that direction.  I am happy 
that at least they got that right. However, the bill does not go 
as far as Reformers would like.  The Liberals have not seen the 
full light of day yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to reforming parental responsibility, the bill 
contains at least two steps in the right direction.  It requires 
compulsory attendance of a parent at court if it is considered by 
the judge to be in the best interest of the young person.  It 
increases the penalty for a parent who signs a court undertaking 
to supervise a young person upon release and who wilfully fails 
to fulfil that obligation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third category is the recognition of victims rights. Victims 
of youth crime are frustrated by the government's lack of concern 
for them.  The bill before us contains several provisions that 
represent a step in the right direction.  For example, clause 52 
has the provision to order a surcharge to be levied on any fine 
payable by a young person.  I assume these funds are to be used 
to provide assistance to victims of offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 113 permits a youth justice court, a review board or any 
court to keep a record of proceedings of young persons. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1615"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 118 permits victims access to the clause 113 records. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 39 states that the pre-sentence report is to include the 
results of an interview with the victim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These measures fall far short of the demands of the official 
opposition, supported by this House, for a full-blown victims bill 
of rights. My colleague, the member of parliament for 
Langley—Abbotsford has already spoken on this.  I commend him 
for being the champion on the victims bill of rights.  On the 
other hand, the minister and her government still assign a low 
priority to victims rights in relation to the rights granted to 
persons accused or convicted of crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth, fifth and sixth areas of concern to the public and 
on which we consider the provisions of this bill to be 
inadequate, are the provisions pertaining to the differentiation 
of violent offenders from non-violent offenders, the sentencing 
of young offenders and publishing or prohibiting the publication 
of the names of the young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the position of the official opposition that a 
disproportionate number of non-violent offenders are locked up. 
This limits the space and resources needed for violent offenders. 
It increases rather than reduces the probability that these young 
people will be drawn into a life of crime rather than being 
protected and liberated from criminal influences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have consequently advocated a stronger differentiation both 
in law and in treatment between violent and non-violent young 
offenders and between first time and repeat offenders.  We 
advocate a stronger differentiation than what is in the bill we 
are debating today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On tougher sentencing, I believe strongly that our punishment to 
criminals is just a slap on the wrist.  Appropriate punishment 
creates fear.  That fear acts as a deterrent to any violent 
crime.  On the other hand, if there is no fear and no punishment, 
that acts as a motivation to commit a crime.  At this time when 
there is not adequate punishment, that acts as a motivation for 
young people to commit crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the bill contains a few steps in the right 
direction, but falls far short of what we wanted to see in the 
bill.  We want a victims bill of rights.  The Liberals do not 
want that.  With respect to the bill's provisions for 
differentiating between violent and non-violent offenders, its 
provisions for the sentencing of young offenders and its 
provisions for publishing the names of young offenders, we find 
there are major deficiencies. With respect to changing the age of 
application of the Young Offenders Act, we think the government's 
approach is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the government has not gone far enough with measures 
concerning the treatment of young offenders, namely, the 
importance of prevention and the crucial role of the family with 
respect to youth crime prevention.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
debate we are having today is rather incredible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To quote Albert Jacquard “If a city needs a prison, it means 
something is wrong in this city”. Listening to my colleagues 
opposite, but mostly elsewhere on this side, I have the feeling 
prison is the solution for young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was offended a little while ago when my Bloc Quebecois 
colleague, who is a separatist, gave some credible statistics, 
but was told he was not making any sense because he is a 
separatist. 
If I were an Australian, I would still be interested in taking 
part in this debate because I believe that young offenders must 
be dealt with the same way wherever you live. We all share the 
same goal, making sure we deal with them in the best way 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Statistics show, and I believe we get good results, that 
prevention is by far better than incarceration and heavier 
sentencing. Sometimes I have the feeling that putting young 
people behind bars, telling them they are no good and always 
punishing them makes things worse. The results are there to 
prove it; they are most disappointing.

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are young offenders sent to prison? Because they have 
trouble living in society. In prison, they will be thrown in 
with other people who, for the most part, had trouble living in 
society. So I often think that prisons can sometimes be schools 
for delinquency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of punishing them even more, let us do the exact 
opposite of what is proposed in this bill and try to make them 
understand what they did wrong and rehabilitate them, so that, 
once their sentence is served, they can be reintegrated into the 
community. This is what a prison system should do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very disappointed today. 
A young person who commits a crime probably comes from a tough 
neighbourhood, from a poor family or maybe a broken family. Do 
members really think that, before committing a crime, such a 
person would stop and think, along these lines “I have to be 
careful, because under Bill C-3 I will be given a longer 
sentence”? Do members think that will stop such a person? Let us 
get serious here. This measure will not solve crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to put a question to my Reform colleague. Does he really 
believe that a young person would stop and think about the 
consequences before committing a crime. Usually, 14 year olds do 
not watch the news, they would not know about the new 
legislation and they do not even have the right to vote. Does 
the hon. member believe that such a young person would stop and 
think about what could happen to him? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, either the separatist 
member does not understand, or he did not listen to what I was 
saying. We on this side of the House are differentiating between 
violent and non-violent offenders.  We also emphasize the 
importance of prevention and rehabilitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is there is no appropriate punishment when the 
punishment by the court is only a minor slap on the wrist.  That 
indicates to our youth that there is no deterrent to commit 
crime.  They do not understand the importance of not committing a 
crime.  There is motivation to commit a crime because there is no 
punishment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is severe or appropriate or reasonable punishment for 
someone who commits a crime, this will put fear into potential 
criminals.  There is a deterrent for them.  The hon. member 
should understand that. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I had not really intended to take 
part in this debate now, but I find it absolutely unbelievable 
that at the end of the 20th century, almost at the beginning of 
the 21st century, the Reform Party would still trot out the 
theories of justice of yesteryear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I still cannot believe that someone would still say “To solve 
the problem of crime we just have to put people in jail because 
that will scare them”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is beyond belief. It is as if these people had never heard 
of restorative justice, presumption of innocence and the very 
foundations of modern justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am really extremely disappointed. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member should 
know that as we are entering the new millennium we want to build 
a strong bridge between this millennium and the next millennium 
where all of us can progress toward safety and freedom of 
expression and thus create a society where all of us can live 
peacefully. To do that the government has to get it right.  The 
government has to have measures in place.  Someone who commits a 
crime must serve the time.  If someone commits a crime but does 
not serve the time, where is the justice? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member of the government should ask his justice 
minister to make the appropriate amendments quickly.  This bill 
should only pass when all the amendments wanted by Canadians are 
made.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  It is my duty pursuant to Standing 
Order 38 to inform the House that the question to be raised 
tonight at the time of adjournment is as follows: the hon. member 
for Témiscamingue, Bill C-6. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it gives 
me great pleasure to speak in support of the government bill 
dealing with youth issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a balancing act.  Hearing my colleagues on both sides of 
the issue speak on the question of youth in the justice system, I 
cannot stand by without saying thank God I am a Liberal and thank 
God I am part of a government that balances the needs of society 
along with the needs of individuals.   It balances the needs of 
youth and the need for proper security for our people. In this 
bill we have seen just that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am extremely delighted to see the approach that has been taken 
by the minister, in particular the approach dealing with 
rehabilitation.  That is the most effective way of dealing with 
the whole issue of offences in our society.  It does not make any 
sense to put all youth who commit crimes or offences in one room 
and keep them there for 15 or 20 years.  If at the end of the day 
we do not do anything with them, when we let them back out on the 
street, they are going to commit other offences. There is no 
doubt in my mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has said there is a price that those who commit 
offences have to pay. In the meantime we have a series of 
requirements we expect individuals to follow.  If they follow 
those requirements and meet the requirements as set out by law, 
then at the end of the day they will do well for themselves and 
for society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am delighted with an example in my constituency of Ottawa 
Centre.  Debra-Dynes has been an incredible and extremely 
successful initiative. The police force in conjunction with the 
community, the private sector and youth have set up a team. They 
have approached this whole issue on a team basis, on a joint 
effort basis.  The results have been exceptionally good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not everything in our society is bad news.  There is a lot of 
good news.  I hope my colleagues in the Reform Party are taking 
note.  For example, from 1991 to 1997 there has been 
approximately a 25% decline in youth crime in our society.  That 
tells me one thing, that what this government has been doing 
along the way has been good.  All issues of prevention have 
served our youth well, have served our society well and have 
served justice well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, there is still a lot of work ahead for us to 
do. There is still very high unemployment when it comes to youth. 
Still over 15% of our youth cannot find jobs.  We still have a 
dropout rate of over 25% of youths who do not finish high school. 
That is tragic.  That is not just the responsibility of the 
federal government. We are doing our fair share. We have to do 
more and we are doing more.  But it is also the responsibility of 
the provincial government, municipal government, school boards, 
parents, of everyone collectively in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at the statistics, in particular when we look at the 
ages between 16 and 18, approximately 24% of all crimes being 
committed by youth are committed by those who are of age 17. 
Another 22% of all crimes committed by youth are committed by 
youths of age 16, and 30% of crimes committed by youth are by 
those over the age of 14, between the ages of 14 and 15. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say this because I see a huge crack in our system and that is 
in the definition of a child.  The definition is that a child who 
turns 16 can tell his mom and dad goodbye and he is on his own. 
No one is responsible for him; he is on his own.  If he comes 
from a broken family, from a situation where there is abuse at 
home, the support that exists for him between the ages of 16 and 
18 is minimal.

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is not enough support for our youth, for those in 
particular who are between the ages of 16 and 18 years.  Those 
youth are falling between the cracks.  As a result a person over 
the age of 16 years is no longer a child and has somehow become 
an adult in society.  Yet the person cannot vote, cannot collect 
employment insurance and cannot legally drink alcohol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We define our children in different ways.  Under certain laws we 
define a child as anyone who is under the age of 14 years.  Under 
other laws we define a child as anyone who is under the age of 16 
years. Under other laws we define a child as anyone who us under 
the age of 18 years.  There is a lack of synchronization and 
harmonization of our laws, not only federal but also provincial. 
There is a need all across this land for us to say that a child 
is anyone who is under the age of 18 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By doing so we would be saying to families and to society that 
they have a responsibility, mandate, role and objective to 
support children until they turn 18 years of age.  It would then 
be society's responsibility to support a child from a broken 
family or an abusive situation until he or she turns 18 years of 
age.  By doing so we would have each child either in school, in 
an apprenticeship program or in vocational training until he or 
she becomes an adult under the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is presently not the case.  When somebody turns 16 years of 
age he somehow becomes an adult but falls between the cracks.  As 
a result we have to follow the United Nations Convention on the 
Rights of the Child which is unequivocally clear that a child is 
anybody under the age of 18 years and that is the end of it, 
because it is well known that children need the support of their 
families, the support of society and the support of the community 
as a whole until they become adults.  Only then can we treat 
children as adults and only then can we say they are on their 
own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not fair for us as a society to look at somebody between 
the ages of 16 and 18 years who is falling between the cracks and 
crack the whip like some of my colleagues in other parties 
wanted. We cannot do that.  We have to stand up to our 
responsibilities and our accountability to the people and to our 
youth.  We must have a system whereby we can do all the necessary 
and important things to ensure fairness and justice in society 
and to ensure our youth are getting the support they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we would not have the 25% dropout rate we have in our 
schools now for youth between the ages of 16 and 18 years.  Then 
we would not have the high crime rate that exists for our youth 
between the ages of 16 and 18 years.  Then we would not have the 
high unemployment rate for youth between the ages of 16 and 24 
years.  Because they are not in the educational system and are 
not receiving the necessary support from the different levels of 
government in society they are falling between the cracks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to commend the government and the minister on their 
initiatives in trying to put forward an approach that takes into 
consideration the need for rehabilitation and the importance of 
prevention.  An ounce of prevention is worth five tons of cure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not an easy situation.  It is an extremely complex but we 
have to work collectively.  We cannot hit a kid on the head with 
a two by four and say that he has to obey the law.  We must have 
a cohesive and holistic approach.  We have to balance the needs 
of the child and those of society.  We have to deal with the 
needs of the child. We have to provide the support necessary for 
the child through the educational system, the family system and 
society as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am delighted to see the family being asked to get involved 
when it comes to a child getting in trouble with the law.  I am 
extremely excited about the fact that we can tell children 
through this act that we want them to go to school as part of 
rehabilitation.  We want to make sure they do not hang around 
with gangs.  We want to make sure they come home every night at 8 
o'clock, 9 o'clock or whatever time the court may decide.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By doing so we are going to the root of the problem.  In a sense 
that is rehabilitation at the highest level.  We are required now 
to tell the child, in particular the one who is at risk, to go 
back to the educational system, an environment where he or she 
will receive the necessary support to build a better life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I have put over 32 private members' initiatives 
before the House asking the government to amend every piece of 
legislation at the federal level so we can harmonize our laws and 
change the definition of a child to be anyone under the age of 18 
years.  By doing so we will be sending out a signal saying that a 
child needs the support of his family and society until he or she 
is aged 18 years.  Only then can we say that we have done what we 
have set out to do, and that is to continue to build a better 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have one of the finest societies on earth, but it could be 
and will be an even better society.  It is not fair that every 
year illiteracy costs us over $10 billion on a regular basis in 
terms of lost productivity.  It is not fair that over 25% of our 
population still has difficulties reading, writing or filling out 
application forms.  It is not fair that we still have the highest 
level of unemployment in our youth population.  It is not fair 
that we have the highest amount of crime committed by our youth, 
those between the ages of 16 and 18 years who are without the 
necessary support required from us collectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To that extent I just want to end by thanking the Minister of 
Justice for putting the bill before us and for once again putting 
forward something that is fairly balanced.  Nothing is perfect 
and the bill will go before a committee.  It will come back here 
at report stage.  It will go through the consultation that is 
necessary for every bill.  If somebody somewhere has a proposal, 
suggestion or amendment that meets the objectives of the bill I 
am absolutely confident the minister will be receptive to looking 
at it and if it fits the objectives we will deal with it then.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, that was an excellent speech in support of the member's 
private member's bill in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to recognize the difference between punishment and 
rehabilitation.  When one wants to talk about rehabilitation, 
which is the most important part of the project when talking 
about young people, one wants to ensure that people are not left 
out of the ability to be counselled in the right way and in the 
right place and to have those resources available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have family involved in the rehabilitation of people in the 
corrections system.  It is certainly my opinion that the way the 
system works is not adequate.  The courts or other institutions 
dealing with young people do not have the option of sending those 
people for proper rehabilitation because they are not a part of 
the age group to which the Young Offenders Act applies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to address that point and to address the 
fact that it does not matter what we say or do in this place 
there is an obvious shortage of resources available when we are 
talking about correcting something that has gone wrong.  We 
really need something for many of our children that starts long 
before that.  If the hon. member who spoke would like to address 
those issues I would appreciate it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his 
sensible question.  If anything, this is what the bill deals 
with.  There is a whole notion of the bill that deals with the 
question of rehabilitation and trying to identify what is best 
depending on the situation we are dealing with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the bill we would work in a partnership or in 
consultation with all the stakeholders, whether we are talking 
about the provincial government, if they are involved; whether we 
are talking about the justice system as we know it, the courts; 
or whether we are talking about the communities where there are 
community initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned the Debra-Dynes project as one example that is being 
used.  It is as an extremely successful initiative that is being 
brought about by the Ottawa-Carleton Police Service Board.  It is 
extremely successful.  The youth who are very much at risk are 
brought in.  They have exercise rooms.  They have teams of all 
sorts.  They have community projects of all sorts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a sense it creates a diversion.  It keeps the youth busy. 
When we keep them busy in athletic activities or by getting 
involved in community projects and other things, we are taking 
their minds away from doing drugs or getting involved in trouble 
again or other potential problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those kinds of initiatives are required of us as a society.  We 
do not have to always rely on the government to provide and come 
up with the solution.  We as a community and as a society have a 
responsibility to put forward initiatives that could help, could 
improve the quality of life of our youth, and could ensure that 
we have a safer community and a better community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To that extent I want to say to my colleague that his question 
is dead on.  It is very much dealt with through then bill when it 
talks about the importance of partnership with the different 
levels of government and when it talks about the rehabilitation 
aspect to address the specific needs of the child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am grateful for his question and I am quite pleased with what 
the government is proposing to deal with the rehabilitation 
aspect of the issue. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Two things, Mr. 
Speaker. First, it is false to say that Bill C-3 represents a 
balance between what the Bloc Quebecois wants and what the 
Reform Party wants. That is simply not true. Everything the 
Liberal government put in this bill is designed to meet the 
objectives of the Reform Party. That is altogether another 
matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the hon. member spoke about responsibility. On that 
subject, we can agree. One has to be irresponsible to change 
legislation that works. When dealing with legislation that 
works, the minister's responsibility is to try to improve it. 
We are not saying that the Young Offenders Act should be left 
alone because it is the best act in the world.  There are things 
that could be amended, simplified.  Right now, there are cases 
where young offenders are tried twice, and presumptions of 
innocence are suffering.  There are things that need to be 
clarified and improved. However, the entire act should not be 
scrapped in favour of amendments that could be technical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to tell me the minister's justification 
for repealing an act that is working. When we look at the 
statistics, we see that there is a 23% decrease in youth crime. 
Since 1995, violent crimes have decreased by 3.2% and sexual 
assaults by 1%.  Fifty-three per cent of charges against young 
people involve property offences, not violent crimes against 
persons. 
I think the government is getting it all mixed up.  The system 
is not perfect.  It can be improved.  But, please, let us not 
make the mistake of throwing out 16 years of enforcement, 16 
years during which judges have established an interpretation 
that is well known in Quebec, that is being enforced, and that 
is yielding results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to the members from Quebec across the way to wake up, 
to tell the Minister of Justice that this does not make sense. 
The government must not throw out 16 years of experience for the 
sake of a few votes in western Canada.  I call on the members 
from Quebec to wake up and oppose this bill.  We cannot pass it, 
because it flies in the face of everything being done in Quebec. 
There is a consensus.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Who do the Liberal members from Quebec represent in the caucus? 
Western Canada or Quebecers?  The Canadian Association of Chiefs 
of Police, the Canadian Police Association, the Quebec bar 
association and 18 organizations have formed a coalition against 
the bill.  Where are the Liberal members from Quebec today, when 
they should be telling the minister that they do not want this 
bill? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the member is bright, that he is reasonable and does his 
homework before he speaks.  I would like him to tell me that he 
agrees with me:  Quebec is enforcing the Young Offenders Act 
with very good results. 
I am sure that, deep down, he does not want to see western 
Canada throw away all Quebec's experience with respect to this 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb:</B> Mr. Speaker, my colleague's question deals more or 
less with matters of jurisdiction. He is asking what happens 
with this bill in a case where Quebec already has laws 
concerning young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not a constitutional lawyer. I think that when the 
consultation process gets under way, it will be interesting to 
consult with the provinces about the way this piece of 
legislation could be implemented. Besides, this bill will be 
referred to a committee. It is probably best that these issues 
be dealt with at that stage. 
<P><A NAME="LINK224"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have been 
listening to this debate since the end of question period, and I 
am flabbergasted at some of the things I have heard. For 
example, a member of the Reform Party said that this bill does 
not go far enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Actually, the bill is going in the wrong direction. It has 
already gone far enough, and even too far. Still, the Reform 
Party is not satisfied with a bill that is going in the wrong 
direction, it would like the bill to go even further in the 
wrong direction. Let me explain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the purposes of this bill is the general protection of 
the public, of course, but its primary purpose is to ensure the 
welfare of young people who have committed a crime or an 
offence. Obviously, we do not want to cheer these young people 
for their wrongdoings, but we not want to turn them into 
criminals for life either. 
After all, these are our children. They are not strange beings 
from a distant planet. They have been brought up by their 
parents, here. They have been brought up by a community that 
has, or has not, given them certain resources, of sources of 
interest, of motivations. Those children have studied in our 
schools and have, or have not, received the training, the 
upbringing and the values they needed. Those young people are 
our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they were born, they all had the same opportunities. Most 
of them are doing well, very well even, but a minority of them 
have problems. It is not necessarily their fault, very often it 
is not their fault at all. Society, the community and their 
family often have an important impact on how they have turned 
out. Fortunately, in such situations, solutions can usually be 
found.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, the Young Offenders Act has allowed us to 
take action and come up with some positive solutions. As my 
colleague from Berthier—Montcalm was saying earlier, since the 
current law was passed, the youth crime rate has dropped by 23%. 
Quite a decrease. The rate of repeat offences has also dropped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since other laws also give us the means to support a young 
person having difficulties and help him or her in the 
rehabilitation process, it is in Quebec that the youth crime 
rate is the lowest and the rehabilitation rate the highest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have is a situation that is both rather remarkable and 
ironic. We have in the current legislation everything we need to 
intervene and help young people reintegrate society in a 
meaningful and responsible way. The current legislation is 
working. However, the Liberal government has introduced a bill 
that is headed in the opposite direction from the current, which 
is working and produces results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is reverse engineering. This bill is doing the opposite of 
what allows us to reach the desired goals. Public security and, 
more importantly, the rehabilitation of our young people should 
be at the heart of the bill before us today. 
However, according to every study done so far and all the data 
we have, this bill is a step backwards. It will not help to 
lower the youth crime rate, nor will it facilitate reintegration 
or maintain the excellent rehabilitation rate we have now. This 
bill is regressive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, a Reform Party member, answering my colleague, the 
member for Berthier—Montcalm, ridiculed what he had said because 
he is a sovereignist. I am going to tell House something. In 
Quebec, things are working. We have the best results with youth 
crime, namely the lowest rate. We have the best rehabilitation 
rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government opposite wants to enact legislation that 
is going to set us back in the pursuit of this cause, coast to 
coast. 
If this bill becomes law, it will be one more reason for Quebec 
to want to become sovereign and to separate from a country that 
wants to mistreat its children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec has followed a very different path over the last 20 
years, and since the Young Offenders Act took effect, we have 
had the best results. But the federal government refuses to use 
legislation from Quebec and the situation in Quebec as a model. 
It refuses to heed the advice of experts from all over the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To win votes in western Canada, a Reform stronghold, it is 
willing to sacrifice—and this is the right word—our young 
people with iniquitous and punitive legislation that does not 
favour rehabilitation and that will not steer young offenders 
away from a life of crime.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will agree with me that this situation is absolutely 
unacceptable. I find it hard to understand how it is that the 
Liberal government, that usually has a better grasp of these 
kinds of issues, does not realize that this bill will lead us 
straight to disaster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we want Quebec and Canada to become a place where people feel 
unsafe on the streets, like the United States? If that is what 
we want, then the Liberal government is proposing the right 
bill. And if we want the situation to be even worse, we just 
have to follow the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But if we want safe communities, where it is possible to 
rehabilitate young people who have strayed from the straight and 
narrow so they can become full-fledged citizens, reintegrate 
society and make a positive contribution to our life, then we 
must not change the law. Let us enforce it as it stands now, 
with all the measures that lead to the full rehabilitation of 
offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec has set a good example in this area, and nobody has ever 
denied that. What I am saying has never been denied. Witnesses 
who appeared before the committee during the last session 
explained at length what I have been telling the House for the 
last few minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote what some people said, because I think it 
is important for the House to understand that the bill before us 
is going in the wrong direction. 
I will quote a criminologist from the University of Montreal, 
André Normandeau. This is taken from an article published in a 
Quebec City newspaper, </I>Le Soleil<I>, on March 13, 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Normandeau said “People in western Canada”—he is talking 
about British Columbia and Alberta—“always react as they did 20 
years ago, at a time when the crime rate increased each year. 
They have kept more of a punitive approach. Changing the law is 
the easy way out, but, more importantly, it does not work. 
Violent criminals, who represent 10% of offenders, do not react 
to coercion”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the words of a criminologist. He says that the law, as 
it is now, has worked. If we change it in the way the government 
wants to do now, we will be going in the wrong direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only will it not work, it will have the opposite effect. 
Mr. Normandeau goes on “The behaviour of prosecutors and police 
officers in other provinces will influence what goes on in 
Quebec. For instance, a Quebec police officer will quickly start 
acting like his colleagues from Saskatoon. He will then need the 
same complicity from the crown prosecutors, and then we will end 
up in a vicious circle”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me quote from another criminologist, Cécile Toutant, a 
member of the young offenders sub-committee of the Quebec Bar 
Association. The Quebec Bar Association represents all of the 
lawyers in Quebec. Ms. Toutant is a highly competent 
professional who knows first hand what is going on in the field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an interview she gave on J.E., a very popular television 
program in Quebec that the rest of Canada has probably never 
heard about—which is another of the characteristics of our two 
cultures and our two nations who live alongside each other, and 
someday there will be a political solution to this situation—Ms. 
Toutant stated that she was concerned about the reform 
because some measures will become automatic, like the transfer to 
adult courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This criminologist argued that, even with what the Liberals call 
the flexibility of the system, the measures that we condemn will 
be applied. She concluded by saying “Why allow what is 
unjustified? Why allow what is inappropriate? In fact, why pass 
this legislation?”

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 19, during a press conference of the group of 
organizations that are concerned with the situation of young 
offenders, Mr. Jean Trépanier, another criminologist, and a 
member of the Barreau du Québec sub-committee on young offenders, 
also condemned this false flexibility of Bill C-3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to him, this so-called flexibility we were talking 
about before the bill was introduced is in fact a political 
trap. Unfortunately, Quebec judges will have to fully enforce 
the law, since they will not be able to ignore sentences that 
will be imposed in other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, because of your legislation, members of the 
Liberal government, young people from Quebec will not be treated 
fairly, they will no longer have the opportunity to be 
rehabilitated, and the safety in our society as a whole will be 
affected. The reason for this is that young offenders who are 
not rehabilitated become criminal adults. We must not forget 
that. They do not disappear because they are put in jail. They 
will get out, one day or the other, with vengeance in their 
heart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, prevention is good, but when a young person has 
committed an offence, rehabilitation becomes essential to ensure 
the long term safety of the community and to ensure that we have 
a citizen who will work with us toward social objectives, 
instead of having one who will be in and out of jail all his 
life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to tell the House about a representative of 
the Quebec youth centres association, André Payette, who said it 
all in a nutshell “It will be a real mess if the bill is 
passed.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What could be clearer? The bill is going in the opposite 
direction from what should be done. I recall what my colleague 
from the Reform Party said earlier “The bill does no go far 
enough”. The bill is going in the opposite direction, and that 
is already too far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me quote also from a court that everybody knows well around 
here, the Supreme Court of Canada. In a recent decision, the 
court agreed unanimously that too many offenders are put in jail 
in Canada, particularly native offenders, and that happens not 
in Quebec but in the central and western provinces. 
The supreme court said that judges should get more involved in 
reducing the incarceration rate, for the rate in Canada is one 
of the highest in the western world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members do not have to be very good at maths. The government 
wants to lower the age limit to 14. You were once 14, Madam 
Speaker. Think about it for a moment: to be behind bars at that 
age, does it not make the system look a bit stupid? As 
lawmakers, we should have enough common sense to realize that 
there are other things to do with a 14 year old to educate him, 
instead of putting him behind bars. We are not in the Middle 
Ages. I am not surprised that members of the Reform Party say 
this kind of thing, for they have a somewhat reactionary 
mindset, if I may say so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But when members of the Liberal Party talk that way, I am sorry, 
but I do not understand. Somebody somewhere is asleep. They 
should be able to stand up and say “No, wait a minute, it is 
true, we are going the wrong way, all the statistics show it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supreme court tells us that our jails are already too 
crowded. If we put 14-year olds behind bars, there will be even 
more people in jail, and for a long time, because by the time 
these young offenders get out, at age 16 or 17, they will have 
attended crime school instead of CEGEP. CEGEPs may not be 
perfect but, frankly, I would rather send a young person to 
CEGEP than to crime school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to choosing between helping a young person get 
back on the right track or seeing him acquire all the skills 
necessary to remain on the wrong path, common sense dictates 
that we invest in reintegration.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This young person who is sent to jail at age 14 and is released 
at age 17 will go back again at age 18 and will end up in a 
penitentiary. An inmate in a penitentiary costs $100,000 a year 
to taxpayers. A social worker hired to look after a number of 
young persons for two or three years, or a social worker hired 
to look after teenagers for a time would cost much less, even 
with full pay. They would save money to our society. Common 
sense clearly dictates that we invest in reintegration. For 
every dollar invested in reintegration, we will probably save 
$10 in incarceration costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is about your money and my money but, more importantly, it 
is about our young people. Let us use our judgement. This bill 
goes against common sense. It goes against human decency. It 
goes against the history of humanity, which seeks to improve the 
way human beings treat one another. The best way to start 
treating one another properly is to show respect for our 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Canada and the Canadian parliament cannot respect our 
children, this will be yet another reason for me to separate my 
Quebec from a country that does not respect its children.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay—Boundary—Okanagan, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I listened with interest to the words from the Bloc 
member from Portneuf.  He is a member of the Bloc who I have a 
great deal of respect for, his separatist bent notwithstanding. 
The member has been to my riding at my invitation.  I said, with 
my tongue very lightly in my cheek, that he should see what the 
best part of the country looks like before he gives it up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a youth diversion program operating in my riding which 
has been very successful.  The last time I spoke with the people 
running the program, they had run over 100 young people through 
the program and had only one incident of a repeat offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lot of confusion about what the Reform Party really 
wants for young offenders.  Our whole approach is divided into 
three categories.  The first category is early intervention.  I 
believe that is the kind of thing the hon. member supports. Early 
intervention would mean interceding early and perhaps preventing 
people from turning to crime or to some anti-social behaviour 
that might lead them to crime.  It helps them to get the right 
type of assistance and aid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second category is the diversion program, which I talked 
about earlier.  I am sure the hon. member supports that as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a third category that everyone likes to categorize the 
Reform with, the tougher hand.  We believe that stiffer measures 
are appropriate for those young offenders who cannot be reached 
through early intervention, through diversion or through any 
other way, and who commit violent or anti-social offences over 
and over again.  For the protection of society, and for the 
protection of other young people who are the number one victims 
of young offenders, we believe there must be stiffer measures for 
people who assault, rape, break into homes and beat elderly 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member support the concept of this sort of 
tri-approach:  early intervention; diversion to keep them out of 
court and give them a second chance; and, strict measures for 
those who will not benefit from the other two aspects and who 
continue to break society's rules?  Does he agree that we do need 
to have some tough measures for the worst of the worst? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye:</B> Madam Speaker, I welcome the hon. member's 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that I had the pleasure of visiting his riding, I 
think it was in 1994. The hon. member came to visit my riding 
too. That has been a very beneficial exchange and I have a great 
deal of respect for this member of the Reform Party who, like 
several other colleagues of his, is more open-minded.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, to answer the particular question he asked me, I will 
say that, while his position appears to be consistent, the fact 
of the matter is that the bill would destroy the very 
foundations of that position. First of all, the bill focuses on 
measures of the third category, which are aimed at the most 
difficult cases. It is clear that it puts less emphasis on 
measures of the first and second categories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, if less emphasis were put on these measures, that is on the 
care of young people convicted of minor offences, if fewer 
efforts were made in that respect, these young people run the 
risk of committing more serious offences for lack of help. They 
will then be facing measures of the third category because they 
will have become difficult cases. 
What the bill will do is merely create more difficult cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following this reasoning, the present legislation would have to 
be retained so that all of the emphasis may be put on the first 
two measures, in order to have a minimum of individuals move on 
to the third. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And now what can be done with that group?  The last thing we 
want to do—and I am sure that my colleague from 
Kootenay—Boundary—Okanagan agrees with this—is to block their 
rehabilitation.  If not rehabilitated, when they are back on the 
street, the semblance of security we enjoyed for the two, three 
or four years of their incarceration will blow up in our faces 
when they do get out again one fine day and, instead of being 
rehabilitated, are really hardened criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tougher the cases, then, the more needs to be invested in 
rehabilitating them.  This is the only way, not just to ensure 
the safety of our communities, not just to save money, but also 
to save the young person himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The arguments being used by my colleague for 
Kootenay—Boundary—Okanagan are exactly the opposite of the 
laudable objectives he wants to pursue.  He must realize this. 
In Quebec we have demonstrated the right way to apply the Young 
Offenders Act in its present form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would invite him to come back to my riding with me and I will 
show him directly how well things are working. 
Perhaps then he will be able to remind the people in his part of 
the country that, if we want the first two measures to work 
properly, there must be more investment so that the third 
becomes the exception.  For those cases, we have to make sure 
that the results are exceptional as well, so that public safety 
is guaranteed and the young offenders become full-fledged members 
of society. 
<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, today, 
I have heard all sorts of arguments in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were those who thought that a person almost had to be put 
to death to be properly rehabilitated.  Then there were those 
who said that these young people had to be put behind bars if we 
wanted them to be allowed back into society, but that there was 
no certainty they would be rehabilitated in jail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also heard people, such as the member for Berthier—Montcalm and 
the member for Portneuf, who explained what needed to be done 
for our young people, for young offenders.  The focus needs to 
be on rehabilitation if we want to help them improve their 
lives.  We are legislators and we want—I think that this is what 
all members here want—to improve society. 
I do not think that a bill such as this is going to improve 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have attended the opening of courts in my region.  I have 
spoken with the chief justice of Quebec.  She told me that the 
other parties in the House would have to examine Quebec's 
legislation, sit down with us and take a look at it and, if 
necessary, improve it.  I think we have the deaf talking to the 
deaf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that Reform Party members will sit down and ask the 
member for Berthier—Montcalm to explain Quebec's young offender 
legislation to them.  I hope that they will keep an open mind.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice is a woman. Women sometimes see things 
differently than men.  They are the ones who bear children. It 
is important to give children everything possible so that they 
have a better life.  I do not think that a bill such as this is 
going to help them.  I appeal to all parliamentarians here today 
to think carefully about what is going on with respect to this 
bill and to remember that we are considering a bill for the 
future.  The young people of today are the citizens of tomorrow 
and we cannot jeopardize their future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye:</B> Madam Speaker, my colleague 
spoke so eloquently that there is nothing much I can add. 
Nonetheless, I would like to say that this bill is quite 
different from many bills introduced in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the subject is a treaty with aboriginals, it is important. 
When the subject is legal issues, it is important. When the 
subject is international treaties, it is important. But today's 
subject is the most important of all. We are talking about our 
children. I appeal to the good judgment of all members and, 
especially of government members, in particular those from 
Quebec, in the hope that they will bring the Liberal government 
back to its senses and convince it to withdraw this bill, which 
goes against the interests of our children.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I must say that it has been a very 
interesting day today listening to a variety of points of view on 
this legislation.  I think it is fair to say that we are all 
pleased that the legislation is finally before us.  There has 
been a feeling in the land, generally, that the Young Offenders 
Act needed improvements.  I think there is almost unanimity among 
members in the House of Commons that this debate is long overdue. 
I hope we can move this debate along quickly today and into 
committee where we can get into some of the concerns that have 
been raised by so many. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I can generally summarize my party's position, it is that we 
see this bill as a major step forward, and I will explain why I 
say that in a moment.  However, we also have some serious 
concerns.  I think they are very legitimate concerns and I want 
to articulate them very clearly because there is a role for 
opposition members, although it is probably distorted in the 
public's mind generally as simply to oppose things for the sake 
of opposing, that we are opposition and we are against everything 
the government does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I am prepared to acknowledge for my Liberal friends 
that on rare occasions there are actually some good things that 
come forward.  Today we are talking about some of those good 
things with this piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 is formally called the youth criminal justice act.  We 
are starting from a whole new approach, youth justice.  I want to 
take a few moments at the beginning of my presentation to read 
from the introduction of the bill itself because to me it 
summarizes what it is we are trying to do today.  It states that 
Bill C-3 is an act in respect of criminal justice for young 
persons and that it will amend and repeal other acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The preamble reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas society should be protected from youth crime through a 
youth criminal justice system that commands respect, fosters 
responsibility and ensures accountability through meaningful 
consequences and effective rehabilitation and reintegration, and 
that reserves its most serious intervention for the most serious 
crimes and reduces the over-reliance on incarceration for 
non-violent young persons; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas these objectives can best be achieved by replacement of 
the </I>Young Offenders Act<I> with a new legal framework for the 
youth criminal justice system; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas members of society share a responsibility to address the 
developmental challenges and the needs of young persons and to 
guide them into adulthood; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas communities, families, parents and others concerned with 
the development of young persons should, through 
multidisciplinary approaches, take reasonable steps to prevent 
youth crime by addressing its underlying causes, to respond to 
the needs of young persons, and to provide guidance and support 
to those at risk of committing crimes; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And whereas Canada is a party to the United Nations Convention 
on the Rights of the Child and recognizes that young persons have 
rights and freedoms, including those stated in the </I>Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms<I> and the </I>Canadian Bill of 
Rights<I>, and have special guarantees of their rights and 
freedoms; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent 
of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows: 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what this whole bill is about.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In anticipation of this debate and the work that will take place 
over the next number of weeks, I consulted a group of people in 
my constituency.  I went into the jails and talked to young 
people who were incarcerated.  It was an interesting experience 
because I had not spent a lot of time visiting jails.  I chatted 
to young people in halfway houses and, in general, to young 
people who were in some form of confinement.  There were young 
people who were being treated in various treatment centres for 
addiction problems and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked to young people on the streets of Kamloops who were 
practising young offenders.  I met with police officers, parole 
board representatives, probation officers, judges, lawyers, 
criminal justice advocates, correction workers and others who had 
in some way come in contact with young offenders.  I asked all of 
them what they thought was the fundamental reason for some young 
people becoming young offenders, because most do not.  I think we 
would all agree that if we talked to young people across the 
country almost all of them would not be young offenders.  They 
are hard working, decent, creative, dynamic, enthusiastic and 
optimistic young people who are accomplished in the sciences, 
arts, sports and so on.  It is really quite astounding.  However, 
there are a few people who do get into trouble with the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked all of these people if there was some commonality, if 
there was some reason or if they could give me a summary as to 
why these young folks got into trouble.  Almost everybody said, 
more or less, two things.  One was that these folks got caught. 
A lot of young people do unusual things and often flirt with 
things that are illegal, but they do not get caught, or if they 
do, they are released for some reason.  They are caught but found 
not guilty.  The ones who are in jail were caught.  That was a 
small point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point was that almost everyone agreed that one of the 
fundamental causes of young offenders in our society is poverty. 
Somewhere in their past, their parents, their guardians or they 
themselves had lived for a period of time in some form of serious 
poverty.  They did not have the things that most kids want and 
have.  They did not have supportive parents, nurturing or 
guidance.  These young people were without that.  They were on 
their own to fend for themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those of us who have raised children or know children well all 
appreciate that it is tough growing up.  There are pressures from 
peers and many other pressures.  If they have no one to guide 
them, to direct them, to care for them, to nurture them or to 
give them a helping hand, it is no wonder they get into trouble. 
I am not suggesting that if they are poor they are going to get 
into trouble.  Obviously there is no correlation there.  The 
correlation is that almost all of these young people, if traced 
back, had some element of poverty in their family's past.  That 
is a crucial factor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of us were here in November 1989 when Ed Broadbent posed a 
motion, seconded by me, that we would do whatever was necessary 
to eradicate child poverty in Canada in the next 10 years.  It 
was a very laudable goal.  I see many of my friends opposite who 
were here and remember that time.  First, we set a goal which was 
to eradicate child poverty in Canada in the next 10 years.  We 
did not do too well.  As a country, one area where we have to 
hold our heads down in shame is that we failed in reaching that 
goal.  As a matter of fact, statisticians have told us that in 
the last 10 years the number of children who live in poverty has 
increased by 50%.  It has worsened for a whole lot of young 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us understand that the reason those young people are living 
in poverty is because their parents live in poverty.  We do not 
have poor children living in rich homes.  Because of that poverty 
good housing and support are often not there.  As we deal with 
this new version of the Young Offenders Act and concern ourselves 
with assisting young people, particularly those who are on the 
edges of trouble, let us acknowledge that we cannot simply do 
this through this legislation. 
Other initiatives are required as well, such as alleviating 
poverty in our country, particularly child poverty.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some people in our country who assume that child 
poverty is a reality, that nothing can be done about it, that 
there is always going to be 5% of the population which is poor 
and that is just the way the world is.  However, that is not the 
way the world is in some parts.  There are countries where there 
are no poor children.  There are no children living in poverty 
because there are no parents living in poverty.  Those countries 
exist.  It is possible to eradicate poverty and it ought to be a 
laudable millennium goal for us to have.  We should eradicate 
child poverty in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on whatever kind of questionable statistics or images, a 
lot of people do not feel that society is a safe place today, 
particularly elderly people who watch the news on television. 
Every bad kid in the world gets front page coverage, so we get 
the impression of one large madhouse with thousands of people 
killing, raping and murdering.  In fact the opposite is true.  By 
and large the rates are going down in our country in terms of 
violent crime.  However, because of instantaneous communication 
and the fact that people watching television are not sure if the 
young people are from Canada or the United States, or from other 
countries, there is a sense that we are living in an increasingly 
violent society. People feel unsafe in their homes.  There are 
instances, of course, where that is the case and people have 
committed heinous crimes, but we must keep in mind that these are 
isolated incidents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened carefully to my colleague who represents a riding 
close to mine.  He spoke about the intervention programs that 
have been successful in his constituency.  I could name a number 
of programs that have been very effective in the Kamloops region 
in diverting young people away from a life of crime, which carry 
out all sorts of parole practices that result in people not 
reoffending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend talked about his experiences in Trail and Castlegar, 
British Columbia where the intervention programs have been very 
successful.  I appreciate that kind of information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to create the impression that we are talking about a 
very small group of young people who get into trouble.  Most of 
them, if dealt with properly in the justice system, do not 
reoffend.  They learn their lesson, smarten up and do not do that 
type of activity again, whether it is stealing a car, breaking 
into someone's house and stealing a VCR or whatever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would all acknowledge the fact that there are young people, 
very few in number, who really have to be set aside so that 
society is protected from their behaviour.  These are young 
people who participate in murder and manslaughter, rape and 
pillage and so on.  We have to acknowledge that there are some 
really troubled people and society has to be protected from them. 
Those are the ones who we want to see in our jails. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a lot of people in jails who, quite frankly, we do not 
have to be protected from.  If a guy has been writing bad cheques 
time and time again, do we really have to pen that person up in a 
cage?  I do not think we do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our friends from Quebec have been pointing out the success they 
have had in dealing with young offenders in that province.  In 
terms of young people who re-offend, the province of Quebec has 
probably had the greatest, most impressive track record of any 
other province or territory and we have to acknowledge that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec has made tremendous advances in the area of native 
justice, particularly native youth justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the occasion a while back to visit the Navajo reservation 
in the United States. They have had a youth justice system in 
place for some time and I wanted to see what it was about their 
system that was so effective.  I spent about four or five days on 
the Navajo reservation with a number of lawyers and judges and 
sat in on a number of sessions. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1730"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will explain how that worked.  It was absolutely marvellous. 
One day little Johnny stole a VCR from a neighbour's house on the 
Navaho reservation.  He was charged and the day was set for his 
court hearing.  I am not a lawyer so I do not know the proper 
terminology, but the court was called and little Johnny was 
there.  He had to bring his entire extended family with him: 
uncles, aunts, grandparents, brothers and sisters.  They were all 
lined up all over the courtroom.  The whole family was there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were not happy campers because they were busy.  They had 
jobs and stuff but they had to set aside this time to go to court 
because little Johnny had stolen their neighbour's VCR. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The old judge got up there and asked “Johnny, how do you 
plead?”  The kid was kind of mumbling.  “Speak up”, the judge 
told him, “so all the court can hear you”. “Not guilty, sir.” 
“Okay”, said the judge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was something to see, Madam Speaker.  You should have seen 
it.  The judge went to the kid and asked him if he could explain 
who the older lady was sitting at the table with him.  The kid 
said “That's my grandmother”.  “Speak up”, said the judge. 
“That's my grandmother”, said the kid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Could you explain to the court how you think your grandmother 
feels today about what you did,” the judge asked the kid.  The 
reply was not clear so the judge said “Speak up”.  “She is 
probably not very happy with me,” said Johnny.   The judge said 
“Tell me some more”.  “She is probably embarrassed that I am 
her grandson”, and the story went on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The judge then went to the mother, the father, the cousins and 
brothers and sisters, and they were all embarrassed by this kid's 
activities.  They said his actions were inappropriate.  They were 
sorry and embarrassed that their grandchild or brother had 
behaved the way he had. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the time they had gone through the entire extended family, 
the little kid was just like a melted pile of wax.  He was beaten 
up, feeling like a complete idiot and wondering what he had done. 
Obviously he was found guilty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was the sentence?  He had to do some community work.  Every 
day after school for six months he had to take a plastic bag, go 
around the reservation and pick up paper until he filled the bag 
and then leave it at the judge's house door each night before he 
could quit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the centre of the Navaho reservation the </I>pueblos<I> have a 
central area where people hang out.  Every Saturday he had to sit 
on a chair by himself from sun up to sun down in the middle of 
the reservation.  Nobody could talk to him but everybody would 
know who little Johnny was.  They would have to keep an eye out 
for him because he steals things from his neighbours and friends. 
They all figured out who he was.  He had to do that for a 
certain length of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  What would have happened had he stolen 
two VCRs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  My friend asks what would have happened 
if he had stolen two VCRs.  I have no idea but anyway this was an 
interesting sentencing.  I think there were a couple of other 
things added on to that but I have forgotten. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The long and the short of it is that the judge said young Johnny 
would never be back in his courtroom ever again.  Why?  It was 
because he realized the impact of his misbehaviour on his family, 
community and friends and that it was not the way to behave in a 
decent society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suspect that when he did it he was not thinking.  Let us face 
it.  We have all been there.  We have all done things in our life 
for which we feel kind of stupid because we did not think about 
them.  When one thinks about it, one does not do it.  The judge 
guaranteed that young Johnny would never return to the courtroom 
again because he learned a lesson. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot apply that for everybody, but as part of the native 
justice system in terms of dealing with young offenders it is 
that kind of sentencing, that kind of approach to the judicial 
system and so on that has proven to be very effective in certain 
circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I read the legislation this is what the bill is all about. 
It looks to the various types of sentencing.  Rather than just 
saying the guilty party goes to jail for 40 days or 40 years or 
whatever it give the judges some discretion.  Let us face it. 
Every case is different.  Every kid who is out committing some 
kind of a crime, gets caught and goes to court is different. 
Every victimized person is different.  The circumstances are 
different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I oppose what my friends in the Reform Party are 
suggesting, that we should not give the judges that kind of 
discretion.  That is why we have judges.  They are hopefully very 
intelligent people.  They know the law.  They understand the 
legal system and society.  They can mete out the appropriate form 
of justice in their judgment. 
That is why they are there.  That is why we have them.  Otherwise 
we would not need judges if we just had straight laws and so on.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friends in the New Democratic and I have a concern.  If we 
are to have all these creative systems to rehabilitate young 
people who have gone off the edge or try to get people redirected 
back into the mainstream of society, those who the judge deems 
can be, we need financial resources to have those systems in 
place to follow through with that.  We have to have the money for 
the parole system, the community action groups and the community 
organizations to ensure those young people can be rehabilitated 
by carrying out the judges sentencing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a major flaw in the legislation.  I may be wrong, but 
from what I can gather there are only $260 million over three 
years.  That is a drop in the bucket.  It will not solve the 
problem.  We can have all the great rhetoric, all the great ideas 
and all the great plans in this legislation possible, but unless 
we have the financial resources to give to support that system it 
will fail.  For that reason I am loath to say that we have to 
oppose the bill at this stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree with the theory.  We agree with the thrust.  It is a 
major step forward, but we cannot handcuff our judges, handcuff 
our parole boards and handcuff community groups that want to help 
young people.  Are they to say they are sorry and do not have any 
money for them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is like what we heard the other day with the RCMP in British 
Columbia.  The spokesperson for the RCMP said “I know those 
people have broken the law and I know they committed fraud, but 
we do not have any money to investigate them”.  In other words 
the laws of the land cannot be enforced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously there are a number of other items that we should 
identify as problems.  My colleague who spoke earlier certainly 
did that with some eloquence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We oppose the bill reluctantly, but hopefully in committee we 
will get some changes, particularly a commitment from the 
Minister of Justice to adequately fund the system.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia—Matane, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened attentively to my colleague, and he caught my ear when 
he said “We must talk about poverty”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have known many delinquents personally. I asked myself “How 
can a 12, 13 or 14 year old become a delinquent? Nobody is born 
a delinquent”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have an answer, and I would like everyone to listen. If one 
becomes a delinquent, it is obviously for one of many reasons. 
The most important reason could be that the delinquent was not 
loved enough or not loved at all. It has nothing to do with the 
young person; it depends on whether the family circle give that 
person the most important thing in life, love. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When someone grows up surrounded by hatred and violence, there 
is little doubt that that person is going to become a 
delinquent. Is it possible to legislate an end to the problem? 
Absolutely not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to take this young person and introduce him to somebody 
who is going to love him. It might be a streetworker, someone 
who works for the social services or a friend. By friend, I do 
not necessarily mean another young person, it could be a teacher 
or a friend who will take him under his wing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an example. In France, a man called Guy Gilbert 
takes in certain delinquents on his farm. There are a number of 
animals there: deer, cows, pigs, chickens and others. The young 
delinquent chooses an animal, and the animal is his. Sometimes, 
this young person, who is seething with anger, may try to 
mistreat the animal. He is told in no uncertain terms “Listen, 
you do not do this”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He is made to understand that one does not hurt animals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he understands that, how will he be able, later on, to hurt 
an old lady just to get $50? He will have understood. Very few 
come back or go back to prison because they have understood that 
if they are not to mistreat animals, they are certainly not to 
mistreat a human being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to think in terms of prevention. And I submit that we 
have to put up the money, especially at the elementary level. 
Even in elementary schools children aged six, seven or eight are 
sometimes tough, very tough on others, almost violent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope my colleague is now going to tell me he favours 
prevention over a more drastic measure. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Madam Speaker, I do not know if I can 
add much to what my hon. colleague has just said.  He has 
identified what he believes is a fundamental cause of 
misbehaviour.  I would have to agree with him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps I can add another point for thought.  I think the hon. 
member was asking us to think about this matter. I am a parent. 
I am just going to stand in my place and pretend that my hon. 
colleague from Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre is my child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon:</B>  He will have to use a lot of 
imagination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  That is quite a leap.  When a child 
misbehaves a lot of parents whack him.  Let us just think about 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I whack this kid across the head or slap him a few times, 
which is what parents generally do to discipline their children, 
and if the child admires me as a parent and believes that I love 
him but I whack him, spank him or give him a little boot or whack 
across the head and keep doing that, what kind of symbol does 
that present to the young child?  The person who loves him is 
hitting him.  I would say that is the way a lot of violence 
begins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that if the people children think love them keep 
hitting them day after day, month after month, year after year, 
and then say to the children that they should not hit other kids 
it is a little hollow and hypocritical.  Rather than hit people 
we need to comfort them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think I have made my point and I would like to thank my 
colleague for his intervention. 
<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
should remind the hon. member that we have a rule here against 
the use of props. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate is going along quite well this afternoon.  The hon. 
member touched on a number of the diverse elements behind the 
legislation, but I personally think the important part of the 
legislation is its enhanced access to what I would call adult 
measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member mentioned, as did previous speakers, the need 
for intervention, diversion, alternate measures and sanctions for 
young offenders.  With the experience we have had in the last 15 
years with the Young Offenders Act in many provinces but not all 
there has been a need, a request and an indication from Canadians 
that there is a need for enhanced access to new tools and firmer 
adult measures in some cases.  That is an important readjustment 
in the current statute.  It provides access to those even though 
in some provinces, and not just Quebec, there have been good 
results with the existing legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the hon. member if he accepts that principle.  We 
may be running out of time and ability to respond, but I would 
leave the question on the floor.  Does the member agree to 
disagree conceptually or otherwise with the thrust of the bill in 
providing access to courts that needed it or to judges who felt 
they needed access to potentially harsher and firmer adult 
measures?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Madam Speaker, I appreciate my hon. 
friend's intervention which was made in a thoughtful way as 
usual.  I must admit that I was not listening to his question.  I 
am sure it was a good one, but I am afraid any kind of answer I 
would have would sound a little bit silly.  I would say that yes 
is probably the appropriate answer knowing the kind of questions 
he normally asks. 
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay—Boundary—Okanagan, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I have one comment and perhaps a question for the hon. 
member from Kamloops.  I trust he is listening this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He gave a very graphic example and demonstration that we all 
feel toward his colleagues from time to time but he has had a 
chance to vent. His demonstration was well put.  Hitting a child 
repeatedly on a day after day basis may create a tendency toward 
violence.  I would hope that we in the House do not confuse child 
abuse with a swat on the backside at the appropriate time when 
other measures have not been effective or when a parent deems 
that to be effective.  It would not be on a daily basis nor 
repeatedly hitting a child each time the child says something 
wrong, looks the wrong way or whatever. There is a time and a 
place for everything.  We should not take that completely out of 
the hands of parents, especially when we tell them that we want 
to hold them responsible for the actions of their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis:</B>  Madam Speaker, that thoughtful question 
deserves a lot more attention than it is going to receive today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One could make the case that there is little evidence available 
to suggest that violence of any kind is ever helpful.  I know my 
friend and some of us might think it is, but we have to look at 
hard evidence. What evidence is there that striking a young 
person, in particular a little person, actually changes or 
modifies that person's behaviour? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will use one example.  I train horses as a hobby.  There are 
two approaches to horse training.  There is the violent approach 
which is called breaking animals.  You break a horse. The horse's 
spirit is broken and then it decides to follow along with what 
you want it to do.  The Horse Whisperer, the individual we are 
probably all familiar with from movies and so on, trained the 
horse to do whatever he wanted it to do through kindness. There 
is little evidence to suggest that violent horse breaking is 
better than kindness horse breaking, but we can discuss this 
matter further. 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, there 
will be no violence in the Progressive Conservative caucus.  The 
New Democratic Party, in distancing itself from its previous 
policies of pacifism today in the House of Commons has surprised 
and shocked all of us.  It is a sad day for democracy in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to speak to Bill C-3, the youth criminal justice 
act.  Canadians have been waiting for this very important piece 
of legislation for a long time. I hear regularly from people in 
my riding who are affected by and concerned about the current or 
previous act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for us when developing public policy to focus on 
reality and not simply perception.  It is sometimes said that 
perception is reality, but sometimes reality is reality. Far too 
often in the House and in politics we focus public policy on the 
perceptions of a situation as opposed to the reality of the 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an increasing trend for governments and political 
parties to focus action, public policy and legislation on what 
the pollsters are telling them to do. 
Of course polls are based completely on public perception as 
opposed to reality. I am concerned that in doing so, sometimes we 
overlook the more significant and root causes of some of the 
problems we try to fix with very simple solutions.

</I></B></P><P align=left>American humorist H.L. Mencken once said that for every complex 
problem there is a simple, clean, precise solution that is wrong. 
Sometimes we in this House come up with some solutions that 
simply do not address the holistic and root causes of the 
problems we are trying to deal with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was pleased to hear the member from Kamloops speak of some of 
the root causes of youth crime.  He linked youth crime to issues 
such as poverty.  Crime is often very much linked to opportunity 
or lack thereof, and particularly lack thereof is linked very 
closely to poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are going to deal with the issue of youth crime in a 
significant and long term way, we need to deal with some very 
important economic issues in Canada.  In Canada there has been an 
8% drop in personal disposable income since 1990.  On the other 
hand, in the U.S. there has been a 10% increase in personal 
disposable income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada homes, the pressures being faced by both parents where 
there are two parents are significant.  The pressures are even 
more significant in single parent situations.  That parent is 
faced with trying to provide for the household, trying to provide 
an adequate level of income for the household, and at the same 
time is trying to be an effective parent by devoting not just 
quality time but the quantity of time necessary in raising 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty I have with some of the band-aid approaches taken 
by this government is that far too often we are ignoring some of 
the real solutions. There are examples both in the U.S. and 
Canada of very successful headstart programs which have achieved 
a great deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Fraser Mustard studies have demonstrated that $1 invested in 
a child in a high risk situation before the age of three can 
provide a return to society of $7 by the time the child is 30. 
That return is based on the savings to society on the police 
system, the judiciary, and in the worst case incarceration, 
social welfare expense, the expense of dealing with somebody who 
has fallen between the cracks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first three years are the most important years in a child's 
cognitive development.  Ninety per cent of a child's cognitive 
adaptive skills actually close off after the age of three.  It is 
ironic in dealing with perceptions as opposed to reality that 
those who develop public policy on the education front, 
particularly on the provincial side, tend to focus on higher 
education and on secondary and primary education and they tend to 
ignore an important area, the preschool area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite possibly it is a step in the right direction for the 
government to indicate in the throne speech that there will be 
more generous EI benefits for new parents.  That is a step in the 
right direction but again, it only addresses part of the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certain types of youth activities are important in providing a 
way for young people to meaningfully spend their time. 
Recreational activities such as hockey, softball, 4-H or scouts 
are all wonderful activities that come with a price.  Any parent 
who has outfitted children in hockey in recent years will attest 
to this. 
For Canadians who have outfitted their children in sports gear, 
it is a very expensive pursuit.  Whether it is registration in 
the leagues or buying equipment, there are barriers. Parents in 
many cases lack opportunity and adequate income levels and 
therefore children lack opportunities to pursue the types of 
self-actualization and important activities that can prevent them 
from pursuing crime.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I represent primarily a rural riding.  Many of the studies on 
early intervention and headstart are focused on urban centres. 
The fact is that for rural poverty and urban poverty the 
demographics are strikingly similar. In many cases substance 
abuse, spousal abuse, child abuse, all these issues are linked 
very closely to poverty. I am not saying that is always the case, 
but living in a household with inadequate income certainly 
increases the pressures on parents and makes things awfully 
difficult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government wanted to move in the right direction, it 
would increase the basic personal exemption for taxation to at 
least $10,000.  Ideally it should be higher than that.  It is 
ludicrous that we are taxing individuals making $7,500 per year 
which makes it even more difficult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, the member of parliament for Shefford, has 
co-chaired the PC task force on poverty and has travelled 
throughout the country.  I have travelled with her on some of 
those trips to speak with and learn from those most directly 
affected by poverty.  The growth and pervasiveness of poverty in 
Canada has never been greater. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from Kamloops quite rightly identified the motion 
from 1989 to eradicate child poverty by the year 2000. 
Parliament's lackluster performance in meeting that motion 
indicates a focus on perception and not on reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be delivering on some of these things.  The best way 
is to create more economic opportunities to provide Canadians 
with opportunities to succeed and prosper and thus provide 
Canadian children with an opportunity to actually break out of 
the poverty cycle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The poverty cycle is important.  There is a fine line between 
programs that benefit families and children and programs that 
create a cycle of dependency.  It is important that we become 
more innovative in the types of social policy solutions we are 
seeking in preventing that cycle of dependency which can be so 
pervasive and deleterious in the long term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some elements of the legislation are very positive, such as 
those which deal with parental accountability.  The notion of 
bringing parents into the courtrooms to deal directly with the 
questions of where they were at a particular time or why they had 
not taken a greater level of responsibility over the action of 
the child is very important.  There has to be parental 
responsibility and that has been sadly lacking the past.  It can 
help significantly if parents and family members play a role 
within a judicial framework in this regard. The bill addresses 
that to a certain extent. I think that is very positive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned relative to the cost of implementation of the 
bill.  It will be largely borne by the provinces.  There has been 
a decline in the federal government's commitment to assist 
provinces to meet an increased burden on the judicial system. I 
am concerned about that. Since the 1993 election the burden on 
the provinces has been increasing for instance by reducing the 
CHST. The provinces have been offloading on municipalities. 
Ultimately there is one taxpayer.  Ultimately provinces that are 
enjoying less economic growth at this time will be put in a very 
difficult situation to try to pay for some of the costs of 
compliance with some of the provisions of the legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that parents become more accountable. We are not 
suggesting that jailing parents would improve the situation, but 
we should recognize the importance of parents playing a role not 
just within the realm of a courtroom but on an ongoing basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I enjoyed the member from Kamloop's comments.  One thing he 
mentioned was that in his study of the issue in his riding, many 
of the young people who were incarcerated or who were in various 
stages of rehabilitation had mentioned that the only thing that 
differentiated them from someone else or one of their peers was 
that they happened to get caught.  I think there is a fair bit of 
truth to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think there are a lot of young people who do end up running 
afoul of the law but are not of a criminal bent.  These young 
people will do what young people sometimes do because of the 
intrinsic sense of mischief that exists.  It is very important 
that we find ways to identify those people and find ways to deal 
with them relative to the crimes they have committed as opposed 
to those who actually demonstrate sociopathic tendencies and are 
capable of far greater crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opportunity to rehabilitate someone who has committed a 
crime of mischief or an aberrational offence will be far greater 
than it will be for someone who has more of a psychological 
profile of a criminal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important that we work with parents in a preventative 
sense and in a more holistic sense.  We need to identify and 
assist parents in developing the types of parenting skills that 
are necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I happen to believe that provinces are, in many cases, better at 
some of the preventative remedies than the federal government. 
Part of that involves constitutional and jurisdictional 
boundaries, but the provinces would be far closer to the actual 
situations, particularly in terms of strategic social investment, 
than the federal government would be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One example of a program that I think has great potential is one 
that the provincial government in Ontario has been working on. 
Dr. Fraser Mustard co-chaired a study on early childhood 
intervention and headstart.  I believe we will see the province 
of Ontario pursue a policy of headstart and early intervention. I 
hope that as part of that policy we will seek to identify some of 
the situational commonalities between those that ultimately end 
up falling afoul of the law.  I think we will find significant 
overlap. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That links very closely to economic factors and opportunities. 
It is difficult enough for parents who have a relatively good 
income to raise children.  It is an increasingly complicated, 
difficult and challenging world.  For parents who do not have 
adequate income and do not have economic opportunities, it is 
evermore difficult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must be extremely careful to balance social policy and 
economic policy.  We must recognize that while all of us probably 
agree on the end, some of us differ on the means to get there. 
We use the justice system to deal with our young people as a way 
to deal with those people who have fallen through the cracks, but 
ultimately, this place and all the provincial legislatures in the 
country should actually be preventing and reducing the number of 
young people who do end up falling through the cracks. 
We would all be better served by that.  It would involve dealing 
with the realities of the situation and the root of the problem.

</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the best headstart programs in a Canadian context 
operates out of Moncton, New Brunswick.  The Minister of Labour 
spent a great deal of her life working on building that headstart 
program and deserves credit for her contribution to Moncton and 
to Canada.  I am certain that program has resulted in significant 
change to the lives of those children who have gone through that 
headstart program.  Goodness knows how many young people have had 
their lives and directions changed based on participation in that 
program.  How many parents are now proud of their children and 
the young people they have raised partially because of the 
assistance of that program? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important that we take a look at not just examples of 
headstart and early intervention programs in Canada but also 
examples that exist around the world, particularly in inner city 
communities in the U.S. that have pursued some of these things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to create a culture of responsibility 
through the education systems in Canada.  This can be difficult 
because the justice system is largely federal and youth criminal 
justice is a piece of federal legislation.  However, we are 
dealing with a problem that emanates, to a certain extent, from 
education and could potentially be ameliorated, diverted or 
improved by a better educational focus on areas of 
responsibility.  There is a requirement for better provincial and 
federal co-operation in some of these areas to ensure that, 
across the country, provinces are pursuing education systems that 
teach a little bit about responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How about citizenship?  I continually hear from constituents 
that there is very little today to teach young people about 
citizenship.  They talk about the importance of not just 
responsibility to one's family and one's friends but of 
responsibility to the country and of trying to devote some of our 
young people's incredible amount of energy to build a better 
community and a better country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are all things that can be achieved if there is a 
co-operative effort to deal with the realities and the root 
causes of the problem and not always with the big stick approach 
at the end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we are pleased that the government has gone a ways toward 
improving the youth criminal justice with this legislation, we 
are not satisfied that it has gone far enough in certain areas. 
On the real root causes of the problem, we do not think that the 
government has really done an adequate job of approaching those 
issues.  There are members opposite who will point to specific 
programs designed to benefit children, but Canadians need the 
types of programs that provide for a culture of opportunity that 
would benefit all Canadian families, including children.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that this young person, instead of being 
rehabilitated, going to school and becoming a good citizen, will 
be sent to prison, a school for crime, where he will be in 
contact with confirmed criminals. My concern is that, when he is 
released, he will be even more frustrated with society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could a young man have respect for society when he feels he 
does not get any respect from it? I do not want to be too 
categorical, but I think that in that school for crime, his 
frustration with society will just build up, and he will learn 
more about crime. When he is released, he will probably be a 
much better criminal. 
He could also have a thirst for vengeance, and the problem will 
still be there. Since he will have become a young criminal, he 
will remain a burden for society for many years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate is very important. I am concerned when I hear some 
people say that young people should be punished more harshly.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the prison systems are there, I hope, to protect society, 
a more repressive attitude will not help us solve the problem. 
Far from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few moments ago, a member talked about prison systems in 
aboriginal communities. I heard about one system where it is 
agreed that young offenders have to be isolated from society for 
a while but, instead of being sent to jail with other offenders, 
they are sent to spend some time in the forest, which I think is 
a basic aspect of aboriginal culture, to reflect on their 
actions and to take responsibility for those actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are alternative measures that have not been examined 
carefully enough. They could yield better results than the 
Reform proposals, which, unfortunately, have found favour with 
the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if most members of the Liberal caucus believe in 
this approach. I hope this is not the balanced approach 
mentioned by the government, leaning to the left on some issues, 
leaning to the right on others, and all that to score political 
points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the Liberal members opposite are truly convinced this 
bill will improve society by putting more young people in jail, 
by treating them like adult criminals when they are not always 
fully aware of the seriousness of their actions. I think this is 
not the way to increase that awareness.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question.  He has been very articulate and vigilant in 
speaking passionately about the young people in poverty in Canada 
and the fact that typically in the House we do not really deal 
with some of the deeper issues which deal with that reality, as 
opposed to the perception. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fairness to the government, this legislation deals with 
justice.  It is very limited in terms of the scope it can take to 
address some of those issues. 
We need to spend more time pursuing some of the social and 
economic policies that can help reduce the poverty and dependence 
that can lead to it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It was interesting that he mentioned the issue of natives and 
the penal system in Canada.  The situation exists as well in the 
U.S. where there is a disproportionate percentage of visible 
minorities in the penal system.  Part of what happens in both 
countries is a systemic racism that reduces opportunities for 
minorities.  Then there are opportunities through archaic drug 
laws that create a loophole for people to make money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the history of organized crime, or go back to 
prohibition, typically those who participated in organized crime 
were of an ethnic background that denied them opportunities in 
the mainstream.  They sought opportunities where they could find 
them.  In some cases those opportunities came to them because the 
government had laws that did not make sense, whether it was 
prohibition or the drug law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people feel our current laws on recreational drugs may be 
particularly tough and do not reduce the usage of those drugs 
among young people.  Instead they increase the number of young 
people who ultimately end up running afoul of the law.  They may 
be decent people who get caught doing something that is a crime 
of mischief more than a crime of misanthropy and ultimately are 
penalized as hardened criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a lot of issues to be discussed and I appreciate the 
hon. member's question.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I have 
a little question for the member from the Conservative Party, as 
well as all the members from the Liberal Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 contains very dangerous measures. I would like the 
member from the Conservative Party to tell us what he thinks 
about two of them: lowering the age limit of young offenders 
that could be submitted to adult sentences, and releasing young 
offenders' names. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Madam Speaker, I appreciate the hon. 
member's questions.  The difficulty in the limitation of this 
piece of legislation is that it is justice legislation which has 
to deal with the problem.  Once it has gone too far preventive 
measures cannot be met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of lowering the age of accountability there are some 
reasons this is possibly a positive measure.  The idea is not to 
punish or to incarcerate 10-year-olds.  The fact is that in many 
urban settings organized crime is preying on young people and 
utilizing some as young as the age of 10 years to pursue crime 
because it realizes there is a loophole in the law by utilizing 
young people.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to start my speech today by talking a bit about the 
philosophical perspective that underpins this piece of 
legislation and many, if not all, pieces of legislation the 
Liberal government brings forward in this place.  We in the 
official opposition have a differing philosophy which is the 
reason we oppose much of what is in the legislation but not all 
of it.  There are some steps in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must acknowledge that the Liberal government moves forward in 
some areas that are positive.  There are some steps forward in 
the legislation but many that simply do not restore the balance 
of the justice system with regards to youth justice as could be 
provided through this piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have waited for the legislation for a great deal of time.  I 
believe my colleagues have been mentioning that length of time 
all day today as being around the 864 days the current justice 
minister has been justice minister and has talked about bringing 
in the legislation in a timely fashion.  If this is what is 
called a timely fashion, I would hate to see what length of time 
it would take if the justice minister were taking her time on 
something.  It is quite amazing it has taken this degree of time 
to get to this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to go back to the underlying philosophical 
perspective that seems to be apparent in much of the discussion 
today.  The government talks quite a bit about offenders, their 
background or what may have happened to them which may have 
caused them to enter into an offence.  That is a consideration 
that needs to be taken into account.  That is certainly something 
we would take into account as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The scale seems to be tipped over a bit too far in that 
direction.  The current government is dealing with that rather 
than restoring the balance within the justice system, which is 
what we would seek to ask the government to address by putting 
forward some positive, proactive solutions that we think are 
missing from the legislation.  I will touch on some of those 
points a bit later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apparently it has become important to the Liberal government to 
get its message out, the communication pieces out about what it 
is doing.  The message may go out that the government is acting 
on youth justice and is firming up the law to make our streets 
safer.  It seems to be most concerned about getting out that 
message rather than the actual tool of legislation which will 
make an impact at the street level on the great concerns of many 
Canadians in this area and many others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government's main concern seems to be its messaging. 
If it gets the right spin, if it gets the right story out to 
enough people, it can garner support by saying it has addressed 
the youth justice issue, for example.  I encourage Canadians to 
look beneath the surface of not only this piece of legislation 
but every piece of legislation that comes before the House to see 
what is their effect and direct impact on people and on the 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This piece of legislation fails to meet its goal in many 
different areas.  That is too bad.  The Reform Party will 
continue to put forward some positive proactive solutions which 
we hope the government picks up on.  Failing that, we will 
certainly work hard in every way possible to form a government to 
put those solutions into place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personal responsibility, accountability and consequences are 
issues that should be at the foundational level of the 
legislation.  If an individual participates in an action, he or 
she should be held accountable for it.  The Liberal government 
seems to be too quick to excuse the behaviour of people based on 
their age, their background, their experience or something that 
has happened to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party would advocate the idea of personal responsibility. 
Young people should be held accountable for their actions.  Our 
position has been misrepresented by others in this place today. 
We are not advocating harsh treatment of young people.  We are 
saying that it is harsh to ignore them, not to help them at a 
very young age, not to include young people in the youth justice 
system so they can get help and access to rehabilitative 
processes at a younger age.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Kings—Hants mentioned earlier that if we wait 
too long there is a group of young people that can be exploited 
by the fact that older individuals can seek them out to 
participate in illegal activities without any fear of reprisal or 
fear of being held accountable for the action.  That is simply 
wrong and needs to be addressed but is not addressed in the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was mentioned in the House today that we are talking about a 
small number of young people that choose to participate in 
illegal activities.  I agree that a small number of young people 
choose to participate in those kinds of activities, but they 
cause a great deal of damage and harm and are a concern to the 
public safety.  Even though it is a small number, when stacked up 
against the number of offences that occur it is a concern which 
we need to address.  The Liberal government has failed to clearly 
address it through the legislation.  That is a shame.  We will 
continue to give the government some suggestions and solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk about some things that are happening within my own 
community of Dewdney—Alouette.  In the city of Maple Ridge there 
is an individual who is very concerned about the youth justice 
system.  She is so concerned about it that many years ago she 
took the time to go down to the local courtroom and monitor some 
of the cases involving young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister responsible for amateur sport is very interested in 
this discussion and I appreciate his concern.  I hope he is 
taking notes.  I would be willing to send him a copy of my speech 
right after I have finished.  I know he would be willing to look 
at it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The individual in my riding is named Lola Chapman. She has 
dedicated a lot of her own time to set up a very innovative and 
successful court diversion program.  It is based on the notion 
that young first time offenders have an opportunity to go through 
a diversion program rather than the regular court system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know diversion is mentioned in the bill.  That is good. It is 
one tool that can be used to address some very serious concerns 
about young people.  The court diversion program developed by Ms. 
Chapman has become very effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When individuals are referred to the program there is a quick 
turnaround between the time they commit the offence and the time 
they come before the youth justice committee.  Sometimes it is 
within a week if not shorter than that.  The longest period of 
time may be two or three months.  Rather than having to wait for 
a court date a year or a year and a half away, this system works 
quickly and effectively.  It has garnered a lot of praise within 
my own area and could certainly be used as a model throughout the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a good program because it deals with the issue of personal 
accountability.  There are key individuals within the community 
who sit on this panel.  They include the mayor of one of the 
cities, the inspector of the RCMP, a lawyer within the community, 
a school principal and a member of the ministry.  It is a good 
representation of key influential people within the community. 
Young people have to come before the group and talk about what 
they did and then some suggestions are made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know my time is growing short and I will have an opportunity 
to speak again.  Might I ask for unanimous consent to table this 
proactive positive solution which outlines the diversion program 
within my own riding of Dewdney—Alouette so all can see what 
great work is being done? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Is there unanimous 
consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  No.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed to 
have been moved. 
<P><A NAME="LINK236"></A></P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>BILL C-6 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, today, 
during question period, I asked a question to the Minister of 
Industry but it was answered by the Minister of Revenue, who is 
also responsible for the Economic Development Agency of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It concerned the request made by two Quebec ministers to meet 
with the Minister of Industry to discuss Bill C-6, which will be 
superimposed on what already exists in Quebec for the protection 
of personal information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a law in Quebec that protects personal information, and 
the Quebec government wants to be heard by the federal 
government on this issue and express all the fears and 
objections it has concerning this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, this position is not without support. Several 
witnesses defended it before the committee. The Quebec access to 
information commission, the Quebec bar association, the CSN, the 
Chambre des notaires and the Conseil du patronat all said the 
same thing, that is, they are very concerned about the impact of 
this duplication, the problems it will create, when Quebec 
consumers are probably the best protected of all. After passage 
of this bill, these people will find themselves in a very muddy 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some things have to be said, and the House should not be misled. 
The minister has alluded to the fact that there had been 
discussions between governments and that the federal government 
had responded to the fears and concerns of the Quebec 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have here the correspondence between the Quebec government and 
the federal government. First, on November 11, 1998, the 
minister received a letter explaining why there were differences 
and enforcement problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister replied. The Quebec government wrote another letter 
on January 25. This time, two ministers of the Quebec government 
signed the letter. I do not have time to read it in full, but I 
will quote at least one part of it. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to clarity and fairness, as we were saying in our 
preceding letter, because of the overlap in standards and 
procedures that Bill C-54, if passed, would give rise to in 
Quebec, the bill is a step backward. It complicates the life of 
members of the justice system, it causes uncertainty about the 
rules and, thus, it penalizes both Quebec businesses and 
consumers. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently, the minister cannot tell the House that there were 
satisfactory discussions with the Quebec government, that 
everything is fine, that we are talking to each other and 
harmonizing. There is no willingness to harmonize on the part of 
the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its brief to the federal government, the Quebec bar 
association, in support of the recommendation of the access to 
information commission, said the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To avoid all confusion and make sure that Quebecers can continue 
to benefit from a comprehensive system of personal information 
protection, we submit that Bill C-54 should be amended to say 
clearly that the federal act will not apply to businesses 
covered by the Act respecting the Protection of Personal 
Information in the Private Sector. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the Quebec act. The Barreau went even further. It added, 
and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would go further. To avoid confusion and legislative overlaps 
and duplications in Quebec, we believe that the bill should 
include a specific reference to the Quebec act to establish that 
it applies to areas of federal jurisdiction. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We favoured the reverse approach, that is that the Quebec act 
should apply to all federal institutions and all federally 
regulated organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the government want to railroad the bill this week? 
There is very serious opposition to it in Quebec and also in 
Ontario. I know that the Ontario Ministry of Health has problems 
with the bill. Why refuse the meeting? Why not wait before 
passing the bill? 
<P><A NAME="LINK238"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, Bill C-6 will provide exemptions 
for private sector activities governed by the provinces, if one 
of them has already passed legislation essentially similar to 
federal legislation to protect personal information. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1835"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT94"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Province of Quebec has already passed legislation to protect 
personal information, legislation that is essentially the same 
as that proposed by the federal government.  The organizations 
covered by the Quebec legislation will be exempted from the 
application of Bill C-6 in the case of transactions taking place 
entirely within Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal bill will add to the protection provided by the 
Quebec law for consumers in that province.  These laws apply to 
different activities, and the federal law fills in the gaps in 
the coverage provided by the Quebec law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-6 resolves problems and situations that can simply not be 
covered by provincial laws, however rigorously they are drafted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One example might be a company with its head office in Alberta 
that gathers information on consumers in Quebec.  Neither of the 
provinces is under the authority of the other and therefore a 
federal scheme is required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once Bill C-6 has been passed, the privacy of Quebecers will be 
the best protected in Canada, since they live in the only 
province that has enacted legislation to protect personal 
information in the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as national security is concerned, I would like to repeat 
what has already been said and that is that the police and 
government authorities will be able to do no more and no less 
than they do now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think Bill C-6 is good legislation for Quebec and good 
legislation for Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The motion to adjourn 
the House is now deemed to have been adopted.  Accordingly, the 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1).
