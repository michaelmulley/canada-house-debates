</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron—Bruce, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, today 
I rise to recognize Ron Hicks, a constituent of mine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was recently informed that Ron volunteered his time and 
business expertise to assist in developing the environmental 
practices and business skills of a firm in one of the world's 
most disadvantaged economies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ron was a CESO volunteer in Panama.  During his tenure at this 
Panamanian business Ron was able to effect improvements and cost 
control by closely monitoring parts procurement and equipment 
failure diagnosis.  He personally trained 25 maintenance staff, 
advised supervisory personnel and effected improvements in 
corporate environmental practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, Ron made a substantial difference in the way that this 
firm conducted its day to day operations.  Because of Ron's 
efforts, the efficiency of this plant was improved which in turn 
will result in more economic output and growth.  This will result 
in an improvement in employees' wages and their standard of 
living while at the same time helping to enhance the 
environmental standards of the country as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I applaud Ron's efforts.  I feel that they represent a concrete 
example of how a hand up is often just as beneficial as a 
handout.

the Associated Press reports “Although ethnic Chinese people 
represent just 4% of Indonesia's 202 million people, they 
dominate commerce and industry.  They are frequently scapegoats 
during troubled times”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Asian financial crisis is hitting Indonesia hard and 
Indonesian Chinese are being hit harder as scapegoats.  For 
example, Chinese women and young girls are being gang raped. 
Stores and homes of ethnic Chinese are looted and torched.  Many 
ethnic Chinese are being murdered.  Some say that what is 
happening in Indonesia resembles ethnic cleansing. Ethnic Chinese 
are fleeing their homes from Malaysia, the Philippines and 
elsewhere to save their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government brags about its human rights record.  When will 
the Prime Minister, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the 
Secretary of State for Asia-Pacific speak up for human rights in 
Indonesia?

Speaker, in November of last year Mr. Arthur Lee stepped forward 
to rescue the McCrae medals and generously donated them to the 
McCrae House located in my riding of Guelph—Wellington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Colonel John McCrae was a Canadian doctor and soldier who wrote 
“In Flanders Fields”.  Every day the McCrae House in 
Guelph—Wellington works to keep his memory alive.  This year the 
house is celebrating its 30th anniversary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of all the citizens of Guelph—Wellington and all 
Canadians, I want to congratulate the McCrae House for keeping an 
important piece of Canadian history alive.  When John McCrae 
wrote the words “To you from failing hands we throw the torch; 
be yours to hold it high”, the McCrae House listened.  Thank you 
for holding the torch and for protecting our heritage.  May you 
continue to do so for many years to come.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie—Lincoln, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
St. Lawrence Seaway is a vital industry not only in my riding of 
Erie—Lincoln and the Niagara area but also for the entire 
country. The seaway is one of the world's busiest shipping 
waterways making Canada a competitive trader in the world 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tomorrow history will be made when plans to establish a not for 
profit corporation to operate the St. Lawrence Seaway system will 
be implemented.  This necessary step will promote economic growth 
by modernizing Canada's marine transport system. While the crown 
retains ownership of all assets, management and operation of the 
seaway will be assumed by a user group, the St. Lawrence Seaway 
Management Corporation, pursuant to the Canada Marine Act for an 
initial 10 year term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This accord will ensure that the seaway continues to bring 
benefits to all as Canada heads into the next millennium.

pleased to rise today to announce the official launch of the 1998 
national menopause awareness campaign which will take place 
tomorrow. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope all members are aware of the importance of this issue. 
Canadians must be better informed if they want to ensure a 
better life for themselves. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the year 2000 more than four million women will enter or will 
have already entered this phase of their life.  It is important 
that we educate women to the long term health risks that are 
associated with menopause, such as heart disease and 
osteoporosis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Building awareness of these risks is key.  Informed people make 
healthier choices which lead to improved health and quality of 
life, not to mention considerable savings to the health care 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank the Society of Obstetricians and 
Gynecologists of Canada, the Heart and Stroke Foundation, the 
Osteoporosis Society of Canada, the Canadian Cardiovascular 
Society and the Canadian Pharmacists Association for their 
efforts in raising awareness of the effects of menopause.

unregulated and speculative capital is wreaking upon the world 
and the unwillingness of existing global institutions like the 
IMF and the World Bank to seriously address the fundamental flaws 
of the current situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A good start would be for the finance minister to champion an

Hundreds of police and peace officers from all across Canada and 
the world joined his wife, Marina, also an RCMP officer in 
Lethbridge, and friends at the solemn occasion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Corporal Graeme Cumming was an outstanding police officer, an 
honourable member of his community, a wonderful husband and a 
loyal citizen of our country.  He left all the communities he 
served better places for having known and experienced his 
dedication.  He will be sadly missed by all who knew him, who 
worked with him and who had contact with him.

bravery of those whose job it is to serve and protect Canadians

Cumming.  He was a man of great faith and conviction. He will be

Government of Canada announced its intention to fund the

desire to keep abreast of the rapidly developing Internet

national network that is wholly fibre-optic based.  We can be 
proud of all the men and women who work in this complex high-tech

stand to benefit in the near future.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister wants to get his hands on employment 
insurance funds that belong to workers and businesses.  But if a

of dollars to a private insurance fund and the managers of that 
fund tried to siphon off those funds for some other purpose the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, if the hon. member had searched a bit before asking the 
question he would have known that the consolidation of the two 
funds was done in 1986 by the previous government when it was 
decided not to have a segregated fund for UI.  It was under the 
advice of the auditor general at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that it is not a special fund, it is a 
contribution to the treasury of the government.

would know this was done in 1986. 
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government's chief actuary said yesterday, not in 
1867, that the Prime Minister is overcharging businesses and 
workers by up to 33% on employment insurance premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a private insurance company with a monopoly was caught 
overcharging like that every member opposite would be up in arms 
demanding some punitive action.

would land the CEO of a private insurance company in jail? 
<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we are having a debate on what to do with a very nice 
problem for the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we formed the government we found that there was $42 
billion deficit.  In January 1994, at that time, the rate was 
$3.30.  We have reduced the rate to $2.70 and it will go down 
further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a surplus in the fund and we will debate with Canadians 
how to use it for the benefit of all Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, here are the relevant facts.  Because the Prime Minister 
refuses to give back to workers and businesses over $7 billion of 
their own money in this fund, a waitress forks over more than 
$175 more per year, a factory worker pays an extra $350 a year 
and the small business that employees that factory worker pays an 
extra $500 a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the Prime Minister explain to these people why he continues 
to rip them off? 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, what we are debating at this time is not very 
complicated.  Is it better to return 60% of the money to the 
companies and 40% to the employees or to give the employees a tax 
reduction? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member prefers that the money goes to the companies,

<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
simply want to point out that 95% of businesses in Canada today

</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the Prime Minister not move today to stimulate the 
economy by returning that $7 billion EI overpayment to workers 
and small businesses? 
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, that is exactly what we are debating.  The difference 
between our position and the position of Reform Party members is 
that we would like to give the money to the workers, but they 
want us to give it to the companies.  That is fair, but I think 
we will be on the side of the workers before we will be on the 
side of the companies. 
<P><A NAME="LINK44"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is time for the Prime Minister to wake up.  The dollar fell 
dramatically today.  The economy shrank for the fourth month in a 
row.  We know the government has been in a coma for the last six 
months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we want now is for the Prime Minister and the government to 
wake up and give that $7 billion overpayment back to workers and 
employers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know what they said in the red book:  It is small business 
that creates jobs in this country.  Why do they not follow their 
own advice? 
<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, that is exactly what we have done with small business. 
We have said that they create 85% of the jobs in Canada.  In the 
last five years since the Liberals have been in government 1.2 
million new jobs have been created.  So 85% of that is one 
million.  One million have been created by the small corporations 
because they have been well treated by the government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the EI 
fund has a surplus in the billions, while three out of five 
unemployed workers do not qualify for benefits, I repeat, three 
out of five. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What makes the Prime Minister think he should have a free hand 
in spending money that in fact comes from unemployed workers in 
the worst straits, those who do not qualify for benefits, even 
though they paid premiums? 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if 
the facts are examined, it becomes clear that those who do not 
qualify include new job market entrants.  An individual who 
finishes his studies and does not find employment has not paid 
into the fund.  There are many cases like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proof, as I said yesterday, is that not only has the number 
of unemployed workers in Canada dropped, but the number of 
Canadians on welfare has also decreased in recent years.  This 
is because the economy is much stronger than when we first 
formed the government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Prime Minister is telling us there is nothing wrong with young 
people having to work 910 hours, nothing wrong with making them 
pay premiums and refusing them benefits when they lose their 
jobs.  That is the message the Prime Minister is sending young 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he realize that an insurance salesman who followed his 
example and overcharged for his policies, compensated two 
claimants out of five and pocketed the excess premiums would 
have the courts to answer to and might even end up in jail? 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
because 1.2 million jobs have been created, fewer people are 
receiving EI benefits.  We have also lowered premiums from $3.30 
to $2.70 in the course of our successive budgets.  Right now, we 
are talking publicly about what we should do in the future. 
Once again, I am happy to hear that the Bloc Quebecois wants to 
see the surplus go to employers rather than employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.

future, but our position is clear. The Bloc Quebecois wants half 
of the annual surplus in the employment insurance fund to be 
used to reduce contributions and help small business create 
jobs. We also want the other half to go towards improving the 
current system to support those who lose their jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is simple: Which part of this approach does the 
Prime Minister dislike? The part about helping small business, 
the part about helping the unemployed, or both?

</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Minister of Human Resources Development said yesterday, 
we have set up programs to help those already in the labour 
market find new jobs, get training, and so on. But we must also 
take into account all government priorities and determine 
whether or not we should put more money into health care. There 
is a debate under way, and there will be a budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is becoming increasingly clear that the Bloc Quebecois is not

to treat the unemployed fairly and decently and to be sensitive 
to the real difficulties they are facing, he refuses to do so. 
Are we therefore to understand that, when he called unemployed 
Canadians beer guzzlers in 1994, the Prime Minister expressed 
what he really thought of them?

what we have done for Canadians is to strengthen the economic

the Minister of Finance wants to score political points by

not qualify for any benefits at all.

Dussault expressed himself very clearly as well on August 24 when 
he wrote a letter to senior government officials expressing his 
deep concern over the loss of Dynacan. By taking this important 
tool from him, the government compromised Dussault's ability to 
provide independent assessment of the future of the CPP. A day 
later, August 25, Bernard Dussault was fired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Was this government afraid that the chief actuary would reveal

longstanding issues concerning his management”.  The Minister of 
Finance had nothing to do with it.  In fact, today in a statement 
he issued to the press he stated: “I know there was no political 
interference in my decision to ask him to leave, not the Minister 
of Finance, not any other minister.  I am responsible for OSFI 
and this was my decision as the superintendent”. Clearly it was 
Mr. Palmer's decision.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Aerospace Industries Association of Canada, which just held 
its 37th annual general meeting in Ottawa, is very concerned 
about unfair competition on the world market. One example is a 
subsidy that gives a price advantage to regional jetliners 
manufactured in Brazil.

industries are not undermined by Brazilian government subsidies?

question because it is an important one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over 60,000 Canadians are employed by the national aerospace 
industry in all regions of the country. That is why the Prime 
Minister with the president of Brazil tried to negotiate this 
dispute with Proex.  Regrettably that was not possible and so the 
Canadian government took the action this summer to bring Brazil 
before the World Trade Organization. We are not shy about 
defending or promoting aerospace industries in this country.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>THE LATE HON. LUCIEN LAMOUREUX 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK125"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
last summer, we were all saddened by the death of the Hon. 
Lucien Lamoureux. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This learned and distinguished Franco-Ontarian was a leader in 
his community and one of the great Speakers of the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lucien Lamoureux was first elected to the House of Commons in 
1962, as the member for Stormont—Dundas—Glengarry, and he soon 
made a name for himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was appointed acting speaker of the House in 1963. After 
having proved his mettle for three years, he was elected Speaker 
by acclamation in 1966. 
He was again re-elected Speaker in 1968 and in 1972. His nine 
year tenure as Speaker was an eventful, at times electrifying 
period. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Twice he presided over a minority government, one in which there 
were five parties, and the government and the official opposition 
were separated by just two seats, adding fuel to the fires of 
parliamentary debate that, as you know, Mr. Speaker, are heated 
even in more stable settings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issues of the day were divisive, positions were deeply felt 
and the tone of exchanges was often angry and personal.  Through 
it all Lucien presided with dignity, diplomacy and wisdom. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was able to maintain order and decorum. In doing so, he 
earned the respect and trust of members from all parties. He 
was, in every way, a model for his successors, a gifted Speaker, 
an expert on our parliamentary procedure and traditions, a 
far-sighted administrator to whom we owe a professional 
development program from which all his successors in the Chair 
have benefited. He was a gracious host and an impressive 
emissary. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lucien Lamoureux was a man of great intensity, who sought 
excellence in everything he did.  He drove himself hard and he 
made many personal sacrifices.  More often than not, he achieved 
his goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, he was also a man of great humility and humanity who 
disdained any kind of pretence, with the gift of making anyone 
feel at ease from the most distinguished dignitary to the most 
junior employees of the House. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After he retired in 1974, he continued to serve Canada well, as 
ambassador to Portugal and to Belgium.

service to the community.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am honoured to participate on behalf of the 
official opposition in this tribute to the Hon. Lucien Lamoureux, 
the esteemed gentleman who occupied your chair from 1966 to 1974. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The word distinguished does not seem adequate in describing Mr. 
Lamoureux.  Perhaps there is not a word in our lexicon that truly 
captures the nature and the capacity of this man. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the time of his formative years Mr. Lamoureux was destined 
for greatness.  He would stand out amongst his peers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Born in Ottawa in 1920, Mr. Lamoureux attended the University of 
Ottawa where he earned a Master's degree in philosophy before 
studying law at Osgoode Hall.  After graduating in 1945 he went 
to work for Lionel Chevrier, a cabinet minister in the 
governments of Mackenzie King and Louis St. Laurent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1954 he took a break from politics and opened a law practice 
in Cornwall.  His roots ran deep in the Liberal Party.  His work 
in Cornwall on behalf of the separate school board, the 
Children's Aid Society and the Community Chest were without 
equal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The urge to serve at the federal level was compelling for Mr. 
Lamoureux.  He sought federal office and was elected as MP for 
Stormont in 1962.  He immediately exhibited an interest and an 
ability in the rules and procedures of the House.  Always a 
measured and reflective man, his interest seemed a natural fit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Liberal Party came to power in 1963 he was appointed 
the Deputy Speaker.  He attended only two meetings of the Liberal 
caucus before deciding to withdraw in order to emphasize the 
impartial nature of his position.  Integrity, balance and 
fairness were hallmarks that would define this gentleman's nature 
in the time that followed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the 1965 general election, Prime Minister Lester 
Pearson nominated Mr. Lamoureux for the role of Speaker.  Mr. 
Lamoureux took the chair in 1966 and served as Speaker for eight 
years until 1974. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real statement of this gentleman's ability was the fact that 
he presided over two minority parliaments during his eight years 
as Speaker.  As Mr. Speaker can appreciate, this would be an 
onerous time for even the most serene individual.  Mr. Lamoureux 
carried it off with the usual aplomb, balance and calm.  It could 
have been an explosive time, particularly in February 1968 when 
the Pearson government lost a vote at third reading on a 
financial bill.  After much representation from all sides, 
Speaker Lamoureux was able to avoid disorder until adjournment 
hour at 10.00 p.m., a statement to his ability, rationale and his 
great knowledge of the rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By April 1968 Mr. Lamoureux had decided he would not fight 
another election as a member of a political party.  He asked for 
an all-party agreement to support his candidacy as an 
independent. Prime Minister Trudeau and opposition leader Robert 
Stanfield, in order to keep Mr. Lamoureux as Speaker, did not 
nominate candidates against him.  Mr. Lamoureux won a landslide 
victory over his NDP opponent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the 1972 general election Mr. Lamoureux announced that he 
would again run as an independent and won again in his riding of 
Stormont.  Once again he was Speaker.  By April 1974 he had been 
the Speaker in the chair for 3,010 days, surpassing the record 
held by Rudolphe Lemieux who was Speaker from 1922 to 1930. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In September 1974 he retired from politics and was shortly 
afterward appointed as ambassador to Belgium from 1974 to 1980. 
After that he was appointed as ambassador to Portugal from 1980 
to 1985.  Mr. Lamoureux said at the time of his retirement from 
politics “I believe I have done my share in serving my country 
and I will now leave it up to other men”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to add a more personal observation on this 
excellent individual for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was elected to this House in 1972 and had the honour of being 
recognized for the first time by Speaker Lamoureux on January 9, 
1973 in question period.  His reputation of impartiality was 
renowned and he was revered for fairness and objectivity by every 
single parliamentarian of the day.  I will never forget coming to 
this House and watching him in operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Columnists during Mr. Lamoureux's days as Speaker and columnists 
of today recognize him as the most adroit and neutral arbiter of 
competing politicians. 
Some have called him the best speaker in modern times.  While his 
style, wit and nature have been emulated, they have seldom been 
duplicated.

Assembly of British Columbia from 1987 to 1989.  I can admit that 
I drew upon examples of the rulings and temperament of Speaker 
Lamoureux more than once during my Speaker's role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you know in your capacity and in the manner you too 
strive for impartiality that some days your very sinew is tested 
in the job of Speaker.  It is an onerous job, but a richly 
rewarding one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fitting that Mr. Lamoureux received the Order of Canada 
before his passing.  It was another distinction bestowed on this 
most deserving of gentlemen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Lamoureux is the benchmark from which all others in the 
Speaker's chair will be judged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To his wife, Elizabeth, daughter Isabelle and stepchildren 
Emmanuel and Karen, I extend on behalf of Her Majesty's loyal 
official opposition our sincerest condolences.  Lucien Lamoureux 
is one of those parliamentarians and Speakers that comes but once

Quebecois, to offer our sincere condolences to the family and 
friends of a great parliamentarian, Lucien Lamoureux, who passed 
away on July 16 at the age of 77. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Lamoureux was born in Ottawa in 1920.  He studied philosophy 
at the University of Ottawa and went on to earn a law degree 
from Osgoode Hall in Toronto in 1945.  His first experience in 
the House of Commons was as assistant to Lionel Chevrier when he 
was a minister in the governments of Mackenzie King and Louis 
St-Laurent.  In 1954, Mr. Lamoureux left Parliament Hill to 
practice law in Cornwall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He returned to the House of Commons in 1962 as the Liberal 
member representing the people of Stormont—Dundas.  He was 
re-elected in 1963 and appointed Deputy Speaker.  Following the 
1965 election, he became Speaker of the House and remained so 
until his retirement from politics in 1974. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During that time, he presided over 3,010 days of debate.  He 
left his own mark on the Chair, because, in order to ensure the 
impartiality of the position of Speaker, he ran as an 
independent in the elections of 1968 and 1972 seeking the 
support of all parties.  Both times he was re-elected with a 
strong majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In September 1974, he gave up active political life.  He was 
appointed Canada's ambassador to Belgium and Luxembourg, a 
position he held until 1980.  From 1980 to 1985, he served as 
ambassador to Portugal. 
After his retirement from public life, in 1985, he settled in 
Belgium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently, Mr. Lamoureux was named an Officer of the Order of 
Canada, an honour he was to receive at the end of July. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Lamoureux spent many years of his life in the service of his 
fellow citizens and of this place of assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His family and friends should be proud of his accomplishments 
during his career.  It is an honour for me as a parliamentarian 
to pay tribute to this man who marked the history of the House 
of Commons.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want to add some personal observations of Mr. 
Lamoureux who passed away last summer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People have given his biography in the House, that he was 
elected several times and was Speaker of the House for six years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was first elected in 1968 and when I came here Lucien 
Lamoureux was really revered as the model parliamentarian and the 
model Speaker that we could all emulate as parliamentarians in 
this country.  He was extremely respected by all members of the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was elected in 1962 and 1965, and I am told when he was made 
Speaker in 1965 he left the Liberal caucus to sit as an 
independent member to show the independence of the speakership, 
which was extremely important in those days.  It was really a 
break in many ways from the tradition in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another observation that I had of him was the tremendous 
respect that people had for this man.  We have had many good 
Speakers. 
We have an excellent Speaker in the House today.  But I think 
Speaker Lamoureux is probably one of the greatest Speakers of all 
time.  In fact former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau said he was 
the greatest speaker since Confederation.  I certainly have 
tremendous confidence in him and would certainly echo the remarks 
of former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaker Lamoureux also had a tremendous ability.  It was the 
ability to calm this place, an ability to referee or adjudicate 
this place like none I had ever seen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember the minority parliament in 1972-74. There was a two 
seat difference between the governing Liberals and the opposition 
Tories with the NDP holding the balance of power. We also had the 
Social Credit Party led by Mr. Caouette. Those were days of great 
tensions and great debates in the House.  Mr. Lamoureux had 
tremendous respect.  He was able to keep this place running very 
efficiently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was also a time of tremendous parliamentary giants:  Pierre 
Trudeau, John Diefenbaker who sat right here, Tommy Douglas, 
David Lewis, Réal Caouette, many parliamentary giants, Stanley 
Knowles and Allan MacEachen to mention but a few. Mr. Lamoureux 
was able to rise to the occasion at all times and be a tremendous 
Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had tremendous respect for him. On behalf of our party, I want 
to extend our sympathy and condolences to his family and to his

Speaker, and after his years in the House of Commons this proud 
Franco-Ontarian represented his country as Canadian ambassador, 
first to Belgium and then to Portugal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Less than a year ago, I had the honour and pleasure of spending 
an hour in Mr. Lamoureux' company.  In his capacity as honorary 
Colonel of the Canadian NATO contingent, he had welcomed me on 
my visit to the military base in Geilenkirchen, Germany.  This 
title of honorary colonel was but one of many he received 
throughout his career.  He was very proud of his 
responsibilities within NATO and spoke with great eloquence 
about our soldiers working so hard in another country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lucien Lamoureux was a legend in his own time.  The standards of 
impartiality and integrity he imposed from the Chair of this 
House, and his stringent adherence to the rules while a 
representative in this House, left a path for his successors to 
follow.  Following on the example he set, the House requires 
very high standards of its speakers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I would like to thank the Lamoureux family for sharing him 
with Parliament and with this great country of Canada he loved 
so much.  He left a great heritage, one of which his family can 
continue to be justly proud for many generations to come.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> Dear colleagues, I wish to address my remarks 
directly to Lucien Lamoureux's children, Michel, Sylvie and 
Adèle, who are here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, I am speaking on behalf of my colleagues in the House 
of Commons, as well as on behalf of those here with us today 
who, like Lucien Lamoureux, once occupied this chair.  I join 
with you in paying tribute to the late Mr. Lamoureux, who, as 
was pointed out, was the Speaker from 1966 to 1974. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We share his family's sense of loss, but we want to join with 
them in celebrating his life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally, for all of us here in the House, and especially for 
me, one of his successors, what we will remember most is his 
distinguished contribution to the House of Commons and to 
parliamentary democracy throughout the world.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As the occupant of this chair, Mr. Lamoureux set a standard to 
be emulated.  This was said by the hon. member for West 
Vancouver—Sunshine Coast and I agree with him.  His eloquence 
and his unfailing fairness in judging the matters brought before 
him are often praised, as they have been today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I personally have been struck by is Speaker Lamoureux's 
gift for perspective when rendering a decision.  He was always 
careful to consider the specifics of the matter before him and to 
decide the case accordingly. Perhaps even more importantly for us 
who are here, he was always aware of the future consequences of 
the decisions he rendered for the institution, this institution 
which he so cherished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lucien Lamoureux presided over this House at a critical juncture 
in its procedural development.  His wisdom guides us still as we 
continue that evolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the international level, Speaker Lamoureux took the 
initiative of creating in 1969 the Conference of Commonwealth 
Speakers and Presiding Officers.  The words of its preamble best 
describe this initiative. “Commonwealth Speakers and presiding 
officers, irrespective of race, colour, religion or culture, are 
united by community of interest, respect for the rule of law and 
pursuit of the ideals of parliamentary democracy”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The conference that he began aims to maintain, foster and 
encourage the impartiality and fairness of speakers and presiding 
officers of parliaments through the promotion of knowledge and 
the understanding of parliamentary democracy in its various 
forms, and to develop parliamentary institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members have spoken today about their personal relationship 
with Mr. Lamoureux.  I did not have the pleasure of ever meeting 
him and I regret that a great deal.  Too long I postponed making 
direct contact with one of these, yes, one of the giants of us, 
the Speakers of the House of Commons.  We look to his decisions 
and we look to the manner with which he conducted himself and the 
business of this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At Kingsmere where Mr. Lamoureux lived, where I now live and 
these Speakers lived, he planted six trees that are there and are 
growing.  When he planted them, I am told they were about seven 
feet high. Even after the ice storm, three of them survived to 
full growth and they are well over 35 feet now.  There are many 
trees at Kingsmere of course.  Those trees were there with 
Mackenzie King and Mr. Lamoureux's trees are there now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is symbolic that he planted something that continues 
to grow.  We here in parliament are the recipients of the seeds 
of his wise decisions.  My colleagues and I who have sat in this 
chair realize full well the responsibilities of a Speaker.  You, 
my colleagues in this House, you too realize the importance of 
this institution to all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have lost a great Canadian.  He was ours.  He belonged to the 
House of Commons.  He belonged to Canada.  Yes, he belonged to 
you and you were good enough to share him with us.  We thank you 
for that.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>TOBACCO ACT 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK136"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on a point of privilege concerning the Minister 
of Health's non-enforcement of the Tobacco Act pending the 
passage of Bill C-42, an act to amend the Tobacco Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Documents from the minister's office demonstrate that the 
minister will not be enforcing certain measures in the Tobacco 
Act which comes into effect tomorrow, October 1, and will instead 
be enforcing the provisions of Bill C-42, which is still before 
the House at second reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask, Mr. Speaker, that you find the minister's presumption 
that Bill C-42 will pass, and his acting as if it has already 
passed, is a contempt of this House.  I would hope that based on 
my presentation you will allow me to move that this matter be 
referred to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing orders require that I raise this at the earliest 
possible opportunity.  I point out that this is the eve of 
October 1 and therefore the earliest possible time when this 
matter could be raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are provisions in the Tobacco Act regarding the ability of 
tobacco companies to sponsor public events that come into force 
on October 1.  The measures in Bill C-42 supersede those 
measures, but there is no way that Bill C-42 will be enacted by 
tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through his careless handling of this file, and introducing Bill 
C-42 at such a late date that there is no physical possibility of 
meeting the legislated deadline in the Tobacco Act, the minister 
has left this House and the concerned members of the public in a 
difficult quandary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As of tomorrow, the new restrictions on tobacco sponsorship 
under the Tobacco Act will have the force of law.  However, the 
government says that it will administer the Tobacco Act after 
October 1 as if Bill C-42 has passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me quote from a briefing document from the Minister of 
Health's office which briefs the minister on how to answer 
questions on Bill C-42.  The question is “What happens if the 
act is not in force by October 1, 1998 even if it is deemed to 
come into force on that date?”  The answer is “Given that my 
intentions are now known it would be appropriate for the 
department to administer the legislation as if the amendment was 
in effect as of October 1, 1998”. Mr. Speaker, I appended a copy 
of this document to the notice of this point of privilege that I 
delivered to your office earlier today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the Minister of Health to administer the Tobacco Act from 
tomorrow as if Bill C-42 had passed this House is in my opinion a 
clear contempt of this House.  When the Minister for 
International Trade earlier this year announced the formation of 
a Canada-China parliamentary association as if the House had 
created one when in fact it had not, you ruled, Mr. Speaker, on 
April 23, 1998: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In announcing the establishment of a Canada-China 
interparliamentary group and thereby prejudging a decision which 
has yet to be taken, the minister clearly overreached his 
authority.  I am somewhat disappointed that a minister of the 
crown in acting with such haste may have prejudiced the very 
outcome that he wished to bring about.  Such disregard for the 
administrative competence of parliament does nothing to enhance 
its prestige on the international stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members have expressed their frustration over other 
announcements by the government which appear to bypass the 
authority of the House.  As I have been reminded, this may have 
taken place on more than one occasion during this parliament.

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The evidence shows that in the case of Bill C-42 this has 
happened again.  Some might wish to argue that the government 
routinely collects new taxes announced in budgets before 
legislation passes through parliament and that this situation is 
comparable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However there is no comparison.  There is no reasonable 
alternative to collecting taxes once they are announced, for the 
obvious reason that individuals would take action to avoid them 
in the interval between the announcement and their enactment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time constraints surrounding Bill C-42 could have been to 
the contrary entirely avoidable.  The government obviously knew 
that the October 1 deadline was in place and it had the 
opportunity to introduce amendments in a timely manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is only through the carelessness of the government that we 
are now in a position of having to take the minister's intention 
as having the force of law.  If this practice were condoned and 
the published intention of a minister were to have the force of 
law on a routine basis, there would be no point in having 
parliament at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this reason, Mr. Speaker, I ask you to find that this 
constitutes a prima facie case of privilege and allow me to move 
that this matter be referred to the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Before I go to the government House leader I 
would put a question to the hon. member so that I understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member did send me copies of material that the minister 
was to have answered if he were asked a question.  My direct 
question is to you, my colleague.  Did the minister ever utter 
those words? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Not to my knowledge, Mr. 
Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I will to go to the government House leader. 
<P><A NAME="LINK137"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, there are a number of things 
wrong with the statement made by the hon. member on this alleged 
question of privilege and sometimes called contempt of the House 
as it has been referred to in her remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, she is referring to a law which she herself has said in 
her remarks was not yet applicable.  She said that the law would 
only be applicable starting tomorrow, so how can the 
non-administration of a law that is not yet a law be a question 
of privilege?  That is the first opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, whether or not a law is in force is not in itself a 
question of privilege, even if that law were already in effect. 
That is the second point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The documents to which the member has referred, according to 
her, are briefing notes for the benefit of a minister should he 
choose to use those notes to answer a hypothetical question which 
has not yet been raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons this is not a question of privilege. 
Finally, rest assured that I will not draw the parallel between 
this case and the raising of taxes.  The raising of taxes works 
under the process of an initiative of the crown and works by way 
of a ways and means motion.  Obviously that is not applicable in 
this case. 
<P><A NAME="LINK138"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  In view of the fact that I asked the 
hon. member and she answered that she did not know of the 
minister ever having said that, and in view of the fact that this 
is not October 1 and we are dealing with a hypothetical case and 
we would have to deal with a real case, I would rule at this time 
that there is no point of privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Mr. Speaker, take it under advisement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I thank the hon. member for his advice but I 
have already made the ruling.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I have read Beauchesne's.  I will give the 
hon. member about a minute to put the case, but unless I find 
there is something new I do not know about I will probably 
intervene again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not sure that I can 
cram it into a minute.  Beauchesne's fifth edition at page 34 
under the section entitled “Places of Members”, clearly states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members are allocated desks in the Chamber by the Speaker on the 
advice of the party Whips— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My argument is that our whip did not consent to this 
arrangement.  The arrangement I am talking about is putting us at 
this end of the Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We admit and acknowledge that we are the fifth party in the 
House of Commons, but following the general election of 1997 it 
was negotiated by all parties, us being the fifth party at the 
time, where we would be sitting.  That applied until last week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The byelection in Quebec changed the House in terms of our 
membership by one person.  That one person displaced an entire 
party to the other end of the Chamber.  I fundamentally disagree 
with that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK142"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member has every right to hold 
whatever opinion he wants.  The fact of the matter is that our 
tradition has been as follows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After an election the party that has the most seats has the 
first choice of the seats.  The second party, the second choice. 
The third party, the third; the fourth, the fourth; and the 
fifth, the fifth.  I am responsible for where independent members 
sit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would hope that we would always act in the House after 
discussions and collaboration, but at the end of the day seats 
must be assigned and I have followed the traditions of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no such thing as a bad seat in the House of Commons. We 
have all been elected in the same manner to sit in here as hon. 
members.  I accept the hon. member may well be frustrated and 
disappointed, as other members might well be with their seating 
arrangements, but the seating arrangements as they are will 
stand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member rising on another point of order?

<P><A NAME="LINK174"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief (for the Minister of Health, Lib.)</B> 
moved that Bill C-42, an act to amend the Tobacco Act, be read 
the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK175"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to begin in this House the second reading debate on 
Bill C-42. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-42 is a short bill.  It is a simple bill.  It proposes an 
amendment to the Tobacco Act and focuses on one aspect of the 
tobacco issue, and one issue alone, and that is the promotion of 
tobacco products through the sponsorship of events. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1550"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT23"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT23"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1550
<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the bill does is straightforward.  It will toughen the 
existing Tobacco Act.  It will take a piece of legislation that 
is already one of the strongest in the world and make it even 
stronger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would ban the promotion of tobacco sponsorships 
following a five year transition period.  Although the bill is 
short, it is not an isolated action.  It builds on the enormous 
step forward which our government took in proposing the Tobacco 
Act and which the last parliament took in passing the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That act, members will recall, takes aim squarely at the number 
one cause of preventable death and disease in Canadian society. 
Its goal is to protect and promote the health of all Canadians. 
It is aimed specifically at keeping children and young people 
from starting to smoke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health facts are clear.  Last year more than 40,000 
Canadians died of tobacco related illnesses.  That means that 
each day, on average, more than 100 Canadians died with tobacco 
standing in the background.  Many of those people died of heart 
disease.  Others died of lung disease.  Still others fell victim 
to cancer or some of the many other illnesses that have their 
roots in the use of tobacco products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some worrisome trends that could add to that toll over 
time.  The percentage of young people between the ages of 15 and 
19 who smoke has actually risen in recent years.  We need to take 
continued and effective action to reverse those trends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we must approach this in a way that recognizes that 
tobacco is a unique product, yet we simply cannot ban it. Tobacco 
is addictive and over time it is often deadly.  It has made its 
way throughout our culture and indeed cultures throughout the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that to combat something that pervasive, 
simplistic solutions simply do not work.  For that reason the 
federal government's approach to tobacco control has included a 
variety of elements.  Legislation, educational programs and 
taxation have all been part of this mix. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increasingly we have taken steps to affect other aspects of the 
process that lead young people to smoke.  An important focus of 
the Tobacco Act was to cut the exposure of young Canadians to 
tobacco promotion.  Tobacco advertising had been prohibited for 
some time and the Tobacco Act continues restrictions in a manner 
that we believe reflects the charter of rights and freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as traditional advertising avenues were closed off to 
the tobacco industry they seized on the use of event sponsorships 
and promotions. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to research, the people who market tobacco products 
are no different from those marketing any other product. They 
all seek to understand consumer behaviour, especially the 
behaviour of consumers who are likely to start using their 
product.  We know they are studying the various factors involved 
in making the decision to smoke. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So who are they studying?  Something like 90% of all smokers 
start before they are 20 years old, usually well before.  In fact 
we can even say as young as 12.  So they must logically be an 
important target. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like all marketers, these tobacco people want potential 
customers to associate their brands with positive images.  More 
than that they want to get their product names in front of as 
many people as possible.  They want tobacco products to be linked 
to events and activities that people enjoy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With less and less recourse to traditional advertising, 
association with sports, cultural and other community events has 
become very important.  Events take on cigarette names.  Posters 
and billboards advertising them are everywhere.  Therefore 
people, especially young people, become familiar with the brands, 
the logos and the overall presence of tobacco in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We might say in this regard that familiarity breeds contempt, not 
by itself and not in a simple, direct and crystal clear line, yet 
there it is.  There are many factors that influence a 15 year 
old's decision to smoke.  There are many steps between a first 
puff and a consistent pack a day addiction.  But the research 
indicates that event promotion is a very significant factor in 
the overall smoking decision process of our young people. Tobacco 
brand names can seem to become innocuous, present everywhere, as 
if they were a normal consumer product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In making these points about the health impacts of smoking or 
the importance of event marketing to the tobacco industry, I am 
simply restating some important points that were made during the 
debate on the Tobacco Act in the last parliament.  Perhaps more 
important, I am simply restating points that were made on both 
sides of the House and in the other place in that debate.

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This House has historically demonstrated its awareness that 
smoking kills.  Historically it has demonstrated that its support 
for measures to cut tobacco use by young people are correct and 
necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same was true with the Tobacco Act.  Mr. Speaker, I am sure 
you recall the outcome of that debate.  Reformers, New Democrats 
and Progressive Conservatives stood with us on it.  They stood 
with the 91% of Canadians who support efforts by government to 
discourage young people from becoming addicted to tobacco.  They 
stood with the 73% of Canadians who support efforts to discourage 
smoking among people who already smoke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was only the Bloc that opposed the Tobacco Act, and that was 
largely because of concerns about the impact of sponsorship 
restrictions on events.  Now that the Parti Quebecois government 
has moved in the same direction as we moved a year ago, I am 
confident that opposition will change there as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, some people outside this parliament expressed 
concerns about sponsorship restrictions.  Event organizers were 
concerned that they would not be able to line up new sponsors 
quickly enough.  Some people in communities that look to these 
events for tourism dollars were concerned about the possible loss 
of those marquee events. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A particular area that drew some attention was the impact of the 
Tobacco Act on motor sports.  If you have ever watched a race you 
will have noticed that every possible space is adorned with 
advertising:  the cars, the racing suits, the facilities.  They 
are all full of logos of sponsors.  Those logos are often of 
tobacco brands that Canadians, Americans, Europeans and Asians 
use.  Because of the concerns of event organizers it was agreed 
that the federal government would take another look at tobacco 
sponsorship and motor sports.  But I must add that this should 
never have been seen as a carte blanche to water down our 
commitment to reduce tobacco use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time we said that we would respect the charter of rights 
and freedoms, that we would respect international standards and 
that we would respect the health obligations and objectives of 
the Tobacco Act.  As we consulted we heard from event organizers 
and we heard from health groups that were concerned with the 
potential influence of sponsorship on young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the process we remained determined to make this act even 
more solid than it was already.  In the end we decided that we 
could not and would not create one set of rules for some motor 
sports events and another for everyone else.  We recognized that 
we did and had to treat all currently sponsored events equally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also determined that we were being presented with an 
opportunity to really fine-tune the sponsorship provisions of the 
Tobacco Act, and the result is Bill C-42. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now turn to the regime the bill sets out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the core of this bill is a five year transition period. 
During that time we will move to a total ban on the display of 
tobacco brand elements in sponsorship promotions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two types of events for the purpose of this bill.  The 
first type includes events that were in existence and had tobacco 
company sponsors before April 25, 1997.  If parliament agrees, 
these events would begin with a two year period under the status 
quo.  Tobacco promotion would be able to continue for that two 
years and we would continue to allow off site and on site 
promotions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next phase for those grandfathered events would last three 
years.  On site promotions involving tobacco product related 
brand elements would continue at those events, but these 
promotions could only be in place for the duration of the event. 
We would close off opportunities for off site promotion and we 
would impose a 90:10 rule that appears in the Tobacco Act on 
those that are permitted.  That is to say, only the bottom 10% of 
the space in the promotional material can display tobacco brand 
elements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Direct mailings to identified adults would be permitted, but 
banners with large tobacco logos on lampposts all over town would 
not be.  Advertizing in publications with primarily adult 
readership would be permitted, but placement in corner stores of 
posters with cigarette names in bold, big type would end. 
Promotions such as tent cards in bars, which are legally off 
limits to young people, would be acceptable, but the same tent 
cards in regular restaurants would not be.

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short we would cut the tobacco marketers' off-site access to 
young people dramatically.  That stage would end after three 
years, as I said.  That brings us to five years from the date 
this amendment to the Tobacco Act would come into force.  On that 
date, tobacco sponsorship promotions would end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second group of events are those in which sponsorships began 
on or after April 25, 1997.  Those events will not be 
grandfathered.  The restrictions currently in the Tobacco Act 
would apply to these events and after five years, the days of 
complacent sponsorship promotions will end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the timetable that we hope parliament will allow us to 
pursue, in the latter part of the year 2003 there will be a total 
ban on tobacco sponsorship promotions whether on-site or 
off-site.  There will be no legal ability to display tobacco 
related product brand elements on sponsorship promotions. Tobacco 
brand elements will not be associated with permanent arts and 
sports facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That ban is more than even the Tobacco Act originally envisaged. 
That act would have simply brought in the 90-10 rule as a new 
status quo. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have gone one step further in protecting the health of 
Canadians by cutting any ties between appealing and wholesome 
activities and tobacco consumption. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some may ask why we have decided on a period of five years.  The 
five year transition period provides event organizers with plenty 
of time and plenty of opportunities to seek alternative sponsors. 
In our consultations with those organizers, it was clear that if 
we were determined to eliminate the use of sponsorship as a 
promotional vehicle for tobacco products, and we are, then they 
wanted time to make alternative arrangements and they could.  In 
fact I know that process has already begun. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, we as a government are very pleased that Air Canada 
will become the new title sponsor of the Formula One Canadian 
Grand Prix next year.  We believe that the five year time frame 
will allow other event organizers to demonstrate to other 
potential sponsors how valuable an association with their event 
can be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this was all we were doing on tobacco control, it would be 
noteworthy enough.  Yet we are actually doing far more and that 
is why Canada is recognized as a world leader in tobacco control. 
Indeed we keep track of the steps that other governments are 
taking on this issue.  I want to tell my hon. colleagues on both 
sides of this chamber that our approach is consistent with 
evolving international standards. Let me offer some examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The European Union recently announced that it is moving in the 
same direction as we are.  It intends to ban tobacco sponsored 
promotions by the year 2006.  It intends to pursue a transitional 
strategy on the way to that ban. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Australia announced last week that it too will totally prohibit 
tobacco sponsored promotions by the year 2006. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States is moving ahead on actions that will limit the 
exposure of children to tobacco promotion in ways that are 
consistent with much that is already in our Tobacco Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is on a course to beat them all.  Our legislation is 
among the toughest and most far reaching in the world.  The 
initiatives that the Tobacco Act enables us to take include the 
regulation of the product, its components and emissions, more 
comprehensive reporting requirements for tobacco companies and 
stricter regulations on sales of tobacco products to minors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also backed up by our continuing efforts to promote and 
protect health through anti-tobacco initiatives.  For example 
last June we announced $100 million in spending on the tobacco 
control initiative.  We are proud of that.  That money followed 
through on a commitment that our government made during last 
year's election.  It was a commitment that we were proud to keep 
because it was really an investment in the health of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tobacco control initiative is co-ordinated and it is 
comprehensive.  It pays particular attention to tobacco use among 
children and teens, groups vulnerable to taking up smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reducing the health damage caused by tobacco consumption is 
increasingly an issue, not only for the federal government but 
for our colleagues in the provincial governments as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A New Democratic government in British Columbia has taken legal 
steps against tobacco companies because of the costs their 
products place on the health care system. 
In Quebec, the Parti Quebecois government has passed strong 
legislation that among other things restricts tobacco sales to 
minors and the promotion of tobacco products.

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both provincial strategies complement our own actions at the 
federal level.  They complement our legislative and health 
promotion approaches.  They demonstrate, just as the history of 
tobacco control legislation does here, that this is not a 
partisan issue.  It is a health issue. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After all, that is the purpose of this bill, a short and 
straightforward piece of legislation that establishes a new and 
stricter framework for tobacco promotion through sponsorship and 
paves the way for the elimination of sponsorship by the year 
2003. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It positions us to be heard and be ahead of the United States, 
most European states and Australia, all countries that have their 
own solid records on tobacco control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The action that this bill proposes, together with the 
restrictions set out in the Tobacco Act as well as our tobacco 
control initiative are individual parts of a unified strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are continuing to work and invest significant resources to 
reduce smoking in Canada.  We are taking action that we hope and 
believe will help reduce the percentage of young people who take 
up smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill then is ultimately about the health of Canadians. It 
is about making a strong piece of legislation even stronger, all 
the while making it more realistic.  It is a bill that I believe 
merits the support of all parties in this House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I speak today on Bill 
C-42, I would like to say that because it is a health issue it is 
certainly a non-partisan issue. One thing that my constituents 
have asked of me as I come here is to try not to critique just 
for the sake of critiquing.  I think the public expectation of 
agreement where health is at stake is a fairly universal one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was a little surprised not to see the Minister of Health rise 
to speak to this bill.  I have gone back and looked in 
<I>Hansard</I>, in that tobacco bills are fairly major pieces of 
legislation, and I have not found another indication where the 
health minister had not done so.  In fact, I went back just today 
to look at what happened on tobacco control in the last 
government prior to the last parliament. I wanted to make a 
comparison and of course, the health minister of that day, Jake 
Epp, was here in person.  I think that was an interesting 
omission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On tobacco, we should judge not by rhetoric so much as by actual 
results.  I noted a few quotes from the member for 
Waterloo—Wellington as he went through his speech. I would like 
to repeat these quotes.  “This bill will toughen the Tobacco 
Act” and “This should never be seen as an attempt to water down 
our commitment to reduce youth smoking”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I went back 10 years almost exactly, to 1987 and the second 
reading debate on the tobacco bill that was being passed then.  I 
found quotes that are eerily similar.  If I might quote from Jake 
Epp on Bill C-51, “The government has concluded that legislation 
banning all tobacco product advertising is the only acceptable 
option”.

have done with those noble goals we set out on back in 1988. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-51 banned all tobacco ads.  If I did not miss it, I think 
that is what we are doing again today.  It is only 10 years 
hence.  It is 10 years down the road.  So how have we done?  What 
happened to Bill C-51? It was considered a breakthrough. 
Sponsorship would only be allowed in corporate names. Sponsorship 
would not be allowed so that companies could sponsor and children 
would make a direct connection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a very rapid incorporation of brand names. They became 
corporate names.  The law was circumvented.  It was circumvented 
so fast it would make one's head spin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In September 1995 Bill C-51 was struck down saying that it was 
too restrictive on the freedom of the companies involved.  We 
moved on to April 1997 where Bill C-71 came along, a Tobacco Act 
which banned advertising, this time directed at our youth.  It 
would be tough to disagree with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party and I supported that bill.  We supported it vigorously. 
In fact we prevented procedural wrangling as we supported it. 
Sponsorship in Bill C-71 would be banned tomorrow, the day after 
today.  I am not speaking figuratively.  On October 1, 1998 
sponsorship would be banned if Bill C-71 was passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hark back to the quote from the member who said that this 
should not be misconstrued as weakening our resolve directed 
toward youth.  I say judge by the results, not by the rhetoric. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are debating Bill C-42 today.  It will provide an 
effective delay of five years directed toward advertising to our 
youth.  If that is not a weakening, I have never seen a 
weakening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1988 parliament said no to cigarette ads.  In 1998 we are 
here saying the same thing.  In 2003 when this bill will come 
into complete force if the effective date is tomorrow, does 
anyone really believe that those ads will be gone?  I ask that in 
deep sincerity.  Does anyone really believe this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What objective gauge is there of the effectiveness of our 
anti-tobacco measures?  I believe there are four.  I would like 
to go over each one of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The number one gauge of how effective we are is the number of 
smokers, especially our youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second good gauge is the number of cigarettes those smokers 
smoke.   It is fairly easy to graph that.  This is followed by 
epidemiologists across the world. How have we done with the 
number of smokers and the number of cigarettes they smoke? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since about 1970 the U.S. and Canada had a wonderful record of 
smoking coming down in lockstep, the two lines coming down 
together.  In 1993 the U.S. continued to plunge and Canada rose. 
Something happened in 1993 in Canada that was the responsibility 
of the government of the day.  I will not spend a lot of time on 
that but it was a mistake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, we can judge how we are doing by the profitability of the 
tobacco manufacturing companies.  From the records we find that 
in 1988, 10 years ago, Players made a profit of $308 million; in 
1997, 10 years hence, it made $775 million.  Rothmans in 1988 
made $54.55 million; today, $112.3 million. They say that is 
because they have been very effective in branching out.  We all 
know they are effective because they are selling more smokes to 
more Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we can judge our government's commitment to tobacco use 
reduction by youth by what the government is spending on 
educational programs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is spending $20 million per year over the next five year, if 
it spends it, and it takes in $2,000 million per year in tax 
revenue.  It is 1% toward those education components.  That is 
not good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why the weakening?  Why have we got a weakening?  Let me be so 
plain, there is a weakening here.  Formula One was used as a lever. 
I am the keenest formula one fan so I watch this with great 
interest.  It was in Montreal.  There was a threat that it would 
leave Montreal.  There was a unity component to it and there was 
an election just coming up.  So there was a quiet, private little 
commitment to the Formula One crew that logos would still be 
allowed.  If that is allowed the government says that it better 
allow it to everyone else.  That is what it has done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is happening in Formula One elsewhere?  Members heard what 
the member from Wellington said about Formula One in some 
countries.  Let me be more specific about what countries are 
doing that are serious about this issue.  If anybody watched 
Formula One this year they saw no signs on the Ferraris the 
Williams cars, the Benneton cars and the Mild Seven cars. 
France, Germany and the United Kingdom stood firm and powerful. 
They were not timid.  Belgium next year will have no signs on 
Formula One cars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bernie Ecclestone, a billionaire, the head of the governing body 
of Formula One, the F1A, has promised that he will voluntarily ban 
tobacco sponsorship by the year 2002 if the relationship showing 
sponsorship increase and smoking is established.  The head of the 
whole group is ready to do this voluntarily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Air Canada has stepped up to be the title sponsor for Formula 
1. Is that an unusual thing?  The world is moving rapidly. 
Canada is moving timidly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What other major events in Canada have also seen their 
sponsorship replaced?  The Canadian open is now sponsored by Bell 
Canada.  It used to be sponsored by a tobacco company.  Women's 
tennis is now sponsored by Corel.  I give those companies high 
marks for coming in and replacing sponsorship which was 
inappropriate.  Healthy vigorous activities are being sponsored 
by companies that are not promoting health and vigour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the event is popular and visible new sponsors will move in to 
replace those cigarette sponsors?  What type of sponsors?  There 
are the banks, oil companies, computer firms and the list goes 
on.  Here are the things they would sponsor.  I would like the 
public to listen to the type of things, the active and healthy 
things.  There is tennis and jazz.  Maybe everybody smokes in a 
quiet jazz bar.  There is show jumping, golf, the rest of auto 
racing, fireworks, white water rafting, extreme ski racing, 
hydroplane racing and country music concerts.  I cannot imagine 
how those events will not find sponsorship that is proper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me finish off by going back to another quote which reflects 
on Bill C-42: “Our legislation is among the toughest in the 
world”.   I have talked to health groups from across this 
country.  Not one single health group agrees with the member for 
Waterloo—Wellington.  By all objective assessments, the 
government looks, acts and talks tough on tobacco but the 
Liberals are defensive, timid and moving in reverse when it comes 
to protecting our youth. 
<P><A NAME="LINK177"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am glad of the opportunity to speak to Bill C-42, an act to amend 
the Tobacco Act.  I do not think anyone in the House would 
minimize the importance of this act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tobacco consumption poses one of the most serious risks we have 
to the health of Canadians. 
I was very glad to hear the Minister of Health say that in the 
House today in answer to a question during question period.  I am 
just sorry that he chose to send one of his lower echelon members 
of the health committee to speak rather than himself because it 
shows I guess the kind of importance he attaches to the bill.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even those people who choose to use tobacco products will agree 
that it is a lifestyle choice that could lead to serious illness 
or early death.  There are literally thousands of studies by 
competent health care professionals that attest to this fact. The 
issue of risk to health is not really the issue here.  It is 
rather the one of whether the government takes seriously its role 
through Health Canada to protect the health interests of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that in presenting Bill C-42 the government is not 
fully accepting this responsibility.  It is a step in the right 
direction but it hardly goes far enough.  Why in the world would 
we in the Reform Party oppose the bill when it ostensibly 
purports to decrease the influence of the tobacco industry over 
the general public and young people in particular?  Simply put, 
because it will not really do that in the long run.  Why do I say 
that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, it allows tobacco companies to use retail ads and 
billboards to advertise cigarettes to children. Ten years have 
passed since parliament first told the tobacco companies to take 
their advertising material out of the corner stores of this 
nation, to get them off the streets of Canada. Instead, Bill C-42 
continues to give the tobacco companies another two years to 
reach Canadian kids on their way to school and in the stores they 
frequent.  That is just not acceptable.  If the government and 
the minister were really concerned about our children they would 
shut the door tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have eight children.  Three of the four oldest had brief times 
in their lives when they smoked.  I am happy to say that none of 
them smokes today, but it was not because of the government's 
poor attempt to curtail the advertising of tobacco products when 
they were in their teenage years.  It was because of good peer 
pressure from both family and friends who continued to remind 
them of the terrible health risks of smoking: the threat of 
cancer of the lungs and throat, the damage to a healthy heart 
that is sustained by prolonged smoking, breathing that becomes 
hard and laboured, fingers that are discoloured, not to mention 
the damage that second hand smoke does to innocent children and 
family members who have exercised their right not to smoke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In two years' time how many children will begin to smoke because 
of the advertising campaigns of the big tobacco companies?  How 
many will get cancer in later years?  How many will eventually 
die?  Do the minister and the government want to have the blood 
of these young people on their hands? I urge the government to 
reconsider the bill and force the tobacco companies to cease this 
advertising immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot support the bill also because it allows lifestyle 
advertising of cigarettes to continue.  The Tobacco Act says 
tobacco companies can advertise but not with lifestyle ads.  In 
my estimation that is entirely appropriate. These are the ads 
that somehow convey to young people that smoking is fun.  There 
is no fun in shortness of breath, no fun in irregular heartbeats, 
no fun in the loss of taste and smell, no fun in the pain of 
lingering cancer, no fun in that at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, I cannot support the bill because it does not guarantee 
that sponsorship promotion will end in the five years as 
promised. The government would have Canadians believe that Bill 
C-42 will make sure there is a total ban on sponsorship in five 
years.  But the way the date is set allows the government to 
reset the clock and allow further extensions without coming back 
to parliament. That is wrong and furthermore it is undemocratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 5 of section 52 says: “The governor in council may by 
regulation prescribe a day for the purposes of—”, that is 
beginning the countdown to restrictions and ban of cigarette 
sponsorship ads. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1625"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT30"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT30"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1625

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What that means is that using “may” instead of “shall” 
allows the government to give a permanent extension by neglecting 
to set the date.  It means this government can test the political 
wind and see which way it is blowing and continue to stall on 
this if it is not to its political advantage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It means that the powerful tobacco lobby will have more 
opportunity to influence the government's decision.  It means 
this government, if it continues in office for the next five 
years, perish the thought, could simply let this thing slowly 
disappear into the sunset never to be heard of again. I believe 
Canadians feel that is totally unacceptable.  It shows once again 
little regard for the health of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also cannot support this bill because allowing sponsorship 
advertising has already increased the retail advertising of 
cigarettes.  A Health Canada survey shows that since the Tobacco 
Act came into force, retail advertising for cigarettes has 
actually gone up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada has commissioned two surveys of tobacco 
advertising in retail outlets conducted by A.C. Neilson of 
approximately 5,000 retailers.  The first survey was conducted in 
1997 when there was no legislative ban on tobacco advertising. 
The second was conducted in September 1997, five months after the 
passage of the Tobacco Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the results?  In five months the survey showed a 1.4% 
increase in sponsorship ads.  These ads very subtly allow a local 
event, perhaps held in Pumpkin Corners, B.C., which would draw 
perhaps 1,000 people locally, to be advertised in over 10,000 
retail outlets across the country.  Why?  At the bottom of the ad 
prominently displayed is the name of the tobacco company as the 
sponsor of an event that has relevance only to the 1,000 souls in 
Pumpkin Centre.  From my point of view that is not honest 
advertising and it should not be allowed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The big events like the Canadian Grand Prix have maintained that 
without this kind of advertising and support from the tobacco 
companies they will simply fold up and die.  This claim, however, 
is not holding up in the face of reality.  For example, the 
Canadian Grand Prix, as my colleague has already mentioned, has a 
new title sponsor in Air Canada replacing Players, a cigarette 
brand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If an event is an outstanding contributor to the Canadian 
cultural or sports scene it will find a sponsor who will see it 
as a great and glorious opportunity to advertise their company or 
product.  These events do not need tobacco advertising to exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is for these reasons that I cannot support this bill.  My 
only hope is that as it comes to the health committee for study 
we will see an all party consensus to make substantial amendments 
to it that will truly make it a bill that will safeguard the 
health of Canadians.  If it passes third reading the way it is it 
will be just another example of an uncaring Liberal government 
that listens to big business before ordinary Canadians, a 
government that procrastinates while the health of young people 
is in jeopardy, a government that, as in many other instances, 
does not keep its word. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all caring members of this House to oppose this bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK178"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am rising 
today to speak on Bill C-42.  My approach will be somewhat 
different from those of my colleagues who have already spoken. I 
would particularly like to address it from a more technical 
point of view, perhaps a little more difficult one as a result. 
I would, however, like my view of the bill to still be clear 
enough to be interesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-42 defers certain provisions of the Tobacco Act, the 
current act concerning tobacco company sponsorships.  The 
amendments bring in a two-year moratorium on the prohibition of 
tobacco sponsorship promotions, i.e. until October 2000. 
Between the third and the fifth year, the restrictions will 
apply as initially set out in the current act, which is that 10% 
of sign advertising will be allowed, until the total ban kicks 
in on October 1, 2003.  At that time, in other words, all 
tobacco company sponsorship signs will be totally banned.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This initiative is in response to a request made by the Bloc 
Quebecois and by all organizers of sports or cultural events, to 
give time to these organizers to find other sources of funding. 
It is, however, deplorable that the government is backtracking 
and refusing to contribute to the compensation fund that has 
been set up in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to understand what Bill C-42 is all about, it is 
important to keep its origins in mind as well as the grounds for 
the government's decision to re-examine the conditions the 
current act had set for sponsorships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will recall that, in September 1995, a decision by the 
supreme court invalidated the provisions of the Tobacco Products 
Control Act pertaining to advertising, thus creating a legal 
void on the issue and enabling the tobacco industry to resume 
its advertising. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true, the industry voluntarily set up a code of ethics for 
itself, but, once again, as with the voluntary moratorium on 
medically assisted human reproductive technologies, this 
voluntary code was, to all intents and purposes, never really 
enforced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Health at the time tabled in December 1995 the 
outline of the anti smoking strategy the government intended to 
introduce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It contained restrictions on advertising and on tobacco 
sponsorships, standards for young people's access to tobacco, 
packaging and labelling requirements, reporting requirements for 
the companies and, finally, restrictions on points of sale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, this master plan provided for total regulation of 
tobacco products at all stages, from their manufacture to their 
points of sale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only one thing was missing, provision for compensation of the 
groups that had been sponsored by the tobacco companies.  This 
sponsorship would be significantly reduced, if not eliminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More than a year after the Supreme Court decision, which 
overturned a number of the provisions in the Tobacco Products 
Control Act, more than a year after the master plan of the 
former Health Minister was tabled, the government finally 
introduced some measures to counteract the ill effects of 
smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has always been in favour of the principle of 
protecting public health, which is why we voted in favour of the 
bill at second reading.  Far be it from me to disagree with the 
harmful effects of smoking my colleagues in the Reform Party 
have listed.  Who could be against everything possible being 
done to do away with smoking?  Certainly not the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although we voted in favour of the bill at second reading,  the 
feeling that we have acted on principle ought not to prevent us 
from seeing the impact of our actions on society. 
Unfortunately, the tobacco bill, its good measures 
notwithstanding, swept under the rug the whole issue of sports 
and cultural events.  These were, unavoidably, going to feel the 
impact of the bill, mainly because of the de facto ban on 
tobacco company sponsorship without any plan for compensation, 
as we know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois therefore voted against Bill C-71 at third 
reading, and I will explain why we did so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The measures relating to sponsorships impacted in a very serious 
way on sports and cultural events.  The Bloc Quebecois called 
upon the ministers of health and of heritage to offer financial 
compensation and to act like politicians responsible for their 
actions. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1635"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the minister at the time, David Dingwall, failed to 
assume his responsibilities and refused categorically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-71 was constructed in such a way that a number of clauses 
simply gave the minister the power to regulate in various areas, 
without defining the scope of these regulations.  In fact, all 
of the clauses in Bill C-71 referred to future regulations.  This 
was tantamount to giving the Minister of Health a blank cheque 
and seriously complicated our work as elected officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not wish to accuse anyone of bad faith, but the government 
must not get into the habit of introducing this sort of bill, 
much of which cannot be debated in the House or in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot let the accelerated passage of this bill go unnoticed. 
At second reading, debate was limited to a single speaker from 
the Bloc Quebecois.  During committee deliberations, the Bloc 
Quebecois had to fight for an additional half day to hear 
witnesses.  Originally, barely a day and a half had been set 
aside for this stage.  This was really ridiculous. We wait 
nearly two years for the government to decide to introduce a 
bill and in committee we are asked to debate it in a day and a 
half at breakneck speed.  This is really unusual, and I hope the 
government will stop this practice, because it really does not 
respect the members' work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, although we agree completely with the protection of 
health, as I mentioned earlier, we have not forgotten that this 
is a provincial jurisdiction and that Bill C-71 allowed the 
federal government once again to interfere in a sector that the 
provinces are quite capable of managing on their own, as 
evidenced by the recent tobacco legislation passed in Quebec 
City. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-42, however, was introduced by the federal Minister of 
Health on June 3, one year after the promise made by the Prime 
Minister on the eve of the last federal election.  Faced with 
the outcry that greeted Bill C-71 in Quebec, primarily among 
organizers of sports and cultural events, the Prime Minister 
made a promise during the election campaign to amend his 
anti-smoking legislation, obviously in order to win a few votes 
in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the primary goal of this amendment was to repair the 
damage done by the federal government's error, Bill C-42 also 
refers to several draft regulations, the effect of which will be 
to clamp down even harder on the production methods and products 
of tobacco companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the Tobacco Act took effect on April 25, 1997, 
manufacturers and importers were required to provide certain 
information regarding tobacco sales, ingredients and 
advertising.  What I wanted to focus on here are the measures 
and regulations that place greater restrictions on tobacco 
companies, and their effect on those companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the new regulations, better information would be obtained 
from manufacturers on tobacco sales, ingredients, research, as 
well as the manufacturing, distribution and promotion of tobacco 
products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding sales and toxic components, it also proposed to extend 
current disclosure requirements to include all categories of 
tobacco products, including cigarettes, cigarette tobacco, pipe 
tobacco, cigars, smokeless tobacco, clove tobacco and the 
hand-rolled Indian cigarettes called bidis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Studies are also covered. Under the proposed regulations, 
tobacco manufacturers would be required to disclose and list any 
study on the toxicity or health effects of their products, the 
taste and aroma of tobacco products, the improvement or 
development of tobacco products, as well as the ingredients they 
contain. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1640"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This information would promote a better understanding of how 
tobacco products are modified so that regulations can eventually 
be proposed to reduce the impact of smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to promotional activities, manufacturers and 
importers of all types of tobacco products would be required to 
disclose promotional activities and sponsorship promotions by 
brand name and province for any event, activity or facility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main thrust of Bill C-42 is to amend the existing Tobacco 
Act to extend the transition period before the restrictions 
already provided for in the act come into effect. This is the 
kind of common sense the Bloc Quebecois tried to inject into the 
debate when Bill C-71 was introduced over a year ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first phase, spanning two years after the amendment is 
enacted, will extend the status quo regarding promotion both on 
and off the site of events and activities sponsored by a tobacco 
company before April 25, 1997. Tobacco sponsorship promotions 
will not be subject to any restriction under federal 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second phase, lasting three years after the two years of 
transition, will again extend the status quo for promotions at 
the site of sponsored events and activities, by permitting the 
display of product-related brand elements in promotional material 
throughout the site of events; permit sponsorship promotions on 
the site of an event as it unfolds or according to other 
regulatory provisions; and apply the existing 90/10 restriction—10% 
advertising at the bottom of a sign—to sponsorship 
promotions off site.  These promotions will be permitted in 
mailings sent directly to adults who are identified by name, in 
publications whose readership is essentially adult and in bars 
and taverns where minors are denied access by law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third aspect of the amendment is the considerable toughening 
up of the Tobacco Act in relation to the bill passed in April. 
Where some might have interpreted the 10% rule as a breach, 
there is no longer any doubt.  We are talking zero tolerance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This total prohibition will take effect immediately following 
the five year transition period.  At that point, the Tobacco Act 
will prohibit all promotional sponsorship by tobacco companies. 
It will also prohibit the appearance of brand elements on 
permanent facilities or in them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With such measures, Canada is following the worldwide trend to 
set more and more restrictions on the sponsorship and 
promotional activities of tobacco companies.  The European Union 
intends to prohibit all industry sponsorship by 2006.  A number 
of signatory countries have already prohibited all tobacco 
advertising and sponsorship within their borders.  New Zealand, 
Australia and the United States have—or are heading toward—a 
total ban. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The total ban after October 1, 2003 is therefore ahead of a 
number of countries, but the extended deadline makes it possible 
to take a sensible approach which will avoid numerous problems 
at the international level, for Formula I in particular, as well 
as on the economic level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with Bill C-42 is the lack of any transition fund, 
any compensation.  The Bloc Quebecois feels that jurisdiction 
over health ought to be left to the provinces.  Health is a 
provincial jurisdiction—a Quebec jurisdiction, in our case—and 
we denounce the current situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be kept in mind that health is, as I have said, a 
provincial area of jurisdiction, although the numerous federal 
incursions into it tend to make some people lose sight of that 
fact.  The provincial level is therefore the main one on which 
health protection initiatives need to be designed and 
implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give you an overview of the tobacco legislation 
Quebec has just implemented, which will perhaps give you a more 
informed view of a bill we feel is a very intelligent one.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill of Quebec's Minister of Health Jean Rochon was 
introduced on May 14, 1998 and passed unanimously on June 17, 
1998.  The bill received a favourable reception from the media, 
the health organizations, the organizers of sporting and 
cultural events, and the general public.  The Quebec Minister of 
Health avoided the pitfalls of the federal Liberals by adopting 
an approach that was far more attuned to reality, while at the 
same time bringing in new standards for the anti-smoking 
campaign.  His bill is bolder as far as content is concerned, 
yet more flexible as far as application is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the prohibition of sponsorships, the provincial 
legislation gives organizers of events a choice between two 
types of transition: they either discontinue all tobacco 
sponsorship activities by October 1, 2000, and have access to a 
financial assistance program running until October 1, 2003, 
which is the Quebec government solution, or they will be subject 
to a five-year transition with restrictions after October 1, 
2000, and forfeit the financial assistance, as provided for in 
the bill before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this bill, sponsorship contracts already signed with 
tobacco companies can be honoured and renewed up to October 1, 
2000. However, the Quebec legislation imposes as ceiling on the 
value of such contracts the maximum contracted amount as of June 
11, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organisers have until October 1, 2000, to make a choice. 
For those who choose the second transition option, the amendment 
states that sponsorship promotion may continue on the site where 
an activity is held and during this activity for three more 
years after October 1, 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Being able to choose between two options, each having its 
advantages and drawbacks, is another example of a balance 
between laxity and rigidity. To achieve this balance, Quebec 
finance minister Bernard Landry agreed to use part of the extra 
income generated by the recent tax increase imposed on tobacco 
products to compensate organizations that will discontinue 
tobacco sponsorship in the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Constitution, anti-smoking efforts, like any 
health initiative, should come from the provinces, not the 
federal government. 
If Quebec and the other provinces did not have to hand over more 
than $30 billion in taxes every year, if we could hang on to 
that money, we could invest more in these prevention and 
awareness initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But hand it over we must and, in the last 30 years or so, 
federal transfer payments have dropped from 28% to 14% of 
Quebec's budget.  In Quebec's health sector alone, the federal 
government's contribution has dropped from 39% to 30% in the 
last 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For 1997-98 alone, the Government of Quebec estimates that the 
$590 million cut by the federal government represents 80% of the 
total $760 million budgeted by Quebec for the entire health and 
social services sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Far from giving the provinces more room to manoeuvre, Ottawa is 
unilaterally cutting transfer payments, and then spending the 
money itself.  The entire issue of federal government health 
funding must be reviewed and overhauled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, it is important that the federal government 
assume its responsibilities and contribute to the compensation 
fund set up by Quebec, and by the other provinces if they so 
wished.  The government is benefiting from the hundreds of 
millions of dollars in spinoffs from sports and cultural events. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal Minister of Health must support efforts to offset 
the negative effects of anti-smoking measures.  This is an 
investment in the economies of Montreal, Quebec and Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is pleased to see that Bill C-42 takes a much 
more balanced approach to the provisions of the Tobacco Act 
since the adoption of Bill C-71.  It is deplorable, however, that 
it has taken the Liberals over one year to understand what we 
have been saying from the beginning of this debate:  it is 
possible to mount an effective campaign against the dangers of 
smoking without unduly penalizing any one group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fight against smoking is one that must be waged by all of 
society.  A habit that has been around for many generations will 
not be easily changed.  But authorities will now have better 
weapons against the serious public health problem it represents.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to tell the House and all 
Canadians why we in the New Democratic Party oppose Bill C-42 and 
to propose some amendments that we believe are absolutely 
essential if the bill is to go forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For me and so many in this place today Bill C-42 is about kids. 
For me personally it is about my nine year old son Joe who wants 
to be cool like any kid in his age group, who but for the harping 
of his parents and for the good teachings and role models at his 
school might think that to be cool, to be liked and to be 
athletic he should smoke.  Families, individuals and young people 
are willing to do their part to deal with the terrible addiction 
to tobacco and to speak out against rampant advertising of 
tobacco products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question for us today in the context of the bill concerns 
what is the role of government.  What is the plan of Liberals in 
the House for meeting their responsibilities and obligations when 
it comes to such a fundamentally important public health issue as 
tobacco addiction? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the bill, tobacco companies will have another two years of 
unfettered lifestyle advertising to the sponsorship of arts, 
sports and cultural events.  All kinds of studies have shown that 
this type of advertising is deadly effective in recruiting 
underage smokers.  Boys and girls see their sports and music 
heroes associated with cigarettes.  It makes tobacco look cool 
when in fact tobacco kills half its users.  That is 40,000 
Canadians every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a product that when used properly, when used as 
recommended, will kill and injure its users.  It costs our health 
care system billions of dollars.  It costs our mothers and 
fathers, sons and daughters their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet this is what the government is proposing to do today.  It is 
proposing to delay action on something as significant as tobacco 
sponsorship and advertising for another two years.  The delay in 
terms of restrictions on sponsorship and advertising by tobacco 
companies combined with a delay in actions by the government to 
actually prevent young people from turning to tobacco that is so 
deadly are together causing us so much grief in the Chamber 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not need to remind anyone in the Chamber or those across 
the country of just how serious a problem we have.  By the 
Minister of Health's own statistics, every year 250,000 young 
people start smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could be moderate in our expectations and say that if even 
10% of these young people do not start smoking it would amount to 
25,000 of them.  If through an effective program of education and 
communication we could convince half those people never to start 
again, we would save a minimum of 12,500 lives from cancers, 
heart disease and other tobacco related illnesses.

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we ask the government to rethink this delay in terms of 
advertising by tobacco companies when it comes to sponsorship and 
advertising generally.  We ask for more.  We ask for the plan of 
action to actually prevent smoking among young people and for 
programs that will help young people to cease and desist when it 
comes to cigarettes.  We are not getting the answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I plead with members across the way to come forward with 
specific plans to meet the commitments they have made publicly to 
Canadian people time and time again.  I think specifically of the 
promise of the Liberal government in the 1997 election to 
increase emphasis on preventing illnesses and specifically to 
double its funding to $100 million over five years to provide 
more programs at the community level which prevent young people 
from smoking or help them to stop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I pointed out in the House earlier today, when we requested 
the information to show just how much of this money had been 
spent, the minister informed the House that for the year 1997-98 
$200,000 of the $20 million a year or $100 million over five 
years had been spent, a tiny percentage of what the government 
promised and what is absolutely required to make the difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also remind members that the government has made commitments 
internationally.  Just a few days ago we received a press release 
that came out of the conference of the ministers of health of the 
Americas which agreed to take measures to protect children and 
adolescents from tobacco by regulating advertising and enforcing 
laws against cigarette sales to minors as a top priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assume that this commitment has been made and now the 
government has an obligation to live up to it.  The measures 
presented to us in the legislation today flies in the face of the 
kind of commitment and action so desperately needed on the part 
of the government, specifically the health minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 1, tomorrow, certain provisions of Bill C-71 come 
into effect.  Let me remind members that Bill C-71 is the Tobacco 
Act passed by parliament in 1997.  The provisions due to kick in 
tomorrow would restrict sponsorship advertising.  For example, 
tobacco brand names could only appear on the bottom 10% of signs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the bill before us today, Bill C-42, puts the whole 
thing off.  There is one positive provision in Bill C-42 before 
us today, and that is the total ban on tobacco sponsorships in 
five years.  The date is not entrenched in law.  A deadline is 
not included in the legislation.  The way the bill is drafted 
would allow cabinet to fix and unfix the date behind closed doors 
without ever consulting parliament or Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a built-in mechanism for delaying or gutting the bill 
altogether.  It is designed to build support for a bill with the 
primary purpose of delaying the tobacco ad restrictions of Bill 
C-71.  That in my estimation is underhanded and reprehensible. 
Nobody is falling for it.  It means two more years of open season 
on Canadian kids.  We cannot let that happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-42 allows tobacco companies to continue to place 
cigarette promotions near schools and playgrounds.  Why did that 
provision have to remain in the bill?  Why could we not begin the 
immediate restriction in terms of off site sponsorship 
advertising? 
We have all been exposed to what that kind of advertising means. 
I have seen it.  I have photos of a cigarette ad near a 
playground in Edmonton.  It is just metres outside the voluntary 
200 metre limit set by tobacco companies.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not act on something as clear and helpful as restriction in 
retail stores, in any community location where young people 
gather?  Ideally we would like to see sponsorship restrictions 
come into effect right way.  We would like to see that in 
conjunction with transitional funding for groups and events that 
lost tobacco sponsorships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Failing that, we would like to see Bill C-42 amended so that 
material promoting tobacco use is not visible to the public 
within 1,000 metres of a school, a place of worship, a community 
centre, playground, public park, recreation centre or child care 
centre.  Why did the government not come forward with a safe zone 
proposal so that young children at schools, day cares and 
community centres would not be exposed to this kind of lifestyle 
advertising? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Related to that, why not support our suggestion in this bill to 
prohibit sponsorship promotion inside and outside stores where 
tobacco is sold?  Children go to corner stores to buy candy, to 
buy comic books. Why are they inundated with glossy images of 
attractive events associated with tobacco? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like to see Bill C-42 amended so that it contains an 
actual date, a definite timetable in terms of when the clock 
starts ticking for this five year lead-up to a total ban.  When 
can we expect precisely when this ban will come into effect?  Why 
does the government not come forward or support our suggestion 
for a definite date such as October 1, 2003 and accept this as 
the fixed time in law that all tobacco sponsorships will finally 
end? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to us the two year delay period should end on October 
1, 2000, not at the will of Liberal cabinet ministers who sat on 
the boards of directors of tobacco giants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to have guarantees that this timetable is entrenched in 
law.  We cannot leave it to the whims of the government to be 
changed at will by order in council.  The track record frankly of 
members opposite is not great in terms of meeting commitments 
when it comes to tobacco related legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also want to see this bill amended so that the grandfather 
provisions apply only to events sponsored in Canada as of April 
25, 1997. As members know, right now as it stands, if a tobacco 
company sponsored an event anywhere in the world, whether in the 
United States, Malaysia or Paraguay, it can make a claim under 
the grandfather provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to see Bill C-42 changed so that it reads that during 
the delay period sponsorship promotions would not be allowed to 
contain images of people, be misleading or be conveyed through 
non-tobacco goods such as hats or jackets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to see representatives of tobacco companies required to 
appear before the health committee of parliament to reveal their 
recruitment strategies for smokers under 18.  We want to see 
their documents which show they knew tobacco kills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier today I raise the matter of the timing of Bill C-42 
vis-à-vis the provisions of the Tobacco Act being changed in Bill 
C-42 come into effect tomorrow.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my view that it is a contempt of parliament to have the 
introduction of a bill so late, knowing full well the timetable 
in terms of the previous tobacco legislation, Bill C-71, and the 
time it takes for this parliament to pass Bill C-42, putting it 
through all the proper stages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-71, the Tobacco Act passed by parliament in 1997, takes 
effect tomorrow.  Can Bill C-42 pass tomorrow?  No, we all know 
that.  It is impossible.  There will be a gap of weeks in which 
the government will not enforce the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess in my most cynical moments I could say that maybe this 
is in keeping with the kind of arrogance we have seen from the 
Liberal government on so many issues, especially over the past 
number of weeks pertaining to the silencing of peaceful 
protesters to protect a bloody dictator's pride. Surely we could 
all agree that the rights and health of Canadians should always 
come before the profits of multinationals, selling hazardous 
products or the embarrassment of tinpot dictators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remain concerned about the actions of this government with 
respect to the legal void that has been created.  I heard the 
Speaker's ruling today in response to my matter of privilege and 
I invite members of the Liberal government in questions and 
comments to address this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like a member of the Liberal government to actually 
answer what happens if the act is not in force by October 1, 
1998. What happens if Bill C-42 is not passed and proclaimed 
tomorrow? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the minister's own briefing notes, members of the 
Liberal government have been advised to say given that my 
intentions are now known, it would be appropriate for the 
department to administer this legislation as if the amendment 
were in the effect as of October 1, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage members to address this topic.  This is a serious 
matter for the work we do as parliamentarians and it is a serious 
matter for all Canadians concerned about government actions and 
inactions with respect to this very important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to acknowledge the work of many in society today 
with respect to dealing with this very serious public health 
issue of smoking and tobacco. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have benefited from the advice and encouragement of many in 
our communities, in my own constituency and organizations 
representing thousands of Canadians right across this country.  I 
think it is important for us in parliament to acknowledge 
the work of those people and those organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular I thank the Canadian Cancer Society, Physicians 
for a Smoke Free Canada, the Non-Smoker's Rights Association and 
the many health organizations and concerned parents from 
everywhere in this country who have worked so hard for stronger 
tobacco laws for the sake of our health and for the sake of our 
kids.  We all owe them a debt of gratitude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of us in the New Democratic Party are very clear today about 
our position on Bill C-42.  On behalf of all members of our 
caucus, I pledge our support for an end to the recruitment of our 
young people to a lifelong addiction to smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We look forward to pressing for effective amendments to this 
bill and addressing the very serious issue of tobacco marketing 
at the health committee.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the only way we are going to resolve anything is to 
declare all out war on smoking.  I say war because I want to 
remind the House and Canadians that 42,000 Canadians died in 
World War II between 1939 and 1945. That is almost the same 
number of Canadians, documented, who are dying every year in 
Canada as a result of smoking, specifically 45,000.  That is more 
than what we lost in World War II.  It is hard to believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the seriousness of the problem.  Sadly the government is 
doing nothing about it. It is caving in to the interests of the 
big tobacco lobbyists, and there is none any bigger in this 
country. There would be only one group of business people lower 
on the acceptability scale, maybe including politicians, and that 
would be the big banks.  They rank with the biggest of the 
biggest and they are extremely powerful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Critical in the debate is that 250,000 young Canadians begin to 
smoke each year in this country. Statistics shows this is going 
to lead to an early death for at least 50% of those young 
Canadians. The numbers are overwhelming and it is sobering when 
we look at the sheer number of Canadians starting to smoke every 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the arguments cigarette companies use to promote the use 
of their product are almost mind boggling.  This shows us the 
power of advertising, the power of the cigarette companies and 
some of the bizarre things they have done in the past and 
continue to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Knowing that 40,000 people a year die from smoking, being the 
health critic immediately I would say imagine the drain this puts 
on our health care services.  How much money is devoted to the 
care and concern of those 40,000 Canadian who are dying because 
of smoking? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cigarette companies claim there is a death benefit to 
smoking and it would be in the government's best interest if all 
Canadians smoked.  The argument is so bizarre it is hard to 
believe they commissioned a study to attempt to prove this.  The 
cigarette companies say smoking is not a drain on society.  It 
does not result in a cost to government because of sickness, 
death and work related illness because of smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cigarette companies are saying that there is a death benefit 
to smoking and they argue that if you smoke you are going to die 
younger.  Their perverted logic says if you die younger it means 
you will not be taking in as much in terms of social security 
from the government.  In order words, you would not collect 
Canada pension as long and this would be good for the government. 
The cigarette companies argue that you would not be collecting 
old age pension as long because obviously you are going to die 
younger.  As a result, the government is going to save money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The argument is so bizarre and so illogical that it is hard to 
believe that a cigarette company would actually promote it, but 
they have and they do.  It has been discounted and discredited by 
just about every think tank in the world, including the Work 
Bank. It is such a bizarre statement, claiming it is factual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As ironic as it may appear I believe the government buys into 
the argument because if it did not why would it not crack down on 
smoking the way it should and the way it can?  No, the government 
has caved in once again to the big cigarette manufacturers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has someone in its own caucus who is proposing to 
do something about it but unfortunately he is in the other place. 
I am of course talking about Senator Colin Kenny.  Mr. Kenny has 
a bill before parliament that will do something now about 
smoking.  However, I do not believe the government is going to 
buy into this one because it means he is doing something 
decisive, he is doing it now and he wants action.  He does not 
want the government to backpedal on what it should be doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a good example of what the Senate can do.  What the 
senator is proposing is workable and very doable.  Some of the 
statistics that Colin Kenny cites when he gives his public 
speeches are the very statistics we are using in this House 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I would personally like to see I think goes beyond what 
Senator Kenny is talking about.  If we are going to attack 
cigarette smoking, three elements have to be in place.  We simply 
cannot attack advertising or education. We have to attack three 
major components. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One would be the price point.  The price point of cigarettes is 
determined to a large degree by taxation. What I am saying is 
that a tax increase on cigarettes, a dedicated tax where it would 
be used for education and maybe for some assistance to the 
farmers, has to be part of the equation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second thing we must do is educate our young people about 
the risks of smoking.  They did that quite successfully in 
California.  Today in California $4 per person per year is spent 
to advertise the dangers of smoking.  In Canada I think the 
federal government is spending about 30 cents per person to 
educate Canadians and especially young Canadians about the risks 
of taking up the habit of smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have mentioned taxes and education.  The third thing is 
advertising.  We have to hit advertising very hard but this bill 
is not doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Driving here or in any major city such as Montreal, it is pretty 
obvious what the cigarette companies are up to. They are 
promoting lifestyle.  While driving through the city of Montreal 
I could come to the subliminal conclusion that by taking up 
smoking du Maurier cigarettes I am going to be a concert pianist 
or violinist.  I believe that was the market that particular 
cigarette company was after.  It is one of the biggest selling 
cigarette brands in the country. However, if I wanted to be a 
downhill skier and possibly a world medalist in skiing, I would 
probably smoke Export A.  Then again if I wanted to be a race car 
driver I would probably pick up Rothmans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cigarette companies are targeting their audience. They know who 
their audience happens to be, the younger members of our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have mentioned taxes, education and advertising.  Where the 
government went wrong, the single biggest blunder it made in this 
war on cigarette smoking was in 1994 when it capitulated and 
dramatically decreased the amount of tax on a package of 
cigarettes.  When taxes were significantly reduced in 1994 there 
was the single biggest increase in the consumption of cigarettes 
by young people in the history of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government caved in.  Who did it cave in to?  This is even 
more bizarre.  It caved in to the smugglers.  Instead of putting 
money toward the problem of smuggling and enforcing our own 
revenue laws as it should have, the government caved in to the 
smugglers.  Who did the government hurt?  The government hurt 
250,000 young Canadians who pick up the habit every year. 
Who did the government help?  I do not know.  I guess it helped 
itself. In 1994 that was the easy way out for the government and 
it caved in and did it.  It was wrong and it is still wrong.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I want you to tell me how much time I have left 
because I have some amendments to the bill.  Five minutes.  That 
should be enough time, because I want to put six or seven 
amendments on the table.  The Speaker is saying 10 minutes and 
more if I need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the minister of agriculture is here listening intently and 
encouraging me as I go along. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to put these amendments on the record. Being realistic, 
we can expect the government to do some things and not to do 
other things.  These amendments are very consistent with what we 
would like to see happen as a party, as a caucus.  It probably 
does not go far enough as far as I am concerned.  I think it has 
got to be a cold turkey approach:  no advertisements, a complete 
ban on advertising from day one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go through some of these amendments because they temper 
some of my own thoughts with regard to this.  I want to give 
credit to the Canadian Cancer Society as well because it has 
worked hard on some of these amendments. Some of them come 
directly from the Canadian Cancer Society.  I am going to be 
reading these into the record and I will forward these to the 
House when I am finished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One, there should be a ceiling on tobacco company sponsorship 
promotion expenditures during the delay period.  This would 
prevent tobacco companies from increasing the exposure of 
sponsorship promotions.  It would prevent tobacco companies from 
increasing the financial dependency of sponsorship recipients. It 
would stop the sponsorship problem from getting worse. Although 
the former Tobacco Products Control Act contained a ceiling on 
brand name sponsorship expenditures, tobacco companies cited a 
loophole in another provision of the act and increased 
sponsorship expenditures from $10 million in 1987 to $60 million 
in 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point to be considered in terms of amendments would 
be that during the delay period, sponsorship promotions should be 
prohibited on the inside and outside of stores where tobacco is 
sold.  These promotions, which were scheduled to have been banned 
on October 1, 1998, are completely unnecessary for the promotion 
of a cultural or sports event. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the 1996-97 period, including the 1996 summer sponsorship 
season, sponsorship promotions were generally not found at point 
of sale.  Sponsorship promotions that had previously been visible 
at point of sale were replaced by direct advertising, given that 
the tobacco companies were not prevented by law from doing so 
during the period after the advertising restrictions were in 
force and before the Tobacco Act was passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sponsorship promotions at point of sale typically contain lots 
of attractive images and little information, sometimes for events 
that are thousands of kilometres away or that occurred months 
earlier.  Children go into corner stores every day and they should 
not be exposed to such promotions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reasonableness of such an amendment is demonstrated by 
sponsored events still being able to use every other media to 
promote their activities:  newspapers, direct mail, television, 
radio, on-site programs, Internet, billboards, transit vehicles 
and shelters.  Indeed the extensive scope of permitted 
sponsorship promotions emphasizes just how serious the further 
delay period will be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three, the bill should be amended so that the two year and five 
year delay periods begin on October 1, 1998 and end on October 1 
in the year 2000 and October 1, 2003 respectively.  It is an 
interesting point that at present the cabinet is free to 
determine whatever starting date it wants.  The cabinet can 
determine whether it is October 1, 1998, January 1, 1999 or some 
other day in the future.  Every month of additional delay means 
more teenagers needlessly become addicted.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an aside, the Quebec tobacco act has two and five year delay 
periods that begin on the fixed date of October 1, 1998.  There 
is no reason for the federal delay periods to begin at the same 
later date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Four, the bill should be amended so that only events sponsored 
as of April 25, 1997 are allowed to continue during the delay 
period with tobacco sponsorship promotions.  At present the bill 
does not allow sponsorship promotions unless the event or 
activity was sponsored prior to April 25, 1997.  This is a good 
start, but as the bill now reads, it would allow events or 
activities whose tobacco sponsorship ended five, 10 or 15 years 
earlier to be revived.  A simple amendment would prevent this 
scenario from occurring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Five, the bill should be amended so that the grandfather 
provisions apply only to events sponsored in Canada as of April 
25, 1997.  At present the grandfather provision applies to 
anywhere in the world, whether it is the U.S., Argentina or 
Botswana. Tobacco companies should not be able to claim that 
because a Rothmans sponsorship existed in a foreign country and 
not in Canada, that sponsorship promotions for a foreign event 
can occur in Canada during the transition period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Six, during the delay period, any sponsorship promotions should 
not be allowed to contain images of people, to be misleading, or 
to be conveyed through non-tobacco goods, for example T-shirts or 
baseball caps.  This amendment could be implemented by making 
sponsorship promotions explicitly subject to section 21 of the 
act which bans the use of people in advertising and section 20 of 
the act, misleading advertising.  Sponsorship promotions should 
be explicitly subject to sections 27 and 28 of the act, the use 
of tobacco brand elements on non-tobacco goods, with an exemption 
if necessary for existing international auto racing events for 
cars and clothing of drivers and pit crews. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the bill should be amended so that only international 
auto racing events are able to have tobacco sponsorship during a 
further delay period, and not all sponsored events.  By allowing 
all events a further extension, allowing for a total delay of 
four seasons after the act was passed, there will be an 
unnecessary undermining of the objectives of the act.  Delay 
periods of two years or less have been implemented in many 
places, including Belgium and France.  Thus the bill would be 
amended to remove the extra two year delay for all promotions for 
all events, and to remove the extra five year delay for on-site 
promotions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1988 when I was elected to this place for the first time, I 
replaced a longstanding member in this House by the name of Fred 
McCain.  Fred McCain was a lifelong smoker.  He smoked for over 
50 years.  It was a habit that Fred said “I took up when I was a 
young boy.  If I had known then what I know now, I certainly 
would not have taken up the habit”.  Fred McCain died just about 
a year ago.  One of the things he impressed on me was to stay the 
fight, stay the course; we have to keep young Canadians off of 
that habit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my constituents, Glenn McLeod, immediately after my 
election last year informed me that he has lung cancer.  It was 
the same situation as with Mr. McCain.  He started smoking as a 
very young man many years ago without knowing the dangers of 
smoking.  But he said to me “If there is one thing that you want 
to impress on young Canadians, it is the real threat to our 
health as Canadians”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Things have evolved over the last 40 years in this country. 
We now know that smoking is a danger.  We now know that 250,000 
young Canadians take it up every year.  Let this House do the 
right thing.  Bring in a strong bill.  That is the only bill that 
we will support.  We want fewer smokers and fewer deaths in 
Canada as a result of taking up that habit.

<A NAME="LINK184">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should review 
the current equalization program formula with a view to 
decreasing the clawback on provincial revenues from resource 
development projects. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, last fall I had a private member's bill 
on Newfoundland's unemployment problem selected and debated here 
in the Chamber.  In my final remarks I remember saying that if we 
had a fairer equalization formula applied to Newfoundland, and 
for that matter applied to all of the have-not provinces which 
receive equalization payments, then we would be a whole lot 
better off as a nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian equalization program, as we are all very much 
aware, redistributes the wealth of the nation.  Last year the 
province of Newfoundland received about $996 million in 
equalization payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this fiscal year we are expected to get roughly $896 million. 
That figure, of course, can be greatly affected by the national 
economy.  In a good year any province that receives equalization 
payments can receive more and, of course, it can receive less 
when the economy is down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The population of the receiving province is also a factor.  In 
recent years it has meant a downward trend because of 
Newfoundland's decreasing population.  Since 1987 Newfoundland 
has lost approximately 60,000 people.  It is very serious indeed 
when the province in total has a population of less than 600,000 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the main variable I am concerned with is the fact that, 
with any major new influx of resource revenue, those revenues are 
deducted dollar for dollar from our equalization entitlements. 
That is to say, if the province had taken in about $1 billion in 
additional resource revenues in the 1997-98 fiscal year, we would 
have been only $4 million better off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just imagine that a province like Newfoundland can take in a 
billion dollars in additional resource revenues in any fiscal 
year and only be $4 million better off because, of course, the 
first $996 million of revenue will have merely gone to replace 
equalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is not much of a chance for a province receiving 
equalization payments to catch up, to become equal with the other 
provinces.  Of course, there is not much of an incentive for any 
province to develop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I served as a member of the Newfoundland House of Assembly for a 
number of years.  During those terms both PC and Liberal 
governments talked about the equalization formula that we have in 
this nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that was brought into focus in Newfoundland especially 
by the massive Hibernia discovery on the Grand Banks of 
Newfoundland.  At the time of that discovery in 1979 Hibernia 
held the promise of jobs and revenues for our beleaguered 
provincial economy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the early eighties oil prices were high and the prospect of 
multibillion dollar annual oil revenues was not out of the realm 
of the possible.  Overcoming the equalization problem, the 
equalization hump, seemed to be within the realm of the possible. 
That is to say, we would lose the first billion but we could keep 
subsequent millions or billions of dollars, whatever the case may 
be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as we are all aware, it proved impossible at that time 
for the government, the Trudeau administration, to negotiate an 
offshore oil agreement.  So an agreement on offshore revenues was 
held up until the Mulroney administration came to power in 
Ottawa.  By the time we actually started to develop that project 
oil prices were a whole lot lower.  Now there was no possibility 
of multibillion dollar oil revenues and it looked as if the oil 
revenues that would be generated would merely replace 
equalization payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened then?  To his credit, John Crosbie negotiated a 
deal with the Mulroney administration that would see us lose only 
70 cents on the equalization dollar for revenues raised from the 
Hibernia project.  However, the deal applied only to that 
particular project.  The revenues from projects like Voisey's Bay 
would still be subtracted on a dollar for dollar basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do not get me wrong.  We are pleased that we have an 
equalization program.  That equalization program can keep a 
province from starving.  However, we are not pleased that it is a 
formula that will also keep us from getting ahead as a province. 
How can we ever be expected to catch up if every new dollar we 
earn is subtracted from equalization entitlements?  And catch up 
we must. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For as long as I have been in public life the unemployment rate 
in the province has been double the national average.  On top of 
that, the federal government has cut transfers for health and 
education by 35%.  As a result, thousands of provincial public 
servants have been laid off and our public services are now under 
a great deal of strain, especially those in rural Newfoundland. 
The federal government has cut the federal public service in 
Newfoundland by 30% as compared with 15% nationally.  It is hard 
to believe that a province with double the national unemployment 
rate was saddled with double the rate of federal job cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because the public service in general plays a larger than usual 
role in the province's economy, the cumulative effect of these 
cuts has been more devastating in Newfoundland than in other 
provinces.  That is one more reason we need a new deal in this 
Confederation if we are to move out of park and into high gear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United Nations says that Canada is one of the best countries 
in the world in which to live, but I guess it all depends on 
where you happen to live in this nation.  How can Canada hold up 
its head in the community of nations while one of its provinces, 
in this case the province of Newfoundland, has an unemployment 
rate that is double the national average?  That is another reason 
we need a better equalization formula, to leave more wealth in 
the hands of the people of the province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province of Newfoundland and Labrador has vast oil and gas 
reserves.  It has a lot of iron ore, nickel and hydroelectricity. 
In most countries that would form the basis of a massive 
industrial complex which would bring more people into the 
province. 
Instead, what we have in Newfoundland is the exporting of people 
and raw resources.  I do not want to be cynical about this, but 
it seems to me that the centres of power in the nation do not 
want that to change.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed we have recently been treated, if you will, to political 
and editorial comments out of central Canada that our nickel 
reserves should be used to feed smelters in Ontario and in 
Manitoba as well.  The premier of Ontario really should have more 
sense than what he demonstrated in making that point about 
resource development in Newfoundland in Voisey's Bay.  He should 
be saying as the premier of the largest province in Canada that 
we should be allowing the province to develop and we should be 
allowing the province to catch up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be helping provinces like Newfoundland do that by 
implementing a new program that would see equalization cut by 
only 50%; a 50% clawback on the resource related revenues in the 
province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose some provinces can argue, and rightly so, that 
Newfoundland and the have-not provinces owe them something for 
providing jobs to migrant Newfoundlanders over the years, but 
should we therefore give away the wherewithal that we need to 
make us self-reliant?  I think not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can understand, for instance, that the good people of Sudbury 
are concerned that the days of cheap local iron ore are over. 
Mining and related operations generally have a very fixed 
lifespan, as we are well aware. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember in Newfoundland, in my own constituency, that the 
towns of Bell Island and Buchans had to deal with the reality of 
ore running out and the tragedy of those mining towns shutting 
down.  Such is the eventual fate, of course, of any mining town. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we wish all the best to the good people of Sudbury, I do 
not feel that the nickel discovery at Voisey's Bay is the 
solution to their problem.  Rather, the Voisey's Bay find is one 
of the solutions to Newfoundland's chronic economic problems. 
Properly done, with a new equalization formula, that project 
could provide thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in 
revenue.  Being able to hold on to some of that revenue from that 
resource is what this motion is all about today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need revenues to do more than merely replace equalization. 
We need revenues to augment our economic situation.  We need 
revenues to augment our equalization.  We need those revenues to 
catch up, to make progress and to try in some way to become, if 
we possibly can over time, equal to the rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada will never be the nation that it should be if it does not 
seriously try to help rectify the crippling unemployment problem 
that we have in Newfoundland.  I have suggested one mechanism, 
that of an improved equalization formula, which would leave more 
wealth in the local economy.  Lower payroll taxes and income 
taxes could also help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I do not believe anything will change if there is not 
an attitude change on the part of the federal government.  That 
is why I am standing here today in the House asking for 
understanding for the kind of plight the province finds itself 
in.  I am asking for understanding for a new deal within the 
Confederation of Canada, where all Canadians can be truly equal, 
wherever they happen to live, whether it is in Newfoundland, 
British Columbia or Nova Scotia.  I do not think that will ever 
happen unless we get a new deal in this Confederation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise and 
speak on behalf of the government in response to private member's 
motion 424. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion deals with two of the most important attributes that 
make both Canada and its federation unique: first, the economic 
significance of the resource development project and, second, the 
efficient and equitable system of transfer programs that form the 
heart of Canadian federalism, in particular the equalization 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role of financial transfers in the Canadian federation has a 
long and rich history.  Built on the spirit of a Canadian 
fraternity our system of transfers illustrates the willing 
co-operation and coordination which has long become a Canadian 
trademark that is the envy of federations around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a recent report to parliament the auditor general referred to 
the program as one of the main successes of the federation.  For 
over 40 years the federal government has fulfilled its 
constitutional responsibility to ensure that provincial 
governments have sufficient revenues to provide reasonably 
comparable levels of public services and reasonably comparable 
levels of taxation through the equalization program. It is an 
example of how the Canadian federation has and will continue to 
work well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I confirm to the House once again that the government is 
committed to the ongoing sustainability of programs as important 
as the equalization program.  As we enter a new era of government 
financing it is critical that we continue to do what is most 
important to Canadians and to do it in the most efficient and 
equitable way possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With reference to the motion before us, let there be no doubt 
that natural resources have long been a staple of the Canadian 
economy.  From coast to coast to coast since the first settlers 
arrived from Europe in the 15th century, even prior to European 
settlement on this continent, natural resources formed the heart 
of aboriginal economic development.  From forestry to nickel, 
from oil and gas to sand and quarrying, natural resources have 
been the foundation of Canadian economic success for centuries. 
They are under our constitution an area of provincial 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sustainable development of our rich natural resources is 
crucial to provincial economic growth, and sustainable economic 
growth is critical to fiscal stability and autonomy for all 
provinces.  The government is committed to supporting all efforts 
by provinces and regions to develop their economies and to 
promote the sustainable development of our rich natural 
resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion presented to the House is concerned with the 
reductions in equalization payments that occur as revenues from 
natural resource development projects come on stream.  There is 
no doubt that the government wants to work co-operatively with 
provinces but I think we must be clear.  The government believes 
it is crucial that such economic development projects go ahead on 
their own merit.  Such economic development projects must go 
ahead because they make good economic sense and not simply 
because of government subsidies.  This is why we must keep 
strong, effective programs such as equalization separate from 
individual provincial economic development decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equalization is an unconditional transfer that provides 
provinces with resources to support economic development 
projects.  The federal government does not say where such 
resources must be spent.  Decisions on how to allocate such 
revenues are at the discretion of provincial governments.  In 
this way equalization is a central component by which 
co-operative economic development takes place within Canada. 
Provinces that require support receive such financial support 
with the maximum amount of flexibility to use as they see fit. 
Equalization must maintain its transparency, sustainability and 
underlying principles of fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It works according to a formula approved by parliament that 
applies equally to all provinces.  The amount a particular 
province receives is determined by a statutory formula and not by 
the political pressures of the day or a particular development 
project.  As the province's fiscal capacity goes up its 
equalization entitlements go down.  As a province's relative 
fiscal capacity goes down entitlements go up.  It is the way 
equalization has worked for over 40 years.  It is this principle 
that applies to all equalization receiving provinces.  The 
formula is the very basis of the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot compromise a formula driven program that applies to 
all provinces equally by treating some provinces better than 
others.  This motion would do just that. 
Compromising the program for one province would undo the 40 years 
of successful co-operation and sharing that characterizes the 
equalization program.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As Canadians we are there for each other.  We help each other 
out when times are tough.  We saw this in the aftermath of the 
floods in Manitoba and Quebec last year and in the ice storm in 
eastern Ontario and western Quebec during January 1998. It is in 
the same spirit that the equalization program works. When times 
are tough, when times are bad, equalization payments increase but 
as a province's economic situation improves its equalization 
entitlements are reduced.  Even when times get better the 
equalization program has the added benefit of protecting 
provinces against large, year over year reductions in 
entitlements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a floor provision that applies to all provinces which 
ensures not only the predictability of the program as a whole but 
also that provinces which experience growth will not be 
immediately or adversely affected by reductions in equalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to this protection, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland 
have traditional protection for revenues that result from 
offshore developments.  Under the Canada-Newfoundland offshore 
accord signed in the early 1980s, Newfoundland is granted 
transitional protection against equalization reductions.  It 
lasts for 12 years.  It allows the province to benefit from 
natural resource development projects.  Under the Canada-Nova 
Scotia offshore accord Nova Scotia is also granted transitional 
protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the current agreements and arrangements Newfoundland would 
benefit substantially from the offset arrangements already in 
place.  It ensures that Newfoundland's overall physical position 
is not significantly impacted and that the provincial economy 
will benefit from job creation, higher incomes and stronger, more 
lasting growth.  This protection is on top of the expected 
increase in revenues that the province would derive from the 
project through royalties and taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, the federal government also supported the development 
of Newfoundland's natural resources through other means, 
including the $195 million coming from the Canada-Newfoundland 
offshore development fund, over $2 billion from the petroleum 
incentive program and over $1 billion in federal cash 
contributions, interest free loans and loan guarantees entrusted 
toward the development of Hibernia.  This is on top of the fact 
that both Newfoundland and Nova Scotia have historically been the 
main beneficiaries of equalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Together these arrangements show the extent to which the federal 
government is an active partner in supporting natural resource 
development projects that make for long term economic success in 
the provinces.  The current equalization agreements clearly allow 
for provinces like Newfoundland to benefit significantly from 
such projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, equalization is a program that works and 
works well.  It is one of the most established and successfully 
recognized transfer programs of the Canadian federation. It is 
distinctly Canadian.  It is about ensuring that all Canadians, 
regardless of where they live, have access to the same kind of 
government programs and services at comparable levels of 
taxation.  For 40 years the program has been there for provinces 
when regional economies faltered.  It will continue to be there 
in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even when we were forced to reduce expenditures during our 
deficit battle the equalization program was not touched.  Why? It 
was because of its importance to Canadians from coast to coast to 
coast.  Compromising national programs for the sake of any 
particular province does not make a strong federation.  Canadians 
want strong national programs that are efficient and equitable. 
Equalization as an enduring program fulfils these criteria. The 
government will ensure that it is sustainable, transparent and 
fair to all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is for these reasons that I urge my colleagues to reject 
Motion No. 424. 
<P><A NAME="LINK186"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise in debate on Motion No. 424 regarding 
equalization put forward this evening by the hon. member for St. 
John's East.  I commend the hon. member for his hard work on this 
matter and his diligent representation of the interest of his 
province and constituency.  I think the member is well known for 
such diligence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion seeks to end what the member characterizes as a 
decrease in equalization payments to provinces that see an 
increase in revenues through resource development projects. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1755"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case he is referring to the projects recently off the 
ground in Newfoundland such as Hibernia, Voisey's Bay and others. 
All Canadians take some gratitude in the fact that we now have 
some real economic development in terms of natural resources 
happening in these areas of Newfoundland.  We all hope that these 
developments will signal a new and brighter economic future for 
the people of Newfoundland and Labrador. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion addresses the question of equalization.  It seems to 
us that equalization formulae already take into account the 
possibility of provincial revenues growing from within the 
resource sector.  There are already in place floors to protect 
provinces from variations in the reductions from equalization as 
a result of increases in the provincial resource tax base. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A province with a relative per capita fiscal capacity less than 
or equal to 70% of the national average in the equalization 
formula is entitled to a floor protection of 95% of the 
equalization entitlement of the previous year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of Newfoundland, which has already signed agreements 
with the federal government applying to resource projects 
initiated by the Hibernia project but also applicable to White 
Rose in Voisey's Bay, this means that in the short run 
Newfoundland may lose just 5 cents in equalization for each new 
dollar in resource revenue and that in the medium run it may lose 
less than $1 or about 70 cents in equalization payments for each 
new dollar in resource revenues.  In other words, a transition 
mechanism is already built into equalization to smooth resource 
driven declines in equalization entitlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the capacity of a province to raise revenues increases then 
its equalization entitlement should decrease, which is what the 
current formulae allow for.  However that decrease is smoothed 
out over time.  It is not jarring.  It does not happen too 
quickly so provinces should have the ability to adjust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member appealed at the end of his remarks for a new 
deal in Confederation based on true equality among Canadians so 
that all people would be treated equal.  Those of us in the 
official opposition could not agree more strongly.  We advocate 
the principle of equality as the basis for any true and lasting 
union in our Confederation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the kind of equality that we speak of in economic terms 
is equality of opportunity and not equality of outcomes.  It is 
simply not possible for this or any other government to guarantee 
equality of outcomes in terms of the economic situation of 
various Canadians.  We can try to provide a basic level of 
equality of opportunity, and that is what the current 
equalization system attempts to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with the hon. member's motion is that it would seek 
to treat Newfoundland differently from all other provinces.  The 
money that comes from equalization payments does not just come 
from out of thin air.  It does not grow on trees.  It is not just 
printed by the Bank of Canada.  It is money that is taxed from 
certain Canadians and redistributed to provincial governments in 
other parts of the country.  In this respect I do not believe 
that equalization is necessarily the most efficient means of 
creating equality of opportunity and redistributing income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are people in my constituency in Alberta of modest income. 
They work hard and carry a very large tax burden, yet part of 
the federal taxes they pay to Ottawa are redistributed in the 
form of equalization payments to citizens in other provinces, 
which in the sense of fairness that Canadians pride themselves on 
is a reasonable principle. 
Except what you end up with is the aberration of lower income 
working people paying taxes to Ottawa in areas like Alberta, 
Ontario and British Columbia in order to subsidize public 
services that upper income people benefit from in other provinces 
such as Newfoundland and Quebec and the other so-called have not 
provinces.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not an equitable form of redistribution.  It is 
difficult to believe that in a country like Canada, being one of 
the wealthiest countries in the history of the world, there are 
seven have not economically disadvantaged provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We accept the principle that we need to assist those who are 
going through difficult times such as people in Newfoundland and 
Labrador.  We do not accept the principle that there are seven 
have -not provinces which should always be guaranteed a transfer 
from the taxpayers of other provinces.  That is why we would 
propose to readjust the equalization formulas to focus benefit on 
the four poorest provinces as opposed to the seven provinces 
which are currently characterized as have not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In so doing, by changing the incentives in the equalization 
system we hope to remove the potential for the so-called welfare 
trap effect taking place.  There is now a disincentive for 
provincial governments to broaden and deepen their tax bases 
because if they do so they lose some of the equalization 
payments.  What is needed are greater incentives for serious 
private sector economic development which can create meaningful 
sustainable jobs for the people of the economically disadvantaged 
regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For 30 years we have followed an economic approach in places 
such as Newfoundland and Labrador predicated on government 
intervention, on enormous subsidies and transfers.  As a result 
we have seen unacceptably high levels of unemployment and 
unacceptably low levels of economic development.  If we look to 
those areas of the country which have relied more on policies 
that are oriented toward private sector investment and lower 
taxes, greater incentives for people to work, save and invest, 
what we see in such jurisdictions as Alberta are the lowest 
levels of unemployment and the highest levels of growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We ought to look to the recent economic history of Confederation 
to suggest that continuing the enormous subsidization of regional 
economies does not create real jobs or real opportunities. 
Unfortunately that is why so many people from the province of 
Newfoundland and Labrador are leaving, because of a lack of 
economic opportunities.  They are moving to, for instance, 
Alberta which has for the past many years has pursued quite a 
radically different approach to economic development, one of 
lower taxes, less intervention and fewer subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I close by commending the hon. member for the sentiment behind 
his motion and his effort to speak on behalf of what he regards 
as the best interests of his constituents.  However, in the true 
interests of equity and fairness across the country we cannot 
change the rules of equalization when a province is starting to 
see some broadening of its tax base.  We must treat all provinces 
with some degree of equity.  For that reason we would like to 
reform equalization but not by creating a double standard where a 
province can see higher own source revenues and continue to be 
subsidized by Ottawa. 
<P><A NAME="LINK187"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is an interesting debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was interesting when the member responsible for the subject 
being debated in the House was speaking, but it is always more 
interesting after the member from the Reform Party gets up. We 
hear in his comments on the proposal the not so hidden but 
explicit agenda of the Reform Party with respect to equalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not agree with the hon. member from Newfoundland with 
respect to his proposal for some of the reasons that have been 
outlined in previous speeches on the government side and on the 
official opposition side, that it would be a mistake to make this 
kind of exception. 
It could prove over the long term to be the undoing of the 
equalization payments program we have in this country, a concept 
and a program that Canadians should be reminded is in the 
Constitution of Canada.  This is not some ad hoc or even long 
term contingent decision of successive Canadian governments.  The 
principle and policy of equalization payments was enshrined in 
the Constitution when we patriated the BNA Act in 1982.  I was in 
the House at the time and remember well that this was one of the 
concerns that many of us had, that when the Constitution was 
patriated the principle of equalization would be enshrined and 
therefore beyond the reach of governments which, for whatever 
reason, might have wanted to do away with the principle 
altogether.

<A HREF="#LINKT49"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is a great principle and I think it is too bad that 
we cannot bring ourselves to treat each other the way we have 
decided to treat each other when we consider ourselves as 
provinces.  In other words, we have this principle in the country 
that all provinces shall basically have a guaranteed adequate 
income in order to provide, if I remember the wording correctly, 
reasonably comparable services to all Canadians no matter where 
they live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say that because the member from the Reform Party repeatedly 
talked about equalization payments as having something to do with 
economic opportunity and equality of opportunity.  Only in a very 
indirect sense, because equalization payments are not about 
equality of opportunity, except in so far as they may be about a 
reasonably comparable level of educational services or a 
reasonably comparable level of heath services or a reasonably 
comparable level of many other kinds of services provided by the 
provincial government.  But it does in the end have to do with 
the provision of services by the provincial governments so that 
provincial governments, no matter what province they may be the 
government of, can provide this reasonably comparable level of 
service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that is a principle we need to preserve and extend into 
the way we treat each other as individuals so that all Canadians 
as individuals and not just their provinces might be guaranteed a 
reasonably comparable standard of living no matter where they 
live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was interesting to hear the member from the Reform Party who 
talked about Albertans being taxed so heavily.  Is this not the 
province that does not have a sales tax?  I always get a bit of a 
charge out of hearing people from Alberta say woe are the 
Albertans because they are so heavily taxed.  They do not have a 
sales tax.  Whatever taxes they do have are ameliorated by the 
income that has come from the energy sector there over the years. 
It may be going down now, but this may be because, contrary to 
the rhetoric of the hon. member, it is not just in various 
imaginary socialist worlds that governments subsidize industry. 
What about all the money in Alberta that has been lost 
subsidizing capitalists like Peter Pocklington who liked to go 
around badmouthing government and badmouthing subsidies and 
badmouthing intervention in the marketplace but have been more 
than willing to step up to the trough when it was their turn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It not just amused me but actually infuriated me that I have had 
to listen to so much anti-government intervention rhetoric over 
the years here from Alberta members of parliament when successive 
Alberta governments, Progressive Conservative governments in 
particular, have been more than willing to put all kinds of 
public money into various private ventures and not, I might say, 
with a great deal of success.  So spare us the false dichotomy 
between those on the right who are so prudent with the public's 
money and those on the left who allegedly are otherwise.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The record will show that governments on the right have been 
frivolous and even outrageous with the kinds of the money they 
have been prepared to put into the business ventures of their 
friends.  It is not that we intervene in the marketplace.  It is 
that we intervene in the marketplace on behalf of somebody who is 
not our friend.  That is the real offence of the right-wingers in 
this country.  If it is done on behalf of friends it is trying to 
help the economy along, trying to create the right climate, all 
that sort of thing that we have had to listen to for years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also concerned about an argument that I heard just the 
other day.  We need to be aware of this as there is some truth in 
it.  Those who supported the free trade agreement should be 
concerned about it.  I heard that Professor Thomas Courchene 
said, I think at a C.D. Howe Institute forum, that over the long 
term the erosion of east-west economic and political ties in the 
country and the strengthening and expansion of north-south ties 
would erode the willingness of Canadians in the so-called have 
provinces to participate in equalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His argument was that in the previous Canadian context if money 
was going from Ontario, Alberta and B.C. to other provinces and 
they were spending that money they would be spending it in a 
national economy.  The money would return to Ontario, B.C. or 
whatever in the form of purchasing goods or commodities coming 
out of those so-called have provinces.  The long term effect of 
the free trade agreements would be that this no longer would be 
the case.  Money coming from Ontario to Manitoba would not be 
turned around and spent in Ontario again.  There would not be 
this effect that there used to be.  The money would be spent 
somewhere else, probably buying something made in the United 
States or Mexico or in the global economy given the effect of 
globalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very interesting argument and one that bothers me.  It 
is not something I would like to see.  It points out once again 
all the unintended side effects of entering into these agreements 
which at the time many people warned would have the effect of 
breaking down certain traditions within the country and certain 
ways of viewing each other and relating to each other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equalization is one of the primary ways we have of relating to 
each other as Canadians through the principle that all Canadians 
no matter where they live should have provincial governments that 
are fiscally able to provide a reasonably comparable level of 
service. Anything which poses a danger to this should be of 
concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have noticed in the past that Mr. Courchene has often been the 
harbinger of bad policy and things that when we first heard them 
we hoped they would never come true but then 10 or 15 years down 
the line they are conventional wisdom.  I hope his current 
reflections on the equalization program do not belong in the same 
category. 
<P><A NAME="LINK188"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to close the debate.  I thank all hon. members for 
their submissions in this debate.  I am not surprised that there 
is very little agreement among members especially from have 
provinces to change the equalization formula.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect, the government member who spoke talked around the 
problem of equalization.  He talked around the motion.  We are 
all very much aware of how the formula came about.  He offered 
very little help and very little advice about how the formula 
could be changed to reflect the very real economic problems of 
the have-not provinces in this nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Simply put, we need economic development and jobs.  We need to 
maximize the impact of any resource development on our economy 
and on the provincial treasury.  We in Newfoundland and Labrador 
have lost a lot in our economy due to federal government cuts in 
programs and personnel.  We are seeing the spectacle of every new 
resource dollar being clawed back, being subtracted dollar for 
dollar from our nearly $1 billion in equalization payments. As I 
said earlier in the debate, the Hibernia development is an 
exception.  From those revenues, we will only lose 70 cents on 
the equalization dollar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need the equalization formula improved.  This improvement 
needs to be applied to the other resource developments as well. 
That is the whole point of the motion, a change in the 
equalization formula.  If there is no change, there will not be a 
catching up.  There will not be a chance for equality of the 
provinces unless there is some recognition of the fact that the 
very pool of money made available by the federal government 
through equalization to keep provinces from starving is the same 
pool of money that will keep them permanently poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying that we should put in place a new equalization 
formula for ever and a day.  I am saying that we should work out 
an arrangement for have-not provinces that will see resource 
revenues clawed back on a more gradual basis.  For example, there 
could be a 50% clawback on a development such as Voisey's Bay and 
maybe a 35% or 40% clawback on a development like Sable Island. 
That way there would be an opportunity to play catch up, to bring 
back to an acceptable level the employment rate and the quality 
of life for people who happen to live in a have-not province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am willing to listen to an alternative to that.  If there 
happens to be no agreement on changing the equalization formula, 
maybe in the next budget some alternative measures could be taken 
to help the economically deprived provinces of which I belong to 
one.  I do not expect to change the world today but I want the 
people of Canada to know that the current equalization formula is 
taking one step forward and one step back.  If that is the case, 
how can we ever get ahead, how can we equalize, how can we catch 
up?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Day after day in this House, the Canadian public and we in this 
chamber have been subjected to the repeated evasions and 
diversions to questions about the role of the Prime Minister in 
this matter.  There is also the matter of the government's 
selected perception as to the role of the RCMP Public Complaints 
Commission in investigating last November's crackdown at the APEC 
summit in Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue extends well beyond whether the RCMP were out of line 
in security measures they used against protesters.  It extends 
beyond the appropriateness of former Indonesian President Suharto 
even being here on an official state visit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the heart of the issue is the mounting evidence that the 
Prime Minister and his office staff interfered with the RCMP in 
the arrangement of security to basically placate the wishes of a 
foreign dictator, to avoid offending him.  We have seen e-mails, 
memorandums and notebooks which express the wishes of the Prime 
Minister and his staff.  They are referenced there quite clearly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also witnessed the Prime Minister in the thick of the 
protest.  Camera angles have caught him at that.  Even the Prime 
Minister's assertion that he was not, in the words of the NDP, 
barking out orders, it certainly raises questions as to what was 
taking place at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the very least, the Prime Minister should be given the 
opportunity, and I suggest he has the opportunity, to rise in 
this House and clarify contradictory statements made about the 
handling of this affair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A ministerial statement in the House is appropriate. That is why 
my colleagues in the Conservative Party and I have been calling 
for the Prime Minister to make such a statement in this House and 
clearly outline what role he played in directing the RCMP during 
the security at APEC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why as well we put a motion before the justice committee 
to conduct an independent review of the relationship between the 
PMO and the RCMP to determine whether political interference 
occurred in APEC and whether there are grounds to look at this 
further and perhaps clarify the boundaries of what the Prime 
Minister's role should be in political interference when the RCMP 
are handling matters such as this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians rightfully want answers and the government continues 
to throw up smoke.  It points to the inquiry conducted by the 
RCMP Public Complaints Commission into the APEC role as a means 
to get to the bottom of these questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless of the commission's inquiry, nothing prevents the 
Prime Minister from speaking to this matter in the House.  It 
would not interfere with the inquiry in any way, shape or form. 
In fact it might raise new questions for the commission to 
pursue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest the cloud that hangs over the commission further 
complicates the matter because the commission's mandate is 
intended to focus on complaints directed toward the RCMP.  It has 
nothing to do with political interference.  The commission is 
headed by a chairperson who has made political donations to the 
Liberal Party of Canada, thus bringing into question the arm's 
length integrity of that person, sadly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recommendations that that commission might make in any event 
are not binding. The report is then made to the RCMP commissioner 
or the solicitor general himself, thus further undermining the 
integrity of that commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly what we need to have happen in this case is have the 
Prime Minister stand in his place in this chamber and give 
Canadians what they deserve:  accountability and responsible 
leadership in government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians need an investigative process that is open, 
transparent and accountable and also has the appearance of such. 
I call again upon the government and the Prime Minister to 
clarify what exactly took place in Vancouver.  Let us stop the 
stonewalling.  Let us stop talking about what the commission is 
charged with doing and talk about what the commission is not 
charged with doing, and that is the accountability of the Prime 
Minister and political interference that is alleged in this 
matter.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Beth Phinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the public complaints commission was created by parliament in 
1986 to act in the public interest in addressing complaints by 
the public against the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commission is an independent civilian board.  Each year it 
receives on average 1,000 complaints from Canadians about the 
RCMP.  About 300 of these complaints result annually in 
independent investigations. The commission has a strong list of 
members and has carried out its mandate with integrity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Opposition members of this House have charged that the public 
complaints commission will not be able to get to the bottom of 
the issues relating to the APEC summit because its mandate is too 
narrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The terms of reference in this particular hearing show clearly 
how broad the scope of an inquiry can be.  The APEC panel will 
hear all evidence and will report on “the events that took place 
during or in conjunction with demonstrations during the APEC 
conference in Vancouver”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chair of the public complaints commission has stated that 
the panel will follow the evidence where it leads and that the 
scope of the investigation will be broad.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Any questions regarding the RCMP operations prior to and during 
the APEC summit are squarely within the scope of this hearing. 
Continued attacks on the ability of the PCC to investigate 
properly the APEC summit will undermine the integrity of this 
body, which I might emphasize has developed a strong reputation 
over the past 12 years for fairness and thoroughness in its 
deliberations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members should be aware that the government has provided 
additional funding to assist the commission to hold a very 
complex hearing in the public interest.  This funding will, for 
example, cover the administrative and witness costs of the APEC 
hearing.  A number of senior federal officials from, for example, 
the PMO and DFAIT will testify at the hearing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also stress that the government has co-operated fully, indeed 
has gone to great lengths with the commission's council for the 
release of documents.  The government is just as interested as 
hon. members across the House in seeing a full and complete 
independent inquiry into security at the APEC summit.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise pursuant to a question I asked of the Minister for 
International Trade in the House last week with respect to the 
decision taken by the government this summer having to do with 
the suit brought against the government by Ethyl Corporation 
under the conditions of NAFTA, whereby Ethyl was suing the 
government for $350 million on the basis that the government's 
decision to ban MMT, the gasoline additive, would cost Ethyl 
Corporation that amount of money in anticipated profits from the 
sale of MMT. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was done pursuant to chapter XI of NAFTA in which we find 
one of the more insidious aspects of NAFTA, something that was 
not included in the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement but which 
found its way into NAFTA.  That is an investor state dispute 
settlement process whereby investors are able to directly sue 
governments in a way that they were never previously able to do 
with respect to trade disputes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past, prior to NAFTA, a corporation, an American 
corporation in this case which felt that it had been unfairly 
treated by the Canadian government, would have had to persuade 
its own government to enter into a trade dispute settlement 
process with Canada.  This now with NAFTA is not the case and 
Ethyl was able to proceed to sue the Government of Canada under 
chapter XI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened this summer was that the government capitulated, 
settled out of court with Ethyl, paid $13 million and declared 
that it had been wrong on MMT. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This raises a couple of concerns.  One is the environmental 
concern with respect to MMT, but the one that I am more concerned 
about today is the way in which the response of the government to 
the suit by Ethyl Corporation points out the weaknesses of NAFTA. 
I believe this is why the government settled out of court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government did not want it to go the full length of the 
process under chapter XI because had it gone the full length of 
the process and had the ruling gone against the government, as I 
think the government anticipated it might have, this terrible 
fundamental flaw in NAFTA would have been bared for all to see. 
It would have been revealed to be the kind of mistake that it 
truly is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of allowing this to proceed and having that revealed for 
all Canadians to see, the government decided to settle out of 
court, blame its decision on another ruling having to do with the 
internal trade agreement between the provinces in Canada and duck 
altogether the possibility that this terrible weakness in NAFTA 
would have been revealed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the minister of trade if in that light, having learned 
this about the agreement, he was now prepared to say that the 
government would not be pursuing a multilateral agreement on 
investment which included this investor state dispute settlement 
process because the MAI, as it is currently outlined, would 
extend this provision to investors in all OECD countries. 
Instead of just American corporations having the power to bring 
suit against the government, it would be all countries of the 
OECD.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of answer did I get?  The minister got up and said 
“This never went to a NAFTA dispute settlement panel” and then 
she sat down.  I never said it went to a NAFTA dispute settlement 
panel.  That is an entirely different matter, an entirely 
different aspect of the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I said had to do with the investor state dispute settlement 
process and I never received a decent answer from the minister on 
that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Beth Phinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Revenue, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the government's 
decision to delist MMT responds to a ruling by a panel 
established under the agreement on internal trade, AIT. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This panel determined that the Manganese-based Fuel Additives 
Act was inconsistent with the federal government's obligations 
under the AIT. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the light of the government's response to the panel's 
recommendation, the government also moved to resolve Ethyl 
Corporation's NAFTA claim and Ethyl Canada's challenge in the 
Ontario court.  Ethyl has terminated its legal actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Studies in Canada and the United States are proceeding on the 
impact of MMT on health and the environment.  If subsequent 
federal government action is warranted, it will act using the 
Canadian Environmental Protection Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's right to regulate in the public interest is not 
in question.  NAFTA is consistent with Canada's sovereign right 
to regulate in the public interest respecting public health, 
environment and the safety of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the investor state proposals under discussion in the MAI 
negotiations, Canada continues to favour open and transparent 
processes which reflect high standards of procedural fairness 
compatible with Canada's legal practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's position is clear.  Nothing in the MAI would 
prevent the government from regulating in the public interest. 
This includes legislation to protect our environment, our labour 
standards and our health and social services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In April, together with other OECD countries, Canada confirmed 
that the MAI must be consistent with the sovereign responsibility 
of governments to conduct domestic policies and not inhibit the 
normal non-discriminatory exercise of regulatory powers by 
governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada will only sign an agreement if it 
protects and promotes our national interests.  This includes our 
sovereign right to regulate in the context of protecting the 
health, safety and environment of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The motion to adjourn the House is 
now deemed to have been adopted.  Accordingly, the House stands 
adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 
24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 6.32 p.m.)
