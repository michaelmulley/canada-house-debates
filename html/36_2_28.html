Order in Council 1999-0957/00 authorized Canada Post to wind-up

Canada Post plans to act upon this authority before the end of 
this calendar year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) Canada Post has decided to wind-up Canada Post Holdings 
Limited for organizational simplification and, more importantly, 
for normal commercial income tax management purposes. Canada 
Post Holdings Limited has unexpired non-capital losses that it 
has been carrying forward and that will begin to expire in fiscal 
year 2000-01. As per normal commercial practice for taxable 
corporations, Canada Post is permitted to wind-up Canada Post 
Holdings Limited so that these non-capital losses can be utilized 
as tax deductions by Canada Post Corporation rather than have 
them expire in Canada Post Holdings Limited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) Canada Post Corporation will continue to hold 22.9% of the 
outstanding shares in PCL Holdings Inc. while 2875039 Canada 
Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Canada Post Corporation,

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from November 19 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-10, an act to amend the Municipal Grants Act, be read 
the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay—Boundary—Okanagan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to speak to Bill C-10 today.  I will 
start by dealing with a bit of a problem that opposition members 
have with various bits of government legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I first came to parliament I made what is euphemistically 
known as my maiden speech.  I am surprised feminists nowadays 
have not insisted we change that name.  In any case, I made my 
speech in which I said that I was not here to oppose for 
opposition sake, that if the government came forward with good 
legislation I would be the first to congratulate it.  If it came 
forward with legislation that had merit but could be improved, I 
would try to suggest constructive improvements to it.  Only when 
it was clearly bad and virtually unfixable would I then try to 
oppose it very strongly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the other problems we have is what to do with legislation 
in which there is a bit of good and a bit of bad.  What do we do 
in that situation? 
Do we really congratulate them because they have actually come 
out with some good?  Or, do we criticize them for all the things 
that are missing and the things that are wrong in it?  In the 
case of the particular bill I will do both and I will do it 
concurrently because the merits and the deficiencies of the bill 
are intertwined.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the bill interest may now be paid by the federal 
government to municipalities.  This is one of the good parts of 
the bill.  However, it is only if in the opinion of the minister 
the payment has been unreasonably delayed.  Likewise, 
supplementary payments can be made but only if the payment has 
been unreasonably delayed as defined by the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some government property is currently leased to non-government 
third parties.  In some cases these parties do not pay their 
taxes.  Of the hierarchy of people who get tax revenues, the ones 
that can least afford to be hit are the municipalities, cities, 
and particularly small towns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-10 proposes that the Department of Public Works and 
Government Services would make payment in lieu of taxes at the 
end of the taxation year, provided the taxing authority has made 
all reasonable efforts to collect the taxes and there is no 
likelihood they will ever collect them, if in the opinion of the 
minister the necessary conditions have been met.  At this point I 
think everyone can clearly see what kind of pattern is starting 
to appear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1983 the Minister of Public Works and Government Services 
established a municipal grants review committee.  Its function 
was to provide advice on resolution of disputes between the 
taxing authorities and the federal government.  The advice was 
non-binding and thus most people felt it was meaningless.  We 
hope that this will finally be corrected under Bill C-10. 
Essentially Bill C-10 puts this whole process into legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, let us look at exactly how it does so.  The minister 
hand picks the members and appoints the chair as well.  With this 
kind of control over the advisory panel, its recommendations are 
non-binding to the minister.  This is really a lot of show 
because we can see the predominant pattern once again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Schedule IV of the Municipal Grants Act lists corporations 
involved in profit oriented activities and therefore pay both 
property and business occupancy related payments in lieu of 
taxes.  The joint technical committee on payment in lieu of taxes 
recommended that Canada Post Corporation and the Royal Canadian 
Mint be added to schedule IV.  This recommendation has been 
ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know Canada Post now has a mandate to make a profit and 
has indeed been making a profit.  Even more notoriously the 
Canadian Mint has been going nose to nose against private sector 
companies for the minting of not only Canadian coins but foreign 
orders and business as well.  It stands to put an Alberta company 
out of business because the highly subsidized Canadian Mint is 
going into competition with it and using the stature of being a 
crown corporation, on top of the subsidies it gets, to compete 
against this private sector company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This certainly sends a message to those who might wonder how the 
minister will deal with other non-binding aspects of the bill. If 
he ignores this recommendation, why would anybody believe he 
would follow a recommendation in favour of a taxing authority in 
any of the other circumstances I have previously listed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the beginning of my speech I implied that the bill had some 
good points.  In review, those good points are so softened by the 
discretionary powers of the minister to suggest that they are 
worthless.  However these problems could be fixed and could be 
fixed very easily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All we need to do is remove the discretionary power of the 
minister and make interest for late payments a requirement for 
payment of delinquent third party taxes, recommend that the 
recommendations of the advisory panel be binding, and include 
Canada Post and the Royal Canadian Mint in schedule IV of the 
Municipal Grants Act.  It is that simple and that fair.  I hope 
the government would seriously consider putting these kinds of 
amendments into its bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes it is a stretch, but I have to assume that the 
government actually wants to write good legislation.  When we see 
things like Bill C-68, like the Nisga'a legislation and a lot of 
others, we have to wonder if in fact it wants to write good 
legislation.  In this case I think there has been at least a half 
hearted effort to write something with some decency in it. 
Perhaps it will consider these amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also the legislation gives cause to look at another situation 
which is in direct conflict with the alleged intent of Bill C-10. 
Bill C-10 sets out certain rights for local taxing authorities 
which in essence are local, civil, municipal or regional 
governments.  It also makes clear that those rights are extremely 
limited and given only through the discretion of the federal 
minister.  This means they can be taken away or never even 
granted in the first place despite the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What a contrast this makes to the unprecedented constitutionally 
enshrined self-government powers of the Nisga'a under the Nisga'a 
treaty.  The Nisga'a will have the only recognized government 
outside the federal and provincial governments.  What a 
comparison when we compare Nisga'a rights against those of the 
small towns in my riding.  Towns like Oliver, Osoyoos, Grand 
Forks, Trail, Castlegar and Nelson will get absolutely no 
guarantees of anything under this legislation.  Neither will 
large cities like Vancouver, Calgary, Regina, Winnipeg, Toronto 
or Montreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Nisga'a legislation gives powers to approximately 2,000 
people living on Nisga'a lands.  It gives them the ability to 
direct even the federal government in certain areas.  They have 
powers in terms of such things as schooling, policing and a 
variety of things over which municipalities have no say 
whatsoever.  They even have in their treaty a special provision 
for future potential taxing rights which no other town, city or 
municipality in Canada has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it not be interesting if we went to the Nisga'a and said 
that there were a lot of payments they should be getting from the 
Canadian Government but we have made them discretionary and will 
decide on a case by case basis whether or not we think we should 
pay them?  If we think we should not pay then we will not and 
they will have absolutely no say in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us compare that to what the Nisga'a actually get and what 
all the other towns I have listed get.  These are towns like the 
ones that everybody in parliament represents.  If the government 
wants to be fair it has to remove that discretionary 
consideration and at least give some pretence of giving something 
not only to small towns like those in my riding but even to the 
largest cities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now the mayor of Toronto is talking about seceding from 
Ontario.  The Bloc must have really loved that when he came out 
with that one.  Toronto would secede from Ontario and set up a 
new province of Toronto.  Heaven only knows it has enough people. 
I suspect that it would probably be the fourth or fifth largest 
populated province in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it stands on the edge of expressing a desire to do this, even 
Toronto does not have the powers the government is giving to 
2,000 people living on Nisga'a lands.  What a comparison when we 
start talking about discretionary powers where the government may 
make some payment to a town or a municipality under Bill C-10. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to end my comments by making an analogy that gives 
some perspective on Bill C-10.  It promises certain things to 
municipalities and towns but in fact is only teasing with it 
because they may never see it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said the bill had good things and bad things.  I would like to 
leave members with the picture of going out to a store and buying 
a great big meaty bone for a dog.  That is good thing to do.  The 
dog will be happy.  Animal rights people will be happy.  They 
will feel good about the good thing they have done.  Then if they 
bring the bone home and use it to tease the dog by dangling it in 
front of it and snatching it away every time it reaches for it, 
that would be bad.  That is exactly what the bill does.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill issues a potential of living up to its obligations to 
the municipalities, of making the payments that many of the 
municipalities desperately need, because they are providing 
services to crown owned properties inside their areas. The 
federal government is saying “Here is this tax.  We think we 
will give it to you but if we think that you do not deserve it, 
we will not pay and there is not a damn thing you can do about 
it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has started with something that has a little bit 
of potential.  I hope it has the integrity and fortitude to make 
the changes and turn good intentions into reality. 
<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the member for Kootenay—Boundary—Okanagan has made many 
important points relating to Bill C-10. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Grants in lieu of taxes have been a thorn in the side of 
municipalities for many, many years.  The question always raised 
by the municipalities has been why the federal government does 
not pay its taxes like all other Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt the approach federal governments have used for 
the last 20 years is very divisive.  It certainly does not bring 
Canadians together.  My hon. colleague indicated that this 
approach basically creates situations where mayors of large 
cities are calling for their own special status, whether it be in 
the form of creating new provinces or new city states. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the new millennium approaching, Canadians need a new way of 
dealing on a level playing field in how they are taxed.  There is 
no doubt that the Municipal Grants Act tends to give the federal 
government special status in the area of paying property taxes to 
the municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member for Kootenay—Boundary—Okanagan, should the 
federal government give itself special status and how does it 
relate to the whole principle of equality in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Jim Gouk:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
his question. He raised a couple of important points, including 
the whole concept of special status. He asked if there should be 
special status for the federal government.  No, there should not 
be special status for anyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During my speech I raised the Nisga'a treaty as an example. One 
of the biggest objections we have to the Nisga'a treaty is that 
it provides special status for some. The word equality is used 
all the time.  We hear it used by both sides of the House, yet 
the government grants special status to the Nisga'a under the 
Nisga'a treaty.  It grants special status to itself under Bill 
C-10.  Now we can see where it is coming from when it had no 
problem with that aspect of the Nisga'a treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an old adage about things that flow downhill.  We know 
what that is and where the source is.  There has been a lot of 
downloading.  The federal government has downloaded a lot of 
costs for things onto the provinces.  But the provinces are also 
taxing authorities so they keep it flowing downhill until it 
reaches the municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In their own respect, municipalities, towns and cities are also 
taxing authorities but they are extremely limited. They have no 
actual power.  It is a delegated power, unlike that of the 
Nisga'a who have actual self-government that is entrenched in the 
constitution.  Municipalities have only those powers delegated to 
them by higher authorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government with this bill is saying it may pay or it may 
not, and because the government has power over the municipalities 
it will decide whether they get paid or not.  It is extremely 
unfair for the biggest brother in Canada to download on the 
little brothers, the provinces, who then download on the 
non-status towns and municipalities throughout the country while 
saying it is transferring all of its costs downhill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the federal government to look good it passes it to the 
provincial governments.  For the provincial governments to 
survive, having lost the money but which are still expected to 
provide the same services, they download some of it to the 
municipalities. Now big brother back in Ottawa is saying it is 
downloading but it may not, and in some cases likely will not, 
pay its share of the bill. 
When I say likely, and in some cases definitely, I mean Canada 
Post in particular.  The mint is also in that category but it is 
somewhat isolated.  Canada Post is all over the country, and for 
the government not to put it in schedule IV is an absolute 
download on municipalities and towns with no hope of their 
collecting.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to speak to a piece of legislation 
that perhaps is not quite as sexy and certainly not as 
controversial as a lot of the legislation that comes before the 
House.  However, it has a spot which is very close to my heart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill deals with municipalities and the Municipal Grants Act, 
which now is going to be called the payments in lieu of taxes 
act.  The reason I say it has a spot close to my heart is that as 
the majority of members in the House are aware, I came through 
the ranks of elected municipal officials. I had the opportunity 
and the great pride and honour to represent the city of Brandon 
as its mayor for three terms. Prior to that I sat on council for 
the city of Brandon for three terms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our caucus also has the distinction and honour of having a 
number of members who have also served honourably on municipal 
councils.  The member for Saint John was a mayor of great renown. 
The member for Richmond—Arthabaska was a mayor of that 
community.  The member for Compton—Stanstead was the mayor of 
that community.  As well the member for Markham was a councillor 
of that municipality.  There is a lot of experience among my 
colleagues with respect to municipalities, municipal requirements 
and certainly municipal issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This piece of legislation as was mentioned before has some good 
qualities to it.  One of the thorns in the sides of municipal 
leaders all over this great country is the way the federal 
government looks down on municipalities and does not deal with 
them the way municipalities feel is right and necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though I am standing in the House right now, I still 
believe very strongly that the grassroots of the first level of 
government is that of the municipal governments.  It is 
accessible by its constituents.  It has elected officials who are 
very close to the issues most important to Canadians where they 
reside.  Canadians depend on that municipal level of government 
to provide them with services that are close to their needs and 
requirements in their homes, their municipalities and their 
constituencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about some of those services.  A municipal council 
and its elected officials are responsible for delivering the 
services that are so in need, such as sewer and water.  It would 
be awful if we turned on a tap and nothing flowed.  That is a 
municipal responsibility. Protective services, such as police, 
fire and ambulance, are needed on a daily basis by our 
constituents. They are provided by municipal councils.  When 
garbage is taken away from our front steps and put in a landfill, 
it is the responsibility of the municipality.  Roads, bridges and 
any other type of capital infusion or capital requirement at the 
municipal level are municipal responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mention these services because the only way a municipality can 
generate the revenue necessary to provide those services is 
through property taxes.  They are services to properties and are 
paid for by property taxes.  This is very important in this 
debate because property tax is levied on properties, whether they 
are apartment buildings, residential buildings, commercial 
buildings, single family homes, or buildings owned by the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because municipalities are not recognized in the constitution, 
the federal government does not recognize taxation to 
municipalities.  That is terribly arrogant. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1040"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Municipalities feel that they are better than that.  They should 
first of all be recognized in the constitution as being a level 
of government, certainly not the first level because the federal 
government on the benches across the way feel that that is its 
right and due.  There should be a recognition for municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because the federal government does not recognize taxation as 
such and because it does not recognize the jurisdiction that is 
levying that tax, it has what is known as a grant in lieu of 
taxes.  It is not a grant.  It is a payment for services 
delivered to the property. In this proposed legislation it is 
changing it to payments in lieu of taxes.  That is a little 
better, but why not just simply say taxes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The normal process with respect to taxation is that everyone who 
owns property in jurisdictions and municipalities is assessed a 
taxable rate levied by the municipality.  An assessment value is 
placed on the property by assessors, whether it be provincial 
assessors or municipal assessors. I as an individual have the 
opportunity and right to question that assessment.  I have the 
right to go to a court of appeal, usually a municipal court or 
board of revision and question the assessment that is placed on 
my property.  If I do not like that, then I go to the next level. 
In Manitoba it is the municipal board where I can then argue 
that the assessment is either right or wrong.  If I lose at that 
level I can then go to the Court of Queen's Bench and argue that 
my assessment is out of whack. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government however does not follow those rules.  It 
simply says that it is arbitrarily going to change the rules and 
decide what the assessed value is on the property.  Nothing 
changes in this proposed legislation to change that arbitrary 
distinction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I am splitting my time with the member for 
Madawaska—Restigouche. I understand that I have five minutes 
left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was saying, the federal government does not have to follow 
the rules of the province of the jurisdiction where it is 
questioning that assessment.  We could say that should be okay. 
The government in this bill has proposed an appeal board.  From 
personal experience I can say that there is an arrogance at the 
bureaucracy level of the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give some examples where federal government officials 
decided that they did not want to pay the assessed value of a 
property.  There was one instance in my municipality when I was 
sitting as mayor.  The provincial assessors decided that there 
was a specific assessed value of a property of the federal 
government.  Arbitrarily that value was reduced by 50%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is like someone with a residential property saying to the 
municipality, “I don't like the assessed value that you placed 
on my property. Therefore I am only paying half of what you are 
going to assess me in taxes”.  Unfortunately there are remedies 
for that.  The municipality could then say, “That is too bad. 
If you don't pay the whole amount, we will take your property in 
a tax sale”.  The municipality cannot do that with the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Arbitrarily the government officials reduced the true value of 
the property to half of its level.  We then had to go to an 
appeal panel. When I appeal assessments I like to look in the 
eyes of the people I am appealing to.  The suggested approach at 
that time was to send a letter to the appeal panel that was going 
to be put in place by the federal government. There would be no 
opportunity to argue our position and the panel would make a 
decision.  That is like appointing the judge, the jury and the 
executioner.  There was no effective appeal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has changed that now.  It now has an appeal panel 
of 26 people minimum.  Again they are approved and appointed by 
the federal government.  Perhaps a lot of unemployed former 
Liberal MPs would like to find themselves sitting on that appeal 
panel, which I do not have a lot of faith at the municipal level 
of having an honest, fair and equitable decision being made. I am 
not happy about that area of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not happy that municipalities are not identified as a level 
of government.  They provide more and better services than the 
federal and provincial levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing I am not happy with is the way that the 
legislation has come forward.

sit on the board of directors for the Federation of Canadian 
Municipalities for some eight years.  It is an organization that 
represents almost every municipality across the country.  When 
the federal government brings forth legislation to put into place 
a very important aspect of taxation should it not sit down with 
the Federation of Canadian Municipalities and get its 
understanding, its feel and its approval for a piece of 
legislation before it comes forward?  At the very least, should 
the federal government not inform the FCM that this piece of 
legislation is coming forward and what the make-up will be of the 
legislation?  It did not happen and I have absolutely no idea or 
understanding as to why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will support the legislation going back to committee.  We 
will support having full, open, honest debate and discussion at

to make sure it deals with this piece of legislation honourably 
and that it puts into place the necessary requirements to make 
sure that municipalities are treated properly and not with the 
arrogance that has been seen from this federal government toward 
the municipalities over the last six years.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Jean Dubé (Madawaska—Restigouche, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
great honour and privilege for me today to be able to speak on 
this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague said that he used to be the mayor of a 
municipality.  The municipal level is very dear to my heart, for 
my father was the mayor of the city of Campbellton until his 
death a month ago.  I can therefore say that today's bill is 
close to my heart, and that is why it is a privilege and a 
pleasure to speak to it. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conversations with representatives from the Federation of 
Canadian Municipalities, the FCM, it is abundantly clear that 
municipalities and their organizations do not appreciate having 
the legislation rammed down their throats.  Municipalities were 
not given any advance notice that the legislation was being 
introduced.  No information, no background notes, no news 
releases, no summaries and no other materials were sent out to 
these various municipalities.  These municipalities are on the 
front line serving our constituents.  They are the front line 
government and I believe the most important government in our 
federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The municipal governments have not had time to study the bill 
and respond to it.  In the case of the FCM, it has not had time 
to consult its members on the bill.  This begs the question: If 
this is such a great piece of legislation, what is the rush? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know from experience that when legislation is rushed 
through the House mistakes often get overlooked.  Quick 
legislation is bad legislation.  As a member of the House and as 
a member of the committee, along with my colleagues, that will 
attempt to clean up the mistakes in the bill, I call on the 
government to allow more time for the House standing committee to 
work on the bill and more time for municipalities and other 
stakeholders to ensure that the legislation will correct past 
problems without creating new ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of past problems, the very fact that we have a 
Municipal Grants Act is a bit of an absurdity of history since 
the government does not officially recognize the existence of 
municipalities.  Towns, cities and local service districts are 
not mentioned in the constitution.  They have no official 
mandate.  They are entirely a creation of provincial governments. 
Furthermore, the federal government has a constitutional 
exemption from paying local taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that the federal government, which owns property 
in almost 2,000 municipalities across the country, benefits from 
all kinds of municipal services, such as water and sewage, roads 
and other infrastructure.  Those services are not free.  In spite 
of its constitutional exemption, the federal should pay for those 
services like every other good property owner in Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This paradox was resolved in 1950 with the passage of the first 
Municipal Grants Act which has been updated and revised many 
times, most recently in 1990.  Since 1980, there have been a 
number of issues pop up that the current legislation does not and 
cannot resolve.  This is the basis of the bill that we have 
before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, a couple of years ago, I remember that there was a 
dispute between the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and local 
municipalities as to whether the department had to make a payment 
in lieu of taxes on wharves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not too long ago, the federally owned Aéroports de Montréal 
protested a property evaluation by the city of Dorval.  Ottawa 
re-evaluated the land at $100 million less than the property 
assessment and told the city that if it did not like it, it could 
contest the figure before a federal government appointed 
tribunal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my home province of New Brunswick, the provincial department 
of municipalities estimates how much municipalities will receive 
from federal payments in lieu of taxes and pays them that amount. 
The department then goes about collecting the payments from the 
federal government, but it is only sometime later that the 
federal government actually pays the amount due and, in some 
cases, the payment has taken years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995, the city of Halifax yelled foul when, after increasing 
the evaluation of the Citadel from $15 million to $36 million, 
the federal government reduced its evaluation from $15 million to 
$1.2 million.  Short of going to court, the two governments had 
no ways of resolving this dispute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992, the Government of Quebec gave municipalities the right 
to replace all or part of their business occupancy taxes with a 
new real property tax.  The result was a sudden $41 million 
increase in the federal payments to Quebec municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Ontario, the provincial government eliminated its business 
occupancy tax.  To make up the lost revenue, Ontario 
municipalities increased their commercial real property tax rates 
by an average of about 45%.  These reforms cost the federal 
government as much as $100 million a year more in payments in 
lieu of taxes in leasehold occupancy costs.  Furthermore, crown 
corporations are paying approximately $30 million more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, a freeze on payments from 1993 to 1995 made municipal 
governments mistrustful of the federal government and made the 
current system unreliable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, it is time to update the legislation to deal with these 
problems that have presented themselves in recent years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us today proposes changes in a number of these 
areas. The bill would change the name of the legislation from 
Municipal Grants Act to the payments in lieu of taxes act, while 
references in the legislation to “grants” will be replaced with 
the word “payments”.  This is to better reflect the nature of 
the program and the relationship between the Government of Canada 
as a property owner and Canadian and municipal governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill proposes introducing compensation for late payments by 
the federal government to municipalities.  It also would give the 
authority to Ottawa to make payments when tenants on federal 
property default on their local tax bills.  These are important 
changes under which the federal government accepts a position 
much closer to that of other property owners regarding its tax 
obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would establish a dispute advisory panel under the act with a 
minimum of two board members from each province and territory. 
The advisory panel would recommend solutions to the minister when 
disputes arise between municipalities and the federal government 
over the appropriate amount of payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Outdoor swimming pools, golf course improvements, outdoor 
theatres, residential driveways and employee parking improvements 
would be added to the definition of “federal property” and the 
bill would clarify the wording of the act as it relates to a 
non-building structure.

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, Bill C-10 proposes to improve the predictability of 
payments for municipalities by clarifying how payments are 
calculated for federal farm property and how deductions are 
calculated when municipalities are unable or unwilling to provide 
the federal property with equivalent services to those received 
by similar private property or structures.  It would also clarify 
the status of Parks Canada assets as federal property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the bill does introduce some important changes, there 
is one important area where I have strong reservations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other than section 4 of the bill, which states the intent of the 
act and which I think is a waste of space as it accomplishes 
nothing, I would say that 90% of the bill is an improvement over 
the existing legislation.  The important exception is in section 
14, which would establish a new dispute advisory panel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two major difficulties with the proposed new panel, 
the first being one of fairness and balance and the second being 
the composition of the panel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine a court trial in which the defendant got to pick his own 
jury, got to pay the jury and install himself as final judge with 
no chance of appeal.  How would the defendant do?  I suspect he 
would win just about every case.  Would we describe this system 
as fair?  I do not think so.  Yet this is exactly the kind of 
dispute settlement panel the minister has proposed in Bill C-10. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Differences in opinion often arise between municipalities and 
the federal government over how much the crown owes for payments 
in lieu of taxes.  These disputes are often based on the 
valuation of a property or the definition and classification of a 
property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the minister has proposed is that he should establish an 
advisory panel composed of a minimum of two persons from each 
province and territory, for a total of at least 26 members. The 
members will be chosen only by the minister, and we can just 
imagine who will be chosen.  The minister will decide how 
qualified the members of the panel need to be.  He will pay them 
$125 per hour plus expenses and they will report only to him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister can fire any of the members of the board at any 
time for any reason if, for example, he disagrees with their 
decision.  He can completely ignore any decision of the panel if 
it suits his purpose and his decision is absolutely final.  There 
is no appeal.  Not a bad deal.  So much for fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On issues related to the composition of the panel, let us look 
at section 14 in more detail.  Subsection 14(1) proposes, as I 
have said, a panel consisting of no less than two members from 
each province and territory with relevant knowledge or 
experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My first reaction was that once the bill passes, there will be 
26 very happy Liberals across the country who will have brand new 
patronage jobs.  After all, $125 an hour plus expenses is a 
pretty good day's work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on the other members of the House to support the bill at 
second reading so we can get it into committee and hopefully fix 
some of these problems.

taxes.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What does that mean exactly for the ordinary folk?  I refer to 
the bill's summary, which states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This enactment amends the Municipal Grants Act to improve the 
fairness, equity and predictability of payments made under the 
Act.  A statement of purpose is included.  The enactment 
establishes an Advisory Panel to advise the minister on disputes 
concerning payment amounts.  It addresses the issues of 
compensation for untimely payments, defaults on tax obligations 
by certain tenants of the Crown and the bijural nature of the 
Canadian legal system. 
The enactment also makes other amendments of an administrative 
nature. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois agrees in principle with this bill.  And 
even though we have concerns about some of the points we do not 
agree with, we will vote in favour of the bill.  We disagree on 
some very specific points.  First, on the need to pass this bill 
in a hurry.  We know it has been around for two years.  Now all 
of a sudden it requires urgent attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of municipalities are currently complaining about being 
unable to examine this bill in depth and to meet with their 
member of parliament.  I would have liked to meet with the 
municipalities in my riding—there are 12 of them—to really 
find out what points bother them. 
Unfortunately, they are not being given the time to do that, 
since the government is moving quickly to get this bill passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the minister's discretionary power. It is true 
that such power is found in a number of bills, but I wonder when 
the government will truly decide to give more power to those 
directly concerned, in this case the municipalities, and to 
reduce the discretionary power of the minister who, in the end, 
is the one who decides and who simply does as he pleases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will also talk about the advisory panel—a bogus panel, in my 
opinion—to which people will be appointed to give advice to the 
government, not to make any decisions. 
Also several federal properties are being excluded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say that the new title of the bill is less paternalistic, 
closer to reality—something which is important to those 
concerned—and clearer. There is a lot of talk about clarity 
these days—I will get back to this later on—since, all week, 
the word clear was constantly being raised during oral question 
period. It is important to talk about clarity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that the title of this bill is a little clearer than 
the former one, which was “Municipal Grants Act”. That title 
suggested that the federal government was giving grants to 
municipalities. A grant means a donation or a gift, but that was 
not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Actually, these grants were used by the federal government to 
pay for services provided to its properties located on 
provincial and municipal land. 
The new title is a little clearer, a little more accurate 
than the former one, and the minister deserves praise for this 
giant step.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Judging by the number of times it has used a gag order to cut 
off debate during the consideration of bills, it cannot be said 
that this government is always clear.  Quite the contrary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that some clarity is in order from this government, 
which wants so much clarity from the provinces, particularly the 
Province of Quebec, when it comes to past referendums and 
referendums not yet held.  As recently as yesterday, during oral 
question period, the Prime Minister was working himself up and 
saying that he would not negotiate the morning after a 
referendum if the question was not clear, regardless of the 
supreme court ruling.  Yet this was not what the supreme court 
ruled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supreme court said that it was not up to the Prime Minister 
to decide whether or not the question was clear.  The supreme 
court ruled that he must negotiate, failing which Quebec could 
take action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of clarity, here is another example.  I remember the 
1980 referendum, in which Pierre Elliott Trudeau, with the help 
of his henchman, told us that a yes meant no, that a no meant 
yes, that Quebecers were telling him they wanted change in the 
federal system, and that there would be change.  He staked his 
life on it.  With the sort of clarity that calls a yes a no and 
a no a yes, the results are not surprising. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently, in the great rally in Montreal just before the 1995 
referendum, the present Prime Minister promised Quebecers that 
he would renew Canadian federalism.  “Decentralized federalism” 
was what he called it. 
At the present time, we are faced with a centralizing and 
dominating federalism that no longer even recognizes this 
founding people, the people of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clarity is something this government was desperately in need of. 
That is why the minister must be congratulated on at least 
changing the title of the bill to make it clearer.  The new 
title is less paternalistic and more realistic, as I said, and 
the Bloc Quebecois agrees with the change.  As I have also said, 
however, the Bloc Quebecois still has questions on certain very 
specific points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have difficulty recognizing the discretionary ministerial 
power in this bill.  Instead of appointing a panel to advise the 
minister, it would have been easy to give this panel real power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been done in a number of areas, the municipalities could 
have appointed one person, the government another.  These two 
could have appointed a third and, instead of advising the 
minister, the panel could have really settled disputes between 
the municipalities and the federal government. But no, the 
minister appoints the members of an advisory panel whose role is 
to provide him with information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>An hon. member:</B> A panel made up of buddies.

colleague has said, this panel will very often be made up of 
friends or of candidates defeated in the last election.  The 
panel will advise the minister, but it is the minister who will 
have the last word and make the decisions.  It is not, 
therefore, surprising to see so much conflict between the 
federal and the provincial or municipal levels of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point that raises questions is all that is not included 
in the definition of “federal buildings”, for instance: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>a</I>) any structure or work that is not a building designed 
primarily for the shelter of people, living things, plant or

within an area defined as “urban” by Statistics Canada, as of 
the most recent census of the population of Canada taken by 
Statistics Canada, other than any real property acquired 
pursuant to the <I>National Parks Act</I> or the <I>Historic Monuments Act</I> 
or any real property that is occupied or used as a park and has 
been prescribed to be included in the definition “federal

</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(i) that is occupied for residential purposes by an employee of 
Her Majesty in right of Canada who would not, but for that 
employment, live on that reserve..., 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Follows a whole list of real property the government reserves 
for itself, perhaps because of the Constitution.  However, I 
think the government could have used this bill to try to put 
some sort of order in all of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does it not pay for the services provided this real 
property?  According to the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services in her speech 
at first reading, and I quote: “The government is provided with 
direct and indirect useful services in exchange for payments in 
lieu of taxes”.  So they recognize that it is really to pay for 
the services they receive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the statement found in the bill's summary I read 
earlier about improving the fairness, equity and predictability 
of payments? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the government not pay its due to the provinces and 
municipalities, since we know that, in 5 years, it will have 
taken $95 billion in surplus away from the provinces and the 
municipalities?  This kind of money is certainly not growing on 
parliament hill. 
This money came from the unemployment insurance fund, from cuts 
to transfers to the provinces, and from higher provincial taxes 
because of a lack of indexing, not from parliament hill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should have given this money back to the 
municipalities and the provinces, because they need it to manage 
and pay the services provided to federal properties. Again, it 
would have allowed them to balance their budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, the federal government keeps accumulating surpluses and 
investing the money in new programs it will eventually drop. But 
the provinces and municipalities will have to pay for and keep 
providing services which, some day, the federal government will 
simply drop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister recently boasted about having surpluses and 
not knowing what to do with them.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill provided the Prime Minister with an opportunity to do 
something with these surpluses, if only he had given time to the 
municipalities to come and meet their members of parliament and 
if he had agreed to really pay for services provided to the 
federal government by the municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister had a golden opportunity to return the 
federal surpluses to the provinces or municipalities, where they 
are most needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, we disagree on three major points, namely the 
discretionary power, the bogus panel that the government will 
set up merely to exercise its discretionary power, and the whole 
part concerning real property, properties for which the 
government could have transferred money to the provinces and 
municipalities. However, as I said earlier, just because some 
clarity has been put in the bill and openness was demonstrated 
on a number of points, the Bloc Quebecois will support the bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I found it very interesting to listen to some of the 
criticism by the Bloc of the bill.  I have a few questions that I 
would like to ask in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It becomes abundantly clear, when one has been in the position I 
have been in for a number of years, that when funds are collected 
by the federal government the handling fee, so to speak, becomes 
very great.  I know the Bloc is pushing for a lot of the money to 
be transferred back to the provinces and so on, but we are 
talking about municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the Bloc agree that it would be better not to have the 
money sent to the federal government?  Would the Bloc agree that 
we should leave the money in the municipalities, leave it in the 
constituencies, and let the people decide the level of tax they 
want? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Reform Party firmly believe, if we want effective 
government services, that the closer those services can be 
delivered to the people the better off they will be.  I wonder if 
the member would agree with that.  He talked about the federal 
surplus.  What is wrong with reducing taxes?  Why not leave the 
money in the pockets of the people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone who has studied this point has come to the conclusion 
that if we want to create real jobs we have to reduce the tax 
burden.  The biggest tax burden is imposed by the federal 
government.  That would do more to stimulate the economy in local 
constituencies than anything else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member agree that the money should be left with the 
people?  We should let the people of Quebec, the people of the 
local municipalities, decide.  A tremendous bureaucracy is 
developed in the federal government when it is allowed to tax at 
the level it has taxed, and there is a huge handling fee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Property taxes in Saskatchewan are a huge problem because 
two-thirds of the component of property taxes go toward 
education.  This puts an unfair burden on certain groups of 
people such as farmers who are trying to make a living from the 
land.  Would the member not agree that if a certain level of 
government such as a provincial government handles education in a 
province it should be the one to equitably fund it?

questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The short answer is yes.  I agree with him, and this is one of 
the reasons the Bloc Quebecois is here now.  Since it is 
impossible to renew this federalism, we have no choice but to 
work toward the sovereignty of Quebec.  Why?  Because we feel 
that the federal system—and I agree with the member on this 
point—is costing a huge amount of money.

and, according to the whim of the federal system, hand them back 
to the provinces, having taken a small cut?  I agree with him 100%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other week, the Premier of Quebec said  “Give us a federal 
system similar to that of the European Union and I will go for 
it immediately”.  How does the European Union operate right now? 
It consists of autonomous governments that give a mandate to 
the higher organization and pay accordingly.  I am in full 
agreement with such an approach.  The provinces should collect 
taxes and pay Ottawa for the services they receive, as simple.

are costing us a lot of money and doing us no good.  This is 
money that could benefit the provinces.

My thought entirely.  That is what the Bloc Quebecois is trying 
to do here, to move this outmoded federal system forward.  If

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
very interesting the hon. member suggested that in the end they 
would support the bill.  There are a lot of things in Bill C-10 
that I would support.  However there are a couple of questions I 
would like to ask him to clarify whether the hon. member would 
like to see the bill amended to meet some of the other 
requirements that ought to be in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, we are talking about crown corporations.  Schedule 
IV lists all crown corporations that make money and are there for 
profit.  One in particular is the Business Development Bank of 
Canada.  That bank is included as a crown corporation that must 
pay business tax because it is in the business of making money 
for the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three corporations are also making money for Canada.  They are 
the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, the Canada Post 
Corporation and the Canadian Mint.  These three corporations are 
excluded from schedule IV.  In my opinion they ought to be 
included because they should pay business tax to the 
municipalities as do all other businesses in the area.  Indeed 
there are other crown corporations that pay it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The requirement in the bill is that the minister may pay 
business tax to municipalities for those corporations listed 
under schedule IV.   Would the member agree that these three 
corporations—the Canadian Mint, Canada Post and Canada Mortgage 
and Housing Corporation—should also be included under schedule 
IV?

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Maurice Godin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am totally in agreement with 
what my colleague has just said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have just said, we are going to vote yes, but with a great 
many reservations on certain unfortunate points, the very ones 
he has just listed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I said that this famous panel ought to have had 
greater powers, precisely so as to provide the municipalities 
with support in certain areas.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, it is a cut and dried issue.  If the federal 
government has buildings, or receives services in a 
municipality, then it should quite simply—particularly with the 
huge surpluses it has—at least pay for the services it receives, 
just like John Q. Public does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would enable the municipalities and provinces to breathe 
easier and to balance their budgets.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
colleague from Châteauguay for the clarity of his remarks, 
because this is obviously not a simple bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He made frequent reference to clarity.  I know that I will have 
to be brief, because the ten minutes for questions and comments 
go by quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I question him on the bill as such, I would like to put a 
question to him about the debate currently under way in the 
House of Commons, especially during oral question period and 
also in the media, on a clear question for the referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me mention in passing that the Prime Minister, who 
apparently spends more time in the Ottawa area than at his 
cottage at Saint-Jean-des-Piles, I think, voted in that riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Prime Minister understood the referendum question in 
1995, why, in his opinion, did the other Quebecers not 
understand it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question on the bill before us today is the following.  Why 
does the hon. member think it is urgent to have this bill passed 
in a hurry, when, in the case of a bill that could help 
municipalities develop substantial programs for the future—such 
as the infrastructure program—the government is dragging 
negotiations on or not beginning them in order to reach a rapid 
conclusion, instead of one that is expected in December 2000? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My questions are: Why act with all haste with this bill, 
putting the other issue on cruising speed, and, why, in his 
opinion, if the Prime Minister understood the referendum 
question would the other Quebecers not be at least as 
intelligent as he is and would they not have understood it too? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Maurice Godin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his two 
questions. Since I must be quick, let me simply say that, 
regarding his first question, I am convinced the Prime Minister 
understood the question very well, as all Quebecers did. Let us 
not forget that 93% of Quebec voters actually voted in the 1995 
referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister understood the question very well and if he 
had won by 15 or 20 points, he would now be the first one to say 
that the question was very clear. But he won by 0.4%. And since 
I now know the number of people who voted at the very last 
minute, I do not think the federal government really won. This 
is why the Prime Minister is so intent on setting the rules 
governing the next referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for my colleague's second question, I too wonder why we must 
proceed so quickly. 
The other day, there was a question in which it was mentioned 
that municipalities were asking the government to get the 
infrastructure program going again. Last week, the minister told 
us that this would not happen until December 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is taking its time regarding infrastructures, and 
yet they are urgently needed. However, as regards this bill on 
municipalities—and I see that the Chair is signalling to me—I 
will conclude by telling the hon. member that I too cannot 
understand why the government is in such a hurry, considering 
there are so many other urgent things to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>The Speaker:</B> It is my duty to inform the House that there will 
now be 10 minutes for debate, with no questions or comments.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is always a delight to be invited to speak while Your Honour 
is in the chair, someone who truly understands the procedures of 
this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to begin by expressing my opposition to the bill 
before us today, Bill C-10, an act to amend the Municipal Grants 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we have heard, this bill purports to amend the federal 
government's relationship with municipalities.  As we know by the 
original act of confederation, the Constitution Act, 1867, the 
federal government and its legal creatures were excluded from 
having to make tax payments to subsidiary levels of government, 
namely those of the provinces and the municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been common practice since 1950 for the federal 
government to assist municipalities in covering the cost of 
services provided to the federal government and its creatures 
operating in those places through grants in lieu of taxes or 
payments in lieu of taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill seeks to regularize and modernize the payment of those 
grants.  However, we believe it is filled with loopholes because 
it provides far too much ministerial discretion, as do so many 
other bills we see in this place.  There is far too much 
discretion given to the minister and the executive branch of the 
federal government to choose whether it will make adequate 
payments and grants in lieu of taxes to municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me begin by saying in principle that we in the official 
opposition, the Reform Party, believe strongly that 
municipalities are the first order of government.  We believe 
strongly in the principle of subsidiarity, a principle deeply 
rooted in political theory, which suggests that the order of 
government which is closest to the people ought generally to 
provide the most services; that is to say, proximity to the 
people who are being served is the best criteria for determining 
whether a level of government should provide a service.  We would 
tend to place a preferential option on municipalities.  We think 
they are the most important level of government and that 
generally the role of the federal government should be reduced 
and minimized while the role of municipalities should be 
strengthened and upheld. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is amazing how long it takes for this place and the federal 
government to work.  I understand that this bill originally 
resulted from a panel of the public works department in 1992, 
which was an effort to review payments in lieu of taxes.  Then it 
took until 1995 for the joint technical committee on payments in 
lieu of taxes to do its work.  Here we are in 1999, virtually 
into the next century, before the legislation is actually 
introduced and acted upon.  It has been eight years, with 
different governments and three parliaments, before action was 
taken.  So often important legislation and important changes are 
just left to stew in the back rooms and these reports left to 
gather dust on shelves while we deal with less important 
priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What really concerns me and my colleagues about the bill is the 
extraordinary discretion it gives to the minister of public 
works with respect to payments in lieu of taxes.  The bill does 
not require the federal government to provide payments to 
municipalities in lieu of taxes.  It leaves that up to the 
minister and his discretion.  I refer specifically to the 
proposed subsection 3(1) of the bill, which states that the 
minister may, not must or shall: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—on receipt of an application in a form provided or approved by 
the Minister, make a payment out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund 
to a taxing authority applying for it— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is to say, a municipality: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) in lieu of a real property tax for a taxation year, and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) in lieu of a frontage or area tax 
</I></B></P><P align=left>in respect of federal property situated within the area— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I look at the current act, which this bill seeks to amend, 
the wording in Bill C-10 is essentially the same.  It is almost 
the same.  We will not change the nature of the relationship 
between the federal government and the municipalities in this 
respect.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party includes in its statement of policies and 
principles, its blue book, the statement that we will insist that 
all laws pertaining to individuals and the private sector apply 
equally to the Government of Canada, its personnel, its agencies 
and parliament.  We believe that this should not be a 
discretionary matter left up to the whim and will of the 
minister, but rather we should recognize by act of parliament a 
positive legal obligation of the Government of Canada to pay for 
municipal services which it consumes, that it pay its fair share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only does the bill give enormous ministerial discretion, but 
the bill also fails to include certain agencies and crown 
corporations of the federal government in Schedule IV of the act. 
We will propose at report stage or at committee that the schedule 
be amended so that the Canada Post Corporation, the Royal 
Canadian Mint, the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation all be 
added to Schedule IV so that they, as creatures of the federal 
government, be included in the system of payment in lieu of 
taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It really disturbs me that it is not just in the bill that we 
see the government's tendency to treat itself to a different 
legal standard from the standard we impose and expect from other 
Canadians and other levels of government.  For instance, I have a 
private member's bill on the order paper, which is now No. 29, 
which is an act to amend the Income Tax Act regarding allowances 
paid to elected officials.  It will be of interest to Canadians 
to know that the same parliament which is not going to require 
the federal government to pay its fair share of municipal taxes 
similarly does not require members of parliament to pay their 
full share of federal income taxes.  Believe it or not, by act of 
this place we exempt elected officials, alone among all 
Canadians, from school board trustees to MLAs, MPPs and MNAs, and 
members of parliament are allowed to exclude one-third of their 
real income, the equivalent of one-third of their taxable income, 
from taxes through the so-called non-receiptable expense 
allowances, which is just an effort to legally avoid the same tax 
obligation we impose on the rest of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members of this place take out their pay stubs they will see 
that they are not required to pay the employment insurance 
premiums which we impose on the rest of Canadians, the same 
employment insurance premiums which are operating now at a $20 
billion surplus, which is allowing the finance minister to pad 
his budget and cook the books. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe, as I said before, that all laws pertaining to 
individuals and the private sector should apply equally to the 
Government of Canada, its personnel, its agencies and parliament. 
That means that we must pay our fair share of municipal property 
taxes, and Bill C-10 should be amended accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also means that members of parliament should pay their full 
share of income taxes and that all of our regular income from the 
federal government should be taxable, for full transparency, so 
we do not treat ourselves to a separate legal standard.  It means 
that we should pay the employment insurance premiums that we 
impose by power of the coercive law of this place on the rest of 
Canadians.  In fact, if we look at the members of parliament 
pension plan, there too we have treated ourselves to a different 
legal standard than is generally available to Canadians through 
pension plans registered under the Income Tax Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all of these respects parliament should come back to the 
first principle that we should abide as individuals and as a 
government by the same laws that we impose upon everyone else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, if you are a municipal property taxpayer, a 
corporation, a small business or a resident and you fail to pay 
your full share of property taxes to a municipality, there are 
legal sanctions.  You could have that property taken away from 
you.  If the federal government refuses to do so, if the minister 
fails to use his discretion, there is no sanction which those 
municipalities can impose upon us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call upon parliament to abide by the same law we impose on the 
rest of Canadian society.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to speak to Bill C-10, 
as it universally affects most Canadians, for we have become a 
nation of city dwellers, living within highly organized 
municipalities.  Within these political city or municipal units 
the federal government and its crown corporations have vast 
holdings of land and improvements which are not subject to local 
municipal taxes.  Nevertheless, the federal government began 
making payments in lieu of property taxes in about 1950, 
following years of persistent representations by the Federation 
of Canadian Municipalities.  With 63,000 buildings and parcels of 
land the Government of Canada is the country's largest municipal 
property owner.  The federal government makes payments in lieu of 
taxes to some 2,200 local governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a long history to the rule that a lower order of 
government does not tax the higher one.  Municipalities are the 
creation of the provinces and certainly within their powers they 
have not been given the ability to tax federal lands and 
buildings, such as a local armoury or military base.  This bill 
will amend the Municipal Grants Act, at it is claimed that it 
will improve the fairness, equity and predictability of payments 
made under the act from the federal government to municipal 
governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The enactment establishes an advisory panel to advise the 
minister on disputes concerning payment amounts.  It addresses 
the issues of compensation for untimely payments when the 
bureaucracy cannot get its job done on time, perhaps if there is 
an interpretation dispute or when there is a default on tax 
obligations by tenants of the crown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although its property is exempt from taxation under the 
constitution, the Government of Canada, through this bill, 
accepts the responsibility to pay a portion of the cost of local 
government in communities where it owns property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1950, at the pleading of the Canadian municipalities, the 
government established a program of payments in lieu of taxes. 
Federal agent crown corporations also make payments in lieu of 
taxes and the corporations themselves manage the payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point of tension between municipalities and the federal 
government has been longstanding in this area.  The bill attempts 
to improve the practice of giving money instead of submitting to 
local taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In one section of the bill the minister is given the authority 
to pay interest on payments in lieu of taxes if it is in his 
opinion that a payment in whole or in part has been unreasonably 
delayed.  Through regulatory instruments and amendment to the 
crown corporations grants regulations, crown corporations may now 
make supplementary payments for payments that are unreasonably 
delayed.  Is it not nice of them to be so benevolent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course there is no legal requirement to pay or set penalties 
for not paying on time.  Municipalities have such authority for 
the lowly homeowner, but the federal government would never 
submit itself to the same standards, especially to pay the full 
going rates of everyone else.  There is no change here.  The 
government is able to set its own property values and pay lower 
property taxes than might otherwise be levied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government also leases some of its property to 
non-departmental third parties.  In the past, municipalities have 
experienced some difficulty in collecting property taxes from 
some of these third parties, with payments sometimes never being 
made.  To correct the situation Bill C-10 proposes that if after 
the last day of the taxation year all or part of the taxes remain 
unpaid and if in the opinion of the minister the taxing authority 
has made all reasonable efforts to collect the taxes and there is 
no likelihood that the authority will ever be able to collect, 
then the property will be deemed to be an operational federal 
property and the government will pay the benevolence payments, 
for that is what they still are.  The bill is very clear that 
there is no power to tax and no rights are created.  However, the 
government says through Bill C-10 that it will be benevolent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is good that the bill proposes to include some structures and 
improvements that used to be excluded from payments, such as 
crown corporations.  Schedules III and IV of the Municipal Grants 
Act outline the crown corporations that are eligible to pay 
benevolence payments if they do not pay real property tax or real 
business occupancy tax.  Those contained in Schedule IV are 
corporations involved in profit oriented activities and may 
therefore pay both property and business occupancy related 
assessments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The joint technical committee on payments in lieu of taxes 
recommended that the Canada Post Corporation and the Royal 
Canadian Mint be added to Schedule IV, but surprise, surprise, 
they do not appear in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the private sector disagreements about property values are 
handled through a formal appeal process and the decisions are 
binding on both parties, but in the case of the federal 
government this process is not used.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The value is used to calculate payments or to determine under 
federal authority the one who pays, and not within the 
jurisdiction of provincial and territorial tribunals.  Would 
private companies not love to set their own rules for how much 
they are going to charge themselves for property taxes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1983 to give municipalities a way of redress when they 
disagreed with the amounts of the payments in lieu of taxes, the 
minister established a municipal grants review committee, MGRC. 
This panel provides the minister with advice on the resolution of 
disputes between taxing authorities and the department concerning 
the valuation and classification of federal property.  The 
decisions of the MGRC are given in the form of recommendations 
which the minister is not obliged to accept.  This has given the 
municipalities the impression that the process is, to say the 
least or charitably, biased against them.  It certainly is not a 
full independent delegated authority like a municipal board of 
referees for residential assessments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-10 simply puts into legislation the status quo that was 
implemented in 1983, with the minister hand selecting the 
advisory panel from at least two members from each province and 
territory. The federal minister also appoints the chairperson 
from those members.  Sadly, the recommendations are non-binding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary the bill has some merit but warrants improvements, 
particularly regarding payments by crown corporations with the 
inclusion of the Royal Canadian Mint, Canada Post Corporation and 
Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation in schedule IV to make 
them eligible to pay business occupancy payments in lieu of 
taxes.  Additionally the minister and crown agencies maintain too 
much discretionary power.  Reform has said for years “The Reform 
Party will insist that all laws pertaining to individuals and the 
private sector apply equally to the Government of Canada, its 
personnel, its agencies and parliament”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-10 still provides for ministerial discretion as to 
whether or not payments will be made by the government and there 
is no binding means of recourse in the event of a dispute.  This 
is not the case for the private sector where the payment of 
property and business occupancy taxes are mandatory and the 
decision of appeals are binding on both parties.  The Government 
of Canada and its crown agencies still maintain their privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has been verbose on the accomplishments 
of this bill.  I do not need to repeat them.  On the 
disappointment side, the minister and crown agencies maintain too 
much discretionary power.  Recommendations of the dispute 
advisory panel are non-binding.  It merely maintains the old ways 
of behaviour and entrenches into legislation the common practices 
that were put in place about 16 years ago.  The Royal Canadian 
Mint, Canada Post Corporation and Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation should be added to schedule IV in order that they may 
be eligible to pay business occupancy payments in the 
municipalities where they reside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I give the final word to the Federation of Canadian 
Municipalities.  More often than not, the Reform Party has a 
better idea because we listen and strive to be accountable.  We 
have a clear notion of whom we are working for, unlike the 
Liberals.  The federation said about legislation on federal 
payments that the Bloc, Liberals, NDP and PCs were all on 
probation on this count as their policies did not make the grade. 
Municipalities have maintained that the federal government has an 
obligation to pay its portion of property taxes like everyone 
else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Federation of Canadian Municipalities gives some credit to 
the Liberals for their efforts to negotiate improvements to the 
program, but it still places them on probation for failing to 
make an explicit commitment to respect future provincial taxation 
principles.  However, the Reform Party passes its examination 
with our commitment to legislated accountability and to subject 
the federal government to the same general tax laws as everyone 
else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With Bill C-10, the Liberals again show that they are slow to 
change.  I hope they will permit sufficient amendments at the 
committee stage to fully respond to the Canadian public agenda of 
reforming and renewing the federation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to make a few brief comments before the 
debate on this bill is over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have looked at this bill and have done some studies on my own. 
I asked some questions of the lawyers who do research for us in 
this esteemed place.  I asked them to examine some of the recent 
legislation in the House to find out which of those pieces of 
legislation take powers away from parliament and give them to the 
bureaucracy. 
They had never been asked a question like that. They were 
absolutely astounded when they finished examining the first six 
pieces of legislation and found that in every single instance it 
was taking power away from parliament and giving it to the 
bureaucracy.  This bill is not any different.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the real problems the Reform Party has with what is 
sometimes called a housekeeping bill or legislation that is very 
innocuous is that it maintains or increases the power of the 
bureaucracy.  That is the biggest problem we have with this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One Reform Party policy states very clearly under the topic of 
parliamentary reform that we believe and insist that all laws 
pertaining to individuals and the private sector apply equally to 
the Government of Canada, its personnel, its agencies and 
parliament.  That is one of the things the Reform Party stands 
for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-10 still provides for ministerial discretion as to 
whether the payments in lieu of taxes will be paid by the 
government.  There is still no binding means of recourse in the 
event of a dispute over payment.  The power still lies with the 
federal government.  This is not the case for the private sector 
where the payment of property and business occupancy taxes are 
mandatory and the decisions on appeals are binding on both 
parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada and its crown agencies maintain 
privileged positions.  They are not relinquishing that in any 
way, no matter what the appearances are in this bill.  That is a 
concern to us.  That should be fixed with the proper amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some good things in the bill.  The interest may now be 
paid on late payments.  Payments may be made on federal 
properties leased to third parties, if at the end of the taxation 
year they are still in a state of delinquency.  Some types of 
structures, for example, outdoor swimming pools, golf courses and 
outdoor theatres have been added to the definition of federal 
property.  There is an advisory panel that serves as a committee 
of appeal regarding payment disputes with crown corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there are problems that need to be fixed.  One of the 
things we have a problem with is that the minister and the crown 
agencies still maintain too much discretionary power.  In other 
words, they can still do as they wish.  Why not fix that? People 
should know what the rules are.  Everyone in the country should 
follow them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recommendations of the dispute advisory panel are 
non-binding.  Why not?  It merely maintains the status quo and 
entrenches some common practices into legislation that were put 
in place 16 years ago.  If something is broken and there is an 
opportunity to fix it, why not fix it?  That is what should 
happen in this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my hon. colleague for Kelowna has mentioned, the Royal 
Canadian Mint, Canada Post Corporation and Canadian Mortgage and 
Housing Corporation should be added to schedule IV in order that 
they would be eligible to pay business occupancy payments in lieu 
of taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recommend that these problems with the bill be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to review the purpose of the bill.  The purpose of 
the legislation is to provide for fair and equitable 
administration of payments in lieu of taxes.  It addresses the 
issues of compensation for untimely payments, defaults and tax 
obligations by certain tenants of the crown and the bi-jural 
nature of the Canadian legal system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Additionally, it establishes an advisory panel to advise the 
minister on disputes concerning payment amounts. 
It also amends the title of the act to payments in lieu of taxes 
act.  That is the essential purpose.  Anybody watching this 
should know what is going on here.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will mention one of the things I mentioned previously when I 
rose to ask some questions because it is of great concern to my 
constituents.  When it comes to administration of some of the 
things within government, and it is not strictly tied to this 
bill, the services should be delivered by the agencies closest to 
the people.  They should have more control over the tax burden 
that those people experience. At the present time the federal 
government has a tremendous power to tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the legitimate concerns that my colleagues in the Bloc 
have is that the federal government overrides the jurisdiction of 
the provinces.  I do not sympathize very much with what the Bloc 
members have to say, but in this respect they make a good point 
that we have a federal government that intrudes into many areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, one area I am very familiar with is gun control.  I 
know my reputation precedes me, but I think this is an 
opportunity for me to raise the issue when we are talking about 
municipal and provincial levels of government in relation to the 
federal government.  This is an area where the federal government 
clearly intrudes into areas of provincial jurisdiction and it 
does it in devious ways.  By going through the Criminal Code of 
Canada it can override the jurisdiction of the provinces in 
regard to regulation of property. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-10 is another example of that. We have to put some 
restraint on the bureaucracy in Ottawa so it cannot ride 
roughshod and arbitrarily over the rights of some of the 
municipalities in relation to some of these things. Mr. Speaker, 
I gather by the way you are listening very carefully, that 
probably nobody has made that point in the debate so far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a concern that the federal government collects huge 
amounts of taxes.  It collects them through some of its crown 
agencies, three of which I have previously mentioned.  We have a 
concern that the government is collecting taxes when it should 
not be.  It charges a huge handling fee for this kind of thing. 
The people purportedly to whom the service is given do not reap 
the full benefit they could, judging by the tax burden that they 
are under. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to raise one other issue which does not tie in directly, 
but many farmers in my area are very concerned with the municipal 
property tax and the way it is administered.  Much of this is a 
provincial matter, but it gives me an opportunity to say that 
there is an unfair tax put on farmers.  It is the education tax 
that is tied in with the property taxes.  Perhaps that is 
something we should urge the federal government to speak up on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to have had the opportunity to make a few comments 
in regard to this bill.  While I would like to share my time with 
my colleague from Wild Rose, I understand I cannot do that.  I 
will therefore end my speech and hopefully there will be some 
time for him to make a few remarks as well.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have 
grave concerns about Bill C-10 and I will explain why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having been the mayor of Saint John for four terms, I always 
stated and still do that the local government was the government 
of the people.  The grassroots people are there. Always, as far 
as I am concerned, the federal government should pay its taxes as 
well as all of the others in the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at what we have in our port.  The federal government cut 
back on its taxes and it was going to give us a grant in lieu of 
them.  The grant was going down, not going up. Taxes were going 
up for everyone else but the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Federation of Canadian Municipalities, of which I sat on the 
board of directors, was very upset with the bill.  It was upset 
at the speed at which the bill was being rammed through the 
House.  It was not given any advance notice that the bill would 
be introduced.

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Federation of Canadian Municipalities represents all 
municipalities across the country.  It is the one that does the 
research to see what should be the priorities, where we should be 
going, whether it is the provincial government or the federal 
government, and in which direction.  It has not been adequately 
briefed on the bill and it was not sent a copy of the bill or the 
background briefing materials.  It has also not had time to 
consult with its members across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot believe that we have really done this.  The local 
governments and all the municipal governments represent all their 
people at the grassroots.  They should have input and they should 
have had input into this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look at the proposed new intent clause, clause 4 of the 
bill, I say to myself that this is a meaningless piece of 
propaganda and adds nothing of value to the bill.  We have two 
major difficulties with clause 14 of the bill, the proposed new 
dispute advisory panel, its composition and fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is great that we are talking about setting up a new 
panel of a minimum of two members from each province and 
territory.  However, it should be the Federation of Canadian 
Municipalities that decide on who the members will be because it 
does not play politics.  It keeps politics out of it. The 
president of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities should 
come in and give the minister two names from each province and 
the territories.  Not one of those people would want $125 an 
hour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>An hon. member:</B>  A day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  A day?  This one says an hour. I do not 
care if it is a day or what it is, not one of them would ask for 
that.  I cannot believe we are doing this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the federation of municipalities wanting to deal and 
co-operate with the federal government, more than likely its 
members would ask only for their expenses to be paid.  They 
probably would ask for no remuneration whatsoever.  But no 
dialogue took place with them on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill requires members to have relevant knowledge or 
experience but it does not define that term.  If we want relevant 
knowledge or experience at the local level, all we have to do is 
take some mayors and councillors—and it does not matter if they 
vote Liberal or not—and put them on that committee.  Perhaps it 
might be better if they did not vote Liberal.  We might then be 
able to have someone with an open mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Presumably relevant knowledge or experience could mean any 
person who is a member in good standing of the Liberal Party, 
which concerns me a little bit.  It would be much better, as I 
have stated, if the members were required to be a certified 
member of a professional organization as well.  There are a lot 
of them who are members of the Federation of Canadian 
Municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would not mind if the bill would allow public servants, 
including municipal employees, to serve on the panel, but I do 
not want them to be in a conflict because they are hired by the 
mayors and councillors.  If they come back with a recommendation 
that is in conflict with what the mayors and councillors of the 
municipalities where they work are feeling on certain issues, 
then it would make it most difficult for them. I must say that at 
the local level we do have some very qualified people whose input 
could be used.  When I look at the panel that is one of the major 
concerns I have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two major concerns.  I feel very strongly that the 
federal government should be paying taxes just the same as the 
private sector and everyone else.  It should pay its taxes just 
the same as my family pays their taxes.  Why should it be any 
different?  It is the same as the provincial governments paying 
their taxes.  If we were able to make everyone feel equal and 
feel that no one was getting any special treatment, the local 
people would have a better feeling about this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The panel is supposed to be appointed by the minister.  The 
panel will be paid by the government.  The panel reports only to 
the minister and its decisions are not public.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot believe we are bringing in a bill like this. If the 
bill does come in then the recommendations should certainly be 
made public.  The next thing we know secret letters will go out 
to everybody else and somebody will get a copy that was not 
supposed to be made public.  If we make it public it will not 
look like we are hiding anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it says that the panel serves at the pleasure of the 
minister, which means the minister can say “I do not like what 
you have brought in so I am going to remove you and put somebody 
else in there”, that worries me as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very much in favour of some parts of the bill, but there 
are concerns, and I feel very strongly that those concerns should 
be addressed.  There is no question that there should be changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also talk about grants in lieu of taxes.  These are difficult 
times on the Hill because once again the government has seen fit 
to spend the money, perhaps in an irresponsible way, but the next 
thing we know the grants could be eliminated in lieu of taxes and 
nothing would be there for the municipalities.  What would happen 
then?  The local governments would have to raise their taxes to 
make up for what the federal government would not be giving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a major concern with the federal government telling me 
and all Canadians that it will give us grants in lieu of taxes. 
This tells me that it does not want to pay the full tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concerns that I have are concerns that my party has.  We 
would like to see a legislative review.  If that panel is put in 
place by the minister and he makes these appointments from all 
across Canada, we want to see a legislative review of the panel 
after five years to see if it is working well and to allow the 
House to make any changes that are necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about setting up and paying someone $125 a day plus 
expenses to sit on a committee, this is when people in Canada get 
very discouraged, they truly do.  When we are at the local level, 
we get very discouraged with that.  That is not necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I stated earlier in my remarks, this should go to the 
Federation of Canadian Municipalities.  This should all be tabled 
until the Federation of Canadian Municipalities has been able to 
sit down, discuss this and have its total input into the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this is probably the only government that has been in 
power that has never sat down with the president and the board of 
directors of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities when 
dealing with issues like this.  I cannot believe that the 
Liberals talk about grants in lieu of taxes when they have not 
even had the input from those at the local level whom it will 
affect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the bill goes, I feel very strongly that it should be 
tabled until that input is there and until we hear back from the 
Federation of Canadian Municipalities as to whether or not it is 
in support of it or whether or not it feels there should be 
changes.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to this piece of legislation today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank my hon. colleague from the Conservative Party for 
reminding me about the problems that we used to have as mayors at 
the municipal level, local level and grassroots level, the 
problems that we had for a number of years.  I can certainly 
share those beliefs and those words with my colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that it has been happening for a number of years, 
including when federal governments were operated by both Liberals 
and Conservatives.  Those are the parties that have been 
operating the government over the last number of years, and 
nothing has really changed in that respect.  It certainly is time 
for some changes and there are some fairly decent changes that 
are brought about in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really have a difficult time understanding why this particular 
government has a problem with trying to implement something 
equally across the system. 
Equality seems to be a word that is truly absent from its 
vocabulary.

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my understanding that the Federation of Canadian 
Municipalities has not had one speck of input into what is going 
to happen to their jurisdictions as a result of the bill.  A 
number of mayors and councillors are wondering what this is all 
about.  Suddenly the bill is here zinging through the House of 
Commons and will become law before they even know how it will 
affect them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is another process that needs change.  This is a process 
that constantly seems to prevail in this place where we know best 
and why should we bother conferring with other levels of 
government that will be affected by these pieces of legislation. 
I find that thoroughly disgusting and yet I am not surprised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having been in the House for six years, I have seen the amount 
of power that is handed over to the bureaucracies, as it will be 
done in this case. I have seen a number of bills that include the 
words “by order in council”, “given ministerial discretion” 
and “full power” over many issues.  Once upon a time, the idea 
of “by order in council” was for emergency situations, but it 
now appears in all legislation so many times that it is really 
scary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I am not mistaken, in Bill C-68, which we recently debated, 
the words “order in council” were used 74 times in that one 
piece of legislation alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The municipalities have to sit back and wait to see what the 
great central government in Ottawa will come out with and how it 
will affect the things they have to deal with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was the mayor of my home town, I recall a couple of 
property owners wanting to subdivide their land and build a house 
and a quonset.  They brought all the information to the local 
council.  I, as mayor, and six councillors looked at the 
proposal.  We studied it carefully, discussed it with other 
residents of the community and decided that it was a good deal 
and should work without any difficulties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, lo and behold, there was another level of government, 
the provincial government, which had not even seen the situation, 
was not aware of the situation had not discussed it with anybody, 
had only looked at a little drawing of what we were talking about 
when we had to get some authority to go ahead with this, and it 
flatly denied the proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was then that I had the opportunity to bring these people 
into town through a challenge that I would pick them up and bring 
them in.  I told them that they had no business making decisions 
without at least looking at the situation.  Once they got out 
there and had a word with the people, and once they saw with 
their own eyes what they were talking about, they were able to 
make some changes and allow it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem we have in this place on a higher level, when these 
kinds of things come down, is making sure the power remains in 
the hands of the minister, the ministerial discretion, the 
federal government almighty power, and making sure the 
bureaucracy is loaded up with power galore.  So we operate in a 
very difficult situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to ask myself “What's new”?  The democratic process in 
the country does not exist in this place.  We just voted on a 
motion asking for a referendum on the Nisga'a agreement.  The 
mighty upholders of democracy, the believers in letting the 
people have a say, could not even support letting the people of 
British Columbia have a voice.  Worse yet, aboriginal people 
living in British Columbia have been phoning my office day in and 
day out asking me to encourage the government to let them have a 
voice because there is no accountability on many of the reserves. 
These people are suffering and hurting.  Yet, things are rammed 
through without any regard for the people themselves, without any 
thought about the effects it will have.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of a situation will we be in with the Nisga'a 
agreement when they become a municipality or self-governing? Will 
the rules apply in their situation in the same way as they do in 
small towns in Alberta or large cities in Ontario?  Will there be 
equality?  It is very difficult to say, but it is obvious to me 
that past history says that people should beware, wherever they 
live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government does not truly believe in a democratic process. 
Its members emerge for a vote in this place from behind closed 
doors after a private discussion among members of their party. 
Then they vote according to what the leader of their party 
happens to say.  Their leader happens to be the Prime Minister of 
Canada and the puppets will obey the rule.  They will vote 
according to what he says, and never mind what they are told in 
their constituencies or what people at the grassroots level have 
to say.  They do not dare to cast a vote which does not express 
the view of the Prime Minister if they want to be part of the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is democracy we truly need some serious changes.  I 
would like to see democracy reflected in bills such as Bill C-10 
but it is not reflected.  I would like to see it reflected in the 
agreements we make with our native people, the treaty agreements 
that have been made and the ones that will come up.  Where is the 
voice of the people in all these things?  Where does the power 
ultimately lie?  The power of any real democracy should lie in 
the hands of the people.  It is difficult to say that it is 
happening in Canada.  There are too many examples that tell me it 
is not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a bill before us today that gives ministerial 
discretion, a great power, to the federal government and to a 
huge bureaucracy.  A panel is to be set up.  We do not know for 
sure how the panel to observe all this will be set up, but we can 
almost bet it will be full of patronage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Good old friends of the Liberal Party will make sure to fill 
those high places.  They will serve on the panels because their 
view is that those of us who are not Liberal, who do not vote 
Liberal, are not smart enough to know what we are doing.  We 
cannot let that happen, not in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their attitude with regard to all kinds of legislation going 
through here is sad.  We are at second reading stage of this bill 
and the fact that municipalities throughout Canada and the 
Federation of Canadian Municipalities have not even had an 
opportunity for input is a real shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say shame on the federal Government of Canada, the leaders of 
this great nation, that it continues to bring forward legislation 
in this place and does not allow the real leaders of the land, 
the people, to have a true voice.  That has to change, and may 
God grant it soon.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADIAN INSTITUTES OF HEALTH RESEARCH ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK68">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from November 23 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-13, an act to establish the Canadian Institutes of 
Health Research, to repeal the Medical Research Council Act and 
to make consequential amendments to other acts, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise to speak to this bill today.  I 
want to say at the outset that the bill to establish the Canadian 
Institutes of Health Research Act, introduced by the Minister of 
Health, is very positive.  I will be supporting it and I believe 
my colleagues will be as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should clarify that.  I understand that their initial reaction 
is that they believe it is a very positive bill.  They will 
support it until committee stage when they will have had an 
opportunity to listen to the research experts. They believe that 
the intention of the bill is in the right framework, but 
obviously they want to hear from the experts at committee stage. 
However, it is my understanding that we are supporting the bill 
at this stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a couple of points in the bill that I think are 
laudable.  The bill will repeal the Medical Research Council Act, 
will bring forth more accountability for all budgetary 
expenditures and will be a vast improvement over the current 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the Minister of Health when he introduced the 
bill.  He talked about the brain drain and how the bill was an 
attempt to help the brain drain situation by bringing in more 
research dollars and by making sure most importantly that 
somewhere in the magnitude of 95% of the moneys would actually be 
used for research.  I believe the goal is that between 4% and 5% 
will be used for administrative costs. 
That is a very positive aspect.  It is so important for that the 
money issued for research actually gets down to the end user, the 
real benefit of which is to Canadian people in the areas of 
health research.

drain.  As the Minister of Health stated in his opening comments, 
he is very pleased with the Canadian institutes of health 
research act, Bill C-13, because it will help alleviate some of 
the brain drain issues by putting more moneys into research for 
our universities in the areas of health and will attract people 
from our universities to stay here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hopefully this is the first of many steps to come.  Without 
question the brain drain is the emerging crisis in the country. I 
listen to the constituents who come into my office on a regular 
basis to tell me stories about how their children have graduated 
from university and moved down to the U.S.  There is no doubt in 
my mind that the biggest problem is that they are the very best, 
the brightest, the entrepreneurs of tomorrow, the future CEOs, 
the people who would be the economic engine of our country 15 or 
20 years from now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was with the finance committee in Halifax a few weeks ago. One 
witness, I believe he was from Ryerson, stated that the top 10 
graduates of 30 in one IT program had all gone down to the 
States.  We hear this over and over again.  We heard it again 
this morning in the finance committee.  It is a huge problem.  It 
is even exponentially more severe because of the numbers.  It is 
the best, the cream of the crop, that are going south, those who 
would be crucial to driving the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-13 to establish the Canadian institutes of health 
research will at least be a very minimal step, the first step to 
possibly provide an opportunity for some of our top researchers 
to stay in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The brain drain is a huge issue with respect to taxation.  We 
hear that over and over again.  The government talked about a $95 
billion cumulative surplus.  I would argue that if we want to see 
more programs such as this one, if we want the research dollars 
and if we truly want to attract the very best, we have to cut 
taxes.  If we want the best researchers not only from Canada but 
from around the globe, the bill alone will not do it.  We have to 
cut taxes.  We are one of the highest taxed of the G-7 countries. 
Study after study and witness after witness came forward with 
that thought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go to the second issue the bill touches upon.  When I 
looked at the bill and saw what the government was trying to do, 
I was very pleased that it was trying to keep the administrative 
costs of the new health research system at 4% to 5%.  It will be 
accountable for how health research dollars are spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings us to the Canada Health Act.  They are directly tied 
together.  There we have a huge problem.  There are over 200,000 
Canadians on waiting lists, some of whom are waiting for very 
serious operations.  Some are matters of life and death for many 
people.  Some of these 200,000 people will not live to see the 
operating rooms, the doctors or the procedures they need. Because 
of our health care system they will not make it.  That is very 
tragic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen $21 billion cut from the health care and social 
transfer payments to the provinces since 1993.  When $21 billion 
are taken out of the pie it has an incredible impact on the 
services that can be delivered.  It is no wonder that some of the 
200,000 Canadians on waiting lists will die.  There is absolutely 
no mistake; that is an irrefutable fact which is very sad.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is the link to this bill.  The positive part of this bill 
is that the government has focused on putting 4% to 5% on 
administrative costs.  Unfortunately, that $21 billion cut by the 
federal government from our health care system and social 
transfers has affected the end users, the patients, those 
Canadians who are on waiting lists for very serious medical 
procedures.  Many families have a family member waiting for 
cancer treatment.  We hear stories of people with lumps who are 
waiting for biopsies.  The list goes on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two things we need to look at.  It was the government 
that agreed with the 50:50 split in the payment of our national 
health care system.  Now it is contributing somewhere in the 
range of 10%.  No wonder the system is crumbling before our eyes. 
The system needs to be overhauled.  There are a few areas where 
that has to happen.  Cash is not the only thing that is going to 
do it.  We saw $21 billion taken out of the pie. When that much 
money is taken out it has a huge and devastating impact on what 
happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is crucial that there is accountability to ensure that the 
dollars are reaching the patient.  What happens when that much 
money is taken out?  I would argue that the administration stays 
the same, and in many cases it might have grown.  It is the 
patients who are affected.  The money is taken away from the line 
users, Canadians.  It is so critical that we make the system the 
most efficient it can be, that we maximize the money being put 
in, that we make sure it gets to the patient and that it does not 
get swallowed up by the bureaucracy or the administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Years ago when I was in law school, I looked at the new health 
care facility that was connected to the Vancouver General 
Hospital, which is a very old and incredible hospital.  It was a 
brand new pavilion, a great big concrete tower, about 15 to 20 
storeys high and very impressive from the outside.  It can be 
seen when driving down Oak Street in Vancouver.  This pavilion 
has been there for years.  It is hollow on the inside because of 
a lack of planning, accountability and making efficient use of 
our dollars.  It is not being used.  That is frustrating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to give credit where credit is due. This bill is 
a very good first step with respect to health research.  The 
government is focusing on the accountability portion and on 
having the administrative portion around 4% to 5%. That is a very 
good first step.  I look forward to seeing what the research 
community has to say.  When the bill comes before the committee 
for clause by clause review we will get its valuable input. 
Hopefully we will bring forward amendments at that time that will 
even strengthen this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to say that we will be supporting the bill but we 
cannot get stuck in a vacuum.  We cannot forget to look at the 
real picture.  We cannot forget that the Canada Health Act is 
failing the people of Canada.  It is crumbling around them. There 
are 200,000 people on waiting lists and some of them will die 
because the Canada Health Act is failing them.  It needs to be 
overhauled.  There needs to be accountability.  Most important, 
the dollars we invest in health must get to the patient.  That is 
what has to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other issue which is directly tied to health research is the 
brain drain. 
I listened to the Minister of Health talk about this bill.  He 
was pleased that it would help alleviate the brain drain problem 
and that some of our top research people will want to stay in 
Canada because of the new accountability and that 95% of the 
funds will be going directly to the research programs.  That is 
wonderful.  I support that whole theory but if he is not going to 
look at other problems of why people are going south to the 
United States in droves, if he is not going to look at the 
taxation system, this bill will not do it alone.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the witnesses in the finance committee this morning only 
three hours ago said that we are talking about a $95 billion 
“surplus”.  I have always argued that there is no real surplus. 
It is not the government's money that it has taken out of the 
back pockets of Canadians.  Canadians want it back. Until we give 
them that money back, that taxation surplus that is rightfully 
theirs, we will not be able to attract the top researchers the 
government wants to attract to the new Canadian institutes of 
health research.  It will not bring those people here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The highest levels of brain drain are not only in technologies 
but also in our health care and engineering sectors.  The very 
best, the very brightest, the cream of the crop, the leaders of 
tomorrow are leaving not only because of the taxation levels. 
They are leaving for a whole host of reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States spends more on a percentage basis of GDP per 
capita on the health care system than Canada spends.  That is a 
factual number. Sometimes we are very quick to criticize our 
neighbours to the south.  We should make no mistake that they 
actually spend much more than we do in Canada.  That is why 
people are going there.  Their taxes are lower. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will finish up by summarizing my two key points. This bill is 
a great start but it is only the very first step.  If we really 
want to move forward, stop the brain drain and keep our best 
researchers here in Canada, if we want to attract people, we had 
better look at our taxation system.  Until we do, there is not a 
hope or a prayer for us.  People will continue to go south and 
the problem will grow exponentially. The unfortunate part is we 
will not see the impact of this for five, ten or fifteen years. 
That is when these top people will have reached their peaks in 
their careers.  They will be the leaders of tomorrow. Right now 
they are going south. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just the people that are going south.  Another witness 
made this excellent point in committee.  It is not just our top 
people that are going south; their positions are going with them 
and they are not coming back.  Those positions are going south to 
the U.S. as well and they are not coming back to Canada.  It is 
very important that we do not lose focus on that and that we deal 
with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most important, all of this will be meaningless.  It will have 
no impact.  We can have the best research in the whole world and 
we can cut our taxes so that our researchers stay here.  However, 
we must look at the Canada Health Act, bring in accountability, 
put the money back in so that those 200,000 people will not die 
on waiting lists.  All of this will be meaningless if we do not 
bring back accountability, if we do not put back the $21 billion 
that has been taken out of our health care system.  If we do not 
put that back in all of this will be meaningless and more 
Canadians will continue to die on waiting lists.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to this bill today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk about two particular instances which have 
affected me regarding Bill C-13, health care and health care 
research. I am much in favour of this bill, however, I have two 
concerns. They are the research and support for the drug issue in 
the country.  I also want to talk about something that strikes 
very close to home with me, Lou Gehrig's disease. A friend of 
mine has been personally affected by this disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to read a letter to the House that Ron Martens' 
wife Carole has sent to appeal to the Minister of Health. After I 
speak about this, I am going to hand the Minister of Health a 
video from Ron Martens, a victim of Lou Gehrig's disease, in the 
hope that Ron can get both an audience with the health minister 
and action regarding not just funding research but funding for 
this particular disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I went to the minister's office about four months ago to get 
some assistance for research into studies regarding assistance in 
the rehabilitation of teenage female drug addicts. I got a warm 
reception in the minister's offices at Tunney's Pasture by the 
minister's executive assistant.  I recall saying, “Now, you are 
not just going to give me some lip service here, you are really 
going to try to help out a particular organization that is trying 
to rehabilitate these young drug addicts”.  “Oh, yes, yes”, 
was the answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was put in contact with a lady in Vancouver who was 
temporarily in charge of this.  I called her a number of times. 
When I finally got through to her, I did get the impression that 
I was being a bit of a pain by even calling. Notwithstanding 
that, I did manage to get her to meet with the organization and 
since then I have heard nothing about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I talk about health care research in this country and about 
bills like Bill C-13, I wonder once again, and I keep bringing 
this up in the House of Commons, will this truly be a bill that 
puts something worthwhile into effect? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spend a lot of time trying to assist those who are addicted to 
drugs, and trying to change things for the better for them. It 
seems that every time I go to the Minister of Health's office, I 
either get lip service or really nothing much at all in terms of 
assistance.  If we pass Bill C-13, what really will be done? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did receive some very good letters, which I respect, from the 
University of British Columbia and other universities saying to 
pass this bill because they need the funds for research.  While I 
agree we should have more money for research, I am not certain in 
my heart that the philosophy or the grit to really effect change 
in health care is with the Minister of Health.  He has not shown 
me this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask him here today if he would at least look at the one 
situation that I have been involved with regarding drugs and the 
rehabilitation of teenage female drug addicts.  Could he not find 
it within the billions and billions of dollars that are spent to 
try to put research dollars into that aspect?

</I></B></P><P align=left>Periodically announcements are made in the House that some money 
will be thrown at the drug problem or at this centre, or they are 
to put it in Toronto where they have lots of seats and that sort 
of thing.  Funding drug rehabilitation and trying to help drug 
addicts has nothing to do with partisan politics.  It has nothing 
to do with what area one is from.  It has a lot to do with doing 
the best we can for young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will vote for the bill, but I am here on behalf of many people 
across the country to ask that the minister take seriously the 
issues of concern with regard to young people on drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, I want to read into the record for the minister 
and for all Canadians listening a letter from Carole Martens.  I 
know Carole and I know Ron, her husband.  I know what a good 
person Ron is.  I understand the difficulties he is going 
through.  I try to understand what Carol and their children are 
trying to live with and what the people in my community are 
trying to live with.  However I do not think the Minister of 
Health or the government understands the dilemma individuals with 
this disease face.  If they did, more money would be put toward 
trying to assist those with the disease.  I will read from the 
letter, which is dated November 17:

</I></B></P><P align=left>Thank you so much for giving 11 minutes of your precious time 
today.  I'm sure every day there are many valid needs that cross 
your desk.  This past year in May 1999 Ron Martens, my husband, 
and I flew to Ottawa in hope to meet you.  As it was, you were 
not in that day, and we had a very special visit with your 
secretary. You may remember the note I left for you.  You may 
also remember Randy White's letter on July 7, 1998, requesting a 
meeting with you and Ron to discuss ALS, Lou Gehrig's Disease, 
and the tremendous need for research funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The clock of life is ticking quickly, and as Ron's wife of 30

to the cause and cure for ALS? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If you were my husband, I would travel, call, phone or write to 
the men of importance in government, knowing that if we don't 
speak up strongly, this thing will never be beaten.

years, franchising 35 stores.  He is a father, a son, a brother, 
an uncle, a husband, a grandfather, a colleague and a friend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My greatest gift to Ron, as his wife, is my time.  My love for 
him drives me to help him reach his newfound goal, and that is to 
see millions given to ALS research.  This would give every ALS 
patient, caregiver and family, hope, which is so vital in 
pressing on through this cruel and devastating disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year, we both wept as we heard on the evening news, you 
awarded $42 million additional dollars to AIDS research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I'm so happy for them, but what about ALS?  It is no longer an 
old person's disease.  My husband was 47 years when diagnosed. 
This past weekend we had attended an “ALS international 
symposium” in Vancouver, where 500 scientists meet to 
communicate and pool ideas and findings, all for the great cause 
of ALS.  I met at least 25 patients, all of them under 52 years 
of age.

heart.  “Some days the stresses of life are so overwhelming that 
my heart can no longer hear a song and then I stop; knowing that 
if I cannot hear a song, I also cannot sing a song.  Without a 
song there is no hope.  Please, please give ALS a song, a song of 
hope”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is but one case.  Carole and Ron are both trying to do what 
they can while there is time to convince people responsible for 
trying to help others to help research and fund the cure for ALS. 
I agree that there are many diseases out there that need funding, 
but it seems to me sometimes that we in Canada listen to the loud 
voice, the squeaky wheel, for instance AIDS.  While I support 
much research for AIDS, I wonder why this is.  I suppose those 
with ALS maybe do not speak loud enough.  Maybe they do not cry 
out long enough.  Maybe they do not have rallies like those who 
support the fight against AIDS.  Nevertheless that does not 
preclude them from getting the same genuine support from a 
government that has the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could spend time, perhaps be critical and show people across 
the country where the government fritters away millions upon 
millions upon millions of dollars.  I have a long list here on my 
desk of projects on which it just escapes me why taxpayer dollars 
are even spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are spending over $800,000 on fireworks for the millennium. 
Yet if we talk about $800,000 to ALS victims and researchers, we 
shake our heads at it.  I cannot help but try to put this in 
perspective and wonder why that is.  Why is it that we always 
seem to be spending our money on things that are not quite as 
devastating but have a higher profile, perhaps are more visible 
and make people feel good?  We walk away with a good feeling, but 
the end result is that problems like ALS are really left to 
themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that UBC, a great university where one of my children 
went, will do much with research as a result of Bill C-13 on many 
things, but I still say we are overlooking some of the obvious 
things that happen.  It is just because people inflicted with 
such diseases as ALS tend not to be those who are outspoken, 
creating protests, being visible and that sort of thing.  They 
tend not to be like that because they are basically tied up in 
their own problems and trying to get them resolved.

</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things the government is responsible for is genuine 
programs for all people, not just for those who holler loudest or 
holler longest, not just for those areas that vote Liberal, not 
just for those areas where there is a potential vote, not just on 
the issues where they think they can win the next election but 
sometimes on those hidden votes.  Those are the votes of people 
who may never elect politicians, but deep down their votes are 
for trying to keep people alive and keep people going for just a 
bit more time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask in the House today that the minister take the video I have 
and spend 11 minutes of his time looking at the contents to try 
to understand the plight of some people, without fanfare, without 
a grandstand or a soap box upon which to stand. He should take 
time in his office, put on this video and think about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No greater deed can be done by people in power and politics 
today with billions and billions of dollars at their disposal 
than that which can help people who do not have a large voice in 
society.  If that is what Liberalism is about or Reform or any 
other politics, that is what must be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have tried to give the minister two issues that perhaps will 
not be talked about in the House.  In fact, I doubt very much 
whether drugs and ALS will even be discussed throughout this 
whole debate.  They are two issues that I hold dearly, and I say 
that if we cannot help young people who are addicted, young 
people who do not want to be addicted; if we cannot help with 
those problems and consider them health problems, and if we 
cannot do more in research for them, we should not be here in the 
House of Commons.  If we cannot help those with ALS who cry out 
quietly, we should not be here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask finally one other thing.  When agencies and organizations 
are set up in terms of health care and drugs across the country 
to help our citizens, we should always be looking at the best 
qualified people, those people with the skills, abilities, 
qualifications and past performance to head those efforts.  We 
should not be in any circumstances putting our friends, those who 
work for us politically, into those positions.  I do not believe 
it serves the client who is the drug addict, who is the ALS 
victim, who is a parent waiting for some assistance.  I do not 
think it helps those clients whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having looked at a lot of the appointments lately from the 
government, it seems that what pervades our system in Canadian 
society today are government appointments.  I know in some of 
those cases that the people who are appointed to positions are 
not the best qualified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I only ask these three things:  (a) let us do a lot more for 
young people who are becoming addicted and who are addicted; (b) 
let us do something constructive, for a change, to try to do more 
for ALS victims and try to help people like Ron Martens; and (c) 
let us make sure that we appoint those in positions of 
responsibility on the basis of skills, ability and qualifications 
with regard to health care.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to give me his version of the facts. 
Does he not think, as I do, that Bill C-13 interferes in 
provincial jurisdiction? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
the question.  I agree with one thing.  I believe that today drug 
addiction is a health problem and not a criminal problem. 
Individual addicts in this country, in this day, are driven to 
becoming criminals because of being addicted.  I could cite case 
after case that I have been involved with which would prove that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that Bill C-13 is part of the answer for research and 
that is why I support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question of whether Bill C-13 is a provincial responsibility 
or a federal responsibility is an interesting one.  I think the 
federal government has a responsibility to participate in 
research.  If it does, and if it helps addicted people, if it 
helps people with Lou Gehrig's disease, I for one will not be 
involved in any discussion as to whether this is a provincial or 
a federal issue.  I for one will be saying to the government 
“Let's just get the job done and stop squabbling about who has 
ownership”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of British Columbia, there are very few people who 
do not know that I have no use whatsoever for the provincial 
government of British Columbia, the NDP.  It has taken our 
province into the lower depths of the economy and everything 
else.  However, when it comes down to a sloppy government like 
that trying to help with health care, I support it if it helps 
people with various diseases like ALS or even drug addiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am no friend of these guys across the way here either, the 
Liberals, but when it comes to the federal government trying to 
help or the federal government properly putting funds into 
research, I have no problem whatsoever with it and I would not 
take sides.  The only side I will take is that of the victim or 
someone waiting for us as politicians to get off the fight of 
provincial and federal and get on to the fight of trying to help 
others.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay—Boundary—Okanagan, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I thought the member made an excellent speech, in 
particular when he spoke about these things touching someone 
close.  We tend to make statistics out of people.  It is nice to 
get in touch directly with the plight of an individual person. 
It sometimes helps to put things in a better perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One area of concern that I have with Bill C-13 is that it sets 
up yet another bureaucracy. 
The intent of the bill is that it will keep the administrative 
costs to 4% to 5% of the total budget.  Reality says that is not 
what turns out.  Once we start creating a bureaucracy, more and 
more of the money intended to help people ends up going to drive 
this great bureaucracy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if my colleague could touch on that and advise as to 
whether he has any concerns about the way government structures 
these types of things and how it uses money which should be going 
to help people, such as those he described. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
the question.  He is right.  Four per cent to five per cent of 
the budget will be for administration.  I do not think we have 
ever seen in this country a provincial or a federal government, 
no matter what party runs it, that has not been totally enamoured 
with the idea that there should be more bureaucrats than actual 
operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In most of the organizations I have been responsible for, the 
administrative costs have usually been around 3%.  I think that 
4% to 5% is high.  If 4% to 5% of the total budget is used and 
the total budget keeps expanding, I have a problem with that. 
Five per cent of the original amount of $374 million is a lot of 
money.  But if we put more money into research it is not 
necessarily appropriate to have 5% of $500 million or 5% of $800 
million.  We are adding to a major bureaucracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the difficulties Ron Martens has as an ALS afflicted 
individual.  For Ron Martens and many of the other ALS people, 
and for all the young people addicted to drugs, we have to get 
off the petty politics, we have to get off trying to build a 
bureaucracy and trying to appoint our friends and we have to get 
on with doing more research.  We must find solutions to these 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the Minister of Health is listening to me.  This is what 
we expect.  We do not have any authority to follow up on 
bureaucracy in this country.  It seems to survive by itself. 
However, I hope for once we do the right thing and put the vast 
bulk of money into research and helping others.

have been much quicker to introduce a bill such as this, because 
Canada has now acquired an international reputation for trailing 
behind in research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member agree with me that the government was slow to

listened with great interest to what my colleague had to say.  It 
seems to me that the Canadian institutes of health research 
represent not only a very, very large injection of new money into 
health research, and I agree with my colleague that it is needed, 
but it is a totally new way of looking at research across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member just mentioned cancer.  We have the Peterborough

in his riding.  I was the chair of our cancer campaign.  Can the

approves, will bring a group like the Peterborough Cancer Society 
into the research network of Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not sure just how it 
would, but what I am sure of is that it would go some way toward 
the co-ordination of the effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has to understand what we are saying about 
administration.  We have to establish a program, standards and 
ways in which co-ordination can take place, and we have to ensure 
that the money for research stays in the programs and develops. 
What we do not want is a bureaucracy that makes this whole 
process overburdened and awkward.  It is hard enough these days 
to have research undertaken on anything.  I think what we are 
looking for is simplicity, not complexity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as co-ordination, it is not just the Canadian Cancer 
Society.  I spent 15 minutes talking about ALS.  There are too

calls clients.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with 
great interest that I rise to speak to Bill C-13, an act to 
establish the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, to repeal 
the Medical Research Council Act and to make consequential 
amendments to other acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following on the speech by my colleague from 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, our party's health critic—and I will take 
this opportunity to congratulate him on the excellent job he is 
doing—I would first of all like to revisit what he asked our 
Reform colleague just now. He asked him whether he admitted that 
this bill ought to have been introduced long ago and that there 
ought to have been more investment in medical research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an area of the utmost importance. I now understand, 
seeing the government members' lack of interest in commenting on 
it, why the Canadian government has not rushed to invest more in 
medical research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speeches and debate coming from the government side have been 
lacklustre debate. A few government members spoke for form's 
sake. 
The ones doing the work are the opposition members.  Is this due 
to lack of interest, lack of courage or a bit of cowardice?  One 
might well ask. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give a little scenario in connection with the 
bill.  Last February, the present Minister of Health announced 
that he would be injecting new money into the creation of what 
may be termed virtual institutes of research.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be understood that no infrastructures will be created. 
There will be a kind of networking, as is already being done in 
certain sectors in each of the provinces.  For the medical 
research laboratories, there will be an attempt to create a 
network so that these people can speak to each other and 
co-ordinate their research, in order to enhance its 
effectiveness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main thrust of the bill we are looking at today is the 
outcome of recommendations made by an interim committee, 
comprising 34 members of the scientific and academic community. 
Hon. members who heard the speech by my colleague from 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve a few days back will recall that he listed 
the scientists and academics on that committee. 
These people have great reputations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To simplify things, the Canadian institutes of health research 
will replace what used to be called the Medical Research 
Council.  These institutes will have a broad research mandate. 
They will develop new approaches to research in biomedical 
matters and on issues more directly affecting the social 
sciences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his budget, the Minister of Finance announced that the 
government intended to double funding over three years for the 
health research institutes.  Funding will amount to $500 million 
in 2001-02.  That is not insignificant, and we applaud this 
budget increase.  The research laboratories needed it.  The 
institutes' permanent governing council is expected to be 
operational by April 1, 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we understand from this networking is that the institutes 
will deal with four major sectors of health research.  They will 
focus their work on various types of research in four sectors 
specifically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first sector is the very important and vital field of 
biomedical research.  At least 60% of the biomedical research in 
Canada is done by pharmaceutical companies in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second sector is clinical research.  It too is very 
important.  It also plays a basic role in the discovery of 
pharmaceuticals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third sector is that of health systems.  Currently, all 
provincial governments are dealing with health care reforms. 
They have had to move toward ambulatory care. 
They are trying to see if their system is well organized to make 
it as effective and efficient as possible, and thus provide the 
public with the quality of care and services it deserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth sector covers cultural society and population health. 
Research institutes will bring about a strategic repositioning 
in health research to solve major medical issues. Moreover, we 
will also have to invest in research on heredity, genetics and 
the human genome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House had the pleasure of listening to the speech by the 
hon. member for Jonquière, who is intensifying her efforts to 
have a genetic engineering research institute established in her 
riding. 
It would be a good thing if the government such research could 
be carried out in the riding of Jonquière.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, Bill C-13 seeks to formally establish the Canadian 
institutes of health research to organize, co-ordinate and fund 
health research at the federal level. It also repeals the 
Medical Research Council Act and defines the structure, role and 
mission of the institutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the bill as regards its purpose and the virtual 
establishment of such institutes. 
It is appropriate for the whole research network, all 
researchers and scientists to co-ordinate their efforts and talk 
to each other to truly ensure effective research, and we must 
also provide them with the most effective tools to enable them 
to carry out their research. We have no problems with that, and 
we agree with this way of repositioning medical research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But we do have a problem with the preamble of the bill, because 
instead of recognizing the provinces' exclusive jurisdiction 
over health care, the government merely recognizes the fact that 
they play some role in that area. Indeed, the second “Whereas” 
reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas Parliament recognizes the role of the provinces in 
health care and that the Government of Canada collaborates with 
provincial governments to support the health care system and 
health research; 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But it should have indicated that it is the responsibility of 
the provinces to manage health care services within their 
territory and that their agreement is necessary when their 
jurisdiction is involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The more things change, the more they stay the same.  It is the 
same old story.  Health care is a provincial responsibility. 
Why is the federal government always bent on extending its 
tentacles and constantly eroding provincial jurisdiction? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health care and education are provincial responsibilities. 
In Quebec, we are determined that we will never allow the 
Liberal government to interfere in our areas of responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If any money is to be invested in medical research, it must take 
the form of social transfer payments, so that we too can double 
our grants to researchers in our universities and medical 
research institutions.  So— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member has indicated that she would 
be sharing her time, so her ten minutes are now up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mrs. Pauline Picard:</B> So, on that note, I will conclude.  Right 
now, Quebec is in the process of reducing its deficit, trying to 
stimulate employment, maintaining its health programs and 
educating its children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the federal government always try to make things 
difficult for us?  Why does it invade our jurisdictions and try 
to take away all our powers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in favour of establishing CIHRs, but we would like the 
government to restore now the money it stole from us in transfer 
payment cuts.  If it has any money to put into health care, it 
should give it back to us so that we can fund our institutes 
ourselves.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to congratulate my colleague on her excellent speech. 
As hon. members are aware, she did a very good job as health 
critic for the Bloc Quebecois, from 1993 to 1999, if I remember 
correctly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since we are talking about health here, I would like to make a 
little announcement to my colleagues: I am going to be 
organizing a volleyball game along with Eric Plamondon, one of 
the pages in the House. 
The connection with the research institutes is that good health 
starts with physical activity. I appeal to all of my colleagues, 
particularly the Minister for International Cooperation, whom I 
see less and less often in the gym, to get active and keep fit. 
The game will be in February. You are welcome to participate 
too, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, to a question for my colleague, without 
any further ado.  I do not want any ambiguity about our belief 
in the Canadian institutes of health research.  This must be 
perfectly clear, in my opinion.  In his 1993 campaign, the 
current premier of Quebec, Lucien Bouchard, a man esteemed and appreciated 
in Canada and in Quebec, made research and development a plank 
in his platform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that all my colleagues will recall that, since 1993, we 
have asked the government to invest massively in research and 
development. I do not know if members recall, but this was 
almost at the same time as the appearance of a report by the 
OECD, which said that, of all industrialized countries, Canada 
had the worst performance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, members will understand that, out of a concern for 
consistency, naturally, we agree with a bill like this one. When 
the bill has passed and the government has invested the full 
amount, $500 million will be available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not much to write home about. 
I want to remind members that the Government of Quebec is 
formulating scientific policy with Minister Rochon, also a 
talented man. If everything goes well, he will release it in 
February.  The Government of Quebec has set aside $400 million 
over two years.  For Quebec alone, they are talking of $400 
million over two years for research and development, whereas 
here the government is proposing $500 million to 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally, it counts for something, but I made the comparison to 
show the House the extent to which Quebec is maintaining the 
tradition of commitment to its scientific community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members no doubt know that about 60% of the biomedical industry 
is to be found in Quebec. 
Historically, very early on, Quebec, through the National 
Assembly, made a commitment to biomedical research. I ask my 
colleague to explain why Quebec has every reason to be in favour 
of the bill, knowing that, historically, it has been very 
supportive of biomedical research through its pharmaceutical 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would remind the House there will be a volleyball 
game in February. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mrs. Pauline Picard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his 
question. I always congratulate him for his skills as a speaker, 
including his metaphors and his sense of humour in presenting 
his views on these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, investments in research and development are necessary, 
and researchers in hospitals and universities really want them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, a number of Quebec groups have applied for funds to the 
secretariat of the acting governing council for research 
institutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois supports increased investment in research, 
including health research. As my colleague pointed out, 60% of 
all biomedical research in Canada is done through pharmaceutical 
companies located in Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I have listened to my two colleagues' speeches, and now it is my 
turn to speak of the institutes of health research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For two years, I was fortunate enough to work with the member 
for Drummond, and I know that she has done some excellent work. 
I particularly remember her extraordinary efforts on the 
hepatitis C issue.  I wish to thank her, and I know that many 
Quebecers and Canadians with this illness are grateful for all 
the work she has done on their behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, she has been replaced as health critic by the member for 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, who did not wait till he was given this 
new responsibility to plunge right into the fight against AIDS. 
Since being elected, he has spoken very regularly on this 
subject and I think he deserves credit. 
He is now continuing his marvellous work in this sector by 
frequently bringing it to the attention of caucus, and he is a 
most eloquent spokesperson both here in the House and in caucus. 
His view is that we can never say too much about health, and he 
is right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a recreation specialist by training and I can say right now 
that I accept the invitation to the volleyball game in February. 
I would have liked to go earlier, but I will certainly be there 
in February, because there is a connection between physical 
activity and health.  Unfortunately, we members may not always 
have enough time for physical activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a diabetic, and I know that there are several other members 
in the House with the same condition.  Diabetes is an illness 
that often strikes very active people who do not perhaps pay 
enough attention to their health.  It is true that diabetes is a 
hereditary disease, but there are ways to stave off its onset. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now come to today's topic, Bill C-13. 
The Bloc Quebecois has presented its position well, through the 
two hon. members in question.  No one can be against health 
research.  If there are any members in this House who are 
opposed to health research, let them declare themselves, but I 
am convinced there are none.  There can never be too much money 
made available for finding solutions, for finding remedies for 
disease.  Life is worth living and, more importantly, it must be 
lived in good health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, one of the problems with this bill lies in one of 
the four sectors, that is, the assessment of health services 
provided across Canada.  My colleague from Drummond has asked a 
good question: Who is it that delivers health services in 
Canada?  The provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It can never be said too often, and we must keep hammering at 
it, health care and the delivery of health services to the 
public is a provincial area of jurisdiction.  This is no whim; 
it is in the Canadian Constitution.  Health care management is 
an exclusive provincial jurisdiction.  Even with this bill, 
although it may not be its main intent, we see the federal 
government again trying to interfere in the health field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, more money will be injected into R and D in the health 
field, but it is regrettable that, at present, Quebec receives 
only 14% of funding allocated to R and D. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I referred earlier to transfer payments to the provinces, but 
since the government opposite has made cuts to health, a 
cumulative total of $3.4 million has been cut from Quebec since 
1993.  That is a considerable amount, and the Government of 
Quebec could certainly have done more in the area of medical 
research.  There have, however, been problems, but there has 
been good news as well, such as the announcement by the hon. 
member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve that the Government of Quebec 
will soon spend $500 million in this area.

committee we often hear witnesses express concern about the 
brain drain.  The brain drain obviously involves researchers. 
People from a variety of research institutes appeared before the 
committee, because it is the Department of Industry that is 
funding research agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada ranks at the bottom of the G7 countries in this area.  In 
the field of health, it is in last place among the OECD 
countries as well. 
I think one of the aims of the bill is to finally catch up 
somewhat.  But the considerable delay and time involved is most 
regrettable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, many of our young researchers, and even more 
experienced ones, have left the country.  They even left Quebec. 
My colleague from Hochelaga—Maisonneuve made a connection 
between health and physical activity.  As an example, 
Dr. Bouchard, who ran the scientific research centre on physical 
activity at Laval University, left the country for the United 
States, because more money was available for research in this 
area.  This is most regrettable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not only a health issue, it is an employment issue as 
well.  When we talk about the knowledge economy, here is a fine 
R and D opportunity in the health field. 
Here is a fine opportunity to concern ourselves with retaining 
our researchers, people who trained in university for many years 
and whose education Canadians and Quebecers have helped fund. 
When these scientists can finally do research, a number of them 
leave Canada for the United States. This is regrettable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us hope that this tendency will be reversed, so that we can 
keep our researchers, because we are talking about quality 
employment here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the fact that economic spinoffs from R and D are 
greater in the field of health than in any other, because of the 
value added. We know that discoveries lead to the development of 
better drugs, products or equipment, all of which can be 
exported to other countries. Think of developing countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not forget these countries, which may not have the money 
to invest in research and development. However, once new drugs, 
equipment or products are discovered, these may help fight 
disease and improve health in all countries of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is very good for the Canadian and Quebec economy, and this 
is why, as a member of the Standing Committee on Industry, I 
welcomed this opportunity to add my two cents' worth to the 
debate today, to say that we should do more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the minute that I have left, I would like to address another 
issue, which I would not want to overlook. I am referring of 
course to diabetes. 
The Minister of Health recently talked about the money to be 
allocated to fight that disease, but I think we should do even 
more about diabetes, because it is on the rise.  Besides 
insulin, which does not treat diabetes but merely slows down its 
progression, possible cures are emerging, hence the need to 
invest more in research in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One last area mentioned by researchers was social sciences. I 
have always been struck by the fact, which has apparently been 
verified, that children from zero to six with health problems 
stand a greater chance of experiencing social problems, 
including delinquency, later in life.

sensed hesitation, and I thank you for giving me the floor.  I 
would not dream of wasting the time of the House.  I think it 
important, however, that we share our views. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to begin by thanking the member for 
Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, who, since 1993, has made such a 
contribution to all the deliberations of the Bloc Quebecois 
caucus.  When we think of the him, all of us call up an image of 
a profoundly compassionate individual, whose humanism is deeply 
rooted in the 19th century but who, throughout the years, has 
stayed very much in touch with the major problems of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière is a recreation 
specialist, as he himself just said.  He is therefore someone 
who has always made a great deal of room in his life for sports 
and recreation. 
I repeat this because I do not want there to be any confusion. 
There are people, whom I will not name, but whom I will look at, 
who sometimes set out to muddy the waters.  This has already 
happened.  The Bloc Quebecois is not against Bill C-13.  Once 
Quebec's concerns have been addressed and debated, we are going 
to put all our energy into getting the bill passed as soon as 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between 10 and 15 CIHRs are going to be established.  The 
sectors in question will be determined by a provisional 
governing council.  Naturally, all Bloc Quebecois members have 
always been faithful to the strictest and least negotiable 
interests that exist in politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>An hon. member:</B> Those of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Réal Ménard: </B>My colleague tells me that these are the 
interests of Quebec and I think he has a very good handle on why 
we are here in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The interests of Quebec demand that we ensure that it gets its 
fair share, particularly in the biomedical field.  I would 
remind hon. members that the Medical Research Council has been 
in existence for 40 years, and is headed by the eminent Dr. 
Friesen, whose years in the service of research are well known 
to all, and for which I salute him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec has strengths in a number of areas, one of them the 
biomedical sector, because of our patent drug industry, 
particularly in the areas of cancer and of diabetes. 
Unfortunately that hit too close to home for my colleague, who 
has to deal with it daily, although he maintains his habitual 
good humour, his even temperament—in a word, his excellent 
character—regardless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask my colleague whether he agrees with me that 
the Bloc Quebecois has been, without a doubt, the best defender 
of the interests of Quebec and will continue to be, as far as 
health research is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B> I most certainly acknowledge the role of the 
Bloc Quebecois.  That is why we are here.  We are, of course, 
promoting sovereignty because it is our feeling that the federal 
system has been out of order for years and that Quebecers are 
being disadvantaged by it. However, we are also here to defend 
the interests of Quebec, and I am here to particularly defend 
the interests of my region.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or—Cape Breton, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise today in the House to speak in 
support of the efforts of my colleague from Winnipeg North Centre 
in terms of ensuring that Bill C-13, which aims to establish a 
new framework for health research, becomes an effective piece of 
legislation that will be able to redress some of the problems in 
linking health research to practice in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along with my NDP colleagues, I applaud the efforts by all those 
who worked to create the new legislation.  However, along with my 
colleagues, I have several reservations about the legislation and 
hope that these will be taken into consideration when this bill 
reaches the committee stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order for the bill to achieve its goal, it requires a 
considerable amount of political will to ensure that the research 
that will be conducted in the 10 to 15 new health institutes will 
indeed reach the hands of health practitioners throughout the 
country.  While the bill acknowledges the need for this 
commitment, it does not ensure that the government will remain 
committed and be one of the driving forces in achieving the goals 
of Bill C-13. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill talks about increasing links, but it does not go as far 
as to enshrine the will to accomplish these links.  In light of 
the continued cuts to transfer payments, I have to wonder how the 
government intends the CIHR to achieve its goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1986 federal cuts to health care funding have totalled 
approximately $36 billion.  The amount transferred via the CHST 
to my home province of Nova Scotia has been steadily decreasing 
since 1993 when this government came to power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does little to take into consideration the consequences 
of these cuts in transfers.  These cuts have led to a diminished 
capacity of the health care system to care for its patients and 
new research findings have not been able to get off the ground 
and be applied. Because of these transfer cuts, problems have 
arisen throughout the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take for example the tar ponds on Cape Breton Island, a toxic 
wasteland which has wreaked havoc on the health of the people in 
the local area and on the environment.  People have died as a 
result of this toxic sludge.  People have reported arsenic 
bubbling up in their backyards and basements.  An entire 
residential street had to be bulldozed because it was considered 
extremely dangerous to one's health to live there. Even the 
government has recently committed another $37 million for a 
clean-up effort, but still no toxic sludge has been removed from 
the tar ponds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though all of this money was provided to alleviate a major 
health concern, it has not translated into a healthier step 
forward for the communities affected by the tar ponds.  Study 
after study after study have shown the ill-health effects and 
have shown the dramatic increase in the incidence of cancer.  The 
government, however, has lacked the political will and commitment 
or health infrastructure to act upon this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CIHR needs a clear mandate to intervene in these types of 
situations where hard research has proven that adverse health 
conditions and/or effects exist.  The government also has to 
provide a real commitment to ensure that sufficient funding 
exists. I sincerely hope that this issue will be examined in 
depth at committee. The CIHR will only be effective in working 
with its health practitioner partners if sufficient funding 
exists in the core health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my major concerns with the proposed CIHR is its lack of 
clear commitment to an approach or framework of health care and 
service ethics.  In this day and age with rapid increases in 
innovation and health care technology, it is absolutely essential 
that the ethical effects of medical research be given a high 
priority.  Bill C-13 barely acknowledges this need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The challenge we are faced with today is to ensure that, as with 
health care, we engage in preventive ethics, not just curative 
ethics.  What I mean by this is similar to that old saying about 
an ounce of prevention is worth two of medicine. 
We need to be actively engaged in encouraging that ethical 
concerns are a priority in any new and ongoing health research 
and practice. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1350"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today there are many ethical dilemmas in health research.  I 
will highlight a few that relate to women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These days simply because the technology exists, many women who 
would otherwise not be able to have children can have them.  This 
is a fantastic gain for so many.  However, there are ethical 
concerns about how these reproductive technologies are being 
implemented by health practitioners.  These concerns need to be 
widely debated.  They are already hot topics for researchers but 
so far, because the government has not acknowledged the need for 
ethical responsibility in medical services, they have not come 
under serious discussion and consideration in the public health 
care system in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be much more beneficial if we acknowledged this need 
for ethical responsibility now rather than later.  The CIHR could 
provide for ethical responsibility by engaging in a little of 
what I call preventive ethics.  It will be so much easier to deal 
with ethical concerns if they are enshrined in the legislation 
and recognized by health researchers and practitioners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last point of concern I raise is a simple one.  It has long 
been acknowledged that men and women have different health needs. 
What has been harder to acknowledge and achieve is a balance in 
health research to ensure the particular differences and the 
needs of women and their bodies are taken into consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My suggestion for the committee that will be examining Bill C-13 
is that we ensure it is not just the universal male body that is 
used in all of the interesting and exciting research to be done 
in Canada in the future.  There is certainly room within the 
legislation to require that one of the 10 to 15 institutes be a 
women's health institute.  All of the institutes created as a 
result of Bill C-13 should ensure that their boards and 
committees have gender parity and ensure gender analysis is a 
major priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reiterate that in principle I believe Bill C-13 is a very good 
start on the road to linking research and practice throughout the 
country.  However to date, the government has done little to make 
me believe that it will provide a considerable amount of support 
including the political support that will be required to ensure 
the success of the Canadian institutes of health research, and 
that it is not just another empty handed gesture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on all hon. members of the House to get the message to 
the government that we are serious about the need for a holistic 
approach to health care in Canada.  We need a commitment from 
this government that it will provide an adequate budget and 
significant and stable funding for health research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>The Speaker:</B>  My colleague, I will let you begin your 
speech but I will cut you off after five minutes and you can take 
it up again after question period. 
<P><A NAME="LINK80"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley,

is a rare occasion when a member of the official opposition can 
stand in the House and actually congratulate the government on 
putting forward a bill that does contain at least a few very good 
points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are inclined to support this legislation because it has some 
very unusual and strange things, unusual and strange to the 
Liberal Party of Canada.  One thing is accountability.  It builds 
accountability into the new CIHR.  It is really strange that it 
does allow for the governing council and the advisory board to be 
chosen by the research people themselves as opposed to simply 
being appointed by some Liberal patronage officer, which has been 
the case in the past with the Medical Research Council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian institutes of health research will replace the 
current Medical Research Council.  This is good for a number of 
reasons.  One is accountability. 
Another is that the governing council and the advisers will be 
chosen by the researchers themselves.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, for anyone who does receive a research grant under this 
new set-up there will be an accountability requirement that goes 
along with the funding. That means that within six months and 
every six months subsequently, as I understand it, the researcher 
that has the funding will have to account for the work he or she 
has been doing and show why he or she should continue to receive 
funding. This is a good thing. It has not been present 
unfortunately under the current Medical Research Council and that 
has been a process that we have not been able to support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another good thing about the Canadian institutes of health 
research is that the administrative costs will only be in the 
range of 4% to 5%.  This is another aspect of this unusual piece 
of government legislation that we can certainly support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of the boards, commissions and governing councils that have 
been set up under a varying amount of Liberal appointments and 
structures have subjected the Canadian taxpayer to more and more 
administrative costs.  At the bottom line it has been shown very 
often that these numerous boards the government has set up have 
simply been places for friends of the Liberal Party to spend the 
rest of their days in relatively nice comfort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going into question period now and I will be very pleased 
after question period to talk about some of the features of the 
bill and why we will support it. I will also continue to remind 
Canadians that it is very seldom that the government puts forward 
a bill that the Reform Party, the official opposition, can 
actually support.  This just happens to be one of them.

out there today.  The report talks about gross payments from

of support but more so reveals that the severity of the income

out of NISA.

since the Liberals took power in 1993.  In 1993 in the last

about $3 billion less.  This is an accurate reality on the farm

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</b>  Mr. Speaker, on 
Tuesday a constitutional lawyer told the government House leader 
exactly how easy it will be for the courts to strike down the gag 
law and the illogical 50 candidate rule in the new elections act. 
He urged members not to dump problems on the shoulders of our 
already overworked solicitor general by passing those parts of 
the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the solicitor general, is he aware of the fatal flaws in

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of

not offending.  The rules regarding third parties are based on 
the Libman decision of the supreme court. Everyone else in the 
House knows that.  The hon. member knows it too.  I have 
explained it to him at committee and informally in a one to one

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</b>  Mr Speaker, I can 
tell from the expression on the face of the solicitor general 
that he does not have a clue about the new elections act.  It was 
very nice of the government House leader to try to help him out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is the minister's 24 hour publication of polls 
amendment was just tinkering around the edges of the act.  Why 
did he not do something meaningful like get rid of the gag law,

oil companies bully the country into accepting these outrageous

them.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-13, an 
act to establish the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, to 
repeal the Medical Research Council Act and to make consequential 
amendments to other acts, be read the second time and referred to 
a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</b>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak today to Bill C-13, an act to establish the 
Canadian Institutes of Health Research and to repeal the Medical 
Research Council Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will draw to the attention of the House some of the positive 
and negative things in the bill and how they relate to other 
things that go on in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the positives of Bill C-13 is that those who serve on 
this Canadian institutes of health research board are elected by 
their peers.  It also has accountability and peer review.  Not 
only is someone elected by their peers, but they are reviewed by 
their peers.  On top of that, only 4% or 5% of the entire budget 
is taken up in bureaucracy, which leaves 95% or 96% to be spent 
on the actual things the bill intends to do and the things that 
the Canadian institutes of health research intend to do.

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have just talked about elected by their peers, accountability, 
peer review and very little waste, in the amount of 4%.  What 
institution in this place and involved with government does this 
directly contradict and not match up with?  I think of the other 
place, the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have done a fair bit of research on our Senate as of late, 
being that I am the critic of that place for the official 
opposition.  It is worthwhile to point out that Canada, in 
relation to countries such as Burkina Faso and Sierra Leon, still 
continues to appoint our senators for life.  It was only a few 
short years ago that we said that no one could sit in the Senate 
after the age of 75. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That all being considered, I noticed that even in the Canadian 
institutes of health research act, Bill C-13, the president is to 
serve a term of no more than five years.  We have the government 
agreeing to the very fundamental and basic idea of a fixed 
appointment, a fixed election and a specified term, not a 
position held for life.  In comparison to the Senate, people can 
be appointed to the Senate at the age of 30 and sit there until 
the ripe age of 75.  That would be a period of 45 years, nine 
times longer than the president of the Canadian institutes of 
health research would be allowed to sit in their posts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A fair question to be put to the government is that if the 
president of this new board, the Canadian institutes of health 
research, can only sit for five years before having a formal 
review and is no longer allowed to sit and the position changes 
over, how is it that a fundamental basis of our Senate, this 
second House that forms part of the parliament, reviews 
legislation, can block legislation and can create legislation for 
the citizens of Canada, can have somebody sit for 45 years with 
no form of review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell the House what I think of that concept of having no 
review.  We have a situation today where even if the Senate runs 
over budget, even if it spends more than what it has already been 
allotted, it cannot be called before the government operations 
committee to account for those things.  I know this because I sat 
on the government operations committee.  I well remember when the 
Senate went over budget and it wanted more money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened?  As members who are duly elected by taxpayers to 
be the watchdogs of the public purse, we tried to call 
representatives of the Senate to come before us in committee and 
we could not do it.  Not only could we not do it, but the Prime 
Minister of this place would never take action against others in 
that place if he were to have trouble with them unless there was 
severe public pressure and condemnation by their peers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the actual terms and how long one should or could be 
sitting in the Senate, right now somebody could be appointed at 
30, be there until 75, and serve an entire 45 years without any 
accountability to the Prime Minister, to the House of Commons or 
to any elector in any province any place in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alberta is a province that likes to generate new ideas every now 
and again.  We did that with the Senate elections act.  One of 
the things we did was tie senators who ran under that act to a 
fixed term.  We set it at double the length of a municipal 
election term. What I mean by that is that we have elections in 
the province of Alberta, as do many provinces in the country, 
that are actually fixed election dates.

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is something the Reform Party supports in terms of this 
place.  We believe we should have fixed election dates, that it 
should not be up to the whim and the caprice of the government to 
decide when it wants to drop the writ and when it wants to call 
an election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am advocating that we actually have fixed election dates in 
terms of the elections act.  Right now Bill C-2 is before a 
committee in clause by clause consideration.  Then, for example, 
every four years we would know when the election would be.  It 
would not be a matter of speculation for business in terms of how 
it conducts its activities, for the general population and 
constituents, or for the benefit of the government in terms of 
how it purchases time, buys advertising and all the rest of the 
things it can use taxpayer money for its benefit in putting out a 
good word about the government and the things it has done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in Alberta decided to go ahead and take that model of fixed 
election dates for our municipal elections that happen every 
three years and said that senators should be elected in every 
second one of them.  In the last municipal election we held a 
Senate election in Alberta.  We had more people vote in that 
Senate election than anybody has ever voted for any federal 
politician in the House, and certainly more than in the other 
place because nobody has ever voted for one of those senators 
aside from the Prime Minister and his sole vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We determined that we would be holding more of those Senate 
elections in conjunction with the fixed election dates in the 
municipal elections act.  That is something I wanted to point 
out.  The government recognizes those principles and puts them 
into things like the Canadian institutes of health research, but 
we do not see it being carried forward in the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Prime Minister campaigned in 1990 and spent his time 
issuing threats to the province of Quebec about 60% majorities 
being required for it to make a decision on its own, he said that 
he believed in Senate elections, that he wanted to see people 
elected in that other place.  If he had carried forward on the 
intentions he laid out when he ran for the Liberal leadership, 
most of the people in the Senate would be elected senators by 
now. That is not the case because he did not follow through on 
his word, his promise in 1990. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to touch on the whole idea of selection by one's 
peers.  Instead of even being judged by fellow senators, 
appointment to the Senate is gained by the judgment of one man. 
Admittedly there was a rare exception in Canadian history when it 
was the judgment of a woman, but for the most part it has been 
one man, the Prime Minister of the country deciding who gets into 
the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since he has not been a senator himself, we might ask what he 
judges or how he judges how one gets into the Senate?  Like the 
people who might be serving on the Canadian institutes of health 
research, will he look at what kind of medical accreditation they 
have?  Will he judge how they have practised medicine?  Will he 
examine whether or not they have the support of their peers?  Is 
any of that being done?  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way that someone gains a seat in the Senate is unfortunately 
based on how loyal they have been to a given prime minister.  Are 
they dependable when the Prime Minister wishes to bring forward a 
piece of legislation that he knows will be very difficult for the 
people in that place to swallow, that may go against the popular 
consent of those he governs, that may not carry the popular will 
of the day?  Will they be good, loyal soldiers, strap on their 
jackboots and carry forward with the orders? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe somebody who has been a good loyal parliamentary secretary 
marshalling bills through committee and shoving the will of the 
Prime Minister down the throats of the people of the country 
would be the type of person who gets put into the Senate, the 
good loyalists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another way some prime ministers have judged is not just on the 
basis of loyalty and being good jackboot wearing parliamentary 
secretaries but on how much money they have raised. 
Many senators in that place have broken records and set the tone 
for being the biggest political fundraisers in Canadian history. 
People are judged in terms of how to get into the Senate on how 
many millions of dollars they raised for a leadership campaign.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</b> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to Bill C-13. I would like to take this 
opportunity to greet Mr. Gary Carter, who is here with us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to speak to this bill that formally establishes the 
Canadian Institutes of Health Research. These institutes will be 
responsible for organizing, coordinating and funding health 
research at the federal level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his last budget, the Minister of Finance announced that these 
institutes would be allocated a $65 million budget for their 
first year of operation. This budget is to increase to 
$175 million the following year, in 2001-02, for a grand total 
of $500 million, when combined with the funding already set aside 
for the Medical Research Council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are pleased to see that the federal government is putting 
more money into health research since it is a crucial area. 
I should say from the outset that we in the Bloc Quebecois—my 
distinguished colleague from Hochelaga—Maisonneuve included—will 
see to it that Quebec gets its fair share of those funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past, when looking at the distribution of federal funding 
for research and development—and we can go back 20 or 25 years—we 
could see that Quebec did not get its fair share, a share that 
reflected its demographic weight. 
On average, Quebec received about 14% of the federal funding for 
R and D, and so far, nothing has changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the new funding provided by this bill and the money handed 
out year after year not only in various areas of medical 
research, but also in bio-food, high technology and other 
industries, we just want to ensure that Quebec is getting its 
fair share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Someday, I hope the Quebec members of the Liberal Party of 
Canada across the way will rise and demand, as we have since 
1993, that Quebec receive what it is owed. They were elected by 
Quebecers, but I have yet to see one of them take a single step 
to demand justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I indicated earlier, we support the establishment of these 
institutes, especially since new funding will be allocated to 
one very crucial area, medical research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we do have some concerns, which is why our eminent 
colleague from Hochelaga—Maisonneuve will be moving amendments on 
behalf of the Bloc Quebecois. For instance, we feel that 
Bill C-13 stints on the role of the provinces. Of course, members 
opposite tend to forget, as they did these last few years and 
especially in the throne speech, that health is an area of 
provincial jurisdiction. In Quebec, the province has 
jurisdiction over health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a fact that is barely acknowledged in the bill. And 
since the bill is based on the constitutional divisions of 
power, the provinces are given short shrift. 
The bill says that the provinces and all kind of people will be 
consulted, and so on, but nowhere does it say that health is an 
exclusive jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the bill states: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—consult, collaborate and form partnerships with the provinces 
and with persons and organizations in Canada that have an 
interest in issues pertaining to health or health research; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would have like to see a statement recognizing that the 
provinces are fully responsible for health and that they will be 
the first partners informed and consulted, particularly with 
regards to the defining of the different health research 
institutes.

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I emphasize that the Quebec government is 
finalizing a science policy. It will identify strategic areas in 
health research, including mental health, cancer, human genome 
and biotechnology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the amendments that we will certainly propose will be to 
the effect that the Government of Quebec, like all the other 
provincial governments, must absolutely be consulted and that 
its research priorities must be taken into account in 
establishing the health research institutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another problem with the provision I quoted earlier. 
In the bill, the expression issues pertaining to health is used 
more often than the word research. This bothers us because the 
use of the expression issues pertaining to health leaves the 
door wide open for the federal government to interfere in 
various ways in the area of health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One amendment we will certainly put forward will be to 
clarify this issue and to replace the expression issues 
pertaining to health with the word research, because what the 
government wants to achieve with this bill has to do with health 
research and not. We hope this is a mistake and that the federal 
government does not intend to interfere in the area of health, 
which is under Quebec's exclusive jurisdiction. 
We will clarify that, and my distinguished colleague from 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve will work to make this bill clearer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support health research because it is fundamental, and this 
is something I cannot overemphasize. However, the few hundred 
million dollars that will be spent on health research over the 
next three years must not overshadow the fact that this 
government made huge cuts in the health sector. Cuts in 
transfers to the provinces, particularly for health care, have 
had devastating effects, the full extent of which is still 
unknown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I always feel uncomfortable when the Minister of Finance rises 
in the House, which is a very solemn place, and tells us he 
increased transfers to the provinces for health, post-secondary 
education and income security, as this is not true. 
He did not even increase transfers. He keeps cutting them and he 
will continue to do so until 2003. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By then, this brazen Minister of Finance, who keeps spouting 
nonsense during oral question period, will have cut $33 billion 
in transfers to the provinces. Half or close to half of that 
amount would have been allocated to health. This is not peanuts. 
In Quebec alone, there will be a shortfall of $850 million in 
the health sector this year, while the cumulative cuts imposed 
by this brazen minister will total $6 billion of which half, in 
Quebec, would have been earmarked for health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one hand, the minister invests a few hundred million 
dollars in health research, while on the other hand he is 
cutting billions of dollars which should have been used to help 
the sick, to manage hospitals and to make more beds available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been talking about oncology for a while now in Quebec, 
Ontario, and other regions of Canada. 
These billions of dollars could have been used for all that. But 
the Minister of Finance preferred to take that money from the 
provinces. He is the one mainly responsible for the mess in 
hospitals, but that does not bother him in the least. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It takes some nerve to do what he did, particularly when he 
says, hand over heart, that he cares about the plight of the 
sick and of the poor children. This is sheer hypocrisy.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</b>  Madam Speaker, I am happy 
to rise today to speak to Bill C-13, a bill to establish the 
Canadian institutes of health research.  Finally we see this 
government come up with a piece of legislation that deals with a 
very important part of our Canadian infrastructure, health care 
and health research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the same government that bragged in the budget of 
February of this year that it was putting $11.5 billion back into 
health care.  What it failed to say, however, was that the $11.5 
billion was basically returning part of the $17 billion it had 
cut from the health care system.  It is good to see that at least 
there is some forward movement when it comes to health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot speak today about health care and ignore what we saw in 
the last year in how poorly those afflicted with hepatitis C were 
treated by the government and the lack of support for these 
people.  It was something that was truly not acceptable to our 
party, to me as an individual and to Canadians as a whole because 
they felt these people were truly victims and should have been 
given some compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the waste and the misuse of funds by this 
government.  Take, for example, Bill C-68, the long gun registry. 
The government said it would spend $85 million to set up this 
registry.  It has spent well over $200 million.  The registry is 
not going very well.  It is still not working as it should, and 
crime has not been reduced because of this so-called piece of 
crime reduction legislation.  Had those funds been spent on 
giving our law enforcement people better resources, better 
computer systems and money to increase the number of policemen on 
our streets, those funds would have been better spent than 
wasting them on something that was more of a PR effort or a tax 
grab. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are not strangers to huge advances in medical science. 
Despite our small population of some 30 million people, we have 
seen very notable achievements within this country in health 
care.  I think back to Banting and Best and their discovery of 
insulin.  I think back to Sir William Osler, who wrote the 
medical text book <I>Principles and Practices of Medicine</I>.  He 
basically introduced the idea of clinical care in our health care 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see that Canada has already had some notable people in the 
health care field.  This piece of legislation will help to bring 
out some other people who could make a contribution to health 
care and health research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about the brain drain in this country.  A lot of our 
bright young minds are going across the border to better paying 
jobs and better working conditions.  One of the positive things 
about this piece of legislation is that it will help to keep some 
of those bright young minds in Canada.  Not only will those 
people stay in Canada to earn their living, but some medical 
advances will probably be brought to this country because of 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to my entry into politics I spent over 15 years with the 
Life Underwriters Association of Yarmouth, the town where I 
worked for the past number of years, and every Christmas season 
we would raise funds for cystic fibrosis research. 
I know how difficult cystic fibrosis can be on the families of 
young people which demand the extent of care that is required for 
these people, the constant medication that they have to take, the 
constant treatment and therapy that has to be given so that they 
can continue living.  Their quality of life is often diminished. 
Their life is not very long because this illness kills.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Research has isolated the gene that causes cystic fibrosis.  The 
cure has not been found, but I think what it shows is that with 
funding and with research we can work toward a cure for some of 
our most serious health problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I think of my home province of Nova Scotia, I think about 
the IWK/Grace Health Centre, which is a world renowned children's 
hospital.  I know that a lot of research is done there.  The 
centre has very bright minds, good researchers and good doctors. 
I know firsthand how caring the centre is.  My youngest daughter 
has cerebral palsy and we have spent a lot of time there over the 
past 13 years.  The level of care, the level of treatment and how 
that centre helps people is very evident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, because of all the cuts the government has made the people 
who work at the centre, along with many others, have had to work 
hard to raise extra funds.  They have a telethon every spring to 
raise funds, just so they can continue to operate.  These 
institutions should have the funds necessary to provide the 
services that Canadians need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We get numerous calls and letters from people saying that health 
care is important, that we should work to make it better and not 
let it erode.  If we are not vigilant, I am afraid that we will 
end up with something similar to what they have in the United 
States.  I am not in agreement with that.  We have a health care 
system in Canada that is by far the best in the world, but we 
have to be vigilant.  We have to ensure that we keep it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is good legislation.  There are, however, some things that 
concern me.  As any legislation, it is not perfect.  One of the 
things we have to do is ensure that we do not have institutes 
that are overburdened with bureaucracy.  We have to ensure that 
the funds go to the researchers for research purposes and that 
the benefits go to curing illness and not to an administration 
that is top heavy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point that has to be looked at is the transparency in 
the creation of these institutes.  This cannot be another 
political plum given to supporters of the government.  We have to 
ensure that these are institutes which are independent, which do 
their work, which do not waste funds on bureaucracy, and that the 
funds go where they are really needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is legislation that is worthy of our support.  I ask all 
members to support it so that it can go to committee where it can 
be studied properly.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we are on the subject of research, let me spend a moment 
mentioning some things on which Canada really stands out.  My 
colleague just mentioned Banting and Best and their work on 
insulin.  I cannot calculate how much of a difference that made 
worldwide to the treatment of diabetes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A colleague of mine, Lorne Tyrrell, a young man who graduated in 
the same medical class as I, has gone on to become the dean of my 
medical school.  I met with Lorne about a month ago.  We have had 
an opportunity to exchange information over the years.  I was 
fascinated to hear about his research on hepatitis B, which was 
conducted in a Canadian institute at a very high level. Hepatitis 
B is a major illness worldwide.  Lorne and his research group 
found a treatment that is now on the market.  It has gone through 
all the testing.  This treatment will revolutionize hepatitis B 
care.  I am proud to know Lorne and to have associated with him. 
I am proud to call him one of my colleagues.  His name will one 
day be known in the same vein.  It is an important part of 
Canadian life.  The improvement to health in an area like this is 
really quite dramatic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to spend a moment talking about research funding and how 
it is divvied up in Canada.  I was surprised to find when I came 
to Ottawa from Alberta that research funds were not apportioned 
according to the severity of the disease.  I found that research 
funding was apportioned in somewhat of an ad hoc way.  I was 
dismayed by that and I made these suggestions over and over again 
to the research community, and I will make these proposals again 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that a portion of research funding should have basic, 
specific criteria.  These criteria could be expanded, but they 
would include the severity of the disease, the number of people 
affected, the number of people who die from the disease and the 
number of people who suffer from the disease.  Those would be 
high on the list of priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These criteria would also focus on what is the research 
expertise like in that particular disease in Canada.  I do not 
believe we should be recreating work that is being done in 
Switzerland or Germany.  I believe we should look at research 
worldwide to figure out where Canada's research dollars would be 
best placed.  There are diseases such as cystic fibrosis and 
rheumatoid arthritis that get very little funding, yet they are 
very close to a cure.  Canada has expertise in these areas.  I 
wish and would hope that research funds would be directed to 
those areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For comparison purposes, let me lay out some of the funding with 
the recent figures I have.  Diabetes, which affects a vast number 
of people in Canada, receives $1.1 million in federal research 
funding.  Schizophrenia, which is a disease of huge proportion, 
receives $300,000 in funding.  Crones disease receives $100,000 
in funding.   One of the new diseases on the scene, which is a 
very significant infectious disease, AIDS, receives $41.5 million 
in funding.  When I look at the proportions, I think they are 
skewed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the issue of keeping and attracting bright 
researchers.  I have known researchers who have left our country. 
I have had the opportunity to ask them why.  They told me that 
they left Canada for three reasons. 
Two of them were monetary.  One was the value of their income, 
which was substantially enhanced in other countries.  The second 
was taxation.  They found that our taxation system was onerous. 
These people are high earners.  If they earn $100,000 and the tax 
man takes away $50,000 and they find another jurisdiction where 
that is not the case, the draw is to go where their work is more 
appreciated.

<A HREF="#LINKT68"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final reason was support for research.  The bill moves 
toward supporting research.  That is one of the reasons that I 
support it.  Support for research in terms of equipment, spaces 
at the universities and research labs is substantially lower in 
Canada than in many developed countries.  Some of the reason for 
that lies behind decisions made by governments in years gone by: 
overspending, spending for the future and running up huge debts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me digress a little and talk about some health matters that 
still are unaddressed.  On hepatitis C, we are coming close to 
the second anniversary of Judge Horace Krever inquiry.  Two years 
ago there was a major exposé on what happened to our blood system 
and people getting hepatitis C and HIV through tainted blood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After all the debate, all the discussion we had in the Houses, 
it is interesting to note that not one single solitary penny of 
funds has been disbursed, not even to the people in the narrow 
area the government agreed to give funding to.  Ontario gave 
funding to everyone.  In Quebec it was the same.  This is one of 
the saddest times in my time in parliament.  I still shake my 
head over the issue of how a government that prides itself on its 
compassion could have been so lacking in compassion on that 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note, however, that in other countries 
where probes were taken not by the government but by law 
officers, by the legal system, charges have been laid.  In France 
particularly there were charges laid against high officials in 
the government.  We have an ongoing RCMP probe in Canada. Quietly 
behind the scenes RCMP officers are looking for the reasons that 
Canada was so far behind other developed countries in terms of 
looking at tainted blood.  It is very close to opening another 
chapter in the hepatitis C saga. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point I cannot help but mention is that the Liberals 
made very specific promises on health care in their red book.  I 
listened carefully and believed that their promises would come 
true.   What did they deliver?  My colleague said that they 
delivered $17 billion in cuts.  That is not accurate.  The 
delivery was $21.4 billion in cuts over five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the government is saying that it is doing so wonderfully it 
will be returning $11.5 billion in the next five years. According 
to simple grade 3 mathematics it is obvious we are still deeply 
in the hole.  We have the longest waiting lists for surgery in 
Canadian history.  We have an exodus of some of our best nurses 
and lab technicians and in fact very poor technology in a host of 
areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What could be done?  There are people looking for creative 
solutions for health care.  I look for things that are not system 
related but patient related, things like a debit card to put 
funding decisions in the hands of the patient, like medisave 
accounts and like patient guarantees to give patients the 
opportunity to be sure they are not on a waiting list too long. 
Is the CIHR a step in the right direction on medical research? In 
my estimation it is supportive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion I will simply say that I will be voting for the 
CIHR.  I do hope the specific issue of apportionment of research 
funding will be carefully looked at by those who will run the 
CIHR.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</b> Madam Speaker, I am pleased 
to rise in the House this afternoon to speak to Bill C-13, an 
act to establish the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and 
to repeal the Medical Research Council Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The part of the bill dealing with the objective clearly states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objective of the CIHR is to excel, according to 
internationally accepted standards of scientific excellence, in 
the creation of new knowledge and its translation into improved 
health for Canadians, more effective health services and 
products and a strengthened Canadian health care system— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read through the bill quickly. It will warrant further 
scrutiny. I realize that its intent is good, but we have a lot 
of work ahead of us. That is normal. We are at the second 
reading stage and we have to debate the bill for a number of 
hours. Then, in committee, we will hear the views of 
individuals, groups or organizations concerned. That represents 
a lot of work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It means that it is important to stress now, for the benefit of 
those who are watching and take an interest in this issue, the 
good points and those we see as more problematical, so that the 
organizations and the individuals who feel they can shed some 
light on our examination can do so in due course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Scientific research is something at which Canadian and Quebecers 
excel. 
We have world class researchers, particularly in the health 
field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I too am from a Quebec City area riding. There are world class 
research institutes and pharmaceutical research centres in our 
area. They have made discoveries and they are keeping on their 
good work. They can hold their heads just as high as anyone 
else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, if we want to maintain this level of 
performance among our scientists, our researchers and our 
research institutes, we have to give them the resources they 
need. Often, it is money they need. Research is expensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is expensive because researchers need well equipped 
laboratories. 
It is expensive, also, because the scientists who do this 
research deserve a decent salary; otherwise, they will go 
elsewhere to get it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be perfectly clear. These researchers, these Canadian and 
Quebec scientists, were born here. They studied here. They have 
were trained here first. Then, many of them have gone abroad to 
get greater skills and broader knowledge. They now work here and 
they accomplish a lot. If we want this to continue, we have to 
take certain steps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this bill is to establish measures dealing with 
some of these points, including funding, but not only funding. 
But I will come back to that later on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois agrees with the principle of the bill and 
even feels a certain degree of enthusiasm, seeing that this bill 
will support the advancement of scientific research in the area 
of health—and we certainly know how important it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there are some problems with this bill. For example, it 
is unfortunate that, in the preamble, instead of recognizing the 
provinces' exclusive jurisdiction over health, the government 
only recognizes the fact that they have some role to play in 
that area. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1555"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT71"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT71"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1555

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health is exclusively under provincial jurisdiction. If we are 
to have a bill to improve scientific research, we certainly 
should make an effort to eliminate jurisdictional irritants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill should not open the door to any potential 
jurisdictional conflicts because scientific research is far 
removed from all these jurisdictional issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the second whereas in the preamble to this bill, 
unfortunately, reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas Parliament recognizes the role of the provinces in 
health care and that the Government of Canada collaborates with 
provincial governments to support the health care system and 
health research; 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a weak statement. It minimizes the inherent 
responsibility of the provinces, including Quebec, with regard 
to health. It should have been specified—and I hope an 
amendment will be made to that effect—that the provinces are 
responsible for managing health services within their boundaries 
and that it is necessary to obtain their agreement to do certain 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make a general comment that has obvious implications 
in our daily lives and particularly in hospitals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health research is not only about finding new drugs; it is not 
only about inventing new treatments or about designing new 
medical devices. It is also about planning for future needs in 
terms of personnel, institutions, skills, facilities in order to 
be able to take care of the people who will need medical 
attention in the coming weeks and years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present, in Quebec—and I am mentioning this only as an 
example—we have a problem with oncologists. There are not 
enough of them, but it takes six years to train one. 
Consequently, it is six years ago that we should have addressed 
the issue but, as we know, the shift to ambulatory care had been 
put on hold by the Liberal government of the day in Quebec, 
forcing Mr. Rochon to proceed with it, with all the delays that 
implies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health research is also, therefore, about knowing how to 
determine future needs. And since health is a provincial 
responsibility, if this bill does not recognize it, we will 
experience this kind of problem again. I know that everybody 
wishes this problem to be solved. This bill should ensure that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should like to make another comment that is relatively simple, 
but that is important. Bills are written in both official 
languages, French and English. And both versions have force of 
law, independently of one another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, when the two versions are not equivalent, we have two acts 
that are interpreted, not one by the other, but independently of 
one another. In the French version, at line 10 of the preamble, 
we read the word “centralisé”, and I will read the whole 
sentence to give you the context. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Attendu que le Parlement estime que des Instituts de recherche 
en santé doivent être créés en vue de coordonner, de centraliser 
et d'intégrer la recherche en matière de santé selon les 
principes suivants: 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Co-ordinating health research is fine; nobody is against that. 
Integrate health research is also fine. But to centralize health 
research?  The English version of the bill says focus, but the 
French version says centraliser. But, we must ask, centralize it 
where? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I saw that, I thought it made no sense at all. Then I 
looked at the English version, which says: 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas parliament believes that health research institutes 
should be created to co-ordinate, focus and integrate health 
research. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Centraliser does not mean to focus.  The English version says 
that the research effort will be focused on chosen subject 
matters, whereas the French version says research will be 
centralized.  To centralize means to physically gather in one 
place.  This is bad translation; we end up with two different 
pieces of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is lots of work to be done before this bill can actually 
produce the expected results and before we can be sure that our 
first class scientists have all the necessary tools to do their 
job, because we really need those results, as the issue here is 
our health.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</b>  Madam 
Speaker, it is indeed a pleasure to raise some issues that relate 
to this bill. I must say at the beginning that the government has 
been slow off the mark.  This is something that should have been 
done years and years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the concerns we have in agriculture on the prairies is 
the lack of research that has been done in relation to GMOs. 
Madam Speaker, I can see you are a bit puzzled when I use the 
term GMOs.  Let me explain that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A GMO is a genetically modified organism.  It is something that 
scientists are able to do with an organism through the use of 
gamma rays or some such technique.  They are able to bombard the 
essential ingredients of life and in some way mutate them and 
develop organisms that are resistant to certain diseases and 
which have certain characteristics that might take a much longer 
time to develop naturally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been genetically modified organisms all throughout 
history because they occur naturally.  The rays of the sun will 
create these kinds of things.  Farmers have been growing 
genetically modified plants for years and years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the problems that is developing is the fear campaign that 
is being spread by certain organizations.  We have seen it in 
Europe.   It is creating the concern that these are going to 
somehow impact our life and cause a lot of problems.  We need 
research in that area and it needs to be done now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize that most members who have spoken so far have 
supported this and by and large we need this.  My concern with 
what the government has put forward is that if the guidelines are 
not implemented properly, the committee that is selected may just 
be another patronage haven for the Prime Minister.  We have to 
make sure there is a complete balance in the membership of the 
committee that selects the particular members and that selects 
the various projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consideration must be given to some of the concerns in rural 
Canada, for example, research that would address the whole area 
of GMOs.  If the question of whether or not GMOs are harmful is 
not answered quite soon, it will hurt the economy of our country. 
That is why I say this is something that should have been done a 
long time ago.  I am glad the government is doing it now and my 
hope is that the type of research that needs to be done will get 
done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bloc members have been arguing that this is an area of 
provincial jurisdiction.  Research in some areas, such as the one 
I have just described which pertains to agriculture and the 
growing of certain crops and whether those crops have a harmful 
or helpful effect on us as human beings needs to be done.  That 
kind of research would transcend provincial boundaries.  That is 
a concern in more areas and possibly one could get around the 
concern the Bloc has by having provinces co-operate in this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also have concerns, as I mentioned previously on another bill, 
that this could develop a huge bureaucracy that would suck a lot 
of funds out of the system that could have gone to research. 
There has to be some check, some balance in the bill to ensure 
that does not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree that research is very important and we need to have 
public input into research.  Is the government willing to make 
some of the amendments that Reform is suggesting in regard to 
this?  We have to work more co-operatively even in this House. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1605"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize that in this bill the government has broken some new 
ground.  There is more public accountability.  It is providing 
for this kind of thing.  Why does the government not do that in 
other areas? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister makes 5,000 patronage appointments every 
year.  We do not just need reform in the health care research 
area.  We need reform in many other areas where there is more 
public accountability and input.  I hope this bill will break new 
ground and the government will see this is absolutely necessary 
in many other areas.  For the Prime Minister to have that much 
power to control that many organizations and to have that much 
input is not healthy in a democratic society.  That is something 
which I hope will be raised more and more as we go along. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I bring up the topic of gun control.  Madam Speaker, you may be 
a bit shocked as to why I would raise this issue in the context 
of this bill, but I have said on many occasions that the hundreds 
of millions of dollars that are now being spent laying a piece of 
paper beside every gun in the country, referring to the gun 
registry, is a complete waste of time.  If we want to save lives, 
we should begin to divert funds from some of these ridiculous, 
useless projects implemented by the government and put them into 
health research.  It is a no brainer as to what would save more 
lives.  A gun registry does not save a life.  It cannot.  If we 
put funds into the health research area, it would genuinely do 
something to enhance our quality of life.  I hope this issue will 
be raised.  I hope the government is listening and will address 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern in relation to this bill is that the government may 
lay down the rules for the various projects.  If it is able to 
make some of these appointments, there may not be a fair hearing. 
The people who make the rules generally call the shots.  If the 
government gets too involved in making the rules that these 
various projects have to follow, that could manipulate the 
process and some of the best projects may never be realized.  The 
research that needs to be done may not be done. I hope that all 
segments of society will be well respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the concerns raised by my constituents over and over 
again is that much of the research is funded by private drug 
companies and in doing that, they determine the outcome of the 
research.  The person who pays the piper calls the tune.  I know 
the government says that it will collaborate with private 
industry and so on but the concern is that therefore if it does 
that, a lot of the research that would be very helpful to 
Canadians will not be done.  Research into health food products, 
organic foods and the use of herbs in enhancing the health of 
people may never be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make the point forcefully that we should be looking at 
alternatives to the medicines being used at the present time. 
The emphasis on drug research is not what we need in Canada.  We 
need to look at many other areas.  People in my constituency feel 
very strongly that the government is not doing enough research in 
that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talked about the brain drain today.  The government has been 
draining the brains of this country for a long time and it is 
going to take a lot to reverse that.  I hope something like this 
will improve that concern people have. I cannot emphasize enough 
that we have to keep our young people at home. We have to get 
them researching these areas and making sure some of the benefits 
of organic foods, health food products, herbs and so on are 
recognized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come back to what I was saying at the beginning, that these 
genetically modified organisms and foods people are scared about 
will be properly researched.  I am not aware of a whole lot of 
research that has been done.  That will take a long time to do.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to watch this bill with interest.  A lot of things 
still need to be ironed out.  People have concerns about health 
care research.  I am glad the government is addressing it, but we 
have to make sure that we keep on track and ensure that all 
Canadians have a voice in the research being done here and that 
it is equal and does not favour certain segments of society. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK236"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia—Matane, BQ):</b> Madam Speaker, I join my 
colleagues in supporting Bill C-13. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about the opposition, very often we think that it 
is difficult for it to agree with some bills. We have an example 
today where the Bloc Quebecois can be in agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk about some flaws in this bill. One of them is that 
it should have been introduced as early as in 1993, when the 
Liberals came into office, because there is an urgent need to 
invest into research and development to help researchers. 
We know that the United States are a few steps ahead of us, and 
that we need to focus on research and development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very laudable to help Canadian Institutes of Health 
Research. Unfortunately, the money is not transferred to the 
provinces. This is another flaw, a major flaw, I would say. Why 
not give this money to the provinces so they can manage it 
themselves? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, I heard a Reform colleague ask “Will the bureaucracy be 
expanded? Will the money go directly into research or into 
framework and administration activities?” There is always this 
danger. When we create something, very often a large part of the 
money goes into the administration and very little goes where it 
should. This is another flaw that I wanted to mention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is nice to agree that money should be provided for health 
research and development. 
But we should certainly not forget the $7 billion that were cut 
from transfer payments to the provinces. The government says it 
will be generous and give some money back, but let us not forget 
this $7 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Rochon reform in Quebec did hurt—and is probably still 
hurting—one must look at the root cause: the $7 billion the 
provinces did not get. Without money, no matter how good a 
manager you are, you will have a hard time making the system 
work. Mrs. Marois, who is certainly a remarkable health minister, 
needs money too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will never say this enough: the federal cuts are the root 
cause of the problems faced by hospitals in Quebec. These cuts 
are shocking, revolting, disgusting, odious and not worthy of 
any government. How could they make such drastic cuts? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the area of health care, when someone arrives at the hospital 
and needs heart surgery or has cancer, leukaemia or any other 
form of cancer, the situation is urgent. Some patients have to 
wait for weeks, even months. In Quebec, patients had to be sent 
to the United States, not because we lacked expertise—we do have 
expertise—but because of the federal cuts. At times, you have to 
make do with what you have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These thoughtless, irresponsible cuts have gutted health care in 
the other provinces too, but especially in Quebec, whose 
problems I am more familiar with. The cuts to the health 
transfers are the root cause of the difficulty Quebec is having 
in managing its hospitals properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The management and staff of the hospitals and CLSC in Matane, 
Maria and Amqui are performing near miracles to treat patients 
with dignity and speed. 
I visited these three hospitals, which are in my riding.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We really have no idea of all the work and the efforts we ask of 
our physicians, nurses and orderlies. They have always given 
their all, but now we are asking for even more. Why is it that 
we keep asking more and more from these people? We know that 
when people with tremendous responsibilities get tired and 
exhausted, medical errors can occur, but fortunately, so far, 
these have been avoided. These people should not be blamed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people to blame are those who cut provincial transfers. They 
are responsible for the way things stand today. 
For the 1999-2000 fiscal year, the estimated shortfall will be 
about $1.7 billion. In Quebec alone, they will reach $850 million. 
Since 1993, cuts to health care have totalled $3.5 billion. That 
means that since our election to this House, cuts of $3.5 million 
have been made to the health care budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents come to see me in my riding office of either 
Matane or Amqui and ask “Why are so many cuts in Quebec?” I tell 
them what I tell everyone in Quebec “Think about it. Who is 
responsible for this? Who is responsible for the lack of health 
care and the long waiting lists?” It is the federal government, 
and no one can argue about that. We have to keep saying this 
over and over again. Of course, when people go to a hospital, 
they are already in pain. They look around and see what is going 
on and, after one and two hours, they get tired of waiting and 
lose patience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have said it before, and I will say it again—because this 
cannot be overemphasized—if people have to wait for a week, two 
weeks or a very long time before an operation, it is not because 
of the physician or the hospital, but because the hospital is 
starved of resources and, as a result, the level of services has 
dropped. Those in charge are doing the impossible to give the 
best service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite should be ashamed for their attack on the sick. 
Occasionally, members of the opposition in Quebec come up with 
special cases, but they do not have enough courage to explain 
why those cases do occur, and why people are on waiting lists. 
We know very well that inadequate budgets are the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister is bragging that, in just a few years, he 
will have raked in a $95 billion surplus. Yes, $95 billion. 
People in my riding of Matapédia-Matane think it does not make 
any sense to have cuts in health care and accumulate a $95 
billion surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding, many seasonal workers and forestry workers have a 
hard time making ends meet. In the forestry sector, summers can 
be very hectic for men with a family—although I am sure some 
women are forestry workers too. They have to get up very early 
in the morning, and go to bed very late at night. On top of 
that, they are under stress because of employment insurance, 
which the people in my riding and I call poverty insurance. They 
wonder why they have to pay into this plan, which is just 
stressing them out. The level of stress is incredible.

health, people may perhaps wonder why so much money is needed. 
Perhaps we need to find out why people are so stressed out.  It 
is said that one of the things that causes cancer is stress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is a past master at causing stress.  It ought to 
examine its conscience and say “It is true that research must be 
carried out in order to eliminate or control certain diseases”. 
I say that is all very fine, but what might be needed instead is 
a more general examination of the problem.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</b>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the debate on Bill C-13, 
an act to establish the Canadian institutes of health research, 
to repeal the Medical Research Council Act and to make 
consequential amendments to other acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Never let it be said that members of the official opposition 
oppose all government legislation for the sake of opposing. While 
we have an onus to oppose as the opposition in this adversarial 
parliamentary system, we frequently support bills which we think 
are in the public interest.  We are pleased to lend our support 
to this thoughtful bill which seeks to improve the administration 
of grants and funding for medical and scientific research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we have heard in this debate, currently grants to finance 
medical research are administered by the Medical Research 
Council, an agency of the government established many years ago 
on the common bureaucratic model of such agencies, with a minimum 
of accountability and transparency and, many would argue, an 
excess of administrative costs and wasteful bureaucracy, money 
which ought to be directed toward real frontline, concrete, 
scientific research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following consultations with members of the medical research 
community and those involved in this field the government 
decided, I think correctly, to reform and streamline this process 
by creating the Canadian institutes of health research to 
decentralize the administration of these grants and the funding 
of this research and to make somewhat more accountable and 
perhaps less bureaucratic the structure of these new agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new institutes of health research will have one central 
co-ordinating body or governing council which will consist of a 
president and an advisory board of no more than 20 members.  This 
governing council will be empowered under the bill to appoint a 
scientific director and advisory board for each institute, which 
will deal with particular areas of research, each incorporating 
expertise in their respective fields. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we are pleased to see that the decentralized specific 
advisory boards will be appointed by the governing council and 
not by the cabinet or the government, we are concerned that the 
governing council of the CIHR will be appointed by the federal 
cabinet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a point that we raise in virtually every bill that comes 
before us.  We are as deeply concerned as most Canadians about 
the enormous, largely unchecked power of the Prime Minister 
through governor in council appointments to name political 
friends of the government to sensitive positions throughout the 
entire public service, agencies, crown corporations and the like.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many objective observers have suggested that in Canada our 
executive branch, our Prime Minister and cabinet, exercises more 
power and more unchecked discretion with respect to appointments 
than any other parliamentary or republican government in the 
democratic world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A case in point would be the recent selection by the Prime 
Minister through a governor in council appointment of the 
president of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.  We could 
look to our mother parliament in the United Kingdom where such 
decisions as the appointment of the president of the British 
Broadcasting Corporation are delegated to the board of that crown 
corporation rather than retained and exercised by Her Majesty in 
council.  I would strongly suggest that the government review how 
it could decentralize this appointment process for the governing 
council of the health research institutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the government for its commitment, in the presentation 
of this bill, to spend no more than 4% to 5% of the operating 
budget of the CIHR on administration.  However we would like to 
see some firm guarantees that this will be the case.  It is a 
tragedy when scarce tax dollars are directed toward important 
agencies of this nature and are eaten up by bureaucracy and 
administration.  Too often we see that happen.  One would say 
that it is almost inevitable.  It is almost the result of human 
nature that bureaucracies will tend to grow if given the 
opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I propose that there ought to be a legislated maximum of 
administration costs.  Those administration costs ought to be 
defined and should be verified by the auditor general who is 
answerable to this place.  That would be an important guarantee, 
a step toward reforming agencies of this nature in the public 
sector in general to ensure that the tax dollars we allocate 
actually go to frontline research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is critically important research.  I am glad to see that 
the importance of medical research is recognized by all parties 
and, I would suggest, by all people across the ideological and 
partisan spectra. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes members of the Reform Party are accused of opposing 
government per se and in toto.  It is alleged that we support the 
libertarian night watchman state and see no role for government 
agencies or programs.  I would say, to the contrary, that in our 
last election platform and in our fiscal proposals of the past 
several years we have consistently supported increased funding 
for medical research and frontline real, hard scientific 
research, because we think that government is in a unique 
position to use public resources to finance the sort of research 
that would not otherwise be properly financed through the private 
sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me be on the record as a frugal fiscal conservative in 
saying that even I strongly support the proposed budgetary 
increases from the Medical Research Council to the Canadian 
institutes for health research contemplated in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand that the government has proposed for the fiscal 
year 2000-01 to allocate a budget of some $374 million to be 
increased in the following fiscal year to some $500 million. 
Again we hope that every cent possible will be directed to real 
research of a practical nature rather than to administration and 
overhead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the selection committee estimates that 
approximately 200 more research grants will be awarded under the 
new institutes than will be awarded under the current Medical 
Research Council, which is a positive step forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope this new structure will incorporate the advice and 
active involvement of all so-called stakeholders in the medical 
research field, including academic researchers, researchers in 
the private sector, in pharmaceutical companies and in other 
health care companies, and researchers in government agencies and 
departments.  Working together these various branches of society 
will be able to identify the most important targets for medical 
research.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</b> Madam Speaker, I am pleased 
to take part in the debate on Bill C-13, an act to establish the 
Canadian Institutes of Health Research, to repeal the Medical 
Research Council Act and to make consequential amendments to 
other acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until this summer I was industry critic for my party.  For two 
years, I had an opportunity to see the representatives of 
universities, numerous research centres and of course funding 
councils that came before us.  They came to tell us how 
underfunded research and development was in Canada, and how much 
the funding had dropped in real terms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be important to look at the major trends in the way 
support to health research has been distributed. 
I have here a chart, which I cannot show to the House, but which 
was provided by the Medical Research Council of Canada. It shows 
that in Canada, while funding had been increasing by about 10% 
since 1991, in 1994, shortly after the Liberal Party came to 
office, this funding started to diminish to the point where it 
dropped below zero. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile, the increase was 30% in France and in excess of 40% 
in the United States and in the United Kingdom. Other figures 
show increases of up to 80% in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The council also told us “public investments in health research 
have diminished by 10% since 1985, while they went up by 80% in 
the United States. This gap is increasing every year and is 
leading us straight to conditions that will prevent us from 
attracting the best researchers”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation lasted until just about now. Under these 
conditions, we can only be pleased to finally see money being 
invested in health research and development. Canada is seriously 
lagging behind and cannot make up for lost time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out that, under these difficult circumstances, 
Quebec maintained the same level of funding, while Canada's was 
diminishing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have the figures for the health sector alone, only for 
the whole research component, for the research areas funded by 
the Quebec and federal governments. From 1984-85 to 1996-97, 
federal funding for these sectors dropped from 55% to 37%, while 
funding provided by Quebec remained at 23%.

<A HREF="#LINKT78"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government cut.  We can look at various figures, but 
it cut funding to health research.  The Government of Quebec 
maintained its funding, despite the radical cuts by the federal 
government of up to 40% in education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under these conditions, obviously, and I could not not say this, 
the fact that money has finally been announced for health, is 
good news, excellent news.  It is late arriving, though, but 
better late than continuing on this slippery and dangerous 
slope, which caused research teams to fall apart, with some 
attracted by the United States, not by salaries or lower taxes, 
as has been claimed, but primarily because they could have 
research teams and equipment.  So, well done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, what is the government that has now decided to invest 
in health doing? It is not doing as it did before, that is, 
funding specific projects through the funding councils.  Since 
1993, there has been a new approach, which has now culminated in 
the health research institutes, the corporation created by this 
bill, which will create divisions.  This is not my word, it is 
in clause 20. 
So the CIHR will, in turn, create divisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a number of concerns, the first being the very real 
potential for centralization as the bill now stands.  Of course, 
the government can tell us that that is not the bill's intent. 
It is not what the officials or those who worked on the bill 
intended.  Our responsibility as parliamentarians is to read 
bills, because we are learning that they can always be useful at 
some time or another, and even though the government or the 
minister claims to be acting in good faith, there is always the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, this institute gives sweeping powers to its governing 
council, which will establish divisions.  The bill says that its 
responsibility is to maintain and terminate them, so the power 
is total and absolute, and determine the mandate of each.  The 
council shall create an advisory board for each health research 
institute and appoint the members of the advisory boards, and it 
shall appoint a scientific director for each health research 
institute.  Obviously, the governing council will itself be 
appointed by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Compared to the earlier operating structure, I think it fair to 
say that the bill is trying to improve things.  Nonetheless, the 
autonomy research groups used to have with respect to projects 
is not at all guaranteed in this bill, as I read it.  That is my 
first concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second is that the government is proposing—and this too is 
very clear—that an integrated health research agenda be forged. 
This appears in the objective of the CIHR: “forging an 
integrated health research agenda across disciplines, sectors 
and regions that reflects the emerging health needs of Canadians 
and the evolution of the health system and supports health 
policy decision-making”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result of this objective might even be that the influence of 
this council on the organization could ultimately have an impact 
on health in Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Students will be trained there. Scientists will have their own

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another thing that is very worrisome, namely that the 
provinces are considered just like any other scientist or 
volunteer agency. The government says it will consult them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing is certain, Quebec is not investing enough as it is, 
because of its dire financial situation, but it still invests in 
research and universities. A link must be established between 
the existing teams and the institutes to be created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Which criteria will be used to choose the people who will create 
the institutes? Which ones will be established in Quebec, and 
what will happen to ongoing projects? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill raises all kinds of questions, and I know that our 
distinguished colleague, our health critic, will introduce the 
amendments we will insist on. After the drastic cuts the 
government has made in health research, we are not going to sit 
back; we will ensure that the money goes where it should and as 
it should.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Ref.):</b>  Madam Speaker, 
I am pleased to enter the debate on Bill C-13, an act to 
establish the Canadian institutes of health research and to 
repeal the Medical Research Council Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that health is the number one issue in the 
minds of all Canadians.  It is unfortunate that over the last six 
years since 1993 the Liberal government has slashed $21 billion 
from health and education. It is in a way ironic to be talking 
about health research and new spending because we know it is 
necessary.  I wonder how many people understand and realize the 
damage that has taken place over the last six years with the 
reduction in health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If health is the number one issue, then I ask the government why 
it did that.  Certainly there are ways of reducing the budgetary 
deficit other than cutting $21 billion.  It absolutely does not 
make sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a country we not only promote but brag about our great health 
care system.  Canadians expect good health care.  Canadians also 
expect governments to deliver, to be transparent and to be honest 
in terms of how they govern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It makes sense that good health care cannot exist without good 
research.  Neither can good industries.  Innovation cannot occur 
without good research and development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my own province, health care budget reductions have had a 
profound effect on the health delivery to individual citizens.  I 
wonder if the government realizes the impact it has had on the 
little guy who needs health care, the grassroots Canadian. I know 
very well because I experienced it in my former position as a 
municipal leader.  We had to wrestle with the whole issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provincial governments because of health transfer cuts had to 
find creative ways of delivering health care.  That usually meant 
if we had less money there was less we could do. What is the 
normal course of action for most governments? They consolidate, 
they regionalize, they sell a bill of goods saying that there is 
going to be the same service but at less cost, that it is going 
to be a more efficient system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what happened in Manitoba. The problems that existed 
from the original cutbacks in health are still there today. 
I still meet with municipal leaders and health officials to talk 
about the mess that the health sector is in, certainly in the 
riding of Dauphin—Swan River, and it is throughout the province.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the concerns with this bill is about the patronage 
appointments of people serving on the board.  That is essentially 
what the provincial government did as well.  It had a good 
system.  The people were elected at the local level.  The boards 
were smaller and the hospitals more varied, serving local 
communities, but they were elected democratically.  We went to a 
regional board.  Hon. members can guess how these board members 
were chosen.  They were not elected.  They were patronage 
appointments made by the provincial government.  As it turned 
out, people are still talking about these patronage appointments. 
They really do not represent the people at the local area.  They 
do not know the concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one of the concerns with this legislation.  The 
government continues to appoint people without giving the 
citizens a say.  The bottom line is that the people of this 
country pay the bills.  They should have access to decision 
making. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say the same thing about the heritage portfolio, for 
which I am the chief critic.  Again, my biggest criticism is the 
numerous boards that are appointed by government.  They are not 
appointed by the people they should be serving.  Even if they 
were elected by national organizations, that would be a huge 
improvement.  Even if the government had a part to play, even if 
it advertised to the public that these positions were available, 
that would be better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the recent appointment of the new head of the CBC I made 
that very point.  In fact, the chairman of the CBC board agreed 
that the board should make that appointment, not the Prime 
Minister's office.  Who pays for the operation of the CBC? 
Obviously, the taxpayers, to the tune of about $900 million. Does 
the poor little taxpayer have any say in terms of who should run 
the corporation?  Not at all.  It is unfortunate.  It is not real 
democracy.  It is not grassroots democracy.  It is hidden. It is 
not transparent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My view is that the CBC position should have been advertised 
throughout the country.  There are many well qualified people 
throughout the country who could have applied.  It would have 
been a huge improvement if the CBC board would have done that, 
instead of having the Prime Minister's office or the Prime 
Minister decide who should be the head of the CBC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to enunciate some areas of concern that Reform has about 
Bill C-13.  Although the intent of the CIHR is to foster 
scientific research and promote Canadian initiatives, there has 
been little time to consult various scientific communities, to 
receive input, to scope the areas of research.  Again, this is 
another example of a government bill where an idea occurred and 
the government did not take the time to do the research or 
consult the community.  We know that the expertise is in the 
community.  It is out there.  It certainly does not exist in this 
room.  We are the catalysts that bring people together.  I do not 
know what the rush is.  If we are going to do something, we 
should do it well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the applicants themselves direct the bulk of the research, 
or will the nature of the research be directed by the advisory 
boards, which will force applicants to apply for funding in areas 
dictated by a central body?  That is a good question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the CIHR will strive to ensure that only 4% to 5% of 
the total budget will be spent on administrative costs, the new 
institutes will require a bureaucratic infrastructure to perform 
necessary functions.  Can the CIHR avoid the trend of having a 
huge part of its budget administered for bureaucracy and not have 
sufficient funds to administer the actual research which is

expenditure be sufficient to carry out its entire mandate?  If 
not, will parliament be required to allocate additional funds for 
the creation of this institute?

governing council as to who should be appointed to the advisory

public selection process, but will the president follow the 
advice of the public selection process or bypass these 
recommendations and appoint members based on individual choice? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many good parts to the bill.  It appears to be an 
excellent model for an institute which will remain at arm's 
length from the federal government and conduct research 
independent of the government.  The consultation process for 
appointments will draw on leading experts from every conceivable 
field of expertise, and this should reduce the influence of high 
ranking government officials.  These and other details I have 
mentioned can be addressed before the committee when the bill 
reaches that stage.  There is also a strong need to consult the 
scientific and health communities for input as to the direction 
of the CIHR.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbinière, BQ):</b> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to take part in the debate on Bill C-13 at 
second reading stage. That is fortunate, because this bill needs 
a lot of amendments to be more in tune with the reality of 
Quebec and with the Constitution of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, we know that health is an area of provincial 
jurisdiction. As my hon. colleague for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve was 
saying yesterday, I am in favor of Bill C-13 in principle. 
However, I have some reservations as to its present wording. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ever since I came to the House of Commons, I have had great 
difficulty trusting the Liberal government. In the beginning, we 
always hear the same cassette and see the same scenario. The 
government puts on a great show of democracy and says that it 
respects the Constitution. That is what we hear from the 
politicians opposite and that is the tone we find in the 
Speeches from the Throne, both the one delivered in September 
1997 and the latest one delivered in October 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Actually, what is the federal Liberal government doing? It makes 
itself look good in the media, then interferes in areas of 
provincial jurisdiction. Every time a minister stands up and 
tries to make us believe that the government respects the 
provincial jurisdictions, something just does not sound right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have difficulty understanding what federal Liberal ministers 
and members are saying. 
I remember the bad experience we went through when the social 
union framework was discussed. Fortunately, the Government of 
Quebec did not ratify it. We know the federal government will 
use this document to try to justify its having jurisdiction in 
certain areas when it goes to Seattle next week for the start of 
the World Trade Organization negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also remember the sorry outcome of this social union 
framework. For health care, Quebec got $55 million, while 
Ontario got $1 billion. Because of this social injustice, Quebec 
is going through a difficult period in the area of health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One does not have to look very far. The numerous media reports 
on that subject clearly show the problem comes from Ottawa, 
because the money is in Ottawa. 
The Minister of Finance brags about having managed to eliminate 
the deficit, but any accountant could have done the same. It is 
very easy to grab the money and cut transfers to the provinces.

<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also very easy for a government to have a budget surplus 
when it dips into the employment insurance fund, taking money 
that was paid by workers and employers, as well as into the 
federal employees' pension fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Minister of Finance did is no miracle. These cuts, 
totalling $7 billion, are hurting Quebecers. They are hurting 
seniors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently, I had the opportunity to meet retirees. These people 
are often isolated and alone. They are worried and they are 
stressed out by the idea that they will have to wait a long time 
before getting test results. 
They have to be very courageous when they have to go to 
hospitals and to emergency clinics. All this is caused by the 
Canadian government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now want to get back to Bill C-13. If the federal government's 
intentions were so good, why did it do what it is doing with the 
Canadian institutes of health research? Why did it choose this 
approach? Because it is again taking the centralizing approach 
that implies Canadian standards. Once again, it ignored totally 
the situation in each province, including Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation is completely different in British Columbia, in 
the prairies, in Ontario, in Quebec or in the maritimes. When 
the Canadian constitution was ratified, the Fathers of 
Confederation decided that health would be a provincial 
responsibility. 
The closer the level of government is to the people—the 
provinces are much closer to the people—the better it can 
manage health care fairly. This is not the case at present, 
because we do not have enough money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the consequences. I will quote a few statistics. 
For example, Quebec's current health and social services 
minister, Pauline Marois, is short $1 billion. This represents 
20% of the cost of running all the hospitals in Quebec, accounts 
for the closing of half the hospitals in the Montreal area—and 
I am convinced the statistics would be the same, a little lower 
maybe, for hospitals in the Chaudière—Appalaches region—and is 
equivalent to the cost of caring for 370,000 patients. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, the Government of Quebec is involved in negotiations 
at the present time.  What does one billion dollars represent? 
The salaries of half the nurses in Quebec—and that is a lot of 
money—or the cost of running all the CLSCs.  In his reform, 
Minister Rochon wanted to bring all primary care into the CLSCs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are short of money.  This is twice the cost of all services 
to youth.  This is the result of the federal government's social 
agenda and this is the situation in which the Government of 
Quebec finds itself, $1 billion in the hole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With Bill C-13, this government is trying to make us believe that 
it is going to respect provincial areas of jurisdiction.  That 
is a joke, considering the way the Liberal government is acting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a need for Bill C-13, because if we are to make progress 
as the years go by—and we are on the verge of the third 
millennium—we need money to support all those involved in 
research, particularly those who are seeking preventive 
solutions.  That is the good thing about Bill C-13. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But when we see this government once again wanting to 
appropriate jurisdictions, although it is trying to make us 
believe that it is going to respect Quebec's areas of 
jurisdiction, I have a big problem with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the principle of the bill, but it needs a lot of 
changes.  One need only look at the powers assigned to the 
governing council of this new federal body and the way the 
federal government behaves toward the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I trust that when the debate on second reading of this bill is 
over, we will be in a position to be listened to properly when 
it goes to committee.  I trust that the Liberal members who will 
be around the table will listen attentively and will, once and 
for all, respect the Canadian constitution.

</I></B></P><P align=left>They are very proud of the Canadian constitution, but they have 
a great deal of difficulty when it comes to understanding it, 
reading it and, in particular, respecting it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, there will be the recourses provided by third reading. 
Bill C-13 is good for research and for all those who want to 
advance medicine in Quebec, but the tools for so doing must 
belong to the province of Quebec, since it has jurisdiction over 
health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tools and the regulations relating to Bill C-13 must be clear 
in order to avoid having the federal government once again make 
use of a new institution in an attempt to standardize from sea 
to sea something as basic as this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope they will listen, because we agree with the principle, 
but major changes relating to the mechanisms for implementation 
of Bill C-13 are needed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</b>  Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to enter the debate on Bill C-13.  My 
colleague from the Bloc hopes that Liberal members will listen. I 
hate to give him bad news but I doubt that will actually happen. 
However, we will keep speaking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill goes in the right direction in some areas.  I will 
quote a bit of its preamble wherein it says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas parliament recognizes 
that Canadians value health as central to happiness and 
fulfilment, and aspire to be among the healthiest people in the 
world. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with that and I think all members of the House would 
agree with that.  If that is something the government is 
intending to put into place, and we encourage it to do so, I 
believe it is necessary for it to take actions to back up those 
words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we take a look at the actions of the government going back to 
1993 in the area of health, we see that the government has taken 
money out of the Canadian health care system.  I believe a total 
of about $21 billion in health care and education has been taken 
out since 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Day after day in this place we hear the finance minister refer 
to what would happen if other parties were in power and all kinds 
of statements which deflect the fact that the government must 
stand on its own record.  It is the case for any government that 
it will be judged on what it has done, its actions, what it 
actually delivered, and not just on its words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen time and time again in this place that the 
government will say one thing and do another.  My colleague from 
the Bloc referred to that.  If it can create the perception with 
the general public that it is doing something then it has won the 
battle.  It does not seem to be interested in making the actual 
applications and changes in law that will have a direct impact 
and effect on the end user of any system.  Bill C-13 goes in the 
right direction.  We would like the government to take those 
steps in other areas as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I met with a constituent on Monday this week at home before I 
left to come here who had some really serious questions in the 
area of health care, which is what we are talking about in Bill 
C-13.  He is a young man who was infected with hepatitis C 
through no fault of his own as a result of a blood transfusion. 
He is still a young man.  He told me his story of what this meant 
to him and his family, how he had received a transfusion and 
years later when the issue came out was encouraged by his wife to 
get tested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He put that off, understandably so, because of the ramifications 
that would impact on him and his family if he were to find out 
that he tested positive for hepatitis C.  Finally he did get 
tested and it was found that he had hepatitis C. 
It has totally changed his life and perspective.  I must 
compliment him.  He is still a positive individual who is looking 
for changes in many different areas, particularly with the 
implementation of the new blood system, hoping it does not follow 
on the failures of the old system.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In his letter Peter Madsen asked me if I would relay some 
questions to the Minister of Health on the particular area.  He 
has given me permission to share it with others.  He wrote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does everyone in the HCV compensation package, from the 
lawyers and actuaries and committees etc., get guaranteed money 
except for the victims involved? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to write: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this government is sitting on such a surplus, why is the 
compensation package not guaranteed?  What do you say to the kids 
who may not receive compensation because the money has run out? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are questions on the area of health from my constituent 
who is looking for answers.  He went on to write: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the government going to fight the lawyers $58.5 million asking 
price?  This does not include the victims who must find lawyers 
to access their compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why was money taken out of the HCV funds to compensate 
secondarily infected HIV victims? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He concluded by writing: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Krever called for no-fault compensation...why then is the 
(Minister of Health) putting in as narrow a window as he thinks 
is the area of legal responsibility of the government and using 
this window as legal point to ignore Krever and ignore the 
pre-1986 and post post-1990 people, contrary to Krever? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Madsen had these comments for the Minister of Health.  He 
ended his letter by writing: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This compensation package was rammed down our throats with our 
lawyers telling us that if we don't like it...too bad.  We could 
opt out but then we would have to (a) find a lawyer and (b) wait 
many more years fighting more government lawyers.  This was a 
closed door negotiation process with the victims having no say 
whether they liked it or not. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are questions that one of my constituents asked the 
minister about on that particular area of health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other Canadians who have many pressing questions for 
the government on its delivery of health care.  As I mentioned, 
Bill C-13 goes in the right direction of one particular aspect of 
fixing the system to make it more effective in the area of 
research funding.  If the government could take that same kind of 
approach with the health care system in general, as it has with 
this bill, the opposition would encourage it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While Bill C-13 is not a perfect bill and there are areas that 
could be improved on, it goes in the right direction.  I am 
afraid we cannot say that the Minister of Health is on the same 
track in terms of the overall health care system within our 
country.  There are vast areas for improvement that the minister 
could act on immediately.  We encourage the government to act on 
what Canadians hold so dearly, and that is fixing the health care 
system.  Many times we hear the government say things but not 
back up those words with actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also indicates that parliament is cognizant of an 
historic opportunity to transform health research in Canada.  I 
would argue that same historic opportunity is being presented to 
the Liberal government as well in the area of health care.  It 
has an opportunity to repair the damage that has been done.  Much 
of that damage was inflicted by the government through its 
reduction of transfer payments to the provinces in the area of 
health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has an historic opportunity to make right the wrongs it has 
inflicted on Canadians through its approach and through its 
funding cuts in health.  We encourage the government to look on 
this as an opportunity to make right what is so clearly in need 
of help in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also encourage the government to look at all areas of its 
responsibility and to look for ways to make effective changes 
that set a positive course for Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that is what Canadians are truly looking for from a 
government.  They are looking for a group of individuals who come 
to this place to set out a vision for the country and then act on 
it by putting policies and platforms in place which would have 
the effect of what it says it will do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, if we walk outside this great place and look up 
to the bell tower we see engraved there, not far from where we 
are here, the phrase “Where there is no vision the people 
perish”.  I would argue that the government is lacking in its 
vision in many areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one bill that moves in the right direction, and I 
compliment the government for that, but I would encourage it to 
move in the right direction in more areas than one small one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Liberals will not move forward and make positive changes, 
we will certainly work hard to form the government to make the 
changes necessary to set the country back on its feet again with 
a positive, forward moving vision.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Mitis, BQ):</b> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to participate in the debate on Bill C-13. Since I am 
not the first member of my party to speak in this debate, you 
probably know already that the Bloc Quebecois supports this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our colleague, the member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, who is 
responsible for this issue as the health critic for the Bloc 
Quebecois, already announced that we would be proposing 
amendments. As all the members who spoke before me said, 
regardless of their political affiliation, even if we applaud 
heartily the government's decision to invest in research, we 
have some concerns about how the institutes will be established 
and managed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we applaud investment in research? For one simple reason. 
Since the 1993 election campaign, based on an OECD report that 
blamed Canada for trailing behind in research and development, 
the Bloc Quebecois has been using every opportunity to remind 
the government that it must make major investments in research 
in general, but more specifically in health research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the figures provided to me by my colleague from 
Mercier, whom I wish to thank most sincerely, we can see—and 
there is a very significant table—that research investments made 
in Canada since the Liberal Party came to power in 1993 have 
fallen below zero and are now just over 10%, while they have 
increased by 30% in France, 40% in the United Kingdom 40% and 
80% in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, under our rules and procedures, we cannot show 
this document, but it would be interesting if those watching 
could see how disastrous Canada's actions have been as far as 
investments are concerned since that party took office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Bloc Quebecois dissenting report, presented with the industry 
committee report entitled “Research Funding-Strengthening the 
Sources of Innovation”—a report published recently, in June 
1999—states as follows, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>From 1984-85 to 1996-97, the federal government's share of total 
government funding for the main fields of university research in 
Quebec fell from 55% to 37%, while the Quebec government's share 
remained steady at 23%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Funds from the private sector made up 
much of the difference, as its share increased from 10% to 26% , 
primarily in the form of the partnerships that are the focus of 
the Committee's report.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What information or lessons can be drawn from this situation? 
The Canadian government uses buzz words in its Speeches from the 
Throne—indeed, this was not the first time. It talks of 
managing knowledge. It has bored us stiff with that. For the 
government, managing knowledge means reducing research funds 
invested in the various sectors of research, allowing the 
private sector to invest even more money in research, with all 
the risks that represents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider Monsanto, for example, which sponsors research 
by academics, then says “You have to answer our needs”. With 
this sort of attitude, one has every right to be concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, a look at the proposed organization chart for the governing 
council and the proposed organization for these institutes, we 
once again have a wall-to-wall, Canada-wide institute, which will 
cover all provinces and territories. We are told it will be more 
virtual than real and that it will link researchers within 
information networks. Wholly integrated buzz words, again, but 
what will it mean in reality and what will the result be? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally we are told that the institutes will have to work from 
four perspectives, in each case: basic biomedical activities, 
clinical research activities, health services and systems and 
impacts on society, culture and public health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We might ask what happens with these things.  Let us look at a 
specific example for our viewers, who are wondering what it all 
boils down to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to have some sense of the operations of an institute, 
let us take the example of an institute on ageing.  Its 
multidisciplinary research program could concern the problems 
caused by the ageing of Canadians.  As part of its mandate, the 
institute could work on Alzheimer's disease from biomedical 
perspectives in terms of the molecular mechanisms of Alzheimer's 
disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the clinical field, what are the most effective drugs or 
treatments?  In the case of health services: is it preferable to 
treat someone suffering from this disease in the community, and 
if so, how, or is it preferable to treat them in an institution? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health determinants, the fourth sector, are the societal, 
cultural and health factors involved.  Are there elements of 
lifestyle, environmental factors or dietary factors that 
contribute to disease? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By bringing together researchers working on common goals, the 
institutes will promote creativity, generate new ideas in the 
area of health research and promote strategic policy to take 
Canada into the new millennium.  That is what the government 
says. 
To that end, it is investing $65 million and has already decided 
how it will be allocated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, however, what has this government done?  It has 
cut billions from health care.  It is probably assuaging its 
guilt.  It has been doing so for a while.  It cut nearly $7 
billion, to round off the figures.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Again yesterday and today, the finance minister had the nerve to 
say “We are so generous that we reinvested $11 billion”. 
Hogwash, if members do not mind my saying so, since the 
government had announced it would make further cuts and that $42 
billion worth of cuts were still to come. And now the minister 
is saying “I am so generous, I am so good, I will only cut $33 
billion”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He wants people to believe he is putting money back in when in 
reality the government is still making drastic cuts there is $33 
billion more in cuts to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I am being signalled that my time is about to expire, I 
will say in conclusion that I believe the government is chiefly 
responsible for the difficulties the provinces are experiencing 
in health care. We will see to it, when the time comes for us to 
introduce amendments, that the bill gives a larger role to the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have jurisdiction over health care, and we will defend the 
point of view and interests of Quebec, since Quebec has several 
areas of excellence and we want our scientists' contribution to 
the management of knowledge in Canada and Quebec to be properly 
recognized.

“Finally”, because, since 1994, Canada has been the undisputed 
champion of cuts to research programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a very telling chart which shows that, between 1991 and 
1998, for the United Kingdom, the United States, France and 
Canada, only Canada's investments in health research were lower 
than in 1991. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The figures for 1998 are in. For that whole year, Canada's 
investments were 10% less than what they were in 1991. 
Meanwhile, France increased its investments by 30% compared to 1991. 
The increase over the same period is 40% for the United States 
and 50% for the United Kingdom. 
This is why the Bloc Quebecois is saying “Finally”. Let us not 
forget that, during the 1993 campaign, the Bloc Quebecois 
candidates and their leader asked that more money be put back 
into health research. In 1997, the Bloc Quebecois candidates and 
their new leader asked the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This shows that in politics, tenacity eventually yields results. 
The bill before us is a case in point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1990-91, per capita expenditures in Canada were at $8.71, 
compared to $39.71 in the United States. In 1997-98, per capita 
expenditures in Canada were at $8.23, compared to $66.64 in the 
United States. So, there has been a drop of $0.48 in Canada. We 
are now investing less than in 1991. No wonder there is a brain 
drain. 
Is it because we pay too much tax? Is it for some other reason? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, if we do not invest in health research, health 
researchers will certainly go to places where they can get jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can applaud the principle of this bill. There were examples 
that were quite disturbing. Examples of the number of grants 
that are being given. In British Columbia, for instance, in 
1996-97, there were 31 grants totalling $1.96 million, for which 
there was no follow-up. In Quebec universities, at Laval, there 
were 40 grants, for a total of $2.863 million. 
So there are examples that support the fact that some action 
finally had to be taken.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Our problem is that we realized that this bill, once we had read 
it in detail, requires many amendments. I tried to find where it 
mentioned the provinces and I found, in the mandate of the large 
institute, a reference to the provinces in clause 4. It says 
that in “encouraging health research”, the institute will 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—engage the provinces and voluntary organizations, the private 
sector and others, in or outside Canada, with complementary 
research interests; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the bill does not indicate—and this is rather 
astonishing, since, in Canada, health is a provincial 
jurisdiction—that the research projects will be selected 
according to the goals set by the provinces. Quebec is about to 
implement a science policy, and we would like this bill to 
consider the various aspects of the science policy that the 
government and the people of Quebec will be implementing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current wording of the bill gives us little hope, in this 
regard. I hope some members of the Liberal majority and of the 
other parties will be sensitive enough to amend the legislation 
to make it bearable, in order to avoid absurd situations where 
the federal government would be investing in some areas, while 
the Quebec policy would be supporting other research projects or 
options. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view, that would be totally unacceptable, because Quebec's 
priorities in health research may differ from those of Canada. 
In the past, we have discovered cholesterol problems and genetic 
diseases that may differ widely from what is found in other 
parts of the country. There are population changes and regional 
problems and concerns that may be unique to Quebec or unique to 
other provinces in Canada. In its current form, I do not think 
this bill is to our satisfaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a very specific concern and it has to do with regional 
distribution of health services. 
For example, clause 4, which states the objective, talks about 
“fostering the discussion of ethical issues”. There are 
specialists in this field, in which the Université du Québec à 
Rimouski, among others, has developed an expertise. It has an 
ethics chair and professors who work in this field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is problem, particularly in the research field, and I have 
discussed it with some of our scientists. We must realize that 
getting a research contract is not like buying a chair. There 
are all kinds of representations that are made. Lobbying is an 
integral part of the process, and it is important that 
scientists in the various regions can have their say, the same 
way they would if they were in the national capital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that regard, lessons from the past have shown us that we will 
have to be vigilant and make sure that researchers, wherever 
they are, have an opportunity to get a research contract because 
it is also a development tool. Research contracts create a 
synergy which leads to the creation of other small businesses in 
the area. Small processing operations can get under way after 5, 
10, 15 or 20 years. Hence our concerns in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also think we should make sure that institutes are not 
established in certain sectors without the consent of the 
provinces. We must make sure that, when institutes are 
established, it is done according to the provinces' priorities 
and that the members of the governing council are selected from 
lists provided by the provinces, so that they can be their eyes 
and ears. 
If, for example, a researcher in our region or at Laval 
University or the Université de Montréal is not satisfied with a 
situation or requires a clarification—there is a reference to 
transparency in the bill—there should be a mechanism in place to 
facilitate this. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—ensuring transparency and accountability to Canadians for the 
investment of the Government of Canada in health research. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this to really happen, the members of the governing council 
must reflect the entire Canadian scientific community.  In 
sectors such as health, their names must be provided by the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe what we have before us is a bill that is worthwhile in 
principle. 
I also believe that substantial improvements are necessary to 
make it into a tool for the development of health research in 
Quebec, not just one for the development of health research for 
all of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that a worthwhile outcome is possible.  There is much 
talk of international standards in this bill.  There may be some 
outcomes of global interest to be presented to our international 
colleagues, but we also need outcomes in this country that must

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
explore the questions surrounding federal-provincial jurisdiction 
in the areas of labour law and transportation law as regards 
independent truckers in the province of Quebec. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, on October 8, I was in Louvicourt, 36 
kilometres from Val-d'Or, where I spent the day with Quebec 
truckers to find out about their claims concerning the road 
transportation crisis in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I met Denis Martin and Vital Meilleur, who were representing 
truckers and who told me about commitments that the Quebec 
government made in 1998 but failed to honour. They included 
legislative changes and a promise to put pressure on the federal 
government to amend Canadian laws accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec government made a written commitment to adopt these 
legislative changes by January 1, 2000. I have here a copy of 
these commitments made on October 25, 1998, at 9.45 p.m., and 
signed by two ministers of the Quebec government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One year after these written commitments were made, the 
government of Lucien Bouchard still has not taken any concrete 
action. 
Worse still, the Quebec Minister of Labour, Diane Lemieux, 
announced her intention to postpone indefinitely the long 
awaited labour code reform for truckers in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 8, truckers from Quebec and the Abitibi who were in 
Louvicourt told me that they have had enough of the unfulfilled 
commitments of the Bouchard government. The document was signed 
by two ministers of the Parti Quebecois on October 25, 1998, 
around 9.45 p.m., namely the Minister of Transport, Jacques 
Brassard, and the Minister of Labour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That document includes 11 sections. It provides that a committee 
of experts must be set up. That was done and properly done. The 
Bernier report, a 200 page document, was submitted to the 
government in 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 2 and the following provide: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>2. Explore the questions surrounding federal-provincial 
jurisdiction in the areas of labour law and transportation law.

to the labour relations between independent truckers and 
clients. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>4. Examine the nature of the contractual relations between 
contractors and clients, as they relate to law 430 (division of 
responsibilities). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>5. Define eligibility criteria for becoming an independent 
trucker that will ensure a harmonious transition for the holders 
of bulk trucking permits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>6. Analyse the working conditions of independent truckers, i.e. 
rates, contracting charter, driver pay, hours of work, etc. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that a number of things are now being done anyway. 
Quebec's transport minister, Mr. Chevrette, has set up a 
committee that includes a federal representative.  Committee 
members are working very hard, but the year 2000 is fast 
approaching. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truckers present confirmed to me verbally that they are sick 
of seeing their working conditions deteriorate in Quebec. 
Clients are imposing difficult conditions.  There are also the 
consecutive fuel price increases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about the cost of gas.  On October 13, I rose in 
this House to call on the Government of Quebec to regulate the 
price of gas in Abitibi—Témiscamingue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Constitution gives the provinces the authority to 
regulate prices. 
Only Prince Edward Island and Quebec have taken any action in 
this regard, although Newfoundland announced recently that it 
would look at the statute provisions that would permit it to 
regulate the price of gas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other provinces preferred to rely on market forces as the most 
effective means of determining the appropriate prices, while 
retaining the incentives that contribute to innovation and cost 
reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Quebec has no choice: it will have to rely on 
the market forces and provide incentives for the people of 
Abitibi—Témiscamingue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time for study is past.  It is time to get down to business— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I wish to say that the best way to placate consumers 
is to rely on market forces and provide incentives.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is an example for Abitibi—Témiscamingue:  the wholesale 
price, including the margin of the Montreal refineries, is 25.4 
cents a litre.  Provincial tax represents 15.2 cents, the 
federal excise tax, 10 cents, and the retail profit margin, 5 
cents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transportation, and this is important, because people say the 
cost of transportation to Abitibi is high, costs only 1 cent a 
litre.  The cost without 7% GST and 7.5% PST is 8.2 cents a 
litre.  The total cost at the pump, if competition were vigorous 
and effective in Abitibi—Témiscamingue, a vast region far removed 
from major centres, would be 64.8 cents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 6, the price of regular gasoline was 75.9 cents a 
litre in Val d'Or. 
That contributed to the crisis with Quebec truckers and many 
residents of Abitibi, who considered themselves to be everyone's 
hostages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gas stations in Abitibi have nothing to do with this situation. 
They must submit to the orders of the oil companies and the 
Government of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whatever forces affect the price of gasoline, the people of 
remote areas like Abitibi, James Bay and Nunavik have the right 
to expect fair treatment in the market by the Government of 
Quebec. As of January 1, 2000, the entire trucking industry in 
Canada will be deregulated, and the sector will thus be opened 
up to competition among carriers from all provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bernier report has been submitted to the Government of Quebec. 
The Bernier committee had to concentrate first of all on the 
element it felt was central and essential: the creation of 
scenarios and assessment of their applicability to the 
relationship between owner-operators and customers, as well as 
those elements directly related to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On July 21, 1998, in order to respect its commitments under the 
1995 Agreement on Internal Trade, Quebec replaced its trucking 
legislation with the Loi concernant les propriétaires et 
exploitants de véhicules lourds.  This act relating to the 
owners and operators of heavy equipment harmonizes with the 
federal 
Motor Vehicle Transport Act, 1987, which applies to trucking or 
motor coach companies operating out of province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bulk haulage in Quebec is part of a distinct economic framework 
under the Quebec transport act.  Since 1972, the Canada Labour 
Code has covered independent truckers, as defined in section 3, 
because it considers them employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec and Ontario are among the geographical entities with the 
most bilateral economic exchanges in North America.  In large 
part, these exchanges stem from the considerable growth in 
Canadian exports to the United States and traffic to Ontario as 
an access route to Michigan, Illinois and upstate New York.  For 
Quebec truckers, this increase in interprovincial trucking has 
become an important dividend of the economic deregulation of 
their industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the latest news, an agreement will be reached 
between the Canadian partners of the Quebec transport industry 
to reduce the hours of work of truckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec's independent truckers feel that the reduction in the 
number of hours worked is a good idea from a health and safety 
perspective. However, they are concerned about the impact of 
this piecemeal approach on the income of truckers who own their 
vehicles. If the rate structure remains unchanged, independent 
or exclusive truckers will simply earn less money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec government will have to solve the income issue. It is 
in the process of doing that with a committee set up with the 
FTQ, the CSD and the CSN. The federal government is also 
present. They are trying to find solutions before the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the deregulation of rates and licences, in 1988, it has 
been very difficult for truckers to earn a decent living in the 
Quebec trucking industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the protest and blockade organized by truckers on October 
8, in Louvicourt, I met many truckers throughout the day. The 
important thing is to listen to them. These drivers are always 
alone in their trucks and they travel long distances in Quebec, 
the United States, Ontario, the Atlantic provinces and the rest 
of Canada. They are always alone and they do not have time to 
see all the contracts. It is often their wife who pays the bills 
at home and who takes care of the family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They told me that it is about time solutions be found, because 
the next crisis in Quebec's trucking industry will be serious. 
As we know, there is a project for bulk haulage.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have here the 1997-98 annual report of Quebec department of 
transport, tabled by the minister. It deals with bulk haulage, 
and there is currently a bill on this, Bill C-89.  There will be 
a fight, but solutions must be found. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec transport report states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Together with other Canadian administrations, the federal 
Minister of Transport decided to postpone until January 1, 2000 
the provision of the Agreement on Internal Trade Implementation 
Act (Bill C-19, clause 19), to give truckers enough time to 
adjust to a more open market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments are intended to comply with commitments Quebec 
made recently with other Canadian administrations to permit 
carriers from outside Quebec to truck within Quebec in certain 
sectors, primarily, wood chips and factory supply, since January 
1, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As of January 1, 2000, out of province trucking firms 
may provide carriage within provinces without economic 
restriction. 
In the meantime, the local bulk haulage industry should 
restructure in preparation for deregulation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we see in Bill C-89?  It is no longer deregulation but regulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What counts today is to hear the other political parties and to 
see what they have to say for our friends the truckers when we 
meet them daily on the highway.  And what is important: What are 
the working conditions in Quebec? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec will find solutions, but finding solutions requires 
everyone working together.  I will speak for all the people I

House of Commons to help our friends the truckers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</b>  Madam 
Speaker, Motion No. 130 states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should explore 
the questions surrounding federal-provincial jurisdiction in the 
areas of labour law and transportation law as regards independent 
truckers in the province of Quebec. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First I want to start off by saying that at least to my 
knowledge, this is an area of provincial jurisdiction and I am 
not sure why we would be discussing it in this House.  Second, 
why would we be bringing a motion into the House that is not for 
all of Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every single member in the House has a responsibility to look 
after the interests of Canada as a whole. We should not be doing 
it in a vacuum for just one part of the country.  If there is a 
problem, we should be addressing it for all areas.  There could 
be specific areas, but in my view we should not be phrasing 
something that is specifically targeted to one area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since we are on the issue of labour law, there are lots of areas 
we should be looking at.  If there is a problem with 
transportation in Quebec which comes under federal jurisdiction, 
then we should be discussing it and I would support that.  I have 
to admit I do not know the details, but I understand this is a 
provincial issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me move on to a problem within the labour laws which I think 
we should be looking at.  We just witnessed this on the other 
side of the country on the British Columbia coast.  The ports 
closed because of a labour dispute which was within the federal 
jurisdiction. It cost the entire economy of Canada $85 million a 
day.  That strike of two or three weeks in British Columbia cost 
the economy of this country almost $1 billion.  It did not need 
to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a very simple solution and it is called final offer 
arbitration.  It is something the House should look at some time 
in the near future.  Final offer arbitration will allow 
collective bargaining.  It allows both sides to try to resolve 
the dispute.  That is absolutely necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should do everything we can to reach a negotiated settlement, 
much like the government has said before. The best option for 
everybody is a negotiated settlement. Failing that, if the 
parties are unable to come to a negotiated settlement, it is 
critical that we do not shut down something as vital as our 
ports.  It is not just the $85 million a day, or the $1 billion 
it cost Canada's economy in two or three weeks. 
It also has a long lasting impact on the reputation of Canada and 
people look to other sources.  Instead of the port of Vancouver, 
the busiest port in Canada—

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mrs. Judi Longfield:</b>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  This is all very interesting, but the member opposite 
knows that we are debating Motion No. 130 and, except for the 
first cursory remarks, I have yet to hear anything that relates 
to what is before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</b>  I will caution the 
hon. member to keep the debate pertinent to the motion before the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Gary Lunn:</b>  Madam Speaker, it says the “jurisdiction 
in the areas of labour law and transportation law”.  What did 
not come under transportation, the labour law and federal 
jurisdiction when we looked at the ports dispute?  I do not know 
if I could find something that was more pertinent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am offering is a positive solution to a situation, one 
that may have helped in a situation like this.  I am doing this 
in is a very positive context.  This may offer a solution to 
another situation in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me explain the process of the final offer arbitration appeal 
and apply it to the transportation problem the people in Quebec 
may be facing.  It may help them out.  I will use the other one 
as an example.  If both sides come to an impasse at the end of 
the negotiations that would obviously be the best solution.  If 
they cannot settle the matter, then each side puts its best offer 
on the table.  The employer would give them the package and tell 
them that it was the very best offer it could make.  In this case 
I suppose it would be the truckers who would put their very best 
offer on the table and the arbitrator would be forced to pick A 
or B, nowhere in between.  The advantage to that is that both 
sides would again get to try to negotiate a settlement but they 
would have to be reasonable in their final offers.  If they are 
too far from the line, too far from where they should be, their 
offer would not be selected. The arbitrator would not be allowed 
to cherry-pick those options.  In models where this has happened, 
the offers have crossed over.  In fact, where the employer has 
offered more— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mrs. Judi Longfield:</b>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I will just suggest again that there is no strike.  There 
is no labour unrest at this point.  We are not talking about 
lock-outs or possible strikes, so final offer— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</b>  I am afraid that is 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Gary Lunn:</b>  Let me just remind the parliamentary 
secretary that I am putting a solution forward, unlike the 
government which waits until the problem is upon it and it has 
cost the economy of the country a billion dollars. We should be 
putting up solutions before there is a problem. Here is a 
solution that would help labour, not just in Quebec but right 
across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot believe that the government member opposite wants to 
stand up and raise a point of order that the problem does not 
exist.  Does the government have to wait for the entire country 
to shut down before it acts?  It is incumbent upon us as members 
of this House to put solutions forward before the problem 
happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will summarize the final offer arbitration solution in this 
case.  First, it allows a negotiated settlement, the best 
solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it eliminates the possibility of all strikes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, it forces both sides in any dispute to be reasonable.  It 
will not cost the economy any money because there is no 
possibility of a strike.  Again, it would eliminate strikes 
forever.  It supports collective bargaining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would only hope that government members opposite would listen 
to this rather than act as they did a month ago with the port 
strike and watch the economy collapse.  They watched British 
Columbia and the country lose a billion dollars because of their 
arrogance.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</b> Madam Speaker, I am pleased 
to speak today to Motion M-130 moved by the member for 
Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First I must say that, in some respects, I was very disappointed 
on first reading this motion.  I will read it again now so that 
members will understand why I have a problem with it.  It goes 
as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
explore the questions surrounding federal-provincial jurisdiction 
in the areas of labour law and transportation law as regards 
independent truckers in the province of Quebec. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would it be left only to the government to explore the 
questions surrounding federal-provincial jurisdiction in the 
areas of labour law and transportation law as regards 
independent truckers in the province of Quebec?  Why is there 
always this desire to exclude the opposition parties with 
respect to such important issues?  Why does this government 
always have this condescending attitude to parliament?  Why does 
it want to exclude parliament? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member had given two minutes' thought to the wording of 
his motion, he would have realized that it was unacceptable. 
Parliament and the opposition members, particularly the Bloc 
Quebecois members, have a say on matters as vital as 
federal-provincial relations and transportation law as regards 
independent truckers in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through his motion, the member is automatically excluding the 
opinions and ideas of 44 members who were duly elected by the 
people of Quebec, and this is all the worse because the motion 
is directly concerned with Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, the Bloc Quebecois is in total agreement with the 
spirit of Motion M-130, but it is out of the question that it be 
excluded from the study of the problems mentioned in the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not favour a review by a committee? Why not take the 
opportunity to explore the issues raised by the motion, with the 
help of experts in the field, who would testify before the 
committee? The member for Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik seems to make 
light of the all important issues of Quebec's transportation 
industry and of transportation law as regards independent 
truckers in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us have a closer look at the transportation industry in 
Quebec and Canada. In Quebec alone, trucking is a $6.25 billion 
industry. 
Therefore, members will understand why the issue is far too 
important to be left to the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it is important to mention that under section 92(3) of 
the Constitution Act, 1867, transportation comes mainly under 
the legislative authority of the provinces. This being said, in 
certain regards, the jurisdiction can be shared between the 
federal government and the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since my time is limited, I will focus on federal powers. 
Briefly, the authority of the federal government in the area of 
labour comes from its power to regulate certain matters, which 
are expressly assigned to it under section 91 of the 
Constitutional Act, 1867, or which are expressly excluded from 
the authority of the provinces under section 92. These matters 
are national, international or provincial in nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to the government, the Bloc Quebecois is not making 
light of the trucking industry in Canada. In Canada, trucking is 
an industry worth close to $30 billion, that employs 400,000 
people. Every year, over 20 million trucks cross the border 
between Canada and the United States, and over 70,000 truckers 
are involved in cross-border transportation. Trucks move over 70% 
of the value of the total exports to the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1991, the number of trucking companies whose revenues come 
for more than 40% from cross-border transportation has increased 
by 70%.

<A HREF="#LINKT94"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering the importance of the trucking industry both in 
Quebec and in Canada, it is totally justifiable for governments 
to want to assume their responsibilities. Quebec has assumed its 
responsibilities by initiating a vast reform of its labour code, 
including the status of independent workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the federal government, in its reform of part I of its 
code, preferred to stay away from clarifying the status of 
independent workers. Even though the problems with the trucking 
industry were dealt with at the provincial level in Quebec, let 
us not forget, and I mentioned it earlier in my speech, that a 
great number of truckers are governed by the Canada Labour Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why the Bloc Quebecois is asking that a parliamentary 
committee be set up to conduct a comprehensive study of the 
trucking industry, the never ending jurisdictional problems and 
the status of independent truckers in the province of Quebec. 
The member for Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik cannot be opposed to such 
an idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A consensus already exists among labour unions with regard to 
the fact that legislating at the provincial level only would not 
solve the problem, because trucking businesses and their clients 
would defy such legislation, claiming they are governed by the 
Canada Labour Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Theoretically, the federal definition of a dependent worker 
would allow truckers who qualify under this definition to 
unionize and to negotiate their working conditions through the 
collective bargaining process. 
But they would have to prove they are economically dependent on 
a business, which is almost impossible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that regard, I would like to read an excerpt from the report 
of the committee of experts on the status of trucker-owners, 
which was commissioned by the Quebec ministry of transport, and 
I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, the jurisprudence states that for a trucker to qualify 
as a dependent contractor, the board would have to see economic 
dependence of the trucker on the client. Because truckers can 
work for many different clients, own several trucks and have 
their own employees do the work, the concept of dependent 
contractor does not apply in many cases. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, the federal government will also have to assume its 
responsibilities and set up a parliamentary committee to 
consider these issues. In fact, we know that the labour minister 
has been approached by the executive of the Quebec union, the 
CSD. Unfortunately, as is often the case, the representations of 
the CSD were not all that successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is always the same thing with the government across the way. 
One need only think about our bill on orphan clauses which, by 
the way, was introduced twice in this House. The Government of 
Quebec did live up to its responsibilities and is about to 
legislate on this crucial issue for our young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec has created a parliamentary commission to hear everyone 
and anyone who has something to say about the orphan clauses. 
Quebec is developing a blueprint for our society by legislating 
on these discriminatory clauses. 
Here, in Ottawa, the Liberals refused to even debate our bill on 
orphan clauses. The federal government is much more anxious to 
pass legislation concerning young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many positive elements in the spirit of Motion M-130. 
The Bloc Quebecois totally agrees that the House of Commons, I 
repeat the House of Commons and not, as the hon. member suggests 
in his motion, the government, should explore in committee the 
questions surrounding federal-provincial jurisdiction in the 
areas of labour law and transportation law as regards 
independent truckers in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This study is particularly crucial since, as of January 1, 2000, 
trucking in Canada will be deregulated, allowing competition 
among truckers from each and every province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the circumstances, it is important that the trucking 
industry find a way to promote discussion among the various 
stakeholders and determine the conditions that would help 
truckers do their jobs, while considering the new climate that 
would be created following the upcoming deregulation and the 
increase in competition.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a subject with which I am intimately familiar, so I am 
a bit reluctant to be any more specific than the member was in 
his motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I managed on short notice to obtain an English translation of 
the November 15 press release from the Quebec Coalition of Bulk 
Carriers and Related Business.  The release states that Bill 89, 
recently tabled in the Quebec National Assembly, serves only to 
aggravate the situation between independent truckers and bulk 
carriers and related business.  The bulk carriers' release stated 
that the bill would conscript them into a closed association and 
would create a monopoly.  I can understand how any group of 
independent truckers might feel if faced with competing with a 
monopoly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was also able to obtain a translation of a <I>La Presse</I> 
story, dated October 22, 1999, about a pending agreement between 
partners in the Canadian transportation industry to reduce 
truckers' hours.  At a recent meeting in Los Angeles it was 
agreed that Canadian truckers' hours would be reduced from a 15 
hour day, with 13 hours of driving, to a 14 hour day.  These 
measures were undertaken as a safety precaution against driver 
fatigue.  This is a proposal which involves all provinces and it 
would take some six months to implement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hoped that the U.S. would follow suit with a similar 
arrangement for its truckers.  However, independent truck owners 
have concerns that decreasing the hours without an increase in 
their income would only force independents to try to live with 
less income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, bulk carriage truckers of the Quebec Professional 
Truckers Association feel that simply improving the hours without 
addressing the income issue would only force drivers to drive 
faster or carry heavier loads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is, since the deregulation of rates and 
licences, it is hard to make a living in the trucking industry. 
The professional truckers feel that a round table among the 
stakeholders in the trucking industry, including the various 
levels of government, is the way to seek a resolution.  Perhaps 
the member is suggesting in his motion that we explore this area 
of federal-provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fast, efficient and safe trucking is essential to the continued 
prosperity of the whole North American economy.  Reaching this 
goal must involve the U.S. government, the Canadian government, 
the governments of the provinces and the various sectors in the 
trucking industry.  To the extent that the member's motion will 
foster constructive debate and problem solving in the trucking 
industry, including independent truckers, I think we should 
support the motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK251"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mrs. Judi Longfield (Whitby—Ajax, Lib.):</b>  Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to speak to Motion No. 130.  The motion presented by 
the hon. member for Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik calls upon the 
Government of Canada to explore federal-provincial jurisdictional 
issues in the areas of labour law and transportation law as they 
pertain to independent truckers in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is obviously very concerned about the recent 
protest actions of Quebec truckers and I understand his concern. 
I wish to commend him for bringing forward this motion.  I agree 
that the issues being raised by the Quebec truckers are serious 
and ought to receive serious consideration by members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I have some problem with what the member is seeking to 
achieve by way of his motion.  I wonder, too, if the motion is 
premature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps some historical background to the actions of the Quebec 
truckers would be helpful.  About a year ago Quebec truckers 
started to blockade major highways in the province and border 
points with New Brunswick, Ontario and the United States.  The 
truckers, mainly local bulk operators, were protesting the 
upcoming deregulation of the interprovincial trucking industry. 
They were also protesting the deregulation requirements of the 
NAFTA, rising fuel prices and their inability to negotiate wages 
and working conditions.

<A HREF="#LINKT96"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response, the PQ government agreed to set up a committee of 
experts to study the industrial relations questions raised by the 
truckers.  This committee was headed by a widely respected 
industrial relations professor and included representation from 
the parties involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were renewed blockades in September and October 1999, 
after which the PQ minister of transport, Guy Chevrette, 
announced that round table discussions would be held to bring all 
parties together.  Surprisingly, the PQ minister also said that 
80% of the truckers, that is, 8,000 of the 10,000, fall under 
federal jurisdiction.  How he arrived at this conclusion is not 
clear, and is not correct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should also be noted that major unions in Quebec have 
undertaken organizing drives among the truckers.  Apparently, 
about 30 certification applications have been received by the 
Canada Industrial Relations Board from the Teamsters and the 
Confédération des syndicats nationaux, or CSN. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From this brief historical view we learn two things.  We learn 
first that Quebec truckers have legitimate grievances regarding 
the deregulation of the trucking sector, regarding their labour 
relations status and regarding rising fuel prices.  We learn 
second that a process has been established to address their 
grievances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a process has in fact been set out to study the truckers' 
concerns, would it make sense for the Government of Canada at 
this time to launch the kind of examination suggested by my 
colleague's motion?  I think not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may be that at some future date such a study ought to be 
undertaken, but I do not think the government would be doing 
anything useful if it were to accept the hon. member's suggestion 
at this point.  It is better to let the process already 
established run its course and see where it leads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to speak for a moment on the industrial relations aspect 
of this matter.  There are at least two significant industrial 
relations questions.  The first concerns federal jurisdiction 
over labour relations and working conditions encompassing any 
undertaking that connects a province with another province or 
extends beyond the limits of a province.  The Canada Labour Code 
makes this very clear.  Quebec truckers, when they travel to New 
Brunswick, Ontario or the U.S., fall under federal jurisdiction 
and, contrary to Minister Chevrette's contention, we do not yet 
know how many Quebec truckers do this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, in his motion the member uses the phrase “independent 
truckers” to refer to the protesting truckers.  Again, we do not 
yet know who are the independent truckers and who are dependent 
truckers.  The Canada Labour Code states that the definition of 
employee includes dependent contractors, and the term dependent 
contractor includes owner-operators of trucks who work under 
contract to employees in the federal jurisdiction.  The code 
permits employees, including dependent contractors, to unionize 
for the purpose of negotiating the terms and conditions of their 
employment with their employer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, truck drivers who are self-employed and who 
are independent owners of their vehicles are not considered to be 
employees under the federal labour code and therefore cannot 
benefit from its provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are two key issues that must be sorted out if a durable 
solution acceptable to all stakeholders is to be found.  The 
member for Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik and I, I am sure, are in 
agreement here.  Where we differ is how to sort out what is being 
done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view, the Canada Industrial Relations Board is the 
appropriate body to determine whether a person is a dependent or 
an independent contractor and whether he or she is working for an 
employer in the federal jurisdiction.  As I mentioned, there are 
about 30 certification applications from Quebec unions being 
reviewed by the board.  I have great confidence in the board's 
capacity to come up with the right decisions on these 
applications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee of experts which was established by the PQ 
government, to which I referred earlier, submitted some important 
recommendations regarding industrial relations in the trucking 
sector.  The PQ government will need to consider these 
recommendations very carefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee recommended that the right of association be 
granted to owner-operators and that the Quebec labour code 
recognize the self-employed truckers' right of association. Also, 
this committee recommended that round table discussions be held 
to study the problem of the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two sessions have already been held and it appears that all 
stakeholders involved in the trucking sector are prepared to work 
hard to come up with ways to address their issues. 
Representatives from Transport Canada and the labour program of 
Human Resources Development Canada were present, as were 
representatives from the union and major trucking associations. 
This group is expected to issue a report on its deliberations 
next month.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I am trying to stress is simply that a two track 
process is already in place that deals with the legitimate 
concerns of my hon. friend.  We have the CIRB process and the 
process set up by the PQ government.  Perhaps I could prevail 
upon my colleague to be a bit more patient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I shall end by commending my friend and colleague for bringing 
forth his motion and drawing our attention to the problems of 
Quebec truckers.  It seems to me that at this time all that 
should be done is being done.  I do not think that further 
federal involvement is called for at this point, but like the 
member I shall be following the matter very closely and will call 
for additional federal action should it further warrant.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</b> As no other member wishes to 
speak, I will now give the floor to the hon. member for 
Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik for his right of reply. This will put an 
end to the debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK252"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik, Lib.):</b> Madam 
Speaker, I am very happy to see that opposition members are here 
to comment on my motion, even at this late hour, which means 
that there are good things in there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party's position is that this is a provincial matter. 
There is one thing I should say from the start. On October 25, 
1998, two Quebec ministers signed an agreement with truckers 
when we had the first crisis, the first blockade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point in this agreement talks about assessing the 
problem of the federal-provincial jurisdictions in labour law and 
transport law. The agreement was signed by both Minister 
Brassard and Minister Rioux. These two ministers told the 
truckers “Both sides must reassess the problem”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But coming back to federal-provincial matters, on October 8, I 
was on the picket line with the truckers. On October 10, I was 
watching the RDI network when I saw my good friend Guy 
Chevrette, just back from Europe, make the following statement 
“You should go to the federal government. The trucking issue is 
a federal matter”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that my good friend Guy Chevrette— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mrs. Monique Guay:</b> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. This is 
supposed to be a federal issue, but the member is talking only 
about Quebec. If he wants to debate it in the national assembly, 
I have no problem with that, but we are here— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Thibeault): </b>Order, please. I do not 
think this is a point of order, and we are getting into debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Guy St-Julien:</b> Madam 
Speaker, I understood what the hon. member said earlier. They 
have millionaires living in the Mont-Tremblant and upper 
Laurentian regions.  We do not in Abitibi. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois member voiced her disappointment with my 
motion, and said I should have taken a couple of minutes to 
think about it.  The fact is that I took four. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have here remarks made by Guy Chevrette on RDI on October 10 
or thereabouts. He said “Go to the feds. They are the ones 
concerned”.  I have notes here on my desk.  I understand that he 
is a good pitcher because he has thrown a strike ball to the 
federal team.  He also indicated that out of the 10,000 truckers 
concerned, 8,000 were subject to federal legislation and these 
ought to approach Ottawa to find some ways of getting around 
their inability to negotiate with their employer. I have notes 
on this here and it is important to know this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that the member for Laurentides would want all 
members to get involved. I agree with what she said about the 
need for a committee to be struck.  That is a good point.  But I 
did not appreciate her saying that I ought to have given it two 
minutes' thought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the current situation, it is impossible to confirm that 80% 
of the truckers in question come under the jurisdiction of the 
federal government until the Canada Labour Relations Board has 
finished its investigation and dealt with the demands of the 
third parties currently before it, which are to have Quebec 
truckers granted union certification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The board will have to determine whether the truckers are 
employees, dependent contractors or independent contractors and, 
in the first two instances, if their employer is governed by 
federal legislation.  Demands are being investigated and the 
date of the board's response is not known. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing is really important. 
We must stand by the truckers. I appreciate the comments made by 
my colleagues tonight, even though we may disagree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, we could deal with the concerns of the truckers about 
working conditions, for instance, higher pay through collective 
bargaining, if union certification were granted, but there is 
nothing we can do, at the labour relations level, about the 
price of gasoline and the deregulation of interprovincial 
trucking as of January 1, 2000, pursuant to section 19 of the 
Agreement on Internal Trade Implementation Act.

Madam Speaker, the government has repeatedly refused to face the

</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to what one of my colleagues in the House proclaimed 
last week during the debate on Bill C-11 that unemployment rates 
were declining in Cape Breton, the reality of the matter is that 
unemployment is rising in Cape Breton with unofficial rates of 
over 30%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's best effort to create jobs has been to 
encourage the conditions that often create low paying, part time, 
contractual jobs with no benefits.  Nova Scotians are falling 
deeper into poverty with the average poor family living almost 
$6,000 below the low income cutoff level.  The Nova Scotia report 
card issued yesterday by Campaign 2000 reports that 67.8% of 
families without full time, full year employment are living in 
poverty.  The same report card states that Nova Scotia children 
are doing better than the average Cape Breton child.  Thanks to 
the Liberal government's generous cuts to EI benefits, less than 
half of Nova Scotians who are unemployed receive EI benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly, the government's inability to act has been the only 
consistency in the lives of the children of Cape Bretoners since 
1993.  We continue to face a crisis of increasing proportions. 
Coastal communities have suffered greatly from the devastation of 
the ground fishing industry.  Devco's being shut down has already 
caused the loss of well over 1,000 direct jobs.  Rural Cape 
Bretoners are being stripped of jobs, the most recent example 
being the reallocation of HRDC jobs from Port Hawkesbury to more 
urban areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the reality the children of Cape Breton face every day: 
poverty, job losses, a government that just does not care. What 
else could possibly explain why Cape Bretoners have been made 
into economic refugees at the hands of their own government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government would have us believe that the road show 
masquerading as a fair and fully participatory panel that is to 
decide the future of Cape Breton is somehow going to make 
everything rosy again.  The government cannot really expect that 
the people of Cape Breton will accept this rushed and obviously 
partisan panel as an appropriate response by the government that 
is legally obligated to take all reasonable measures to reduce 
economic hardship. This crisis will not be solved overnight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that the policies of the government continue to put their 
parents out of work, what other message does this send to the 
sons and daughters of Cape Bretoners except that in the eyes of 
the Liberal government they just don't count?

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Natural Resources, Lib.):</b>  Madam Speaker, the future of all 
families in Cape Breton will be brighter as a result of the steps 
the government has taken to build a solid foundation for 
tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the transfer of the responsibilities of the industrial 
development division of Devco to Enterprise Cape Breton 
Corporation in 1988, Devco's sole focus became coal mining.  At 
about the same time, successive governments began mandating Devco 
to attain commercial viability.  Unfortunately that goal was not 
attained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has initiated a process to reshape the coal 
mining industry on Cape Breton island with the objective of 
maintaining up to 500 jobs in a commercial private sector coal 
mining business.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-11, the bill to provide Devco with the authority to sell 
its operations is now before the House.  I would like to note 
that the member for Sydney—Victoria has indicated that there are 
some good things in the Devco divestiture bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Passage of this bill and the finalization of a sale will remove 
uncertainty about the future of coal mining in Cape Breton.  Most 
important, finalization of a sale will also confirm the 
continuance of good solid coal mining jobs in a commercial 
private sector operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to look beyond coal mining.  Since 1967 the 
federal government has provided over $500 million to diversify 
the Cape Breton economy, first through the industrial development 
division of Devco and beginning in 1988 through the Atlantic 
Canada Opportunities Agency and Enterprise Cape Breton 
Corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the government continues to invest about $20 million 
annually in economic development on Cape Breton through ACOA and 
ECBC.  The goal is and will continue to be to diversify the Cape 
Breton economy beyond coal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to this, we have allocated another $68 million to 
fund sustainable economic development initiatives in Cape Breton. 
The province of Nova Scotia is providing an additional $12 
million for the same purpose.

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Ref.):</b>  Madam Speaker, 
when I asked the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food how he 
would transfer the money for farmers in crisis from the cabinet 
table to the kitchen table, he responded by saying “All the 
money will go through the process and the farmers will get it”. 
Unfortunately, the process the minister has faith in does not 
work and the money has not flowed to the farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifty-nine per cent of Manitoba farmers who applied for AIDA 
were rejected.  Close to 3,000 claims remain unprocessed.  How 
can the minister believe that his process is working? 
Three-quarters of the AIDA money is still in government coffers 
and not in the hands of farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers in my riding are crying for help.  They are farmers like 
Phil Lewis from Minnedosa who said “AIDA is a wild card and 
banks do not like it”.  He has had 900 unseeded acres this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>David Hamlin from Miniota said “We have been farming since 1972 
on a family farm established since 1910.  I will have to go out 
and get a job to stay afloat”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dorothy Andrew from Rossburn, Manitoba said “Another machinery 
dealer was here today and he wasn't here to offer a decrease in 
the payments on the machinery”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Walter Stadnyk of Grandview said “Our forefathers worked hard 
to create the family farm.  My two sons want to farm but won't be 
able to.  It cost me $500 to fill out the AIDA forms and I was 
rejected”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maggie Creber from Newdale said “We the farmers are in trouble. 
We have no crops in and what was seeded at this date has very 
little chance to be a good crop.  We are looking for aid and we 
shouldn't have to beg for it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>George Guley of Ethelbert said “AIDA does not work”.  He did 
not qualify and he cannot get work.  What are producers like him 
expected to do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cam Flett from Angusville said “Many of your government grants 
are a terrible waste of money.  The plight of farmers, health 
care and education are far more important and should be 
recognized as such”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ross Matheson from Decker, Manitoba said “No farmer wants to 
have to beg our government for subsidies, but the economics 
producers face are seemingly impossible”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Herbert Christian from Kenville said “The AIDA formula does not 
recognize the extreme need of farmers who have had depressed 
incomes for several years”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I end by saying that John Puchailo from Grandview said that he 
is afraid that there will be a full-blown civil revolution to 
clean out the government because it just does not listen or care 
about the west. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that farmers in Dauphin—Swan River and in the 
west need help.  We need to take away the politics.  Let us help 
those Canadians who need help. Premier Romanow and Premier Doer 
came to Ottawa asking for help and were denied. What will it take 
for this Liberal government to help the farmers in crisis?

</I></B></P><P align=left><b>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Natural Resources, Lib.):</b>  Madam Speaker, the changes the 
government has introduced to the AIDA program will benefit many 
producers across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will now be covering negative margins.  Negative margins 
occur when a farm has a particularly bad year and the operation 
has insufficient revenues to cover variable costs like fuel, 
machinery repair and chemicals.  These due dollars will go to 
those farm families that need help to cover their variable costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will also help farmers to get through these tough times is 
that they now have the option to make a one-time choice in 1999 
of the reference period on which the payment calculation for AIDA 
is based.  They will be able to choose either the previous three 
years or three of the previous five years where the high and low 
income years are not counted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will be a real help to farmers as they will not need to 
count a low income year they may have had due to flooding, 
drought, or some other occurrence beyond their control.  This 
will provide better stability and more effective support to those 
farmers who find themselves in this type of situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, we are committed to having all processing of the AIDA 
claims completed by Christmas in provinces where the federal 
government delivers the program, as is the case in Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As of today, November 25, the total value of AIDA payments in 
Manitoba is $33.7 million.  These program changes and the total 
amount of money to be paid out by Christmas will help the farmers 
get through the tough times the hon. member referred to.
