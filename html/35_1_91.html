closed doors, hidden agendas and business as usual?

	In spite of Lasmo's attempts to justify the hiring of only 12

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="REPORTOFFINANCECOMMITTEE">REPORT OF FINANCE COMMITTEE</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, a few hours after it was tabled, the report of the Liberal 
members on the finance committee was resoundingly rejected 
by several provinces, including Ontario and Manitoba.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance both quickly 
distanced themselves from this proposal to implement a hidden 
GST that would integrate the provincial sales taxes. In other 
words, the Liberal report has already been shelved.
<P>
	Now that the government has returned to square one by 
disowning the Liberal members' report in that way, can the 
Minister of Finance tell us what alternative to the GST he 
intends to submit to the federal-provincial conference of 
finance ministers scheduled for next week?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, the 
Leader of the Opposition is wrong. I have in front of me quotes 
from Newfoundland's finance minister, Winston Baker, who 
says that he is in favour of beginning discussions; so is Allan 
Maher, New Brunswick's finance minister.
<P>
	I must tell you that the Leader of the Opposition quoted Mr. 
Rae. I have Mr. Rae's exact words, which I will quote in English 
since he spoke English.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Rae said he was willing to work with Ottawa to replace the 
tax, we have a tax that is like sharing a bedroom with a gorilla, 
so if we can have any suggestions as to how to move the gorilla 
out of the bedroom I would be happy to discuss that.
<P>
	I have not had a lot of experience with gorillas in 
bedrooms-I would interpret that it may well be difficult-but I 
believe the premier of Ontario was saying he is prepared to 
co-operate.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the question is who is the gorilla? I strongly suspect it 
is the Minister of Finance, and I do not like having him in my 
bedroom.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I ask the Minister of Finance if he recognizes 
that the provinces' negative reaction-he knows that they are 
against it-to the GST replacement proposed by his Liberal 
colleagues from whom he seems to be dissociating himself now 
is a new blow to his government in its relations with the 
provinces, which have already rejected social program reform, 
the national health forum and interprovincial trade negotiations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, I know I speak on behalf of Mr. Rae. I 
know that in my case and in his case either one of us would 
rather share a bedroom with a gorilla than each other.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, it is very clear. The finance committee's 
report- I must congratulate the members of all parties who 
were on that committee. I think that they heard 500 witnesses, 
they read at least 500 briefs; in any case, they received a lot of 
people. I think that they did an outstanding job and we will 
certainly accept it as a basis for discussions with the provinces.
<P>
	I believe that the main recommendation, namely 
harmonization with the provinces, is something that 
everyone-that is, the business community and 
consumers-wants.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, given the refusal to merge the GST and provincial 
taxes, a merger that is contrary to the  provinces' fiscal 
autonomy, does the Minister of Finance not admit that the best 
way to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5724"> 5724 </A></B>

correct the present situation and simplify the present confusion 
is to abolish the GST and transfer this taxation field to the 
provinces, as the Bloc Quebecois suggests?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I said yesterday, it 
must be said that the Chamber of Commerce of Metropolitan 
Montreal wants the two taxes to be harmonized, as do the 
Quebec Chamber of Commerce, the Quebec manufacturers' 
association and the PQ candidate, but not the member.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	I must tell you that it is clear for the Conseil du patronat that 
most of the interested groups and individuals in Quebec want 
harmonization; most of them do not agree with the Bloc 
Quebecois on that and on everything else as well.

<P>
	While Ottawa and the provinces had promised to conclude an 
agreement on interprovincial trade liberalization by June 30, 
negotiations now appear to have broken down. According to the 
daily <I>La Presse</I>, the federal negotiators are even talking about a 
possible failure of negotiations if several provinces start asking 
for more and more exceptions.
<P>
	My question is as follows: As negotiations are continuing in 
Toronto today, can the Deputy Prime Minister confirm that these 
negotiations have stalled because several provinces want to 
preserve the ability of their government corporations to 
intervene?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister

answered his own question, stating as he did that negotiations 
are continuing as we speak. Naturally, if they are continuing, 
this means there is no breakdown.

part in very many negotiations.
<P>
	I will nonetheless put this supplementary question to her: Will 
she confirm the ministerial statement to the effect that the 
federal government is now contemplating not signing an 
agreement it considers flawed? Does this failure not confirm yet 
again the inability of this government to negotiate with the 
provinces?

March in this House invited me to bring to his attention 
excessive use of time allocation and closure.
<P>
	I would like to share some quotes with the House on the 
subject of closure. The member for Ottawa-Vanier said that it 
was far from being democratic. The member for Winnipeg St. 
James called it a draconian device. The member for Kingston 
and the Islands said it was morally wicked. These are quotes 
from Liberal members who now sit on the other side of the 
House.
<P>
	Does the government House leader concur with his 
colleagues' description of closure mechanisms?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the comments quoted are quite relevant when there is excessive 
use of closure.
<P>
	Unfortunately for the hon. member's question what happened 
yesterday was not closure. We used the time allocation rules of 
the House and they were not used to force a decision on the 
House. Instead they were voted by a majority of the parties in 
this House, plus the NDP. That is democracy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, several amendments were brought forward in this 
House and received almost no debate as result of closure 
motions, time allocation and closure, I might add.
<P>
	Members of the current government when they were in 
opposition consistently maintained that these activities were 
contrary to democracy and the free operation of this House. Now 
we have the same members over there defending the use of 
closure to rush bills through the House before they have 
received adequate and normal public exposure or scrutiny.

fictitious chapter entitled ``Governing with Integrity''. ``This 
erosion of confidence in government seems to have many 
causes, including an arrogant style of political leadership. The 
people are irritated with governments that do not consult them 
or that disregard their views, or that try to conduct key parts of 
public business behind closed doors''.
<P>
	The government campaigned on restoring honesty and

explain where is his government's integrity after the 
unprecedented action last night of imposing closure and time 
allocation on no less than four pieces of legislation-

yesterday. They were available publicly days, if not weeks, 
before yesterday. The Yukon bills were studied for over 20 hours 
in committee.

very clearly that the transition to the private sector, which will 
happen given all the changes in military activities around the

<P>
	It is being reported today that the secretary of state has said 
that the government will release an economic statement in

Reformers have been demanding such action for months and 
wish to be assured that this statement accurately reflects the 
position of the government.
<P>
	Do the remarks of the secretary of state mean that today the 
government is prepared to tell investors, taxpayers and lenders 
in clear language, yes, we will announce deeper spending cuts in 
September?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions)):</B> Mr. Speaker, the quote was not quite 
accurate. There was no promise or suggestion of a mini budget.
<P>
	For the hon. member's knowledge I reiterated the budget 
promise made last February that an economic statement would 
be made this fall, as we promised, at the beginning of our 
consultation process with the people of Canada leading to the 
February 1995 budget.
<P>
	If the hon. member had read the budget in February 1994 he 
would know that is not very much news. That is exactly what 
was said.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
these kinds of statements and the earlier statement just add to 
the mixed signals and the uncertainty to which the market is 
reacting.
<P>
	This is the government's last chance before the summer 
recess, the last chance to stop dancing around on spending cuts 
and deficit reduction. It is the last chance to come down hard on 
the side of deeper spending cuts in order to cope with the deficit.
<P>

representatives from the minister's department met various 
organizations representing francophone and Acadian 
communities to confirm new cuts in federal subsidies and to try 
to make adjustments in the department's relations with these 
organizations.
<P>
	However, the approach proposed by the department was 
judged to be unacceptable, and I would like to quote what was 
said by the spokesperson for the Coalition franco-ontarienne, in 
referring to the government's discussion paper: ``We realized it 
failed to mention the issues we wanted to discuss. We want a 
comprehensive policy that respects the principles of the 
Charter''.
<P>
	Would the Minister of Canadian Heritage, who claims to 
defend the rights of francophones from the Atlantic to the 
Pacific, confirm that his discussion paper was rejected by the 
Coalition franco-ontarienne?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, perhaps I should set the record straight. It is not exactly 
news to say now that there are budget cuts. Of course there are 
budget cuts. Just read the last budget brought down by the 
finance minister.
<P>
	The purpose of our dialogue with francophone communities is 
to see how we can decentralize our administration to give them 
more authority and a chance to identify their needs so they can 
better serve the communities they represent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
spokesperson for the Coalition franco-ontarienne also said that 
the government was cutting down to the bone.

	How can the minister make substantial cuts in subsidies to

francophones, before deciding on a comprehensive 
development policy for francophone and Acadian communities, 
which is on the drawing board in his department?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage): </B>I do 
not think we have to undertake a fundamental review of this

we will pursue them. What is on the drawing board today is how 
we can improve and add to these policies.

Yesterday the government acknowledged that higher than 
expected interest rates are impacting on the government's 
budget projections but he said that this would be offset by higher 
than expected revenues.
<P>
	We know that higher interest rates are already impacting on 
the economy and on consumer spending. I ask the Minister of

could slow economic growth and put off his revenue projections.

	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister

what the secretary of state said earlier.

will release a comprehensive statement that will clearly lay out 
changes in the economic and fiscal outlook since the last budget. 
Economic scenarios for the future will be put forward and the 
government's economic and fiscal goals and broad proposals 
and how they might be achieved in the next budget will be made

	Mr. Speaker, everyone knows that the real problem is federal 
management and that a $500 billion federal deficit is not one of 
the benefits of federalism.
<P>

convince the people of Quebec and the rest of Canada that his 
government will not bankrupt this country?

their friends.

	What we intend to do is precisely what the Prime Minister has 
said repeatedly. In fact, if there is something Canadians are very 
confident that we will provide, it is good government. We will 
and we do. And this will be made obvious in our statement in 
September. This is as clear as the fact that the real reason our 
debt is so high is because of irresponsible statements on the part 
of certain people that have caused interest rates to soar.

This week, he added bilingualism to his department's concerns

<P>

such service from the Quebec City terminal control unit, which 
the minister stubbornly wants to shut down next month?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
if someone is being stubborn in the House today, it is certainly 
not the Minister of Transport. We are trying to explain to our

the safety of the air navigation system in Quebec and the rest of

<P>
	We are doing our best, with the technology that is available to

every means at our disposal, and I hope the hon. member does

	They said: ``We don't have to bring in an alternative because 
we are going to eliminate the deficit within three years'', and

	<B>Mrs. Jane Stewart (Brant):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is for 
the Solicitor General.
<P>
	Recently the Minister of Justice tabled amendments to the 
Young Offenders Act and a sentencing reform bill that clearly 
indicated that this government will support increased 
community based crime prevention and rehabilitation 
strategies.
<P>
	I am concerned however about earlier decisions to change 
federal funding to our local partners, like the St. Leonard's 
Society, that may jeopardize their ability to help us meet this 
goal.
<P>
	Would the Solicitor General please review these funding 
strategies and assure this House that our local partners will be 
able to maintain and enhance their community based custodial 
and non-custodial criminal rehabilitation programs?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
like the hon. member I believe that organizations such as the St. 
Leonard's Society in places like Brantford and Windsor and 
many other parts of the country do very good work.
<P>
	I want to assure the hon. member that Correctional Services 
Canada will be working with voluntary agencies across the 
country over the next number of months to review and refine 
funding structures as well as standards of service delivery. I 
would be happy to have her suggestions as to how this review 
can be carried out in the best interests of these organizations and 
the communities they serve.

	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (Lotbinière):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Liberal 
Party of Canada teamed up with the previous government on the 
late Charlottetown Accord. The Liberal government, for its part, 
has still not said whether it intends to reimburse Quebec for the 
$26 million taxpayers paid twice for this referendum. That is 
probably the new type of harmonization this government carries 
out on the backs of the provinces.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs not admit 
that, before getting into a new, hypothetical referendum 
scenario to put Quebec in its place again, the federal government 
should pay off its debts before anything else?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to reaffirm that the federal government 
takes its responsibilities by trying to  reconcile its views with 
those of the provinces every time it is required.
<P>
	The Canadian debt problem must be solved in co-operation 
with the provinces, and we will continue our efforts to solve this 
problem with the kind of co-operation shown in the past.

	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	Recently the people of Saskatchewan and other Canadians 
saw a dramatic and unexplained increase in the price of 
gasoline. Gasoline prices have gone up despite no tax increases, 
despite no increases in inflation, despite no increase in the price 
of crude year over year, and despite the fact that major oil 
companies announced substantial increases in profits.
<P>
	Given the above, has your government referred my requests 
for an investigation into gasoline pricing-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. The hon. member would please put his 
question to the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solomon:</B> Mr. Speaker, my question through you to the 
Deputy Prime Minister, has the Government of Canada referred 
my request for an investigation into gasoline pricing to the 
bureau of competition policy? If so, when will it be reporting 
back to Canadians on this matter? Will you consider setting up 
an energy price review commission to review all gas price 
increases in all regions of Canada to protect Canadian 
consumers-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. The hon. Minister of Natural Resources.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, let me say in response to the hon. member's first 
question that I have not referred that question to the bureau of 
competition. That is a question I will ask the Minister of 
Industry to take under advisement.
<P>
	Let me say in response to the second question of the hon. 
member that the answer is simply no.

<P>
	This process has been ongoing in Canada for more than 20

	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre)</B> Mr. Speaker, I move that the

the House on Monday, June 20, 1994 be concurred in.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. Could the Chair 
please clarify what the intent of this motion is.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It is that the ninth report 
of the Standing Committee on Finance presented to the House on 
June 20, 1994 be concurred in.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, with respect to the ninth report of the 
Standing Committee on Finance regarding replacing the GST 
and options for Canada, there are two issues I would like to 
address and I will also present the Reform Party's plan for tax 
reform.
<P>
	The two issues I would like to address on this motion are the 
Liberal red book promise and the Liberal campaign election 
promise. There is a distinct difference between the two and this 
government is now attempting to confuse the Canadian public 
by putting the two together.
<P>
	First, with respect to the red book campaign promise, the 
Liberals promised in that book, and it is there for everybody to 
read, to replace the GST with a simplified tax, more fair to small 
business and harmonized with the provinces.
<P>
<B>(1515 ) </B>
<P>
	The government is going to call this the new national value 
added tax but it is nothing more than a Christmas wish list. The 
government has made no hard proposals, only various options 
for provinces to consider, for Canadians to consider. It shirks its 
responsibilities by coming out one way or another on anything 
that is within the proposal. All decisions are left for the 
provincial governments to make. It is trying to sell the perfect 
tax world. If the provinces do not go along they will be the ones 
blamed and the federal government will claim that it has done 
the proper thing based on a report from a committee.
<P>
	I have two colleagues who will address this issue as well and I 
will leave it to them to point out our concerns with this new 
national value added tax. I predict in short order, probably 
before Christmas, it will be referred to as the very awful tax and 
Canadians will be encouraging the government not to 
implement it.
<P>
	My two colleagues will also point out the basic fundamental 
flaws that value added taxes are unable to resolve.
<P>
	I would like to go on to the second aspect of-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. On a point of order, 
the hon. member for Mississauga South.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Mr. Speaker, I understood that the motion was to 
adopt a report that had been previously tabled in the House. It 
appears to me that we have debate on the substance of the 
discussion within the committee and not the recommendations 
or the-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I do not believe that is a 
point of order. Respectfully, I say the member is engaging in 
debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, the second issue that I wish to address 
relates to the report that has been filed.
<P>
	This report is an attempt to fulfil an election promise. It is 
very apropos that we talk about the Liberal Party's election 
promises and its behaviour between now when it is the 
government and when its members were in opposition. The 
things they said to the Canadian public to get here, to get 
themselves elected, especially in the province of Ontario where 
they stole every seat except one-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> I do not mean stole. I will take that comment back. 
-where they were elected in every seat but one, duly elected 
democratically.
<P>
	Let me quote the current finance minister: ``I would abolish 
the tax'', August 1990; the Minister of International Trade: ``I 
would tax prescription drugs and food'', 1989. During the 
campaign the Prime Minister said that he would scrap the tax. 
As recently as February of this year and May 4, 1994, in answer 
to one of my questions about this proposed tax, he indicated that 
he hated the GST and that he would kill it.
<P>
	With comments like that, now they have proposed a 
replacement for the GST which is virtually the same as the 
current GST. It is nothing more than the son of GST, a clone of 
the GST with a new name. They now expect the Canadian public 
to accept the fact that they have fulfilled an election promise, 
that they have not only replaced the tax but they got rid of the 
awful GST.
<P>
	What we will have if they proceed with this particular 
proposal is a very awful tax which is the same as the GST. The 
Canadian public will feel betrayed.
<P>
	Here is an interesting situation I put to the government and to 
the Canadian public that are listening. The Deputy Prime 
Minister said that if the Liberal Party did not abolish the GST 
she would resign. She said this at a CBC town hall. That is a very 
firm commitment. I know she always keeps her word. The 
question is, how do we determine if this new national value 
added tax abolishes the GST? If it is determined by the Canadian 
public that it does not abolish the GST, then I would recommend 
that the Deputy Prime Minister fulfil her promise and duly 
resign.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	It should be acknowledged and recognized that not only the 
Deputy Prime Minister but the Prime Minister, the Minister of 
Finance and the Minister of International Trade basically made 
an election promise they cannot keep. Rather than coming clean 
in the House and telling the Canadian public that ``we can't keep 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5733"> 5733 </A></B>
<P>
clean,'' they are continually trying to proceed with this double 
talk in the hope that the Canadian public will not hold them 
accountable.
<P>
	I beg to differ, Mr. Speaker. The honeymoon is over and I 
believe that the government over the summer and in the fall will 
be held accountable. I just wonder how they will vote on this 
concurrence motion that brings it closer to government policy.
<P>
	As we know from the media, both the finance minister and the 
Prime Minister are trying to distance themselves from this 
report by the committee. They choose to ignore the 
recommendations of the committee because they know it is a 
political hot potato.
<P>
	The leader of the Liberal Party made promises. He is a 
populist leader and the popular thing to do when you have made 
a mistake and are wrong is to admit it rather than continue the 
farce of this double talk and trying to fool the Canadian public.
<P>
	I take a little bit of offence at the finance minister's answers to 
my question in question period today about how we are guilty of 
double talk and if he ever saw double talk it is the Reform 
minority report on the replacement of the GST which has been 
filed with the ninth report of the Standing Committee on 
Finance.
<P>
	I will highlight some of the aspects that are in this minority 
report and I will leave it for the Canadian public to decide if this 
is double talk.
<P>
	A majority finance committee report on the replacement of 
the GST cannot be fully endorsed by the Reform Party. While 
the replacement goes part way in responding to concerns 
presented to the committee, many of the concerns will only be 
addressed by future negotiations with the provinces. If the 
provinces do not agree to integration, if the provinces do not 
agree to harmonization, this proposal has been a waste of time 
and all those witnesses that came before the committee, all their 
constructive words of wisdom, will have been a waste of time.
<P>
	The majority report recommendation merely tinkers with the 
current GST and does not live up to the Liberal promise to scrap 
it. We are of the view that value added taxes are incapable of 
responding to a significant portion of the concerns raised during 
the hearings.
<P>
	The Reform Party recommends that spending cuts be the 
government's first priority. As well, the entire current system of 
personal, corporate and value added taxes should be replaced by 
a simple visible and proportional system of taxation that is 
similar to the single tax that one of their more intelligent 
members has recommended, that incorporates the principles of 
fairness and the lowest rate possible. In the interim, the party 
will support reforms to the current regime that move in this 
direction.
<P>
	The Reform Party strategy for tax reform is as follows: We 
believe strongly that tax reform must include a number of 
components. First, a review of spending in order to balance the 
budget in as short a term as possible with the least negative 
impact on the economy, and we see that as three years. We came 
here with that philosophy, we recommended that philosophy, but 
the finance minister said it is too draconian, that a 6 per cent  cut 
in spending is too draconian. Now I read in the paper as of three 
or four weeks ago that he is now looking for 12 per cent cuts in 
next year's budget.
<P>
	Second, we believe a simple visible system of taxation that 
incorporates the principles of fairness, simplicity and the lowest 
rate possible. The Reform Party opposes tax inclusive pricing, 
which is just hiding the tax. It is like the gasoline tax you pay at 
the pumps. None of us know what we pay but we know that 
governments have raised it and pretty soon the Canadian public 
once again falls out of touch with what taxes we are paying. This 
is the Liberal way of eventually raising taxes in years to come 
and that is why the British call this the very awful tax because 
that is what happened in that country.
<P>
	This practice of hiding the tax violates the principle of open 
taxation which is essential to efficient functioning of open 
democracies. Disclosures of taxes paid on cash register receipts 
preserves an element of openness in taxation, but as the 
experience in Europe has shown, it eventually results in strongly 
diminished public awareness of the tax.
<P>
<B>(1525 ) </B>
<P>
	Third, the Reform Party believes that tax reform must also 
mean tax relief. We believe that Canadians are concerned as 
much or more with the level of taxation as with the method of 
taxation. If we are asking the Canadian public to sacrifice, there 
must be a reward at the end of the day. That reward would be to 
eliminate and abolish the GST and we would do that once we get 
the budget balanced.
<P>
	We agree with those who say that the introduction of the GST 
was the trigger that set off the underground economy, a general 
distrust of politicians and a belief that governments had lost 
control of their finances. The current government believes that 
this distaste can be dispelled through a change in the 
mechanism. It believes that if it scraps the GST or changes the 
name that the antagonism toward a new value added tax will go 
away.
<P>
	That is my point today. If this is what the government believes 
will happen it will be sorely surprised and like that commercial 
on TV they slap their face while saying, ``I needed that'', that is 
what it is going to get.
<P>
	Canadians will be wary of accepting changes to how they are 
taxed when the bottom line is that they must pay between 30 and 
60 per cent of their income to carry a government that cannot 
control its spending. Not only will the government not control it, 
it will not even enter into serious dialogue to cut spending. They 
bring us into their offices, we show them $9 billion to $12 
billion worth of cuts and they say: ``We can't do that because it 
is philosophical''. Anytime we make a point to criticize their 
philosophy they change the subject.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5734"> 5734 </A></B>
<P>
	Only when Canadians see meaningful expenditure reform and 
deficit reduction, only when Canadians believe that they will get 
value for their tax dollar, will they acquiesce on the tax burden 
required to provide these services.
<P>
	The Reform Party's plan for tax reform recognizes that the 
current structure of taxation is not suited to carry us into the 21st 
century. Our plan recognizes the need not only for changes to the 
mechanism but the necessary changes to the level of taxation. 
Our plan recognizes that deficit reduction is an integral part of 
tax reform.
<P>
	Our party's plan for tax reform would embark on a 
comprehensive plan for expenditure reform with a plan to 
eliminate the deficit in three years. Concurrently the Reform 
Party would work toward the implementation, as I said earlier, 
of a simple visible, proportional tax. Third, once it is clear that 
the deficit reduction strategy is leading to a balanced budget, the 
Reform Party would eliminate in stages the national value added 
tax, the GST tax, the son of GST, whatever, the great Liberal 
flip-flop, GST, VAT, NVAT, whatever, and implement a personal 
and corporate tax based on the principles of the proportional tax.
<P>
	The Reform Party acknowledges that tax reform is a difficult 
process. We were somewhat apprehensive that the limited time 
frame given this committee would not allow adequate 
investigation of the type of sweeping reforms that are necessary 
to address all of the concerns with the GST. Our apprehension is 
verified in that many of the problems with the GST are not dealt 
with in this report-my colleagues will touch on that-being 
either put off to future negotiations or implicitly ignored.
<P>
	The Reform Party sees the GST, now the national value added 
tax or equivalent, as a temporary tax which belongs in the 
provincial domain. As much as the tax will exist for a temporary 
period of time, the Reform Party supports the constructive 
changes that would streamline the operation and remove as 
many of the significant problems that exist until such a time as 
we can implement such wider tax reforms that provide both tax 
relief and tax simplification. This would include the elimination 
of a federal value added tax.
<P>
	My final point in the few minutes left to me is the following. I 
am a rookie politician. I came here because I am fiscally 
responsible. I want to see government live within its means. Two 
and a half months ago I was named a member of the finance 
committee and the first job I had was to help evaluate a 
replacement for the GST on behalf of the government.
<P>
	All members of the committee worked hard and 
constructively. They all listened to the witnesses and tried to see 
where the group could stay together for the longest possible time 
to achieve a unanimous report in the best interests of all 
Canadians and all provinces. I can assure you, Mr. Speaker, all 
of us tried to do that.
<P>
	I went back to the previous report that was filed when the 
Conservatives first brought in the GST. Many members opposite 
were on that committee; the Minister of Industry, the party whip 
and others sitting on the other side.
<P>
<B>(1530 ) </B>
<P>
	Their recommendation was not to bring in a GST, no 
consumption tax. Two and a half years ago many members of 
that party gave that opinion. They gave it in committee. Some 
Liberals came to our committee. No GST-truly abolish the 
GST; replace it with a better system of taxation, replace it with 
nothing, replace it combined with some spending cuts and this 
party has ignored those recommendations. For two and a half 
years it has done nothing to work toward its goal of a simplified 
system of taxation, more equitable, more efficient.
<P>
	As a rookie MP, I am very disappointed. If you stand up today 
and say something and you get your chance to do it two and a 
half years later and you do not do it, is power that corrupting?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before proceeding to 
questions and comments, because there have been many 
requests from members on both sides of the House regarding 
petitions, I would like to remind members that if they so choose 
to table those petitions with the clerk, the net result of course is 
that they are not printed in <I>Hansard</I> but in fact do appear under 
the publication of <I>Votes and Proceedings</I>.
<P>
	I leave that for your own judgment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the self-proclaimed rookie from 
Calgary Centre for this opportunity to discuss the GST report 
and to show by his motion support for what the majority of 
Liberals are trying to get toward.
<P>
	What we are trying to do in this report is set the stage for some 
fundamental changes in the Canadian tax system and I would 
like to publicly thank my colleagues both on the government 
side and on the opposition side for their diligence.
<P>
	There are only two members of the House of Commons 
committee on finance who have ever sat before on a House of 
Commons committee, the chairman and I, and it is a great tribute 
to the new members who brought such strength and wisdom and 
such diligence not only in Ottawa but across the country in the 
consideration of this very difficult piece of legislation.

<P>
	It is old ground that this government inherited a very difficult 
tax. This tax is a very difficult one for Canadians. In the last 
few years it was a focal point for tax unrest and government 
unrest and there would indeed be many members of this House 
who are here today because of that general public unrest with 
the previous government.
<P>
	We have taken this issue. It is one of the first things that we 
did when the House sat. I can remember presenting on behalf of 
the government the motion to the House of Commons committee 
in the first week of business in which we stated quite clearly in 
the speech from the throne and in the committee on the first day 
that we were going to fulfil the commitment from the red book.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to express my thanks to 
those in the former opposition caucus of the Liberal Party and in 
the office of the Leader of the Official Opposition for their work 
in preparing the red book.
<P>
	I used to be very involved with the policy process of the 
Liberal Party of Canada and it took us years to get people to 
agree that the best way to succeed in politics was to present a 
clear mandate, a clear choice to Canadians as to what we 
intended to do in the government.
<P>
	This red book is the first serious effort of a major party to 
present a document of substance and I think the fact that we have 
used it as a benchmark in our actions is a tribute to the Prime 
Minister and to his cabinet.
<P>
	Our inquiry was in response to the red book commitment of 
the government to have the finance committee ``report on all 
options for alternatives to the current GST'', and ``replace the 
GST with a system that generates equivalent revenues, is fairer 
to consumers and to small business, and minimizes disruption to 
small business, and promotes federal-provincial fiscal 
co-operation and harmonization''.
<P>
	That motion was passed unanimously by that committee on 
the first day of its business and all three parties voted to begin its 
work.
<P>
	It was with a great deal of spirit of co-operation that 
witnesses were called, were questioned, and I think that the 
committee soon began to recognize the complexity of the GST 
issue as part of the consumption tax strategy of the national 
government.
<P>
<B>(1535 ) </B>
<P>
	It is not well known but the federal government entered the 
income tax field in 1917 in response to its fiscal prices during 
the first world war and the began to enter the consumption tax 
deal by various means in 1923.
<P>
	Therefore the government has been involved with one form of 
consumption tax or another for the last 70 years. As one begins 
to reform these taxes, to restructure them and to build a new tax 
that is completely different than the previous GST which has, I 
must admit, been a great frustration for almost every Canadian I 
met, this  committee showed a great deal of maturity to go 
through each of these issues.
<P>
	Many Canadians, as I speak today, have not had an 
opportunity to read the report, as it was just tabled 48 hours ago 
and is in the beginnings of being distributed. The committee 
broke its work up into five areas. It looked at the history of the 
tax and why it was such a difficult tax. It looked at the fact that 
the GST became an opportunity lost.
<P>
	I, as a member of the opposition-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, I want to know 
under comments and questions if the member is leading to a 
question or whether he is making a comment.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Let me see if I can help 
the member. I asked for questions and comments at the 
conclusion of the intervention by the hon. member for Calgary 
Centre. Not seeing anyone seeking the floor, I then called for the 
resuming of debate and we are in the process of engaging in 
debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> Mr. Speaker, it was the hon. member who first 
introduced the sports image of a rookie. I think you are just a 
rookie camp and looked down at the ball when some guy was 
coming toward you. Pay attention to the debate and all the 
subtleties from the Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I would like to have a bit 
of the member's time, if I may. I would like to remind all 
members that although we are leading to possibly a conclusion 
here some time this week, still direct all of your comments and 
interventions through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, I feel the member 
should withdraw those comments. If he wants to play on a 
football field I will meet him any time. If he wants to have a war 
of words-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> That is not a point of 
order. It will be a debate for another day and another place.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will take your words of caution to 
heart. I apologize if I have in any way disturbed the Chair.
<P>
	Continuing the discussion on the GST and the work done by 
the committee, the committee came to the conclusion that if we 
were going to be serious about reform of the GST it is important 
to put into the public domain some of the major options 
available.
<P>
	Those options included different proposals brought forward 
from the public. Some witnesses, for example, wish to see the 
federal government move away from consumption taxes 
altogether. Other people wish to see us revamp the system and 
go with a BTT, a business transfer tax. Other people want to see 
us 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5736"> 5736 </A></B>
<P>
amend the income tax provision in our legislation and begin to 
move more toward a wider review of these questions.
<P>
	In the end the committee decided there were a number of 
changes that could be made in the GST which are absolutely 
fundamental to the improvement of it. The committee showed a 
great deal of sensitivity to the small business community.
<P>
	Small business people have come to us on several occasions 
both in the past and in this government and indicated the high 
cost of collecting the tax. Some of them estimate the overhead 
was 16 per cent of the revenues. For the large corporations 
which have other systems of managing the tax collection, their 
cost is down around 2 per cent but particularly for very small 
firms 16 per cent represents a great deal of time.
<P>
	The revisions made to simplify the tax collection for 
corporations with sales in the neighbourhood of $200,000 and 
some choices between $200,000 and $500,000 per year are a 
great step forward. I am sure other members can think of 
businesses in their own constituency which that takes away a 
tremendous antagonism that has evolved between the small 
business person and the government.
<P>
<B>(1540 ) </B>
<P>
	The other relationship we wish to deal with which has caused 
a great deal of antagonism, which small business people and 
individual consumers told us, is that seeing that tax is a real 
antagonism because the purchase price is deceiving. They want 
to see the total cost. In Manitoba that adds on another 14 per cent 
and in Ontario another 15 per cent. That is a tremendous burden 
for people to carry.
<P>
	If you are a busy person and you have children with you when 
you are shopping and you think you need $10, you end up 
needing $11.50. Every time you go into a store it is another $1 or 
$2 or $3 more. That is a real aggravation. Most families have a 
great deal of difficulty making ends meet with the high tax 
burden on the income tax side and the high cost of bringing up 
children. This is another aggravation they wish to see us 
remove.
<P>
	We have suggested ways the tax can be integrated into the 
price structure shown in stores. There are provincial issues 
involved here that we will have to return to and we will be very 
happy to raise that with provincial governments.
<P>
	If we can have an integrated price with the value added tax and 
indicate on the final bill the percentage that is included as tax we 
think consumers will be able to plan out their expenditures and 
see exactly what the total of their bill is going to be. In a 
colloquial sense it will end the surprises at the till for 
consumers.
<P>
	This committee also saw as a major problem integration and 
harmonization with the provinces. To anybody serious about tax 
reform in this country, the work of the committee has to be 
endorsed as perhaps the most fundamental step being taken in 
the last decade.
<P>
	The committee has said to the government and to the House 
that if you want to have fundamental change in this country you 
must seek out the support of the provinces to harmonize and to 
integrate the sales tax system, the value added tax or the 
consumption tax system.
<P>
	I cannot agree more that this is the most fundamental 
problem. We are perhaps the only industrial country that has ten 
systems, and if you include the absence in one case, eleven 
different variations of a sales tax known by a series of different 
names. For those who are trying to do business with us or travel 
here it is incomprehensible that a country with only 28 million 
people cannot even get its consumption taxes right.
<P>
	We should thank the committee and particularly thank the 
majority who have seen this and say let us go to the provinces as 
quickly as possible and open up the debate with the provinces. 
There are many issues we can discuss.
<P>
	Fortunately the regularly scheduled meeting between the 
federal Minister of Finance and the provincial ministers of 
finance takes place next week in Vancouver. This fresh report 
that has been widely quoted in the media will give the ministers 
an opportunity to set an agenda of co-operation. I know that our 
Minister of Finance is looking forward with a great deal of 
enthusiasm to the meeting.
<P>
	I am sure provincial ministers also seek an opportunity for a 
more harmonized and integrated consumption tax in this 
country. Of course there are number of issues and a number of 
problems dealing with collection and dealing with distribution 
of the revenue.
<P>
	In politics you can see situations, as does the opposition party, 
as problems or, as on the government side, as opportunities. We 
are very proud that we went into this very difficult situation in 
February, saw the problems and have sought now to lay out a 
very positive agenda.
<P>
	In many ways the Official Opposition also understands that 
this has to be a positive solution. It is seeking out ways to 
improve the consumption tax system in this country. It has a 
particular strategy which I do not think will work because it 
would weaken some of the provinces far too greatly. However, 
that is a matter for discussion. It knows the present system is not 
working.
<P>
	There has been a great deal of discussion in the media about 
extending the base. This committee was willing to review the 
options available to the government. One of the most 
controversial areas of discussion is what we include if we 
broaden the base. One of the problems facing a government is 
that when we introduce a new tax there are always barriers, 
whether we include this or that.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5737"> 5737 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	One area of confusion and controversy since the introduction 
of the GST has been the area of food. There is a price that is paid 
for it if it is excluded. By excluding fundamentals such as food 
and pharmaceutical products the previous government was 
forced to set a rate of 7 per cent which became a highly visible 
and aggravating tax. If we broaden it and include these items as 
taxable we take away a lot of the confusion over exemptions. We 
could possibly lower the rate and at the same time include a 
broader base.
<P>
	I do not have to tell anyone in the House that it is a very 
controversial discussion. However I should like to say for the 
record that the committee does not lead the discussion of 
broadening the base with a conclusion or a recommendation. It 
simply says to Canadians that there is a possible solution to the 
high rate and that is to broaden the base. If through members of 
Parliament and the discussions this summer and if through the 
provincial governments and their representatives Canadians 
continue to express their opinion that food should be exempt, the 
committee by no means would lay down any contrary 
recommendation.
<P>
	At page 48 it says: ``The committee's aim is to flag the 
difficult questions that must be answered, articulate the various 
views we heard during hearings, and pass on to the government 
and to citizens the committee's assessment of how best to 
proceed''.
<P>
	At page 50 it concludes the section by saying: ``Whatever 
course the governments involved eventually takes, 
comprehensive based or exemptions for necessities, we 
recommend that the aggregate tax burden borne by low income 
Canadians under the national VAT not be larger than the one they 
bear today under the culmination of provincial sales taxes and 
the GST''.
<P>
	At the heart of Liberal principles is the principle of fairness. 
No taxes will be changed that increase the burden for working 
families, low income families, individuals and seniors. It is 
fundamental to the way we approach taxes as compared to the 
Reform Party and as compared to the previous government. We 
are not about to make any changes in the system-and the 
committee was very clear on it-that in any way affect the 
well-being of working Canadians. That view is shared not only 
by the committee but by every member of my caucus.
<P>
	Perhaps in the quickness with which the member for Calgary 
Centre reviewed the position it was inadvertently downplayed to 
the extent to which the Reform Party agrees with our approach. 
At page 117 it says: ``We agree with the report that the current 
structure leaves much to be desired and that changes at this time 
are necessary. The majority report does deal with some of the 
concerns raised in the lengthy hearings that the committee 
undertook''. People were listening. It is very important to state 
that. It goes on to say: ``Many concerns remained unresolved 
until negotiations between federal and provincial governments 
are concluded''.
<P>
	Therefore the motion in front of the House is ahead of itself. 
How can the House concur in the report before we begin the 
essential negotiations with provincial governments? We should 
wait and we should be able to proceed when we hear what the 
provinces have to say. As the hon. minister responsible for 
housing who is listening attentively to the debate knows, the 
way to get good housing policy is to deal directly with the 
provinces. The way to get good tax policy is also to deal directly 
with the provinces and not to get ahead of ourselves. We thank 
the Reform Party for recognizing that federal-provincial 
negotiations are at the core of resolving the tax dilemma.
<P>
	The committee's conclusion at page 122 says: ``The Reform 
Party commends the government in attempting to meet the 
concerns raised during the hearings in the areas of business 
compliance costs, harmonization and the charity section''. 
There we go again. In the major issue of harmonization again the 
opposition realizes that the majority very much had its eye on 
the ball and very much was concerned about reforming the tax.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	In the course of tax policy and what we have seen since we 
formed the government, there have been great strides made in 
getting Canadians to talk openly about issues central to their 
own well-being. The GST represents not only a consumption tax 
in itself. It represents for many Canadians all that has been 
wrong with the Canadian tax system in the way it was imposed.
<P>
	The government will take its time and will do the right thing. 
It will follow up on its red book commitments and will produce 
for Canadians a tax that is fundamentally different from the 
current tax: one that works and one that is responsive to the 
fiscal framework and the fiscal well-being of the national 
government. This means in turn the livelihood and the defence 
of the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of Canadians and 
their health, social well-being and education.
<P>
	The government will not put at risk the physical health of the 
national government by being in a hurry. We will produce a tax 
which is more successful, more fruitful and more reliable than 
the one currently imposed, the GST. We look forward to 
discussions with the provinces.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
two-part question for the parliamentary secretary.
<P>
	I heard him say that the committee's Liberal majority report 
draws no conclusions and makes no recommendations on 
whether the tax base should be broadened to include food, 
pharmaceutical products and the like. However, the same report 
says that a simplified system will be adopted for small 
businesses so that they will only have to report once a year, 
simply by subtracting purchases from total sales.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5738"> 5738 </A></B>
<P>
	Clearly, if the system is to be simplified and if the tax is going 
to be called a business transfer tax, then everything will have to 
be taxed. That is the hypothesis behind this model. Can the 
parliamentary secretary tell me if the recommendation 
pertaining to small businesses would still allow them both to 
preserve their current accounting methods and to report as 
proposed in the Liberal committee report or will they once again 
have to adopt a different accounting method, one which would 
take into consideration taxable and tax-free purchases as well as 
taxable and tax-free sales? That is the first question I would like 
him to answer. If there continues to be exceptions, then the 
system will not work. Therefore, to say that the report draws no 
conclusions and makes no recommendations on whether to 
broaden the tax base to food is to lack courage. The hypotheses 
underlying the proposed simplification of the business transfer 
tax would clearly indicate quite another matter.
<P>
	The second part of my question has to do with the 
parliamentary secretary's comment that low and 
middle-income earners would be compensated, regardless of 
the new system implemented. How does he explain the fact that 
families with two young children will receive the same credit, 
regardless of whether their children are 12 and 14 years old, or 
14 and 7 years old years, or whether in one case, a child is sick 
and needs medication? How can he guarantee that both families 
will have the same consumption patterns? How can he be certain 
of the amount these two families pay in taxes? How can he say 
this credit system is effective? These are questions which I 
would like the parliamentary secretary to answer.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was happy to hear the question 
from the hon. member. A series of hypothetical questions is just 
that. The report was very careful not to get into hypothetical 
situations. Dealing with the tax field, my own experience is that 
as soon as people begin to speculate on hypothetical situations 
they get themselves into greater and greater difficulty.
<P>
	The majority on the committee has stated its position and I 
have reiterated the government's position that no taxes will be 
introduced that increase the burden on low income families. I 
state categorically that the intention of the government is and 
will continue to be to re-establish fairness in the tax system for 
low income families and individuals. No steps will be taken that 
in any way, shape or form breaches the commitment we are 
making.
<P>
<B>(1555 ) </B>
<P>
	On the question of making sure that small businesses find it 
easier to report the tax, the committee's report has been very 
thorough in its examinations of options. It will make sure that 
small businesses feel more comfortable with the tax. The small 
business community has expressed through its leadership a real 
determination to work with us and to simplify it. In fact it is 
happy with the recommendations. We look forward to the actual 
design assistance to make it easier for small businesses.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
everybody in Canada knows that the GST was purely the transfer 
of a tax burden from corporations to ordinary Canadians. As 
New Democrats we oppose that sort of transfer of burden from 
one sector to another.
<P>
	I would like to ask the member a question pertaining to 
whether or not the committee reviewed any other alternatives 
besides just a new name for the GST. For example, there are a 
number of family trusts outstanding. The total value is about 
$70 billion that goes untaxed. This is a tax free situation 
provided to very wealthy families. It was a tax free situation 
afforded to those people by the former Liberal government for 
20 years, extended for 20 more years by the Conservative 
government, and this government has not done anything with it.
<P>
	I am wondering whether the committee has reviewed that 
matter and in particular is looking at some of the transfer of 
profits from corporations operating in Canada to other 
countries. The example I use is Imperial Oil. Last year it 
declared a dividend of $580 million. Of course 70 per cent of its 
shareholders is the Exxon corporation of the U.S.A and $405 
million left Canada through this nice little tricky tax free 
situation to go into the United States.
<P>
	We lost a portion of what we believe should rightfully stay 
here either to work in our economy or contribute to our taxation 
system. I would like to know whether the government is looking 
at the situation or whether it considered looking at the 
approximate 63,000 profitable corporations in Canada with 
substantial profits that were not taxed a dime on their profits.
<P>
	I am wondering if the committee considered some of these 
very important tax sources as opposed to once again going to 
low income people, middle income people and others who have 
very difficult financial circumstances to deal with right now 
with their families and getting along in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the hon. member on 
summarizing so many misconceptions into a very short 
question.
<P>
	To start with, as he knows there were 40 meetings. Just to 
reiterate, in the structure of the House of Commons committees 
any member of the House of Commons may join in the 
proceedings. Many of these issues were raised. When the 
member gets a chance to read through the hearings over the 
summer holidays I am sure he will know that members of the 
other three parties asked some excellent questions of people 
who wished us to change the tax structure more broadly.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5739"> 5739 </A></B>
<P>
	Dealing with some of the specific misconceptions, the 
government has addressed the family trust issue. A paper was 
released earlier this month by the Department of Finance. It was 
presented to the House of Commons Standing Committee on 
Finance last week. The chair was asked to arrange with the 
opposition parties to set out hearings or to suggest ways of 
proceeding.
<P>
	I am sure the critic of the Bloc Quebecois would be interested 
in family trusts. He will know the committee report is now 
available. We will seek our direction from the other members of 
the committee and the steering committee on how to proceed 
with an analysis of it.
<P>
	On the question of corporate taxes and the contributions of 
corporations to the Canadian tax base, the member knows that in 
the February 22 budget presented by the Minister of Finance we 
made more progress in closing tax loopholes for corporations 
than any other government has done. We are very proud of what 
we have done.
<P>
	Lastly, we anticipate an increase in profits from the corporate 
sector this year. I do not want to get ahead of statistics to be 
released by the government over the course of the year, but the 
hon. member will be happy to know that corporations will be 
pulling their fair share as the profits from their businesses go up 
in the current calendar year.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I intend to share my allotted time with the hon. member for 
Témiscamingue.
<P>
	I welcome this opportunity to discuss the alternative to the 
existing Goods and Services Tax proposed by the Liberal Party 
of Canada. After spending $750,000 to find an alternative to the 
Goods and Services Tax, especially to get rid of the tax, as the 
Prime Minister has promised repeatedly, it is now clear that the 
Liberal government has failed miserably in the attempt. There 
are a number of reasons for this, but I will give you one 
fundamental reason and five more specific reasons.
<P>
	First of all, for the price of $750,000, they took four quarters 
and gave us a loonie. It is disgraceful to use public funds to 
propose merely cosmetic changes. These changes will not 
abolish the GST, as the present Prime Minister promised to do 
and as all members of the Liberal Party promised to do as well, 
and they were very convincing as they rent a van full of 
garments. No, these proposals were just for a new GST which, 
according to the best scenario, will be similar to the old one and 
in the worst scenario will be more complex than the Goods and 
Services Tax.
<P>
	In the end, and this is a monumental farce, after spending 
$750,000, Quebec and Canadian consumers will still be paying 
the Goods and Services Tax every time they make a purchase.
<P>
	We object to this monumental farce for five basic reasons. 
First, in addition to the general argument I just made, the Liberal 
majority report proposes a GST alternative which is not an 
alternative. It is a hidden tax, and the report suggests the 
possibility of hypocritically and craftily making the new goods 
and services tax invisible as part of the price.
<P>
	When they say we will be able to see the amount of the tax on 
the cash receipt, that is not quite true. The Liberal majority does 
not say so. It was explained during many discussions in 
committee that one could indicate at the bottom of the receipt 
that the total price paid by Quebec and Canadian consumers 
includes a goods and services tax, a despicable tax imposed by 
the Liberal government, a tax which may be 7, 10 or 12 per cent 
or whatever.
<P>
	The Liberal majority's report opens the door to all kinds of 
insidious increases without the knowledge of Quebec and 
Canadian consumers.
<P>
	The second basic reason why the Bloc Quebecois vehemently 
and strenuously objects to this Liberal majority report is that it 
could lead to a broadening of the tax base with a proposal to tax 
food, health care and drugs. When I heard the secretary of state 
say earlier that this was out of the question, and that this would 
have to be negotiated with the provinces, the Liberal 
government has always been planning to tax these three basic 
items, ever since the Finance Committee started work, and 
members on the committee would agree with that.
<P>
	Subsequently, it was the Liberal majority that referred to 
taxing food, health care and drugs as a very realistic proposal. 
As my colleague from Témiscamingue indicated in his question, 
with the first level of taxation referred to earlier, that is to say 
the business transfer tax imposed on small business, it is 
practically impossible to exclude such items from the new 
taxation system laid out in the Liberal majority report.
<P>
	I was listening to the secretary of state express earlier a great 
deal of compassion for the most disadvantaged members of our 
society. But this is the same man who fought to maintain the 
proposed cuts to the unemployment insurance program 
contained in the last Liberal budget. He fought to maintain this 
budget measure, using arguments that were fallacious and often 
demagogic.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	I will tell him that there is no mention in this Liberal majority 
report of indexing the tax credit, the refund low income families 
receive. There is nothing about such an indexation while the 
Conservatives-whom the people across the way roundly 
criticized-at least planned to index the tax credit refund on the 
old GST. These people have no sensitivity, no compassion for 
the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5740"> 5740 </A></B>
<P>
disadvantaged  and you can be sure that their proposal is not 
intended to help them.
<P>
	Third, the alternative to the GST proposed in the report from 
the Liberal majority at the finance committee is an 
unprecedented centralizing attack on provincial areas of 
responsibility. This idea of negotiating with the provinces a 
uniform tax base for goods and services from coast to coast and 
of bringing this broader tax base to include food, drugs and 
health care within the scope of an act of Parliament would 
prevent provincial governments, and the Quebec government in 
particular, from adjusting tax rates and base to meet their 
economic objectives as well as their priorities respecting 
development, economic growth and assistance to any industry 
that may need it.
<P>
	Let me recall certain measures the Quebec government has 
taken in the past to exempt the furniture industry and the 
clothing industry, child clothing in particular. With this Liberal 
majority proposal, if the government of Quebec or of any other 
province for that matter wanted to support these industries and 
help them pick up or help the less fortunate consumers go 
through hard times, it could not make the necessary adjustments 
to help the most disadvantaged members of our society. And that 
is totally unacceptable!
<P>
	The fourth reason why the Bloc Quebecois disagrees with the 
insidious and pernicious report of the Liberal majority is that 
not only do they give us four quarters for a dollar, as I 
mentioned, but they make the consumption tax system 
incredibly complex by adding a small business transfer tax to a 
GST like the one we now have.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois thinks that this new business transfer tax 
or BTT for short will be a real nightmare for businesses to 
administer-I will let my colleague from Témiscamingue who 
studied business administration explain these complexities to 
you-as a result of this second level of taxation introduced in 
the Liberal proposal.
<P>
	We are told that when they started, the Liberals wanted to 
abolish the GST and replace it with a simpler system. In fact, 
they have just made the consumption tax system more 
complicated by introducing this second level of taxation called 
the business transfer tax.
<P>
	The fifth fundamental reason why we are strongly opposed to 
this proposal, this systematic attempt to disguise the current 
GST, is that they cannot see the forest for the trees. Since the 
Standing Committee on Finance started its hearings on the GST, 
the Bloc Quebecois has been raising the need to review the 
whole Canadian tax system. We were told, as I heard the Prime 
Minister and the Minister of Finance say last week, that in the 
past they tried to carry out such a review and failed.
<P>
	But in the past Canada was not facing the severe difficulties it 
is now encountering. There was no $511 billion debt or record 
deficit either. I would tell you that it is the Liberals' second 
record because the first Liberal administration also set an annual 
deficit record for the federal government. The then Minister of 
Finance, who is now the Prime Minister, can claim credit for that 
record.
<P>
	I would tell you that they tried without success to change the 
current GST, to abolish it and to replace it with a simpler system.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	Not only have they failed in their attempt but they have made 
things even more difficult, not only for small and medium-sized 
businesses but also for consumers, who will not understand this 
system.
<P>
	As soon as it was published, the report was destined to be 
shelved or else to be thrown out. Even the Prime Minister said 
yesterday that he did not feel bound by this report. He even said 
that he was dissociating himself from this report and I 
understand why. Several premiers of the larger provinces have 
spoken against this Liberal proposal.
<P>
	So I look at all this and I also look at the Bloc Quebecois's 
proposal, if you will allow me to state it. The Bloc Quebecois 
has proposed a viable option, one that has a future and will not 
force us to negotiate with the provinces for two years and fail, as 
the Conservatives failed before the Liberals. We cannot 
harmonize in the way presented here, with unprecedented 
centralization of a consumption tax system. So the Bloc 
Quebecois's proposal is first to abolish the GST and keep the 
Prime Minister's promise and to give this field of taxation to the 
provinces, with an adjustment in federal spending, of course.
<P>
	Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I look forward to receiving 
questions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (St. Paul's):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to 
make a very short comment.
<P>
	I guess the hon. member opposite does not much like the 
report. That is a shame because he spent tremendous time and 
enormous effort listening to Canadians across the country 
express their views about the current GST and recommend 
alternatives.
<P>
	All of those views are expressed in the report and reflected. It 
is a shame that the hon. member and the loyal opposition did not 
have the courage to present alternatives in a written form. At 
least the Reform members had the courage to express in writing 
what they agreed with and what they did not agree with.
<P>
	While the Bloc agreed to the mandate to look at alternatives to 
the current GST and supported that mandate of the committee 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5741"> 5741 </A></B>
<P>
and put in all the work, at the end of the day what does it do? It 
says: ``Well, it is not good enough. Why not give it to the 
provinces and let us have a provincial tax grab?''
<P>
	There has been a complete flip flop. During the election 
campaign the Bloc members liked the GST. Now they do not like 
the GST and they want more provincial taxes. Indeed, they have 
engaged in what I would express as the big lie, that the report 
recommends a tax on food and pharmaceuticals. There is no 
such recommendation on any one of the over 100 pages in the 
report, no such recommendation at all.
<P>
	I make them an offer that one of our colleagues south of the 
border once made to the Republican Party: ``If they will stop 
telling lies about us we will stop telling the truth about them''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will very briefly answer the hon. 
member; what he said borders on the unparliamentary.
<P>
	I would ask my colleague, one of the vice-chairmen of the 
finance committee, to read our minority report. We tabled a 
minority report, with our own resources. We had it translated 
into English at our own expense and we tabled it. We tabled our 
minority report in both official languages for the press 
conference two days ago. You were not able to provide us with 
this translation on time to analyse the preliminary copy of the 
report.
<P>
	So I think that our colleague should not boast that he has not 
read our minority report, when it was in both official languages 
and translated by the Bloc Quebecois, because the government 
party did not deign to accommodate us, except if we appended 
our minority report to the committee's report. We exercised our 
free choice and chose to table it separately. I think that we made 
a good decision.
<P>
	I would say, Mr. Speaker, that our alternative, if the hon. 
member would read our report, if he would be so gracious as to 
read our report as we have read the report of the Liberal majority 
several times, in English and in French, if he would read the 
minority report, he would see that the Bloc Quebecois is keeping 
the Prime Minister's promise to abolish the GST and transfer 
this field of taxation to the provinces.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	We thus avoid two things: We avoid a sixth failure in 
constitutional negotiations between the federal government and 
the provinces. After the health forum, interprovincial trade and 
so on, we can add another failure because the Conservatives 
tried for two years to negotiate harmonization with the 
provinces, as the majority report proposes. So we avoid those 
frictions. We avoid three things. The second thing we avoid is 
continued duplication and overlap.
<P>
	We give the government an opportunity to withdraw from 
certain spending fields in order to compensate for the transfer of 
the GST to the provinces. Thirdly, we are helping to clean up the 
mess that the government's finances are in. The Liberal 
members should thank us for the work we did, seriously, because 
it is the only  alternative left at this time, after the many 
statements from provincial premiers and especially from great 
experts, and I am thinking of Yvon Cyrenne of Martin, Chabot, 
Paré &amp; Associates, for example-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order! I am sorry to have 
to interrupt the hon. member. Resuming debate, the hon. 
member for Témiscamingue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is now 
my turn to speak on this infamous report of the Liberal finance 
committee on the GST. I have worked very hard on this matter 
from the very beginning, along with my colleagues from 
Saint-Hyacinthe and Charlevoix.
<P>
	When we first saw the draft report, we were extremely 
disappointed to see the direction in which the Liberals were 
heading after all the public hearings, because no one had 
suggested as an alternative that an integrated tax be introduced. 
Just try to explain to people now contending with two different 
taxation systems that the existing GST is going to be replaced by 
a relatively similar mechanism!
<P>
	Government members roundly criticized this tax when it was 
first introduced and continued to do so during the election 
campaign. The Prime Minister said it was a bad tax, and so did 
the Deputy Prime Minister who even said she would resign if the 
GST was not abolished. The Minister of Foreign Affairs and all 
the Liberal members said it was a bad tax, and now they are 
asking the provinces to do away with their own tax and replace it 
with the GST. This is scandalous, Mr. Speaker. After criticizing 
this as a bad measure, now the government wants to extend it to 
everything. This makes no sense.
<P>
	Furthermore, the government wants to broaden the tax base so 
that the tax will now apply to food, pharmaceutical products and 
health care. In addition to using strong-arm tactics where the 
provinces are concerned, the government boasts of wanting to 
simplify the system for small businesses. I want to touch on this 
point a little further because up until now, this issue has gone 
relatively unnoticed. Once again, the government is merely 
throwing up a smokescreen and I will explain why.
<P>
	The report says that businesses with earnings of $200,000 or 
less will be able to use the business transfer tax system. 
However, the government does not want to call this tax by its 
real name, preferring instead to call it a VAT. This tax is nothing 
but a GST hybrid, an added value tax, if you will. This must be 
clearly understood. Businesses with earnings of $200,000 or 
less are being told: Now all you have to do is take the sales total, 
subtract from it your purchases and file an annual report''. What 
they are not being told, however, what the report does not have 
the courage to say, is that throughout the year, until they file 
their report, businesses will have to use an accounting method 
which takes into consideration taxable and tax-free purchases, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5742"> 5742 </A></B>
<P>
as well as taxable and tax-free sales. This is exactly what they 
must now do with the current GST.
<P>
	What will happen? Until now, small businesses could use the 
so-called quick method to calculate the amount of GST. So how 
will the new system be different? Most likely, it will be worse 
than the quick method which was not used very much. The 
government probably should have pushed the quick method 
more and not changed anything in this regard. But it did not, Mr. 
Speaker.
<P>
	The report contends that the new system will be simpler for 80 
to 90 per cent of small and medium-sized businesses. Lest we 
forget, businesses with earnings of $500,000 and over account 
for 94 per cent of all sales in Canada. What does this represent 
for Conservatives, in terms of change? Ninety-four per cent of 
sales will still be subject to the same GST. However, small 
businesses which account for the remaining 6 per cent of sales 
will have to contend with a more complicated system.
<P>
	When they get wind of this proposal, they are going to react 
very strongly. Let me give you four cases where the new system 
will prove to be more complicated. To digress, the report is 
rather non-committal when it says that maybe the door should 
be left open even for businesses with earnings of between 
$200,000 and $500,000. On this point, they changed their minds 
in mid course. The final version says that this could perhaps be 
an option for businesses with earnings of between $220,000 and 
$500,000.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	Think of it, Mr. Speaker. A firm could sell some products that 
are taxed and others that are not. But whether the report tells us 
that they do or do not want to tax food, there will still be 
exceptions.
<P>
	If there are any exceptions, how will firms with sales of 
$200,000 or less be able to have a simplified system if they sell 
different types of products? What happens if these firms 
expand? What will happen to a firm with sales of $400,000 that 
hopes to achieve growth, which is a universal goal in business? 
When that firm's sales top the $500,000 mark, it will be forced 
to change its accounting and taxation systems. This is a terrible 
outrage!
<P>
	Companies will have to decide which system is most 
profitable for them. They will spend their time trying to decide 
between the business transfer tax and the goods and services tax. 
And they will see that these are relatively similar systems, so 
they will probably prefer to keep the GST. Many firms will 
prefer to stick with the GST. If the threshold is set at $200,000, it 
is even worse. What change? Most firms with projected growth 
will not change to another system. Firms engaged in 
interprovincial trade-the provinces will still have differing 
rates, and it should not be assumed that there will be a uniform 
rate across Canada-will have to take sales and purchases made 
in other provinces into consideration in their accounting.
<P>
	This translates into still more new accounting for these firms. 
The claim is that now these small firms could, in their annual 
income tax returns, manage to provide the desired statements. 
But they will not be able to; they will have to continue keeping 
daily accounting records. Furthermore, they cannot claim the 
tax credit for purchases from non-registrants-that is, people or 
businesses with sales of $30,000 or less who are not obliged to 
register for the GST. So special accounting records will have to 
be kept for that purpose as well.
<P>
	And this is the simplified system for small businesses? Is this 
it? It is a dog's breakfast. There is no way in the world that this 
will be simpler. People are being taken for something they are 
not when they are told things like this.
<P>
	There are a number of things I want to say in the few minutes 
left to me. Easier to manage says the report in one of its 
objectives. Easier for whom? For the government? Do you think 
that the present staff at Revenue Canada will be able to handle 
the introduction of this new business transfer tax, a tax of which 
many small businesses will probably never avail themselves. 
They will nonetheless investigate the possibility. They will need 
information. People will have to be hired to provide this 
information. And after that, the tax will have to be administered.
<P>
	Since the GST will still be widely used, people will continue 
to be needed to run that system. Administration costs, which are 
already high -at least $600 million-are likely to increase. 
What a mess! What a waste! That is what the Liberal GST is 
about. Is this the kind of improvement the Liberals have in 
mind? The public will never go for that, never!
<P>
	It will not be easier or simpler for businesses either. Someone 
mentioned the tax credit for low-income individuals earlier. 
This aspect has been debated vigorously here as well as 
elsewhere. Huge petitions were brought in, petitions that said 
the tax credit had to be indexed, that it was wrong to impose a 
regressive tax. Now, in this report, they do not even have the 
courage to state that, if a value added tax must be maintained, 
tax credits for low-income individuals will have to be indexed 
yearly.
<P>
	The rate of inflation will not remain as low as it is forever. 
There will be years when it will be higher. If the economy grows, 
so will inflation. But the credits will remain the same. In time, 
the gap will grow. Also, this tax is a hidden tax. We are told that 
it will not be, that the amount will be shown on bills. That is not 
true, not at all, because bills could simply mention that the total 
amount includes a tax of such and such a percentage.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5743"> 5743 </A></B>
<P>
	Can you imagine small businesses figuring out their purchase 
price and the tax paid? They are going to have to take the total 
amount, take out their calculators, divide all those figures, 
reprogram their computers-What a nightmare! It is a real 
nightmare. That is the Liberal GST? That is the improvement the 
Liberals had promised? Are they true to their commitment? The 
public will not be fooled. That is not what they had promised. 
They are in breach of an election promise, and this is a major 
breach too!
<P>
	We are proposing an alternative. We are offering them an 
alternative. The world must have gone crazy, when the 
opposition offers ways to fulfil a government commitment. We 
told them, ``If you want to abolish the GST, there is only one 
solution: to abolish it and leave this area of taxation to the 
provinces. Of course, there will be less revenue, but you can 
then tinker with the transfers to the provinces, especially in 
areas where there is a lot of duplication''. Reducing overlap is 
also one of the goals stated in the red book. You could achieve 
several goals at the same time.
<P>
	You are signalling to me that I do not have much time left, Mr. 
Speaker, so I will conclude by quoting from an article by Michel 
Vastel, a renowned Parliament Hill journalist, that appeared in 
this morning's newspaper: ``Another solution mentioned by the 
committee''- which did not look at it because it was apparently 
not its mandate-``and recommended by the Bloc is to abolish 
the GST and make up for the shortfall by abolishing transfers to 
the provinces''.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	He goes on to say, ``They would then eliminate at once a lot of 
duplication and a bunch of public servants. All this is obviously 
too simple and dangerous for a federal government that wants to 
raise its profile''. He could have added, ``that craves absolute 
power and control and constantly tries to confront the 
provinces''. That is why the Premier of Ontario compares them 
to a gorilla. I would be ashamed to be compared to a gorilla, and 
by a Premier no less! But he is right. The people of Ontario 
should listen to their Premier because he is handling this very 
well.
<P>
	I will conclude by saying that they are reneging on their 
election commitment and that the people of Quebec and Canada 
will never let them get away with it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> After his 
eloquent speech in which he criticized the Liberal majority 
report, a disgraceful report that sets out to mislead Quebecers 
and Canadians, I want to stress the outstanding work done by the 
hon. member for Témiscamingue, and also by the hon. member 
for Charlevoix, on the finance committee and in developing our 
own position, which is the only valid one at the present time, the 
only possible basis for negotiating with the provinces, since the 
biggest provinces have rejected the Liberal majority report out 
of hand.
<P>
	Although the hon. member for Témiscamingue mentioned 
this briefly, it made me wonder when the parliamentary 
secretary said earlier that we were the only country in the world 
with ten different tax systems, perhaps I may remind him that 
the Liberal majority's proposal would introduce not only a GST 
but also a business transfer tax. We already have two tax 
systems, which, multiplied by ten different rates, ten rates that 
are different from one province to the next, will make us the only 
country in the world with a Liberal majority that proposes 
having twenty different tax systems instead of ten. So much for 
improvements.
<P>
	Again, I wish to commend my colleagues on their excellent 
work in developing the position taken by the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brien:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot for his comments. I would also like to 
stress the excellent spirit of co-operation we had here in the 
Bloc Quebecois when we were working on this question and also 
with a number of members on the committee who belong to the 
Liberal Party and who disagree with their party's position but 
cannot do so openly because of the party line system, because 
they are gagged. I am also aware that my Reform Party 
colleagues co-operated splendidly during the entire process, 
and I want to thank them for doing so.
<P>
	Where my colleague referred to complex systems, he drew 
comparisons with the situation at the international level. In fact, 
there is not a single country in the world that has this kind of 
hybrid tax, with one system for one kind of business and another 
system for another business. I attended all the hearings and 
many meetings and I travelled all through the provinces, but not 
a single person suggested alternatives.
<P>
	Why bother holding public hearings that cost a fortune and 
waste a lot of taxpayers' money, if in the end, we do not listen to 
what is said. After only a few days, the committee was doing 
such a poor job that the Prime Minister had to tell officials at the 
Department of Finance who had spent a lot of time on the report 
that it was going to be put on the backburner. That is the kind of 
thing that is so discouraging to the public and makes people so 
sceptical. I am sure that the way the Liberals handled this 
question will not do them any good.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. On behalf 
of the caucus co-ordinator I would like to inform the House that 
according to Standing Order 43(2) we will be dividing our time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
gives me great pleasure to share with this House the reasons why 
the Reform Party opposed the majority report on the GST.
<P>
	Before I go into the substance I would like to go on record as 
congratulating the chairman of that committee, the hon. member 
for Willowdale, for his excellent stewardship and the great 
learning experience that he  allowed all of us to have. I think he 
treated the proceedings most fairly and really was a master at 
dealing with the many witnesses we saw.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5744"> 5744 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1630 ) </B>
<P>
	I started off this hearing process fully supporting the GST. I 
had lectured about it in classes and thought I fully understood 
the principles. Well, I understood the principles but what I had 
failed to understand were the difficulties.
<P>
	At the beginning we had many witnesses who said: ``Let us 
keep the tax. We spent several billion dollars installing it. It 
would be very silly now to throw away this investment and start 
the learning process, the investment in cash registers and so on 
all over again''.
<P>
	We also heard the very eloquent and polished representatives 
of the large industry groups located here in Ottawa, all of whom 
suggested: ``Keep the GST. There is no alternative'', but they 
said ``broaden the base, harmonize the tax with the provinces 
and do a few other things that will make it cheaper to run''.
<P>
	I thought for a long time that this was the alternative, the only 
sensible thing for the committee and for the country. However, I 
had an experience which I was very sceptical about. I travelled 
with the committee to as many of the capitals that I could here in 
our great country. There I found that the information conveyed 
to me by the people who one might say are on the firing line with 
respect to the administration and use of the tax were telling us 
stories that somehow were omitted in the more formal hearings 
that were dominated by the polished representatives of the big 
industrial organizations.
<P>
	I changed my mind and came out with the belief that the tax 
cannot be rescued, that the tax is a bad tax. It is a nightmare and 
even with all the changes that have been proposed it will remain 
a nightmare.
<P>
	I would like to discuss and put on record what I consider to be 
the unavoidable consequences of a value added tax, even under 
the assumption which is of course of very, very questionable 
validity that we will get total harmonization with the provinces. 
Even if we do this the administrative costs of the value added tax 
are extraordinarily high. Firms have to keep track of their input, 
the sales they have. There are all kinds of extra accounting 
procedures that have to be undertaken.
<P>
	We know that the government is spending about $300 million 
to $400 million a year administering this tax. We know that there 
are over 1.5 million registrants, people who are entered into the 
computer with numbers and addresses who have to file 
regularly. They have to supervised. They have to be caught up 
with if they do not file. Businesses are going bankrupt 
periodically and other businesses are created. Just to keep track 
of all those 1.5 million registrants is a very, very high cost.
<P>
	In trying to keep track of those people the government already 
had to make exemption by the definition of a business. The 
representatives selling Tupperware or Avon products are all in 
principle required to file GST returns. As it happens and as I 
learned these people have entered into a special contract where a 
one step higher distributor pays the GST.
<P>
<B>(1635 ) </B>
<P>
	There is a system that was introduced in order to reduce the 
regressive effect of this sales tax, in order to reduce the impact 
of this sales tax on those people with lower incomes.
<P>
	This system is extremely expensive and awkward to 
administer. We have to find all of those tax filers who qualify. 
We have to send them cheques. As we know, many of them 
cannot be found. The cheques do not reach them. There are some 
who are receiving cheques who should not be, for example 
people in prison. It is a very expensive and awkward system for 
making this tax applicable.
<P>
	The hon. member from the Bloc mentioned other 
disadvantages for large families and so on. In a country in which 
there is a very big neighbour which does not have the GST, we 
are finding that some Canadians, the snow birds, are taking 
holidays in the United States, staying there for months on end 
and not paying taxes yet they have the right to services that are 
provided while they are here.
<P>
	This was a report filed by several of the witnesses who 
considered that to be a tax inequity. I am reporting what some 
representatives of the people of Canada are saying.
<P>
	One of the most traumatic experiences I have had was 
listening to a businessman who was located in a border town 
whose commerce has been devastated by the existing GST. 
Where there once were 10 supermarkets, there now are two. 
Where there were 15 gas stations, three are left. There is no way 
in which the new value added tax will take care of this problem.
<P>
	I would suggest that if we put on top of the value added tax 
through harmonization the provincial sales taxes equivalent, we 
will increase the incentives for border shopping with all the 
problems that this causes to a wide strip where Canadians are 
living along the U.S. border.
<P>
	We heard many stories about tax evasion encouraged by the 
value added tax. This is something that will also be increased by 
the possible harmonization of the increase in differences. The 
tax was designed originally to make international trade neutral.
<P>
	We know that in this country tourism is a very important 
export service. We heard representatives telling us that it is not 
possible to remove the distorting effects of the GST on that 
important international trade dimension. We also heard that it is 
impossible to ever tax the consumers of the financial sector. A 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5745"> 5745 </A></B>
<P>
comparative international study has shown that none of the 
European  countries have done so because technically it simply 
is not possible.
<P>
	These problems exist because the value added tax is basically 
flawed in a world in which we live, next to a country that does 
not have a value added tax, and because we live in a country in 
which we like to take care of those who are at the lower income 
scale and who would otherwise have been hurt.
<P>
<B>(1640 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with 
interest to my hon. friend's dissertation on the son of GST, 
called the VAT. We will be referring to the Minister of Finance as 
Vatman or something of that nature.
<P>
	Can the hon. member respond to this observation? When we 
go into book stores these days, the books we notice front and 
centre are books on how to avoid tax, how to reduce taxable 
income and so on. For many, tax evasion has become a blood 
sport. Being in a situation where one can avoid paying tax and 
participate in the underground economy now is something that 
Canadians increasingly are part of unfortunately.
<P>
	Would the hon. member say that the reason for these activities 
is because Canadians generally have lost faith in our tax system? 
Do they see it as a fair system, an equitable system, a just system 
where all people are paying a fair share? If the perception is that 
it is unjust, unfair, then people are saying: ``I might as well try to 
do whatever I can to avoid paying what taxes I am because I am 
probably paying too much''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I attended a conference on the 
underground economy which was held in Vancouver a couple of 
months ago and very soon the conference proceedings on this 
topic should be published by the Fraser Institute. This was a 
great subject for discussion. The surveys made of Canadians 
suggested they have become extremely cynical about these 
issues. The hon. member summarized the argument very well.
<P>
	At the same time however the evidence presented by those 
people who have studied it a great deal suggests that the 
underground economy is not as large as is popularly believed. 
There are certain industries, such as home repair, shoe repair, 
home care services and on and on that when one looks at these 
industries in detail it turns out that they do not represent a very 
large proportion of national income.
<P>
	The largest proportion of national income is produced by 
large industries such as automobiles, banks and so on that do not 
have an opportunity to evade taxes in the way it was suggested. 
Nevertheless it is quite clear there is a very great temptation at 
the moment as a result of the existence of the GST for people 
who wish to have their houses repaired, who have all kinds of 
services that are consumed in the home, are finding that 
producers come to them and say: ``Will it be with or without the 
tax?'' For them there is no penalty for suggesting this.
<P>
	Why not save a buck, especially once the ethical standards 
about this have been eliminated or have been depreciated as a 
result of the discontent with overall levels of government 
spending and deficits.
<P>
	It may very well be that it will be very difficult in the future to 
restore this. We may have used up an amount of social capital in 
trust and in confidence in our government and in our taxation 
program. There was a lot of worry expressed about that at the 
conference.
<P>
	We hope to do that once we get our spending under control and 
taxes can be lowered, as is the program of some parties, but it 
will be a long haul.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
say first of all that the committee experience with regard to this 
issue was certainly a very productive and rewarding one.
<P>
	I want to pay tribute, as my colleague did a few moments ago, 
to the chairman, the hon. member for Willowdale, and also the 
departmental officials that were so willing to provide us 
information and direction.
<P>
	I must say though that one of the things I noted as our hearings 
started was that it seemed like we were having a rerun of 1990.
<P>
<B>(1645 ) </B>
<P>
	Many of the people said very clearly: ``I said this at the GST 
presentation in 1990, but it bears repeating in 1994''. We heard 
that a number of times. It is interesting to see that certain 
recommendations which were made at that time but were 
unacceptable were more acceptable during the spring session of 
this Parliament.
<P>
	One of the questions raised earlier was with regard to whether 
we could concur in this report without jeopardizing some of the 
negotiations with the provinces. There is no question that is a 
misconception. The report sets up a framework by which 
negotiations can take place with the provinces. It establishes a 
variety of options which can be used to negotiate or look at in 
terms of the responsibility of this government to replace the 
GST. There is no reason that this House cannot vote on this 
matter and concur in it at this point in time. There is no reason 
that cannot be done even though we may disagree with a number 
of things in that report.
<P>
	What did we really hear in those hearings? What is it that 
Canadians said to us? That is the most important thing. They 
said very clearly that the GST had a lot of shortcomings and a lot 
of pitfalls. It was unacceptable in a number of ways.
<P>
	They also said that they had spent a lot of money in 1991 in 
implementing it, putting it in place and complying with it as the 
government requested. They had spent a lot of money and did 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5746"> 5746 </A></B>
<P>
not intend to do that again. This was said very clearly to the 
government. I hope the government remembers that when it 
starts to implement the GST.
<P>
	Harmonization was also a top priority. Over and over again 
this ideal target was presented to the committee. They said we 
must harmonize with the provinces. That statement was easily 
said but after listening to the provinces I think there is going to 
be some difficulty.
<P>
	Consider for example the province of Alberta. In my 
conversations with some of the ministers they clearly said that at 
this point they do not want the government to interfere in the 
direct taxation area, the sales tax area. Therefore a province and 
the federal government are in somewhat of an adversarial 
position.
<P>
	Other provinces are asking what is in it for them, how they 
will benefit. If the federal government is not able to satisfy those 
questions in trade-offs and in application then certainly there 
will not be much of an improvement to the current 
circumstances. Harmonization was a top priority in at least 70 
per cent of the presentations made to us.
<P>
	In terms of simplification, the point was made that we must 
remove the work and the headaches at the local level. Many of 
the owner operated retail businesses are working many hours, 
spending many of their dollars directly and indirectly and using 
their energy in filling out GST forms. After the business closes, 
husbands and wives are having to return at night to determine 
the amount of GST that must be forwarded to Ottawa. That has 
to be simplified.
<P>
	If we changed that compliance procedure whereby people 
could determine the GST amount and forward it to Ottawa once 
a year, that would be much better. There is a recommendation in 
the report that leads to that and I consider it as an interim 
measure by the government.
<P>
	One of the other questions was the matter of whether it should 
be visible or hidden. I would say it was a 50:50 split. Canadians 
looked at it and there is merit for both ways. The Reform Party 
has said that any taxation should be visible so that people know 
what they pay and what it costs them to run the Government of 
Canada.
<P>
<B>(1650 ) </B>
<P>
	One of the other things that was most significant and I think is 
a message that the government should hear which came through 
the GST hearings is to get its spending under control, that there 
should be deficit reduction. That was the message, loud and 
clear.
<P>
	They also raised the question as to the commitment that this 
government made with regard to the GST. It is clear to 
Canadians that the Liberal government said it will replace the 
GST. There was a perception out there when that was said in the 
election and has been quoted a number of times and said even 
during the proceedings in this House that people in Canada 
expected the tax would cost them less, compliance would be 
much simpler, and that they would not incur additional 
administrative costs through a replacement tax.
<P>
	They also thought that it would be a tax that would have a new 
form or a new application. I am not sure what they thought it was 
going to be or how they reached that conclusion, because there 
were certain options available and those were the only options.
<P>
	I asked my constituents how they felt about changing the GST 
and what they thought should be done. In mid-April I sent out 
my householder to my constituents; 5,300 of my constituents 
responded to the questionnaire and one of the issues listed was 
the GST and how they felt about it. How they felt is an indication 
and should be a notice taken by the government as to how they 
should respond to changes that are brought about in this next two 
year period.
<P>
	First of all, they said that 61 per cent wanted the tax included 
in the price of goods and services. That is very interesting 
because many of the people who made presentations said the 
very same thing, but 61 per cent of them said they wanted it 
included in the price.
<P>
	Second, 65 per cent wanted to eliminate the GST altogether 
but only after the deficit is eliminated.
<P>
	It is worthy to pause at this moment because what they are 
really saying is that the GST or its replacement should be an 
interim tax measure that would bring in a revenue replacement 
or a consistent revenue of about $14 billion to $15 billion, but 
that once the deficit is looked after then that tax form should be 
eliminated. This is what they recommend.
<P>
	One major shortcoming of the report that is presented to this 
House is that question is not being addressed. The government 
has not made a commitment to the term of the tax. It is most 
likely going to end up something like our income tax. Back in 
the war years the income tax concept was implemented only as 
an interim measure and it was supposedly going to be eliminated 
after a period of time. We know the history of that. Today we are 
still paying income tax and a huge amount of income tax out of 
our daily pay cheque.
<P>
	It is really unfortunate that Canadians pay 30 per cent, 40 per 
cent of their income to income tax as wage earners in this 
country. It is very high.
<P>
	What else did my constituents have to say? Eighty-nine per 
cent of my respondents want to apply the GST to the 
accumulated debt once the government obliterates the deficit. 
They also want it to deal with the accumulated debt, meanwhile, 
54 per cent would rather see income tax rates decline after the 
tax is eradicated.
<P>
<B>(1655 ) </B>
<P>
	The message from that is very clear. They are saying it is time 
in this country that we focus on deficit reduction, that we cut the 
cost of government and in turn reduce taxation so that we have 
more income for ourselves that is available to meet our own 
personal or family or community needs. It is time we changed.
<P>
	Those are the shortcomings of this report. One, it talks about 
putting a tax in place but not what it is. Second, it does not deal 
with the question of deficit reduction.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="EXCISETAXACT">EXCISE TAX ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from June 21 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-32, an act to amend the Excise Tax Act, the Excise 
Act and the Income Tax Act, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> When Bill C-32 was last 
before the House, the hon. member for St. Albert had 15 minutes 
remaining for debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise again to 
talk on Bill C-32 and since it was yesterday that I was talking 
last on the bill perhaps I should give a little bit of a recap of what 
I was saying for the benefit of members opposite.
<P>
	I was saying that a nation is not a nation if it cannot defend its 
borders and enforce its laws. What we saw this past winter was a 
situation in which this great and wonderful country of ours 
allowed its borders to be used illegally. They refused to defend 
them while in many situations there were millions, even billions 
of dollars being smuggled into this country.
<P>
	The abuse of our borders and the unwillingness of this 
government to defend its own borders was a disgrace to Canada.
<P>
	The smuggling was largely through certain reserves that 
straddled the border between Canada and the United States and 
that was what we called, as far as I understand, a no-go zone for 
the RCMP.
<P>
	This government even refused to send in the police to bring 
under control and under the Canadian jurisdiction the laws of 
this land while they were being blatantly abused and ignored by 
people in that area.
<P>
	We could watch on evening television-and this was not 
Bosnia or Belfast, it was right here at our own border-while 
skidoos and boats were crossing the St. Lawrence River, 
bringing smuggled contraband into this country. We could hear 
the bullets and the guns going off. You would think you were in a 
war zone.
<P>
	We sometimes even heard the people on television saying that 
if the government sends in the RCMP it will be war on our very 
own borders. That is another shame on Canada. We had one here 
last night when democracy was denied in the House. Here we 
have in our country the RCMP not going in to defend the laws of 
the land or to defend the borders. Not only was that an insult to 
Canada but, to add insult to injury, these cigarettes were being 
exported legally by manufacturers in Canada. They were fully 
aware that 70 per cent of all cigarettes they were exporting were 
coming back across the border illegally. The government was 
fully aware of that. Yet it waited until the situation reached a 
crisis point before it did anything about it.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	These manufacturers were willing co-conspirators in the 
smuggling situation. By exporting them they were not losing 
their market. They were fuelling their market. They were 
increasing their market. They knew the cigarettes that were 
being exported to the United States were coming back in here 
and were being sold here for less than half the regular price in a 
store because of the high taxation applied by this country.
<P>
	As a result of the lower price more and more people were 
smoking. As I said they were willing co-conspirators in this 
game where Canada was being bilked of billions of dollars, 
where our laws were being ignored, and where our borders were 
being trampled on by people who had no thought, care or respect 
for our great country. The manufacturers, the exporters, the 
brokers and the truckers were all working legally but with full 
knowledge that the end product was illegal, denying tax 
revenues to the government and putting the jobs and well-being 
of the country at risk.
<P>
	We have laws in this land to protect our society. Finally the 
government acted. It introduced the measures last February 
which we now know as Bill C-32. At that time it reduced the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5748"> 5748 </A></B>
<P>
federal taxes on cigarettes by $5. It said that for every dollar the 
provinces reduced the tax to a maximum of $5 it would match it, 
for a total $15  reduction. The province of Quebec where the 
smuggling was by far the worst went further and reduced the 
provincial sales tax even more.
<P>
	In addition the government applied an $8 excise tax where 
cigarettes were being exported to places where no tax was being 
applied. This was to recognize that cigarettes exported to a 
foreign country and ending up on native reserves had no taxes. It 
was to make sure that the value of the cigarettes as we exported 
them would be higher and therefore reduce the differential and 
the smuggling back into this country.
<P>
	In addition they applied a 40 per cent surtax on the profits of 
the Canadian manufacturers of cigarettes. It was a reasonable 
penalty, recognizing the fact these Canadian manufacturers had 
been willing co-conspirators in the smuggling problem, to say 
to them that they could not make profits in this country if they 
participated in this type of illegal activity. Therefore the 
government applied the 40 per cent surtax and said that it needed 
the money for education. It was to spend the money to teach 
young Canadians that there is a penalty for smoking; not only a 
financial penalty but a very serious health penalty as well.
<P>
	My hon. colleague from Macleod, who is a medical doctor as 
we all know, gave vivid and graphic descriptions which really 
were not nice. It was nice to get the descriptions but the graphics 
of people who smoked were not very nice. We will leave it for 
the record to indicate exactly what he said. He described them 
far better than I could.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	The health penalty for youngsters who start smoking is very 
serious. That ends up spilling over into health costs later on if 
these people contract various lung problems, emphysema and 
even cancer. That cost to us as a nation adds to the penalty we 
have as people continue to smoke. The government also 
introduced the measure to raise the age of purchasing cigarettes 
from 16 years to 18 years.
<P>
	There were four basic measures. It dropped the excise tax. It 
added an export tax. It added an income surtax to the 
manufacturers and increased the age of people allowed to buy 
cigarettes.
<P>
	Let us take a look at these four items. I can agree with the $8 
excise tax. I can agree with the surtax applied to the 
manufacturers because they were the willing co-conspirators. 
However I cannot agree with the reduction in the taxes applied 
to cigarettes because we know from statistics that the cheaper 
cigarettes are the greater the likelihood that young people will 
start to smoke.
<P>
	For youngsters with peer pressure affordability is one of the 
major factors in making them decide whether they will or will 
not start to smoke. If we can increase the price beyond their 
financial resources or so that they would rather apply the money 
elsewhere, we are doing them a favour by encouraging them not 
to smoke.  Therefore I cannot endorse the reduction of the tax 
that was part of Bill C-32.
<P>
	Not only that. The smuggling was primarily in the provinces 
of Quebec and Ontario. I understand it was largely in the 
province of Quebec. It was not out west and I represent a riding 
in the province of Alberta. The problem was not serious out 
there even though there was a large differential between the 
price of cigarettes in the province of Alberta and across the 
border in the United States. We did not have any reserves 
straddling the border that could claim some kind of national 
jurisdiction and could say that Canadian laws did not apply to 
them. Of course they apply to them. They apply to all Canadians. 
That was where I left off yesterday when I talked about Bill 
C-33 and Bill C-34. I wanted to get into that because the 
government refuses to talk about these important issues as we 
saw last night.
<P>
	The point is that now we have dropped the price of cigarettes 
in eastern Canada we find that they are substantially more 
expensive in the west where we are still trying to discourage 
Canadians from smoking. Now we will have a smuggling 
problem east-west between provinces rather than north-south 
between Canada and the United States. I cannot support the idea 
that we drop the price of cigarettes dramatically by reducing the 
excise tax.
<P>
	Another point I would like to speak on is that we have raised 
the age whereby it is now legal for youngsters to buy cigarettes 
from 16 years to 18 years. I started my speech by saying that a 
nation is not a nation if it cannot defend its borders and enforce 
its laws. Although the government introduced this law, I wonder 
if it intends to enforce it. It has paid lip service by applying the 
law to people under the age of 16 years buying cigarettes. Now it 
is changing the law to 18 years of age. Do members think it is 
going to go out there and enforce the law? Is it going to have the 
RCMP outside every grocery store and corner store? I doubt it.
<P>
	The problem is that we are not only encouraging children and 
young folk to smoke. We are also telling them that they can 
thumb their noses at the law and get away with it because we do 
not care. We write laws that we do not intend to enforce. We 
have members standing in the House, Canadians elected to 
represent the people of the country and to write laws for the 
betterment of society.
<P>
<B>(1710 ) </B>
<P>
	I do not think we have shown any leadership, direction or 
responsibility in this matter. In conclusion I have to say I cannot 
endorse Bill C-32. A couple of points are okay. However, with 
respect to the fundamentals of trying to reduce the amount of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5749"> 5749 </A></B>
<P>
smoking in this country, that is why the high taxes were 
introduced in the first place. I cannot endorse the removal of 
these taxes, telling kids that it is okay to smoke and okay to 
break the law. I will be voting against the bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand-Norfolk):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
quite interested in the hon. member's statement. The sense I get 
from across the way is that one person wrote the same speech for 
everybody. Much of the same misinformation seems to be 
passed along from one member of the Reform Party to the next.
<P>
	The hon. member stated that this was an eastern Canadian 
problem. I am wondering where he gets that information. The 
hon. member knows this was a major problem in Alberta. There 
have been a number of complaints by people from all over the 
country. Smuggling was a problem in every single province.
<P>
	Other hon. members on the other side suggested that we failed 
in this matter. The hon. member said yesterday that smoking had 
gone up because of this. I found that quite interesting so I called 
Statistics Canada. Statistics Canada reported that Canadians 
smoked approximately 3.6 billion cigarettes in the year ending 
April 1994 compared to approximately 4.3 billion smoked in the 
year ending April 1993. That seems to suggest that smoking has 
gone down dramatically. A lot of it has had to do with the 
policies brought in by this government, especially the hard work 
done by the Minister of Health in this area.
<P>
	These hon. members seem to always suggest that this is just a 
native problem, that somehow we have two systems of laws in 
this country, one for native Canadians and one for other 
Canadians. From people who obviously have not spent a lot of 
time with natives in this country, I find it quite distressing hon. 
members would even suggest that. There is no two tier system of 
laws in Canada. We have one set of laws for all Canadians.
<P>
	There was a problem before we became the government. The 
RCMP was having problems dealing with specific situations on 
certain reserves. I wish hon. members on the other side would 
visit some of these places. It is not so easy to send in a whole 
bunch of RCMP officers and expect them to solve a situation. 
These people are good people. They are Canadians and the 
majority of them on these reserves respect the laws. The people 
on the reserves want all Canadians to know they are law-abiding 
citizens. Yes there are certain problems on the reserves. Certain 
individuals on the reserves do not follow the law.
<P>
	We as a government made a commitment when we brought in 
this bill to make sure the RCMP went into these areas and dealt 
with the problems. To suggest, like the other side is suggesting, 
that we somehow militarize these places, send in the forces, 
knock them all around and that somehow we will stop the 
smuggling is all wrong.
<P>
<B>(1715 ) </B>
<P>
	What that would do is create animosity, create mistrust and it 
would not be a good way to set a good standard for all Canadians 
to live by.
<P>
	I want to ask the hon. member if he really believes there are 
different levels of laws in this country for certain Canadians or 
is it just the rhetoric of the Reform Party that he is being pressed 
into saying this. Does he really believe that there are 
Canadians-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Do you really believe your question?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speller:</B> Yes I do really believe my question. Does the 
member really believe that there are different levels of laws in 
this country for Canadians? If he does, how does he propose to 
solve some of the problems that he has outlined here?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, after all of that I should be 
allowed another 15 minutes for sure.
<P>
	I will respond to the hon. member. He talked about 
disinformation but I think all the disinformation comes from 
that side of the House. We were talking about it and the way it 
actually is. He brought out some stats from Stats Canada. If you 
listen to the dates, Mr. Speaker, he was comparing the numbers 
before the introduction of Bill C-32, before the government 
reduced the excise taxes.
<P>
	I have no doubt in my mind whatsoever that cigarette smoking 
will go up because the price has come down dramatically. Stats 
Canada said that there is a direct relationship. There is no doubt 
in my mind that smoking will go up especially among young 
people and we now find especially among young women.
<P>
	He is talking about more than one set of laws in this country. 
Yesterday we were trying to point that out to the members over 
there and they invoked closure so we could not get our point 
across.
<P>
	However, the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development introduced a law that says natives in this country, 
in Yukon and so on, under the agreements in Bills C-33 and 
C-34 are exempt from the charter of rights, yet everybody else 
in this country is under the charter of rights. Therefore, 
obviously there are two sets of laws in this country for two 
different groups. That addresses the wider range and also the 
narrow situation regarding the reserves that straddle the border.
<P>
	I remember the Minister of National Defence sitting in this 
House when there was discussion and debate about some 
shooting at a helicopter that was flying over the reserve to 
monitor or do something regarding the smuggling problem. 
They were so afraid to take any action. He said that it was okay 
to shoot at the helicopter as long as you did not hit it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5750"> 5750 </A></B>
<P>
	The Minister of National Defence, who has all the resources at 
his disposal, said that it is okay to shoot at us as long as you do 
not hit us because we do not want to retaliate. Anyone else in this 
country who takes a potshot at government property and 
government personnel, you can bet your boots that they are 
going to answer for it in court. Yet the minister says as long as 
they were not hit it did not matter.
<P>
	In answer to the hon. member's question, the disinformation 
is coming from over there. Look at the facts. This is a serious 
situation.
<P>
	I will finish up by saying a nation must defend its borders and 
enforce its laws and that is the basic, fundamental principle that 
has been abused. This government should ensure that these 
things are looked after or make sure that the laws that are not 
enforceable are not applied or not introduced.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before resuming debate I 
do want to indicate to the House that we will now move to the 
next stage of debate. Members will be entitled to a maximum of 
10 minutes intervention with no questions or comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was looking forward to the questions 
and comments.
<P>
<B>(1720 ) </B>
<P>
	We will have a special audience outside after.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, thank you very much for the opportunity to 
participate in this debate. As you know, Bill C-32 represents a 
very important part of the budget which was first presented on 
February 22, 1994.
<P>
	I would like to spend part of my time going over the major 
features of this legislation, but I would also like to take some 
time to respond to some comments made by members during 
yesterday's debate. In the haste of debate we often do not take 
time to seriously read each other's material and to think about 
the consequences of what other members might be saying.
<P>
	The first issue I would like to address is on page 5626 of 
yesterday's <I>Hansard</I>. A member raises the question: Why does 
the present Liberal government always seem to be in a hurry to 
table bills without having the appropriate committee reports 
prepared?
<P>
	I would like to leave Canadians assured that the government 
does not rush through important legislation. We began this 
debate openly, not in February but back in December, and 
continued it through January and February, ending up with the 
presentation by the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	The measures in this legislation were clearly explained in the 
original budget documents and enable the government on a 
technical basis to carry out these measures which are important 
to the success of the budget.
<P>
	We gave the opposition parties an opportunity to call 
witnesses, and of course our own members too, and some 
witnesses did appear to discuss Bill C-32. The fact is the 
coalition made not one but two presentations concerning the 
tobacco tax portions of this legislation.
<P>
	It is important, therefore, that members of the opposition do 
not play too loosely with the activities of the government and 
leave Canadians with the impression that we have been in a 
hurry and that they have not had an opportunity to speak. I would 
like to assure the House that anybody who approached the House 
of Commons finance committee to speak on this legislation was 
given an opportunity and that in future cases we would give the 
opposition parties and our own members every opportunity to 
invite people to speak about legislation that was presented.
<P>
	As an extension of that, members of the opposition are invited 
to present amendments both in committee and at report stage so 
that we can consider ways of improving the legislation.
<P>
	This legislation deals primarily with tobacco smuggling. As 
members have discussed in the last few days and previously, 
there has been a rapid growth in tobacco smuggling in Canada. 
The contraband tobacco trade has had serious consequences for 
government, business and citizens of our country. The 
increasing market penetration of contraband tobacco products 
has caused a serious decline in government revenues. These 
revenues are an important part of the government's tax 
collection and are used to provide funding for programs and 
services across many areas of responsibility.
<P>
	Based on these concerns, the government announced a 
comprehensive anti-smuggling initiative on February 8, 1994 
designed to eliminate smuggling as a significant national 
problem. Leading this national action plan was an increase in 
enforcement, with greater resources assigned to both the RCMP 
and Canada Customs to intensify their efforts along the 
Canada-U.S. border and to target organized criminal networks 
dealing in contraband tobacco and other products.
<P>
	In addition to specific excise and income tax changes, Bill 
C-32 also contains a number of measures that are important to 
the long-term success of a national action plan on smuggling. 
This legislation contains provisions for full inventory rebates to 
be provided in respect of the national $5 excise tax reduction.
<P>
	All wholesalers and retailers are eligible for complete 
reimbursement for tax paid inventories of cigarettes, tobacco 
sticks and fine cut tobacco held as of midnight, February 8, 
1994.
<P>
	Administration of the inventory rebate program is the 
responsibility of Revenue Canada. This bill will provide the 
Minister of National Revenue with the authority to pay out 
inventory rebate amounts once it receives royal assent.
<P>
	There have been a number of questions raised and I would like 
to assure the House that we have been  listening very carefully to 
these. Dealing with the question of the reductions, the question 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5751"> 5751 </A></B>
<P>
that we hear most often is why does the national action plan on 
smuggling include tobacco tax reductions?
<P>
	In 1992 the government announced a wide range of 
enforcement measures to respond to the substantial rise in 
tobacco smuggling triggered by federal and provincial tobacco 
tax increases.
<P>
<B>(1725 ) </B>
<P>
	These measures included much tighter controls on the 
distribution and sale of tax free tobacco products, significantly 
higher penalties for persons caught smuggling, new proceeds of 
criminal provisions and the allocation of substantial new 
resources to customs and the RCMP to strengthen their 
enforcement efforts and the border and within Canada.
<P>
	While these measures assisted the government in its fight 
against tobacco smuggling, they were not sufficient to bring the 
problem under control. The price differential between Canadian 
tax paid tobacco products and contraband products were such 
that the profits from smuggling far outweighed the associated 
risk. As a result, despite these measures, smuggling continued to 
grow, representing about 15 per cent in about 1991, 25 per cent 
in 1992 and 40 per cent in 1993 of the total Canadian market for 
tobacco products.
<P>
	The government's national action plan on smuggling is a 
comprehensive plan that includes new enforcement initiatives, 
tobacco tax reductions, measures affecting tobacco 
manufacturers and measures to reduce smoking. There is also an 
export tax. The tax on exported tobacco products is designed to 
more closely control export shipments and to prevent any 
recurrence of the level of shipments that would effectively 
supply the contraband trade.
<P>
	At the same time Bill C-32 makes provision for certain 
limited exemptions to allow tobacco manufacturers to satisfy 
demand for legitimate exports for bona fide consumption 
outside Canada. These exemptions apply in respect of the 
historical level of exports which was in the range of 2 to 4 per 
cent of total domestic production during the period before 
tobacco smuggling became a problem. As well exports where 
the manufacturer provides satisfactory evidence that the 
national taxes of the country of destination have been paid are 
also exempt on the grounds that tax paid tobacco products are 
not used to supply the contraband tobacco market.
<P>
	The tax is only imposed on manufacturers of tobacco products 
because only manufacturers can export tobacco products free of 
domestic taxes and duties.
<P>
	There is also a health promotion surtax which applies for a 
three-year period and this has raised the question; why not make 
it permanent? The health promotion surtax is one part of the 
government's national action plan on smuggling. It was 
designed to respond to the potential for increased consumption 
associated with tobacco tax reductions, providing the funds 
necessary to  undertake an extensive anti-smoking campaign to 
help prevent any increase in smoking. The government does not 
expect that tobacco taxes will remain at the reduced levels 
indefinitely. As such it was not considered appropriate to make 
the surtax a permanent feature of the income tax system.
<P>
	Yesterday a member from one of the opposition parties quite 
accurately pointed out that I raised this point in testimony 
before the finance committee and it is part of their record that we 
are very concerned, as is every member of the House, about the 
levels of smoking and that the actions of the government do not 
contribute to increased consumption.
<P>
	To assist the federal enforcement agencies and provinces to 
control the potential for interprovincial diversion of tobacco 
products, Bill C-32 contains new liability and offence 
provisions. An additional federal excise tax will be imposed on a 
wholesaler or retailer in respect of any sale of marked tobacco 
products to a person in another province. The legislation also 
makes the offence subject to a fine for any person to sell or offer 
for sale tobacco products marked for consumption in one 
province to a consumer located in another province.
<P>
	I can assure the House that the people in Manitoba are very 
concerned about this issue. This particular provision was to 
address the western provinces.
<P>
	As I started my speech I wanted to bring to the attention of the 
Chair that sometimes members react perhaps too strongly to 
particular measures. I want to quote one member yesterday who 
said, and I quote from page 5649 of <I>Hansard</I>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This reduction in taxes to cigarettes is the single most disastrous act of 
sabotage to the health of Canadian people which has ever been enacted by any 
government in the history of this country.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is a pretty strong statement. A representative from the 
same party on page 5629 said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This party supports the immediate payment of tax rebates owing to retailers 
and distributors throughout Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
<B>(1730 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walker:</B> Let us go back over this again in case members 
were not paying attention. We have first a reduction in taxes on 
cigarettes, the single most disastrous act of sabotage to the 
health of the Canadian people. This party supports the 
immediate payment of tax rebates owing to retailers and 
distributors throughout Canada. Heaven forbid if something 
serious should happen in this country.
<P>
	There are other elements of this that I want to bring to the 
attention of the House. There seems to be some confusion 
among opposition members on the air transportation tax. I want 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5752"> 5752 </A></B>
<P>
to point out that the purpose of the new air transportation tax 
regime is to reduce the cost of short haul flights.
<P>
	This was brought to our attention by a witness from the 
province of Quebec and also raised in the House during debate 
yesterday by members from Quebec. I want to reiterate that in 
most cases those flights will see a reduction in the cost of the air 
transportation tax because they qualify as short haul flights.
<P>
	It is very important that there be flexibility of the government 
to respond to the needs of businessmen and local markets. The 
member opposite raised this and I agree with him 100 per cent. 
For small businesses the cost of these flights is very important. 
It slows down their business in the province. It slows down the 
business across western Canada. We have made efforts through 
this to reduce the cost of the airport tax on short haul flights and 
to increase it on long haul flights. We feel that brings a greater 
degree of fairness.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I could go on for a while about other comments 
made in the House but I welcome the debate, as do you, and I 
urge all members to support Bill C-32 as soon as possible.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 5.30 p.m. the 
House will now proceed to the consideration of Private 
Members' Business as listed on today's Order Paper.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Point of order, Mr. Speaker. I think you might 
find there is unanimous consent of the House to suspend the 
operation of private members' hour for the time being to permit 
completion of the debate on Bill C-32.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The House has heard the 
terms of the motion. Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Agreed. Resuming debate 
on Bill C-32.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to rise in the House today to speak on Bill C-32 on behalf of the 
Reform Party. Other members of my party had planned and 
prepared to make presentations on this as well but unfortunately 
they will not have the same opportunity as I have.
<P>
	Last night we witnessed a Liberal interpretation of open 
democracy when they invoked closure on this and every other 
critical piece of legislation before this House.
<P>
	Here we have another omnibus bill that tackles issues as 
varied as airport tax, meal allowance changes and the 
anti-smuggling initiatives. Today I will concentrate my remarks 
on the cigarette smuggling and taxation component of this bill. I 
believe that this is a step in the right direction. We should be 
educating the public about the hazard of smoking tobacco. I 
agree with the export tax on tobacco products.
<P>
	We in this party are in favour of stronger enforcement of the 
laws against smuggling. We have a police force in Canada that is 
one of the best in the world. We have laws. Why this situation is 
so different from any other law breaker is really difficult for me 
to understand. Take speeders for example. Because people do 
not comply with the speeding laws is no reason to change the 
laws to do away with the speed limit so that people can drive at 
any rate they like. Instead we come up with different ways to 
apprehend these speeders and we penalize them for having no 
respect for our laws.
<P>
	When we talk about compliance we have a problem now with 
smuggling east and west in Canada. It occurs to me that we are 
all too ready to enforce our smuggling laws east and west but we 
are very hesitant to do the same as far as other smuggling is 
concerned.
<P>
	How much money do you suppose this government is 
foregoing with this new policy of the reduction of taxation?
<P>
<B>(1735 ) </B>
<P>
	The government's policy is to broaden the tax base. It has 
voluntarily given up hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue. 
If one reduces taxes on cigarettes across this country and 
foregoes those hundreds of millions of dollars worth of revenue, 
it would seem to me that in order for the Liberal government to 
reach its target of 3 per cent deficit of the GDP in three years' 
time, it will be compelled to make up this revenue somewhere 
else since it seems reticent to reduce its spending by any 
substantial amount.
<P>
	I suspect that there have been many debates in this House and 
in the provincial legislatures that increasing taxes would not 
only bring in additional revenue from the so-called sin taxes but 
it would also be a financial deterrent against smoking. This 
reduction in the taxation on cigarettes seems to be a complete 
departure from that rationale.
<P>
	This bill also increases the legal age limit to buy tobacco 
which I suppose is commendable but at the same time the 
government is making tobacco and cigarettes more affordable. 
Now that we are making it financially easier for people to 
purchase cigarettes, will we see an increase in the usage of an 
already overburdened health care system? Some members have 
quoted facts and figures on both sides, whether there is an 
increase in smoking or whether there has actually been a 
decrease in smoking.
<P>
	It makes me wonder when we are quoting facts from Statistics 
Canada if they have taken into consideration the amount of 
cigarettes that have been smuggled into this country and 
consumed that do not show up on StatsCan's statistics.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5753"> 5753 </A></B>
<P>
	I will take a slightly different tack. In my view, a very clear 
precedent has been set here. We have established that in order to 
deter smuggling, we must take the profit out of smuggling by 
reducing the taxation on whatever.
<P>
	There is also a significant problem with the smuggling of 
alcohol and spirits into Canada. It is very easy to draw a parallel 
between the smuggling of tobacco and the smuggling of spirits. 
The price of a bottle of spirits in Canada is approximately 
double what it is in the United States. Eighty-seven per cent of 
the cost of a bottle of spirits in Canada is taxation. The 
manufacturer must produce, bottle, advertise, transport, pay all 
capital building costs and employees and take its profit out of 
the 13 per cent that is left.
<P>
	Is it any wonder then that we have the smuggling of spirits 
north and south across our border. It seems to me that we are 
encouraging a new generation of runners here. The statistics that 
I have indicate that of the 17 million cases of alcohol or spirits 
that is sold in Canada today per year, four million of those cases 
are contraband. They reached Canada illegally. They were 
shipped out of Canada and smuggled back across the border.
<P>
	We arrive at four million cases by communicating with 
provincial liquor boards, comparisons of per capita 
consumption between Canada and the United States and 
consumer surveys on consumption habits and Revenue Canada 
customs law enforcement agencies.
<P>
	There has been quite a lot of discussion about what the law 
should be and the two tier system. Is there a law for one group 
and another law for another group? Perhaps that is a debatable 
point. There is no question that it is debatable. There is 
definitely a difference in how the law is enforced.
<P>
	What we are looking at here is an enforcement problem. We 
should have gone to a more stringent enforcement. We have the 
laws. We have the police force. We simply need to apply it.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	I believe that if we follow the rationale that the reduction in 
taxation is the route to go as far as discouraging smuggling of 
cigarettes, then exactly the same thing has to be done with 
alcohol. We have to improve the enforcement profile, as I have 
said, and we must increase the penalties for smuggling. I do not 
believe that reduction of taxation should enter into it at all.
<P>
	I find it extremely difficult to support this bill in its present 
form. I do not have any intention of doing that at this time.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is the House ready for the 
question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.

	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development)</B> moved that Bill C-34, an act respecting 
self-government for first nations in the Yukon Territory, be read 
the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am extremely pleased to rise today in support of Bill 
C-34 which implements self-government for First Nations in 
Yukon, an extremely historic agreement.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5755"> 5755 </A></B>
<P>
	It is a particular pleasure for me to do this because as 
Minister of Indian Affairs in 1976-77 I was involved in the 
original negotiations with respect to these matters. At that time 
the claim made by the Council of Yukon Indians was entitled 
``Together Today for our Children Tomorrow'' and was 
presented by Elijah Smith, an outstanding leader with the 
Yukon Indians. Soon afterwards I dealt with the new president 
of the Yukon Indians who was known as Daniel Johnson.
<P>
	I supported this claim at that time which is a long time ago and 
I am pleased today after many ups and downs that it is finally 
settled and being ratified at this time by the House of Commons. 
I should point out that part of the delay over these many years 
has been due to the fact that the Yukon Indians to their credit not 
only put forward land claims in the traditional way but also 
wished to have aboriginal self-government as part of their claim 
and that held up the negotiations for many years.
<P>
	It is also interesting to note that some of the people who were 
active with the Council of Yukon Indians back in 1976-77 when 
I was negotiating with it are still active today. I saw in the 
balcony last night people such as David Joe, Harry Allen and Vic 
Mitander. I must congratulate them all, along with Judy Gingell, 
the new chairperson of the Council for Yukon Indians, for their 
tenacity and their commitment to their claim and for having 
stuck with it over the years despite some very tough negotiating 
situations.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	It is interesting to note that when we started the process back 
in the seventies very few Canadians understood and supported 
what we are doing here today. There was very little 
understanding and support for aboriginal land claims and 
especially for aboriginal self-government. However over the 
years there has been great progress and great advance in public 
education to the extent where today there is overwhelming 
support for these claims.
<P>
	A certain amount of the success in advancing this public 
education was due to the aboriginal nations and to the work of 
the special committee on Indian self-government in the 1980s 
under Keith Penner, a former member from northern Ontario. I 
was also a member of that committee. The process that led up to 
the Charlottetown accord included provisions for aboriginal 
self-government which by that time had achieved a great deal of 
support among Canadians. Despite the fact that the 
Charlottetown accord was rejected by Canadians, the clauses 
with respect to aboriginal self-government had a lot of support.
<P>
	As Canadians we have come a long way in understanding and 
supporting aboriginal self-government. Unfortunately that 
support is not yet unanimous. I am sad to say that we still have in 
the House a number of members, those in the Reform Party, and 
others in the country who still do not seem to understand this 
important concept and who still bring up  the old myths and 
stereotypes with respect to aboriginal people. I ask these 
members with great sincerity to take a new look at it. There is 
still time for them to vote in support of this very important 
measure.
<P>
	We must remember that the aboriginal nations in Canada and 
in North America generally were here for thousands of years 
before the Europeans came. In that time they had their own 
lands, their own governments, their own languages, their own 
cultures, their own laws and their own economies. They were 
nations and they lived on the lands we now occupy.
<P>
	When most of us as Europeans-and some of us came from 
other lands-first came here the aboriginal people thought they 
were sharing the land with us. They certainly were not 
transferring it to us. They never agreed to give up their rights 
and their sovereignty with respect to these lands, their cultures, 
traditions, governments and so on. Regretfully our people, the 
descendants of the Europeans, gradually took it away from 
them.
<P>
	It is only justice that today and in other land claim settlements 
and through the treaties these demands have finally been 
recognized, that these rights are finally recognized, and that we 
have agreed to settle with these nations as we are doing today 
with the Yukon First Nations.
<P>
	We are now on the third and final reading of Bill C-34 which 
is the Yukon First Nations self-government act. The 
self-government agreements to which this legislation pertains 
are in many respects the most complex self-government 
arrangements we have ever attempted in the country. For one 
thing they are unique in that they are the first such agreements 
tied in directly with a comprehensive land claim agreement that 
is ratified at the same time.
<P>
<B>(1815 ) </B>
<P>
	This legislation will be passed together with the Yukon land 
claims settlements act, Bill C-33. That means the 
administration of both the claims and self-government aspects 
will begin simultaneously in these First Nations that have signed 
self-government agreements.
<P>
	It is also the first self-government legislation to cover all the 
First Nations within a single province or territory. Previous 
self-government arrangements have been made with a single 
band such as with the Sechelt band of British Columbia, or with 
a regional group such as was the case with the Cree and Naskapi 
in northern Quebec.
<P>
	The Yukon settlement, which was initiated by the Council of 
Yukon Indians, covers the vast majority of aboriginal people in 
the territory. It includes almost a quarter of Yukon's total 
population.
<P>
	The legislation is also the first self-government legislation to 
include several different aboriginal cultures and communities 
under a single piece of legislation. Yukon has some seven 
distinct native language groups. There are 16 communities in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5756"> 5756 </A></B>
<P>
Yukon, virtually all of which have a significant aboriginal 
population.
<P>
	Finally the Yukon self-government legislation is the first 
under which the First Nations will be empowered to provide 
certain programs and services not only to residents living on 
settlement land but also to First Nation citizens living off 
settlement land. This is another first.
<P>
	Given these unique features, it is not surprising there were 
fairly protracted negotiations before the final agreements were 
reached. Because of the complexity and diversity of Yukon's 
aboriginal communities, the government agreed to negotiate 
and sign individual self-government agreements with each of 14 
separate First Nations. Four such agreements have now been 
finalized. Active negotiations are currently being pursued with 
five others.
<P>
	The government is confident this process will be completed 
satisfactorily over the next few years. While each agreement 
will have certain unique provisions reflecting the particular 
characteristics and needs of individual First Nations, there are 
certain common areas covered in all the agreements negotiated 
to date.
<P>
	These include first, the recognition of First Nation governing 
structures. Unlike the previous band structure under the Indian 
Act that they will replace, First Nations will have broad powers 
similar to those of other governments to enter into contracts, 
acquire and hold property, and form corporations. These powers 
are vitally important if the First Nation is to effectively 
administer self-government and develop initiatives to improve 
the economic and social conditions in its communities.
<P>
	Second, these agreements will replace the Indian Act. Under 
the agreement the Indian Act will no longer apply to a Yukon 
First Nation, its citizens or its land, except for some minor 
provisions which deal with for example the question of which 
citizens are Indians within the meaning of the Indian Act, how 
reserve lands are to be treated under a self-government regime, 
and provisions respecting the treatment of trust moneys for 
minors.
<P>
	Third, the agreements provide for an ongoing process for 
transferring programs to the First Nations, that is transferring 
programs from the department of Indian affairs to First Nations. 
It is inherent in these agreements that First Nation governments 
will assume responsibility for administering a number of 
programs and services now provided by either the federal or 
territorial governments. These will include social services, 
health services, and educational responsibilities.
<P>
	This will be done on a transitional basis in which the First 
Nation will take the initiative in determining which programs it 
is prepared to take on and in what order. Annual meetings will be 
held between government and First Nations to review priorities 
and agree on the timing and financing of these transfers.
<P>
<B>(1820 ) </B>
<P>
	Although this process will take time, the government is 
confident that over the next several years the minister will be 
able to downsize the department of Indian and Inuit affairs 
operations in Yukon by some 75 per cent from present levels. 
Only a small staff will remain to handle responsibilities and 
obligations directly related to the implementation of federal 
responsibilities emerging from self-government. I want to 
congratulate the minister on the actions he has taken in that 
respect.
<P>
	Fourth, the legislation provides for the establishment of 
law-making authority of First Nations over their citizens and 
settlement land. Although federal laws of general application 
will remain paramount, First Nations will have authority to pass 
legislation dealing with internal management, the provision of 
services, taxation on settlement land and similar matters.
<P>
	Fifth, with respect to the funding of Yukon First Nations, 
self-government will be by means of new five-year 
comprehensive financial transfer agreements which will replace 
current funding agreements. These will give First Nations much 
more scope and flexibility within which to set priorities and plan 
for the orderly development of their communities.
<P>
	These are the key general provisions in the legislation that 
will be common to all the self-government agreements in 
Yukon. However, some differences will exist from one First 
Nation to another in Yukon, for example, in procedures 
established for ratification of the agreement and in the specific 
provisions dealing with the application of self-government 
powers within community boundaries.
<P>
	The most compelling aspect of self-government is the 
opportunity it provides for economic development within 
aboriginal communities. Both aboriginal leaders and the 
government are seriously concerned about the continuing high 
rates of unemployment among aboriginal Canadians. This is 
clearly one of the major stumbling blocks to improving the 
economic and social conditions among Canada's aboriginal 
population. As the government has stated, this is a matter of 
national concern. The untapped potential of aboriginal people is 
untapped potential for all of Canada.
<P>
	Yukon's aboriginal population is young with more than half of 
that population under 24 years of age. Like the aboriginal 
population as a whole, it is growing at a faster rate than the 
national average. Compounding this situation is the fact that 
young aboriginal people in all parts of Canada, including Yukon, 
are seeking greater educational opportunities in recent years. 
Across Canada, the number of young aboriginal people staying 
in school until grade 12 has doubled in the past decade. The 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5757"> 5757 </A></B>
<P>
number going on to post-secondary institutions, universities 
and colleges has almost doubled in the past five years.
<P>
	This is an extremely positive development and one that 
reflects well on the leadership of aboriginal communities and 
the governments that have supported their efforts. It also means 
there is a growing generation of job-ready young people coming 
to the employment market with higher hopes, higher aspirations 
and higher expectations than ever before. Unless these hopes 
and expectations are reasonably met, they will quickly be 
replaced by despair and disillusionment.
<P>
	The very fact that these land claims and self-government 
agreements will come into effect will create an environment of 
greater certainty and stability in Yukon. This in turn will have a 
positive effect on investment, particularly in the important 
resource sectors of mining and mineral development. An 
upsurge in activity in these key areas will certainly have a ripple 
effect throughout Yukon's economy and will create improved 
job opportunities for both aboriginal and non-aboriginal people.
<P>
<B>(1825 ) </B>
<P>
	Our government, the Liberal government, is convinced that 
aboriginal economic development must be largely a bottom-up 
exercise. Aboriginal controlled community enterprises and 
effective community development institutions will be the main 
engines of economic growth for them and for the entire 
communities. We are further convinced that the combination of 
the powers inherent in self-government taken in tandem with 
the funding provided in the land claims agreement will create a 
climate in which such development and institutions will have a 
much better chance of succeeding.
<P>
	Self-government can work to provide wealth and jobs, 
provided the arrangements have been carefully worked out and 
provided the First Nations concerned are willing and able to take 
maximum advantage of the opportunities presented to them. 
This is certainly the case with regard to Yukon's First Nations. 
The self-government agreements have been painstakingly 
worked through negotiations spanning many years.
<P>
	The leadership of Yukon's First Nations are ready and willing 
to take on the job of governing and rebuilding their 
communities. There is no reason to delay. There is every reason 
for us to give speedy consideration and passage of this 
self-government legislation so that the work can begin. I think 
the government did the right thing in putting forward the 
motions last night to ensure this legislation would pass before 
we adjourn this House for the summer recess.
<P>
	I must say as well that self-government is not the be all and 
end all. As several aboriginal leaders have pointed out recently, 
simply signing a document cannot make the problems of their 
people disappear overnight. On the other hand, this government 
is convinced that all these problems of housing, social services, 
education and economic progress can be more effectively 
advanced and dealt with within the environment of greater local 
autonomy, a sound financial framework and equally and  
mutually respectful relations among governments at all levels. 
That is what self-government is essentially about. It is why this 
government has brought this legislation before the House.
<P>
	I conclude by urging all members of this House, including my 
friends in the Reform Party, to support this legislation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean): </B>Mr. Speaker, we are now 
only a few minutes away from adopting a bill on which my party 
the government and our Reform Party colleagues have worked 
for many hours.
<P>
	Before getting into the nuts and bolts of the bill before the 
House today, I would like to talk about how my perspective on 
the work of a parliamentarian has changed. It is light years away 
from what I expected my work as a parliamentarian to be, 
especially as a critic for a sector as difficult and complex as 
Indian Affairs. We sometimes think that the life of a 
parliamentarian, before we actually experience it ourselves, is 
very easy and that it is cocktail parties every evening.
<P>
	Since coming to Ottawa, and especially these last two weeks, 
I have not had time to go to cocktail parties; I have only had time 
to read through agreements one-foot thick in order to analyse 
them very quickly.
<P>
	I think I can say that I have learned to appreciate the 
complexity of the issues. For instance, since aboriginal issues 
are a federal matter, and being a member of a sovereigntist party, 
I have always adhered to the principle that we have two nations 
in Canada, Quebec and the rest of Canada. My point is that 
Quebec and Canada sometimes have different ways of 
approaching the issues.
<P>
	As a critic for the Official Opposition in a federal Parliament 
and as a member of the sovereigntist party, one has to be very 
diligent to ensure that one's positions are implemented. I am 
delighted to see that Quebec has led the way in this respect. The 
hon. member made this point earlier with respect to James Bay 
and the Northeastern Quebec Agreement-the Cree and the 
Naskapis-and I think this is a first in Canada. We led the way, 
and this fact has given me some very important tools. The issues 
are also complex because within the territory occupied by these 
two nations, there are about 600 native bands, each with its own 
identity.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	The word complex applies not only to the relations between 
two nations and the 600 native bands in Canada. Especially in 
Quebec, the situation is extremely difficult with regard to the 
aboriginal question. Extremely difficult, because unfortunately, 
we have tremendous problems with some of the reserves. I think 
the federal government is not doing everything it should to 
resolve these problems. My point is that the situation is not an 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5758"> 5758 </A></B>
<P>
easy one for a parliamentarian, especially an Indian affairs 
critic.
<P>
	There are other aspects which make being an Indian affairs 
critic a thankless job. The minister tables a bill for first reading, 
the same afternoon we receive a stack of documents a foot thick, 
and the next day I have to rise in the House to make two 
speeches. Imagine the amount of work, even if we are told 
subsequently that these documents were in public domain, we 
have other things to do as well. So not only do we have a difficult 
job but there is also a tremendous amount of work involved. We 
are now on our fifth bill on aboriginal affairs in two weeks, 
C-16, C-25, C-33, C-34, and C-36, and I personally introduced 
a motion on the north.
<P>
	Imagine the work we have to do! And that does not include our 
work on the standing committee. The committee has to go on 
with its study of the bill. Once again, I thought I would stay up 
all night only once during this session, but I did so twice, thanks 
to my friends in the Reform Party, because we discussed the 
issue all night. Fortunately, the hon. member for Jonquière 
relieved me at 2 a.m., because the sitting was starting to seem 
very long indeed, but I tell you that the job of Indian affairs 
critic is not an easy one.
<P>
	It is also vital for a critic to explain to his party how important 
it is to respect and understand the First Nations. And that is not 
always easy, considering the difficult and volatile context I just 
mentioned. It is also necessary to show that one has the political 
will, and I think the Bloc Quebecois, by supporting land claims 
in the Yukon and self-government for aboriginal peoples, has 
shown that it is prepared to understand these people.
<P>
	It may be scant consolation but I did find it satisfying to see 
that, despite all this hard work, I was able to sense the frustration 
of these people in the Yukon who had to wait 21 years for these 
negotiations to be concluded. All of the work that we have had to 
do to reach this third reading stage is nothing compared to the 
frustrations these people must have felt over the years.
<P>
	Understanding and respect are important considerations. I 
have in my office the Indian and Northern Affairs map showing 
the 600 bands scattered across Canada. Approximately one 
hundred different languages and dialects are spoken by these 
bands and first nations. Imagine the wealth of native culture, 
particularly with respect to language.
<P>
	As for the environment, in our economic analyses, our 
environmental concerns have always taken a back seat to other 
priorities. The opposite is often true for native peoples. We have 
to understand that the environment often tops their list of 
priorities. These are important considerations when it comes to 
adopting a bill such as the one now before us because, as we will 
see, the bill's provisions focus at considerable length on the 
environment.
<P>
	We also have to understand that in our view of modern 
economy, the main thing is for shareholders to earn as many 
dividends as possible on their shares. However, their primary 
concern is the environment. They are not interested in measures 
that will enhance or stimulate their economy, because these 
could harm or endanger the environment. We must also 
understand this extremely important aspect of native culture.
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	Last but not least, I want to touch on the question of power or 
authority. Later on, I would enjoy talking with the people of the 
Yukon to hear their views on power and democracy, and 
specifically on parliamentary democracy. We are accustomed to 
seeing people yell ``yea'' and ``nay'' and rise one by one for 
hours on end. In our system of parliamentary democracy, this is 
quite acceptable. However, for some this process is hard to 
understand because their concept of power is quite different.
<P>
	I can give you some typical examples of what happens on 
some reserves when negotiations take place. Because we are 
used to delegating authority, our first instinct is to say: Let us go 
meet with the appropriate authorities. We come before the band 
council and to our great surprise, after several negotiation 
sessions, we realize that the band council is not the only 
authority on the reserve. First nations have a very different view 
of authority than we do.
<P>
	I realized that sometimes the band council says yes one day, 
and no the next. Why? Because there are other authorities on the 
reserves with whom we are not in the habit of dealing. Among 
others, the elders have some authority. We view the elders as 
important, wise people, but for the natives, it goes much further 
than that. The elders are responsible for the presence of the 
others on the reserve and are seen as very wise. Others look to 
them constantly for advice and counsel.
<P>
	This view of authority is very important because when a band 
council has made a decision, the elders may that same day or in 
the days that follow give their view of the decision made. There 
are also the clan mothers, a totally different phenomenon than 
what we have in our society. Native societies are often 
matriarchal societies, whereas ours is a patriarchal society. We 
are accustomed to seeing the father as an authority figure, as the 
one who gets angry and who metes out punishment. The 
opposite is often true in native communities. Mothers have a 
great deal of influence, considerably more than they do in our 
society. Therefore, it is important to design new systems and 
new centres of authority within each reserve.
<P>
	We are used to the way things are done here in the House and 
often in the agencies we deal with. Decisions are made by simple 
majority. Fifty per cent plus one vote is all that is required to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5759"> 5759 </A></B>
<P>
make a decision, and the minority is then asked to come on side. 
They, on the other hand, will often debate an issue far longer 
until a consensus is reached. I think these things are important,  
because I want my colleagues to be aware of what it means to 
negotiate and hold talks with aboriginal nations. It is also very 
important to go there first-hand, as I did on several occasions, to 
try to establish such relations and see how they work. This may 
be a thankless assignment, but it is also extremely rewarding 
and, from a cultural standpoint, I must say that rubbing 
shoulders with them has been an ongoing source of personal 
enrichment for me.
<P>
	Now, concerning the bill-I hope you will forgive this aside, 
but I felt it was important to get it out before launching into the 
mechanics. What is self-government? A quick definition would 
relate the ``self'' to independence, the ability to make decisions 
in relation to a central authority. This is what will be before us 
today with the bill. And ``government'' means the act of 
governing and providing political direction. So these people 
will effectively be able to make decisions on very specific points 
of jurisdiction, which are in the agreement that I will explain 
later. This is what self-government means to some extent, and I 
thought it was important to start with a brief definition.
<P>
	In keeping with the argument I developed previously, no two 
self-government agreements can be exactly alike. Some people 
associate self-government with a territorial base, and this is so 
in the case before us today. Others already have a territorial base 
and are not necessarily seeking to expand that territory, but 
rather want to be given specific points of jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
	Again, depending on their culture, they will ask the 
government during negotiations to give them back such and 
such area of jurisdiction-be it education, health care, social 
services, police or language. These areas may vary from one 
nation or reserve to the next.
<P>
	We must understand that there is no general model. It cannot 
be said that self-government will be handled the same way for 
all 600 bands in Canada. That is impossible.
<P>
	I pointed out earlier the importance of knowing their culture, 
their language and their respect for the environment, that is, 
their great customs and traditions firmly rooted in their genes, I 
would say. Some preconditions must be met before this type of 
negotiations can be entered into. I think the first nations must be 
willing to take control of their own destiny. The Yukon people 
that I have met seem to have this will. They showed us time and 
again that they wanted to plan their own future and get rid of the 
famous Indian Act guardianship. If the minister and the Liberal 
government are to be believed, they want to dismantle the 
Department of Indian Affairs and revoke the Indian Act.
<P>
	I think this agreement fits in with the idea of taking control of 
their own destiny and getting rid once and for all of the Indian 
Act and the guardianship of Indian Affairs.
<P>
	There is also a will to respect other people's cultures. I think 
the Bloc Quebecois has also shown that we were able to 
understand these people and that they understood us as well. I 
noticed a little sadness when debate dragged on, but they must 
understand that we are living in a democracy under a system 
different from theirs and that, unfortunately, they had to go 
through the process that took place here in recent days. So I 
think they are in a position to understand that this is the way the 
Canadian government operates.
<P>
	I now want to make a short statement on what I said at the 
beginning of my speech about the importance of the James Bay 
Agreement affecting the Cree, as you know, and the 
Northeastern Quebec Agreement affecting the Naskapi. That is 
something the Bloc Quebecois must rely on because it was a 
first, an agreement that was hard to reach, I admit, but so 
rewarding and important in paving the way for other aboriginal 
nations.
<P>
	I want to congratulate Quebec on how it approached these 
very complex negotiations with aboriginal nations. Not only 
was Quebec willing to negotiate but it made an effort to 
understand, as the money it spent on this demonstrates.
<P>
	We see again that Quebec, to its credit, has a strong value 
system and that its respect for other peoples is reflected in these 
agreements. For instance, if we consider the financial impact 
and what the Government of Quebec contributed through 
Hydro-Quebec, most of the money in these agreements came 
from Hydro-Quebec and the Government of Quebec, while the 
agreements that have been before the House lately include very 
little in the way of financial input from the provinces involved.
<P>
	It is clear that the federal government is very generous to 
aboriginal people outside Quebec, but the situation is different 
in Quebec, although, we decided to try to reach an agreement 
with these people in an atmosphere of mutual respect. It took 
time, and of course there are still the occasional clashes today. 
There are still some irritants, but I can assure you that on the 
Quebec side we are trying to smooth out the rough spots.
<P>
	I think it is important to point out that the James Bay 
Agreement was a first, an example that was followed by many 
other aboriginal nations.
<P>
<B>(1845) </B>
<P>
	In fact, the list of jurisdictional items that are included in the 
agreement before the House today was already to a considerable 
extent included in this agreement, and that is why I say that the 
James Bay Agreement was a pioneer in this respect.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5760"> 5760 </A></B>
<P>
	As far as administration is concerned, and I will now get back 
to the bill before us today, these people will no longer be 
dependent on programs administered directly by the Department 
of Indian Affairs. They will finally be able to say: We have 
values, we have a different culture and we intend to run our 
affairs in our own way in accordance with our own culture and 
traditions and with a greater say over our own economy, which is 
as it should be in a modern economy.
<P>
	I wish them good luck with the language aspect, those who are 
in the visitors' gallery today. Since there are six or seven 
languages and the common denominator there is English, I hope 
that aboriginal languages will command a greater appreciation 
and that aboriginal people will be able to exercise much tighter 
control over aboriginal languages. I also hope they will not 
experience what happened in Quebec to the French language.
<P>
	You know about Bill 101 and Bill 178, and we in Quebec are 
constantly under attack from Supreme Court judgments. I also 
know that Quebecers are prepared to respect the terms of 
agreements with aboriginal peoples. I hope that as far as 
aboriginal languages are concerned, the Supreme Court will stay 
put and not do anything that would destroy aboriginal languages 
in the Yukon as was done in Quebec.
<P>
	As far as health care is concerned, people will have greater 
control over health care, which is quite an achievement. I say 
this because once again, their culture has shown us that they take 
a very unique approach to medicine and health care. It is a 
holistic approach which focuses more on prevention than on 
cures. We see a lot of healing circles, which are an important 
resource. Kateri hospital in Kanawake, for instance, takes a very 
different approach. The physicians who work at the hospital 
went to a traditional white school, but with their culture they 
also have an approach that is far more holistic, as I just said.
<P>
	There is a series of other programs, and I do not intend to 
repeat the speech I made in second reading, but perhaps I could 
expand somewhat on the roles of the traditional economy and a 
modern economy. This is something of a challenge for them, and 
I think they will be able to meet that challenge. The traditional 
aboriginal economy, particularly in the Yukon, is based on 
trapping, fishing, fruit gathering, and so on, in the ancestral 
way. It is an economy which has always existed and I think it 
should be preserved.
<P>
	Now we must also ensure that integration into the modern 
economy does not simply sap and devastate this traditional 
economy. Knowing the aboriginal nations and the importance 
they place on the various facets of their traditional economy, 
such as gathering, hunting and fishing-because this has gone 
beyond mere subsistence and can also involve marketing 
activities-I think they will go out of their way to ensure its 
smooth integration with the modern economy.
<P>
	I also think it is important to talk about law enforcement. I did 
not get a chance to speak on the young offenders bill, but I must 
point out that there are enormous justice problems on aboriginal 
reserves. It is increasingly obvious that our justice system 
cannot apply, or is extremely difficult to apply to aboriginal 
nations. Delinquency rates are high, incarceration rates are also 
high. This may be-and in fact is-attributable to appalling 
social conditions. Economic and social conditions are extremely 
bad, so that people tend to turn to drugs and drink-with all of 
the resulting ills in terms of delinquency and incarceration rates. 
So, given the opportunity to administer the justice system a little 
more, their justice system being slightly different from ours, 
law enforcement will be more tailored to their standards.
<P>
<B>(1850) </B>
<P>
	A person who commits a crime may not necessarily have to go 
before a judge or go to jail. They have a sort of discussion circle, 
and often the entire community will discuss an adolescent's 
particular problem and try to develop an action plan to 
rehabilitate the individual without necessarily imposing 
incarceration. These are important considerations that must be 
raised to explain that their culture is different.
<P>
	The bill contains all of these concepts, and it is safe to say that 
the people of the Yukon will be taking far greater control over 
their future. I will conclude to leave a little time for my friends 
in the Reform Party. The Bloc Quebecois will support Bill C-34, 
as we stated in committee and at second reading.
<P>
	I would like to review some of the points raised by the hon. 
member who preceded me. I think the Reform Party left 
aboriginal people and, I think, other Canadians with a bad 
impression; people think they may be going too far. I think 
people in the Reform Party might take advantage of the next few 
minutes to try to erase the picture which Canadians and 
aboriginal people now have of them. Naturally, I would ask them 
to vote in favour of Bill C-34.
<P>
	Finally, the elders who were there will be pleased to note that 
the present generation has concluded an agreement which will 
benefit their children's children. This agreement was entered 
into peacefully, without the use of weapons, solely through 
perseverance. I ask all of my colleagues to vote in favour of Bill 
C-34.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to 
divide my time, if that is possible, with the member for Calgary 
Southeast.
<P>
	Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for this opportunity to debate Bill 
C-34. Before I get into the specific clauses of this bill that will 
allow self-government for 14 Yukon Indian bands, I wish to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5761"> 5761 </A></B>
<P>
again express my objections to the strategy the government 
chose in introducing this bill into the parliamentary process.
<P>
	I use the precise words of the minister of Indian affairs: ``The 
scope and complexity of these agreements is unprecedented. 
This government has used all means at its disposal to stifle 
public exposure of this legislation''. That begs the question: 
Why?
<P>
	This party had no desire to block this legislation and could not 
even if we chose to. We simply wanted time for adequate public 
scrutiny, examination and meaningful debate. Was this 
unrelenting bullying simply to satisfy someone's ego or is it, as 
some aboriginal people suggested to me, to prevent proper 
examination and exposure of the fact that this is a move to 
exploit the desire for dollars of current band leadership to 
extinguish aboriginal rights now provided through the treaties 
and the Indian Act? Time will tell.
<P>
	While this was procedurally allowable, I would remind those 
members who were in opposition in the last Parliament to 
remember their own cries of objection when the Conservative 
government imposed those conditions on themselves and the 
Liberals' promise in the red book to do things differently.
<P>
	To those who would dismiss our demands for fairness I would 
like to quote from this very self-government agreement in the 
preamble where there is a definition of consultation, which I 
presume was what was supposed to be taking place here. That 
definition says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Consultation means to provide to the party to be consulted notice of a manner 
to be decided in sufficient form and detail as to allow that party to prepare its 
views on the matter, and a reasonable period of time in which the party to be 
consulted may prepare its views on the matter and an opportunity to present 
such views to the party obliged to consult.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Surely this House deserves at least the same consideration as 
that provided in the agreement.
<P>
<B>(1855 ) </B>
<P>
	Since these bills cannot come into force until pending surface 
and subsurface legislation is introduced in the fall, it seems 
reasonable that these bills could have stayed in committee for 
the summer and had proper analysis without in any way delaying 
their implementation.
<P>
	However having gained some time, I am more and more 
coming to the realization of my question of the minister in 
committee before his unprovoked attack upon me. My question 
was of his vision of self-government. We are now beginning to 
see his vision. It seems to be that of sovereign nation states 
within Canada with powers in some cases parallel to the federal 
government fully funded by the Canadian taxpayer.
<P>
	The member from Churchill during the committee process 
continually demanded an answer as to who in fact holds title to 
the lands in Canada. It is becoming clearer and clearer that this 
government's idea is that the aboriginal peoples of Canada still 
retain title to the lands in Canada and we as non-aboriginal 
people are simply leasing or renting the land that we are using 
and occupying. I might notify all Canadians that as of today the 
rent is going up on the land that we occupy.
<P>
	I must now voice our concerns on behalf of all Canadians with 
this legislation. First, I must question why we are now being 
asked to pass this self-government legislation when only four 
out of 14 bands being given self-government have agreed to 
sign this agreement.
<P>
	I am aware that all 14 bands have agreed to the umbrella 
agreement but the 10 non-signatories must be trying to 
negotiate substantially different agreements or there would have 
been 14 agreements before us today instead of 10. I suspect very 
much that the hesitation of the other 10 has much to do with the 
extinguishment of some very fundamental aboriginal rights.
<P>
	Should the governor in council have the authority to approve 
the remaining 10 agreements without the examination of 
Parliament? I question this. It goes right to the question of what 
in fact are we here for? In addition to the aforementioned 
concerns, I have concerns about the minister's remarks when 
leading off the discussion when he said that these 
self-government agreements do not have constitutional 
protection. They may, however, be revisited to apply this 
protection when his government is able to define the inherent 
right to self-government. I submit this statement has a serious 
impact on the goals of clarity and certainty which were to be 
achieved.
<P>
	There are a number of very subtle references in this agreement 
that I believe and our legal counsel agrees have very important 
implications for this country. These references will no doubt be 
discounted by others as simply wording but I am sure most 
people here know full well the difference wording can make in 
the interpretation of legal documents.
<P>
	This is the first time I am aware of any piece of legislation 
dealing with Canada's aboriginal people referring to these 
people as First Nations and to the people involved as citizens 
instead of participants. This subtle wording could have 
implications not only in the international community but also in 
the self-determination of other cultural groups likely to be dealt 
with in this country soon.
<P>
	We are giving legitimacy to nations within nations and 
beginning the dismantling of Canadian confederation. I 
question if we as Canadians should be setting up ethnically or 
racially based homelands when South Africa is just celebrating 
an end to the same system because it found it to be 
discriminatory, divisive and most undesirable. It might even be 
open to challenge under the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms on the ground that it discriminates on the basis of 
race.
<P>
	I find it surprising that the Liberals and NDP so quickly 
support this concept. In a biography of T.C. Douglas, the much 
respected first leader of the NDP by Doris F. Shackleton, she 
states: ``The practical obvious solution is to do away with the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5762"> 5762 </A></B>
<P>
reserves and the degradation that goes with stewardship and 
integrate the Indians with all speed into Canadian society''.
<P>
	Is this ambition now too obvious and too practical for today's 
NDP? When the leader of the Liberal Party was the minister of 
Indian affairs his department published a white paper on the 
status of Indians. The proposal of that document formulated by 
the now Prime Minister was that Indian citizens should become 
equal citizens of the provinces and of the country.
<P>
<B>(1900 ) </B>
<P>
	In recent weeks there has been much discussion whether the 
charter would apply to aboriginal self-government. On two 
occasions the minister of aboriginal affairs said the charter 
would apply to this legislation. This certainly has not turned out 
to be the case.
<P>
	In spite of the fact that this party introduced an amendment 
that would allow the Charter of Rights and Freedoms clearly to 
apply, the government and the House refused the amendment. 
That begs the question, was it refused because the Indian 
leadership did not want it or was it refused because the 
government did not want it. Either way there are serious 
questions that need to be answered.
<P>
	Clause 8 of the bill which refers to an as yet unadopted 
constitution by an as yet undefined government structure calls 
for the recognition and protection of the rights and freedoms of 
citizens. There is now expert legal opinion that the charter 
probably does not apply to aboriginal self-governments unless 
special provisions are made.
<P>
	We believe the protection of the charter must apply for the 
same reasons the aboriginal women of Canada voted against 
Charlottetown. It is not some idle thought or idle dream of the 
Reform Party to be obstructionist. I would like to quote from an 
article in the <I>Free Press</I> recently by an aboriginal person. Make 
note that these are not my words. They are the words of an 
aboriginal woman and an elder of an aboriginal band.
<P>
	``One thing for sure, I am not for this self-government. All it 
is going to do is make a lot of men think they are high 
politicians. I know native men. They are still trying to be 
dominant. All this power will go to them. According to the 
native men, women are just supposed to follow them around like 
little puppies''.
<P>
	The native elder goes on to say: ``Aboriginal leaders have 
failed in their efforts to improve conditions and now expect to be 
trusted with more power. Everything they,'' that is the 
aboriginal leaders, ``have done backfires. We are supposed to be 
running our reserves and we are $1.4 million in debt. We have no 
control now. There are drunks everywhere, bootleggers in every 
corner of the reserve. The law was strict before. Now there is no 
law. How can we say yes when there is no control. This may be 
good for Ovide Mercredi and the chiefs. They can fly all over 
Canada. Winnipeg has become a paradise for our chiefs. Now 
they want to put in self-government''.
<P>
	Those are the words of aboriginal people so when it is said 
that all aboriginals, all people, support the agreement there are 
other opinions.
<P>
	Clauses 11, 13, and 20 refer to the law-making powers of 
these self-governments and schedule III, parts I, II, III and IV 
spell out in detail the areas of jurisdiction.
<P>
	In most of these 44-plus areas one would naturally assume 
that self-governments would have jurisdiction but there are 
notable exceptions where power formerly granted only to 
provinces is given to these governments.
<P>
	Schedule III, part III, No. 7 appears to give authority over 
gaming and lotteries.
<P>
	Number 13 provides control over operation and licensing of 
motor vehicles.
<P>
	Number 14 provides control over the manufacture, supply, 
sale, exchange, transportation, possession and consumption of 
intoxicants, i.e. alcohol or drugs.
<P>
	Number 17 provides control over the administration of 
justice.
<P>
	This unprecedented power and control raises questions of the 
approach aboriginal governments will take to access these lands 
in question. I believe there are ominous signs also and I would 
like to demonstrate with a couple of these examples as well.
<P>
	In the Slave River <I>Journal</I> of Fort Smith on June 8, 1994, 
there was an article telling of a Mr. Ray Decorby who was shot in 
the leg for trespassing on Indian lands while he was trying to 
photograph birds.
<P>
	Another example that might apply is a subdivision in the 
township of Archipelago where the Indian band involved 
erected a steel gate across the road denying access to 
non-aboriginal homes and cabins on the lake and demanded $5 
million for passage through the gate.
<P>
	Everybody in the House heard what happened at the Mohawk 
reserves in Quebec and southern Ontario when the Canadian 
military dared to trespass on Indian lands.
<P>
	The provision of these powers goes well beyond powers 
granted to any government subordinate to provincial 
governments in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1905 ) </B>
<P>
	In the briefings the minister told us the agreement would 
provide clarity and certainty and would be much less expensive 
than the current situation for Canadian governments and people 
wishing to do business in Yukon. We have to question how this 
will be possible when now instead of three levels of government 
to deal with in Yukon, anyone wishing to do business in that part 
of Canada will have to deal with 17 different governments. Each 
government will have its own bureaucracy, taxes, laws and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5763"> 5763 </A></B>
<P>
regulations. It sounds like an expensive bureaucratic nightmare 
of gigantic proportions.
<P>
	I have consistently expressed support for the concept of 
aboriginal self-government and self-determination. I will 
support every measure designed to provide the Indian citizen 
with the same opportunity as I want for my children and 
grandchildren. I will resist every attempt that is made to relegate 
Indian citizens to a separate status of citizenship based on ethnic 
origin.
<P>
	The implications of this legislation are far reaching. These 
agreements, whether or not the aboriginal people of Yukon 
wish-

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="YUKONFIRSTNATIONSLANDCLAIMSSETTLEMENTACT">YUKON FIRST NATIONS LAND CLAIMS SETTLEMENT 
ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development)</B> moved that Bill C-33, an act to approve, give 
effect to and declare valid land claims agreements entered into 
between Her Majesty the Queen in right of Canada, the 
Government of the Yukon Territory and certain First Nations in 
the Yukon Territory, to provide for approving, giving effect to 
and declaring valid other land claims agreements entered into 
after this act comes into force, and to make consequential 
amendments to other acts, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elijah Harper (Churchill):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives me 
great honour to participate in this debate and also to recognize a 
process which should have been resolved many, many years ago. 
It has taken a long time to get the recognition we deserve as First 
Nations in this country we call Canada, which happens to be an 
Indian word. I do not know if Reform members know what that 
means. Certainly they need to understand the real history of the 
country which today we call Canada. If it was not for the 
kindness and the generosity of the First Nations and its people 
this rich country would not benefit anybody.
<P>
<B>(1920) </B>
<P>
	I know we are talking about the land claims settlement 
agreement and also self-government but often times we 
combine the two because that is our philosophy, our way of 
thinking. We cannot isolate the land from day-to-day life. Our 
existence depends on the land and it is very important that 
people understand that.
<P>
	If I go back to the time of the first European contact the 
governments that came to this country were met by First Nations 
on the shores of the St. Lawrence River or on the west coast of 
British Columbia or on Hudson Bay and Winnipeg. The First 
Nations met these people and that relationship has never been 
concluded, has never  been finalized. Certainly across the 
country there have been many agreements and treaties made 
with First Nations and that process has extended to areas where 
treaties have not been made such as the Northwest Territories 
and Yukon.
<P>
	I always say that the first order of business has never been 
concluded with the first people, the first inhabitants, the First 
Nations.
<P>
	The treaty making process is about establishing relationships. 
When the crown or the Queen's representatives came to this land 
they made treaties with the First Nations. What does it mean 
when you make treaties or agreements with the First Nations? It 
means that we entered into agreements. We established a 
relationship and these treaties and the modern day agreements 
are those agreements.
<P>
	Treaties that were signed many years ago and today are about 
establishing relationships, how we are going to live with each 
other. Certainly the treaties that we signed in western Canada 
hundreds of years ago are still an ongoing process. They have 
not come to an end. Governments still have outstanding 
promises, treaty promises. We still have outstanding treaty land 
entitlements. We still want to resolve some of the issues like 
education that were promised to the Indian people.
<P>
	Those things are ongoing. The treaties were signed years ago 
but it is an ongoing process because it is about establishing a 
relationship.
<P>
	As I have said many times, we have never surrendered or 
extinguished the right to govern ourselves. As a matter of fact 
when the treaties were entered into, the Queen's representative, 
the crown, never questioned the authority and the jurisdictions 
of the First Nations. They respected it.
<P>
<B>(1925 ) </B>
<P>
	That is the fundamental relationship that the First Nations 
have with the Government of Canada, the treaty relationship. No 
other group of Canadian people have that relationship. It is a 
special relationship that we hold sacred and we bind the 
government to honour those commitments. Our elders tell us 
those are sacred agreements.
<P>
	It is not something that was given to us. Our way of thinking, 
our philosophy, is to share what we have. Certainly in terms of 
land, our philosophy is that we cannot own it but rather we could 
only share it with the newcomers to this country.
<P>
	There was conflict over the different value systems that the 
Europeans, when they came to this land, wanted to impose. They 
had a different value system such as land tenure which was quite 
foreign to us. Somehow they conferred that title on to us and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5765"> 5765 </A></B>
<P>
later negotiated it back so that they somehow would justify their 
occupation of this country.
<P>
	If one looks at the Indian philosophy, our way of thinking, 
governments did not need to do that because our way of thinking 
is to share what we have, including the land and resources that 
we signed in our treaties, including in the Northwest Territories 
and today in the Yukon settlement.
<P>
	We have been very patient, very generous, very kind and we 
have never rejected anyone who came to this country. As a 
matter of fact, we extended our hand to the rest of the world for 
the kind of country this can be, this great country that we call 
Canada today.
<P>
	Sometimes I cannot fathom the thinking of the Reform Party 
in which it questions the land that is being claimed and settled 
with the aboriginal people. Our people never questioned their 
generosity to the rest of the people. We never questioned that 
because that is our way to extend a hand, to share what we have. 
That is our greatest strength as First Nations people.
<P>
	What is happening today, what we are trying to retain are parts 
of the country, parts of our territory, so that we can continue to 
live traditionally and with the rest of society. If one looks at the 
relationship from day one and if one looks at the European 
people who came into this country, they were out to look for 
treasures, to conquer the world, to seek the riches of the world.
<P>
	They came to this land and found the First Nations people who 
were very kind and generous here. They never knew the concept 
of land tenure, to own the land. The concept is as foreign as 
owning the air. That is how foreign that concept was to our 
elders at the time when we signed the treaties.
<P>
	Treaties are about establishing relationships so that we would 
live with each other, so that we would live side by side with each 
other, so that we would honour each other, so that we would 
respect each other and not to dominate each other such as the 
case has been over the past hundreds of years.
<P>
<B>(1930) </B>
<P>
	Many of the people who were signing treaties went back and 
started implementing a policy of the government which totally 
dominates us today as First Nations people. They passed an 
Indian Act which has been in place for a hundred years. It affects 
us on a daily basis as to whom we are today. It defines us as 
Indians. It even contributes to the conflict and chaos in our 
communities.
<P>
	With the new Bill C-31 we have many categories of Indian 
people. We have status people. We have non-status people. We 
have treaty Indians. We have Bill C-31 Indians. We have band 
Indians. Governments have tried to define us, but we have 
always said that we are First Nations. The definition of 
membership should belong to the First Nations government. It 
should define who are its members.
<P>
	People often wonder why we are not improving our lives in 
the communities or the conditions we live in. We still have poor 
housing conditions. We have no running water. We have no 
electricity. Infrastructure is terrible. If we look at the statistics 
in terms of illnesses and hospital use by First Nations people, 
they are high. The suicide rate would be four times as high, four 
times the national average. Our children drop out of high school 
at an early age. Oftentimes they are symptoms of the social 
conditions we live in, symptoms of the lack of control in our 
communities.
<P>
	We are not asking the government to give us something. We 
are asking the government to share what we have, to respect our 
governments, to respect our ability to control our lives and to 
respect that we are able to determine our own future. This is not 
about living in a different world because Canada belongs to 
everybody. To the aboriginal people it is not about separating. 
There is no threat of separation in the country.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Churchill):</B> We are not asking for land. Unlike 
the Bloc our intention is not to separate. Our intention is to keep 
the country together, to live with each other.
<P>
	I just want to get back to the original terms of our relationship. 
It is important to understand why we live in the conditions on 
our reserves. The first and most destructive piece of legislation 
that has kept us under wraps has been the Indian Act. I have 
always thought the Indian Act would have established the 
relationship between the governments of Canada and the First 
Nations, not one that totally binds us or totally shackles us on a 
daily basis. By trying to do away with the Indian Act the 
government can address the issue. At least it will put the control 
of our lives and our destinies in the hands of the First Nations. 
We have never signed away or bargained away that right.
<P>
	Governments outlawed many of our ceremonies. They 
basically outlawed our Indian spirituality. Indian spirituality is 
a way of life for us. Governments outlawed the dances, the 
ceremonies and the potlatch. Basically they outlawed how we 
manifested our relationship with the Creator. It was against the 
law to do that.
<P>
<B>(1935 ) </B>
<P>
	Indian spirituality is a way of life. In order to establish a 
relationship with oneself, with one's family and with the 
community one needs to have that spirituality in oneself to 
establish that relationship, to be able to establish the 
relationship with other people who have come to this country of 
Canada, even to establish the relationship with the environment, 
with all living things, with the land, the air, the water, all the 
trees and all the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5766"> 5766 </A></B>
<P>
animals. We need to have that. In order to be able to function as a 
society, able to function as a government we need to have that.
<P>
	In order to have any kind of sense of moral values you need to 
have respect that there is another way of doing things, not just 
your own way. People need to recognize that. When they 
outlawed all these things, the classic example of how we were 
beaten, even for speaking our language, was done through the 
educational system. People were strapped for speaking their 
language when we went to residential school.
<P>
	Many people can talk to you about the instruments that the 
governments used to assimilate us, to integrate us. Even cultural 
genocide is written in black and white as to the intentions of the 
government. Certainly when they outlawed the spiritual aspect 
of our people they destroyed many people. We might as well 
have existed with no heart and no soul. We might as well have 
been just basically robots running around without any kind of 
conscience or any kind of moral values.
<P>
	Let me tell you that aspect has never been taken away. It has 
been our strength because today we have survived many years of 
assimilation and persevered despite government policies.
<P>
	I said in my statement yesterday about Aboriginal Solidarity 
Day that we are a great nation, that we are a great people, that 
greatness is not measured by material wealth, but is measured by 
how much we are able to give and how much we are able to 
share.
<P>
	That has been demonstrated by the First Nations to the rest of 
the world by what kind of people we are today. That as I said has 
been our greatest strength and has made us endure all kinds of 
things that have been thrown in our way. Today we are resolving 
a small portion of the country in which many of the First Nations 
live in the territory of Yukon in order to settle their land claims.
<P>
	If we look at the tremendous contributions that the aboriginal 
people have made, this is a very small aspect of what they are 
getting. If we look at all the Indians, First Nations across the 
country, when they signed the treaties and shared the land and 
the resources, how much can we calculate in terms of dollars? 
How much can we calculate in terms of dollars has that been to 
the cost of the aboriginal people?
<P>
	It probably runs into billions, maybe trillions of dollars, that 
the First Nations have shared so that other people can live in this 
country.
<P>
<B>(1940 ) </B>
<P>
	When you look in the communities we live in third world 
conditions. Many of the necessities of the south in our 
communities in the north are considered luxuries. We have no 
plumbing on our reserves and no roads. We have to fly in. 
Unemployment is high.
<P>
	In the meantime the people in southern Canada benefit from 
the lands and resources we shared with the governments.
<P>
	Even if we get a small percentage, let us say 5 per cent of the 
land resources alone, there is enough for the government to be 
able to honour its commitment to the First Nations in this 
country.
<P>
	Canadian people question the government about their tax 
dollars but it does not have to necessarily get the money from the 
ordinary taxpayer to pay for its treaty obligations. I know we 
have to maintain the social programs such as medicare and 
family allowance, old age pensions. Those dollars generated 
from the income tax of ordinary Canadians or other means, the 
government does not necessarily use that money to pay for its 
treaty obligations.
<P>
	It is the land and resources which we shared that we expect the 
government to get the revenues generated. There is enough for it 
to give to the First Nations in order to honour its treaty 
commitments and treaty promises. I do not know how much that 
runs into. I think it runs into billions of dollars.
<P>
	I expect governments to recognize the First Nations as equals. 
That we will always have the ability to enter into treaties. We did 
not subject ourselves to the governments. That is one thing the 
Reform Party should understand. We have never been equals at 
the bargaining table.
<P>
	As I said there is no threat in that because our guarantee is to 
share the land resources. I might as well say our constitution is 
written in our hearts and enables us to share what we have.
<P>
	Often times I find that people and governments want certainty 
to the land. I know how business operates. I know the realities of 
business that need to be developed and companies would want to 
have a certainty in terms of ownership of land. I believe there is 
another way to deal with those things but it is not something that 
is part of the bill. I do have other opinions and other ways of 
dealing with that. At some point maybe later on we can talk 
about it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alfonso Gagliano (Saint-Léonard):</B> Mr. Speaker, on a 
point of order, I regret having to interrupt the hon. member's 
speech. I think you might find unanimous consent that he could 
share his remaining time with the member for Yukon.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, we agreed with members of the 
Liberal Party and the New Democratic Party to vote on this 
evening's adjournment motion first and then the Bloc Quebecois 
will give its 20 minutes to the leader of the NDP. If this is indeed 
the agreement we made, I would like the government House 
leader's assistant to confirm it.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think there is unanimous 
agreement in the House that when the House adjourns this day 
after completion of the business of the House it would be 
deemed to be adjourned as of tomorrow at the normal hour of 
adjournment. In other words, for all purposes June 23 in the 
standing orders would be counted as June 22 in the standing 
orders and accordingly when the House adjourns tonight it will 
be adjourned until September 19. If there is that understanding I 
think we can proceed as indicated.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, in negotiations with the other 
parties in the House we had come to an understanding that in 
spite of the fact that closure had been invoked on this bill 
yesterday we would have 20 minutes to speak to both bills, C-34 
and C-33.
<P>
	If in fact we do not have 20 minutes to speak to this bill then 
we will deny unanimous consent to adjourn today.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, my understanding is indeed that 
the Reform Party will have 20 minutes. I think that there is 
unanimous consent on both sides of the House to give them 20 
minutes, just as there is to give the leader of the NDP 20 
minutes.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a little problem with the 
math because the first hon. member who spoke has taken almost 
40 minutes. If we give another hon. member 20 minutes of 
course then the debate would suspend. Therefore we cannot give 
unanimous consent unless we are assured by all members of this 
House that we will have the 20 minutes that were agreed to.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the agreement is that the 
House will adjourn tonight and the standing order will be treated 
as though it were adjourning on June 23, that there will be 20 
minutes allotted to the hon. member for Yukon, 20 minutes 
allotted to one of the members of the Reform Party before the 
question is put, pursuant to the special order adopted yesterday. 
I think that would solve the problem.
<P>
	I understand also that the hon. member for Churchill will need 
another two minutes to complete his remarks. I think that might 
be included in the whole arrangement if that is satisfactory to all 
hon. members. If so I think we might proceed on that 
understanding.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like a ruling from the 
Chair that this is in fact possible under the closure motion that 
has been put forward and the time allocation of one hour, that 
this House can assure that Reform MPs will have either one 
member for 20 minutes or two members for 10 minutes to speak 
to Bill C-33.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Just so I understand as 
clearly as everyone else here, this agreement would only apply 
to the legislation that we are presently debating, that is C-33, 
and no other legislation afterwards. This is just applicable to 
C-33. Is that a clear understanding?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, we had agreement that all 
parties would have 20 minutes to speak to Bills C-33 and C-34. 
We are asking for that agreement to be kept.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Let me continue these 
negotiations. I am not trying to drag things out. Bill C-34 has 
passed so this unanimous consent being sought is on C-33 only. 
Agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Adjournment of the House.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I understand that portion.
<P>
<B>(1950 ) </B>
<P>
	Maybe it is not my role, but as attentive as we all were to the 
intervention by the hon. member for Churchill, if the hon. 
member for Churchill had five minutes to conclude his remarks 
then I would recognize someone from the Official Opposition, 
from the Bloc Quebecois for 20 minutes?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Let me start over. The 
member for Churchill would have five minutes.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Two minutes.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I tried. The hon. member 
for Yukon would have 20 minutes and an hon. member from the 
Reform Party would have 20 minutes.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yes.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Or they could split the 
time into two 10 minutes and then I can call the question. Is there 
unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Resuming debate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, the adjournment motion will be

<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Churchill):</B> I will just say that I recommend this 
bill to the members of the House of Commons. I hope that the 
Reform Party will support it because it is about Canada. It is 
about living together in this country and not trying to alienate 
each other. That is what we want.
<P>
	I want to say that I have been honoured to speak on this bill 
and I hope the motion is carried unanimously.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I always thought Indian 
time was on the longer side rather than on the shorter side. I 
thank the hon. member for Churchill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon):</B> Mr. Speaker, first, I 
would like to thank the Bloc Quebecois for their kindness in 
letting me speak on a subject that is very important to the Yukon 
and to the member for the Yukon, as well as for their support on 
these bills. I think that their support is very important and so was 
their contribution to this debate. We in the Yukon appreciate 
their support for these bills.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is with pleasure that I rise today to speak on these bills that 
are so important to the Yukon and to the future of the Yukon. 
There has been much said in the House on this debate about 
giving something to Indian people. In fact these bills give a 
great degree of autonomy to the Yukon people, aboriginal and 
non-aboriginal. Certainly the land was never conquered when 
Europeans first came to the Yukon and elsewhere in Canada. The 
land was taken and assumed. It was never ceded.
<P>
	What we are doing this evening is an extremely important 
historical event in that we as democratic members of Parliament 
in a democratic country are recognizing the importance of 
redressing those historical wrongs.
<P>
	This legislation has been a long time coming, more than 20 
years of frustrating negotiations. We have seen a couple of 
generations grow up during these negotiations and tonight, we 
have the fruit of that dedication and spirit. We have a living 
document, a testament to the will and the commitment of the 
Yukon people. This legislation not only rights the bitter wrongs 
of the past but holds the key to the future, a future to which all 
Yukoners both aboriginal and non-aboriginal can look with 
pride and with hope. This legislation is a celebration of the 
Yukon spirit, that determination to meet all challenges, to carry 
on despite all obstacles and to work together to achieve a 
common goal even when the way is not easy.
<P>
<B>(1955) </B>
<P>
	The legislation is not the product of winners and losers. It is 
the product of many years of give and take and negotiation. It 
did not come easily. Each side had to cede on some of its 
objectives. Sometimes that was hard  to explain both to 
aboriginal people and to non-aboriginal Yukoners.
<P>
	As the previous speaker said the legislation represents a real 
definition, an attempt to work together in a co-operative way 
and to show that different cultures can live together in a 
harmonious and, even more important, respectful way, 
respectful of each other's languages and cultures.
<P>
	While we say the legislation was 21 years in negotiation, it 
might be more accurate to say that it was 92 years to this day, 
June 22, 1994. It was in 1902 that Chief Jim Boss spoke simply 
to the government about the need to protect the land of his 
people. He said: ``Tell the King we want something for our 
Indians because they take our land and our game''. With those 
simple words began the stand which has led us to where we are 
today.
<P>
	Chief Jim Boss' people were those who had for thousands of 
years hunted, fished and raised their families. They had a 
government system, a structural system, a cultural system, a 
justice system and an education system that they had devised as 
First Nations people in Yukon.
<P>
	Anthropological evidence indicates that in fact there were 
aboriginal people in the Old Crow area of Yukon at least 20,000 
years ago. With the coming of whalers to Herschel Island, the 
stampeders to the gold fields of the Klondike and thousands of 
American army engineers building the Alaska highway, 
cultures, languages, land and traditions were lost or eroded. 
Children were taken away from their families to residential 
schools. Communities were weakened by disease. Clans were 
scattered. Wildlife populations decimated. Critical habitat 
destroyed or altered and sacred places forgotten. One wonders 
how any vestige of pride and dignity or any shred of heritage 
could have survived, but it has survived in the wisdom of the 
elders and in the hope for the future.
<P>
	It was a little over 20 years ago that Elijah Smith, a Yukon 
Indian who had served his country in the second world war, 
came back to Yukon to fight for the rights of his people from 
within. It was Elijah Smith who 20 years ago travelled to Ottawa 
bearing a document entitled <I>Together Today For Our Children 
Tomorrow</I>.
<P>
	This evening is historic because this is the evening of 
tomorrow. I say that no one in Yukon expects this solves every 
problem that will ever arise in Yukon; but it is an attempt to 
build on that spirit of co-operativeness and of communalism 
that is part of the aboriginal tradition and part of Yukon history 
where people have learned that co-operation is necessary for 
survival.
<P>
	There are many important details in the legislation, both the 
land claims legislation and the self-government legislation that 
I will not review. They have been very thoroughly reviewed in 
committee as well as in the House. However I will review some 
concerns that have been raised. One concern often raised 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5769"> 5769 </A></B>
<P>
particularly by the  Reform Party is that of equality, that these 
agreements, these pieces of legislation, represent an inequity as 
opposed to something more equal. I fundamentally and 
profoundly disagree with that view. These pieces of legislation 
and the negotiations which led to them are based on very 
fundamental equality, respect and dignity of all peoples for each 
other.
<P>
<B>(2000) </B>
<P>
	The agreements also recognize that all aboriginal 
communities are not the same. There are different cultures, 
different languages and different traditions even within Yukon. 
Therefore there must be a degree of flexibility to successfully 
implement and acknowledge those differences.
<P>
	What is precedent setting? I have heard a great number of 
arguments about how dangerous these agreements are because 
they are precedent setting: we should all be very worried; we 
should be worried about apartheid; we should be worried about 
too many forms of government. It is quite the opposite. I think 
tonight is a night for rejoicing. The precedent set by these pieces 
of legislation is a very important one for the future of the 
country. The precedent is that different cultures or different 
linguistic groups can live together. They can do so successfully. 
They can negotiate to do so successfully and-this is the 
important precedent-they can do so within the context of 
Canada.
<P>
	There was testimony given before the standing committee on 
aboriginal affairs by the governor of Yukon. It is important to 
note there was a strong consensus in Yukon to see the legislation 
go through. I have rarely in my years in the House of Commons, 
and indeed my years before I was in political life, seen a 
consensus of this nature. It was not arrived at 21 years ago. It 
took 21 years to arrive at this consensus, but we are at a point 
now in Yukon where we see the Yukon legislature passing 
unanimously, all parties including independent members, this 
companion legislation. We see as well the chamber of 
commerce, groups ranging from outfitters, mining associations 
to francoyukonnaise and other groups in Yukon unanimously 
supporting the passage of the legislation.
<P>
	Questions have been raised about whether this was simply 
conducted behind closed doors. The previous government leader 
of Yukon in his testimony before the committee noted that 
during his government there were over 100 public consultations. 
The current government leader noted that they had many 
consultations with groups, with individuals and with 
communities and frequent discussions in every community of 
Yukon about the legislation as it proceeded.
<P>
	The Council for Yukon Indians during this period also 
undertook extensive consultation. It had many general 
assemblies to discuss matters and to establish its negotiating 
position. It has been a long and arduous process. I believe it has 
been a fruitful process. In a sense two decades of Yukoners have 
learned that it will be  necessary at times to compromise. In the 
end we will all gain from something of benefit to all of us.
<P>
	The self-government legislation is extremely important as a 
companion piece to the land claims. Once and for all it throws 
off the cloak of colonialism and acknowledges that aboriginal 
people are competent to run their own affairs, can run their own 
affairs and will run their own affairs. In the past I have heard 
people say they really believe in it but that maybe people are not 
ready. The people of Yukon, the First Nations of Yukon, have 
been ready for a long time and now is the time.
<P>
<B>(2005 ) </B>
<P>
	I would say as well that as we look at the implementation of 
these agreements, recognizing that there will be another 
agreement, the surface rights act, to be dealt with later in the 
session in the fall by this House, it will take all three pieces of 
legislation before a proclamation of these two pieces of 
legislation and that third piece of legislation.
<P>
	I do want to mention in fairness that there are people in the 
Yukon who have some concerns about their negotiations in land 
claims and their future. I am pleased that the standing 
committee on aboriginal affairs has recognized the concerns of 
the Kaska Dena Council which has transboundary claims and 
other concerns and has agreed to monitor the negotiations with 
the federal government that have been agreed to and will be 
undertaken and that its concerns were taken seriously. For this I 
certainly congratulate the chair of the standing committee and 
members that their concerns were taken seriously and will be 
dealt with.
<P>
	I suppose the essence of what we are doing here tonight, better 
than any words I would give or indeed anyone in this House 
might give, were given in testimony by Elder Matthew Tom to 
the standing committee on aboriginal affairs when he began his 
presentation and his prayer by saying: ``We are here to hold 
hands not be separate''. That is really what this is all about.
<P>
	Sometimes I believe that people feel that we do not have to 
deal with history and if we just move on it will be forgotten. I 
believe that we all know that in life you cannot just move on, 
that you must deal with some of the tragedies of history in order 
to move forward into the present.
<P>
	The words of Matthew Tom will always remain with me 
because it is the reason why I stand here in this House of 
Commons and that many Yukoners before me in politics and in 
First Nations have dedicated their life to this moment tonight.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5770"> 5770 </A></B>
<P>
	I understand that my time is nearly finished. I would 
conclude by saying that I would urge this House to unanimously 
support this legislation. It will show to Canadians that we 
understand that within Canada it is possible to recognize and 
respect our differences, our history and our traditions. I call on 
each member of this House to strike a voice tonight for that 
respect and for the future of our country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to acknowledge that I will be sharing my time.
<P>
	This is the first time I have had an opportunity to speak to this 
bill. When I first read the umbrella agreement on which this bill 
was based, I immediately had a number of concerns about the 
Yukon land claims agreements. I was concerned about the 
number, concerned about the fact that approximately 7,300 
Yukon Indians out of a total Yukon population of 32,000 will 
receive collective ownership of 16,000 square miles which 
includes all the subsurface rights on 10,000 square miles and 
some subsurface rights on the other 6,000 square miles. I have to 
ask: What do the other residents of the Yukon think of these land 
claims agreements? What do they think?
<P>
	In addition to a cash payment of almost $250 million the 
Yukon First Nations will also receive rental revenues from 
surface leases and royalties from the development of 
non-renewable resources. Additionally, the Yukon First Nations 
will receive a preferential share in wildlife harvesting. What 
impact will these agreements have on access to settlement lands 
by non-native people? We are asking these questions. We have 
heard a lot of rhetoric today but we have heard very little about 
the details of this agreement and how it is going to impact on the 
residents of the Yukon.
<P>
<B>(2010) </B>
<P>
	Will the Yukon First Nations allow hunters, trappers and 
fishermen on settlement lands and their much larger traditional 
territories? What is going to happen in that regard?
<P>
	Another concern that I had was that there was no financial 
balance sheet accompanying these agreements, none at all. I was 
concerned that the federal government will still be obligated to 
make the same payments to the Indian people in the Yukon. My 
understanding of settling the land claims and entering into 
self-government agreements was that the financial obligations 
of Canadian taxpayers would be reduced as a result of these 
revenues that would be replaced by royalties and resource 
revenues.
<P>
	What is the rationale for continuing to make increased annual 
payments to the Indian people under that kind of an 
arrangement? What control will the Parliament of Canada have 
over payment of taxpayers' dollars to the Yukon First Nations? 
Canadian taxpayers are asking Reformers these questions and I 
have yet to hear the answers.
<P>
	I was concerned that if we passed Bill C-33 that future land 
claim agreements with the 10 remaining bands in the Yukon will 
not have to come before Parliament for debate. That is a 
concern. They can be approved by cabinet through orders in 
council. That is the process written into this whole agreement. I 
have to ask why the government is trying to avoid the 
democratic right of the Canadian people to examine all aspects 
of each and every land agreement in the Yukon. Why are they 
being denied that right?
<P>
	Under clause 6 of Bill C-33 the rights contained in these land 
agreements are ``recognized and affirmed under section 35 of 
the Constitution Act of 1982''. Does this mean that the Yukon 
land claim agreements will now be entrenched in the 
Constitution? Are they now part of our Constitution? If they are 
entrenched how will they be able to be amended?
<P>
	If we want to change those agreements at any time, how will 
that happen? Clause 13 of Bill C-33 makes the provisions of the 
Yukon land claims paramount over all federal and territorial 
laws. Is this really what the government has intended? Is this 
really what the citizens of Canada want or do the people want the 
laws of Canada to apply equally to all its citizens regardless of 
where they live? Why is the government trying to ram these bills 
through without being as up front with the Canadian people as 
they have been with the Yukon Indians?
<P>
	Finally, I am very concerned about the precedent we might be 
setting by entering into these land claim agreements. Will the 
precedent set here apply to my province of Saskatchewan? Will 
it apply to Manitoba? Will we be asking these same questions a 
year or so from now relating to land claim agreements in all the 
other parts of Canada?
<P>
	Will future land claim deals contain all the same provisions, 
transferring the same powers and law making ability, a 
proportional amount of land, the same control over resources, 
similar royalty provisions and so on? The list can continue. Will 
this set a precedent for all of those things? Will the arguments 
made in future court cases refer to the precedent set in the Yukon 
land claims agreement? Have we thought through all of this? I 
have heard a lot of rhetoric but I have not heard anyone address 
that. This is why the amendments that we tried to make are so 
important. We were shut down.
<P>
<B>(2015) </B>
<P>
	The amendments that the Reform Party had proposed would 
have gone a long way to removing many of my concerns. The 
amendments proposed by our party would have answered many 
of the questions being asked not only by Reformers but all 
Canadians.
<P>
	I was talking to some people from Halifax the other day and 
we were discussing the Yukon land claims and self-government 
agreements. The gentleman said that he had not heard anything 
about these agreements. The people of Canada know precious 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5771"> 5771 </A></B>
<P>
little of what is  happening here. They do not understand the 
impact that these agreements will have on their home provinces.
<P>
	The government has the attitude that the quicker it can push 
this through the less waves it will make. It would rather not have 
the people know what is happening here today. I came to Ottawa 
to represent my constituents, to be their voice in Ottawa. I would 
not be doing my job if I had not raised their concerns in the 
House. We have to speak up.
<P>
	They have similar concerns to the ones I expressed here today. 
I even heard from an elder. I know many of these people in 
Saskatchewan. Some of them are my friends and they have 
raised similar concerns to the ones I have raised here today.
<P>
	People would rather not listen. They would rather not know 
what some of the grassroots native people are saying. They 
would like to hush it up. They would like to keep it quiet.
<P>
	This is a key element in the process we see here today. This 
elder from one of the reserves in my constituency complained of 
the Mafia tactics used by Indian leaders to suppress the will of 
the grassroots Indian people. We have received many similar 
complaints from Manitoba.
<P>
	Were non-native Yukon citizens given the opportunity to 
review and vote? Were they given the opportunity to review and 
vote on these agreements? People who do not know are 
answering but I do not hear the people who know. We are asking 
these questions to ensure that Parliament is signing agreements 
that the majority of Indian people and the majority of Canadian 
taxpayers will support.
<P>
	These land claim agreements may or may not be able to be 
changed in the future, so it is vital that all of these important 
questions be answered before this bill is passed by Parliament. 
When this bill is passed there will be 10 more land claim 
agreements that will be passed without any further scrutiny by 
Parliament.
<P>
	It is for this reason that Reformers want to take all the time 
that is necessary to examine, discuss, debate and amend this bill 
until we can get it absolutely right. I ask members to consider 
the process that is taking place here today. We have heard a lot of 
rhetoric but I have not heard many answers to these questions.
<P>
	Finally, the question of native self-government was put to the 
Canadian people during the Charlottetown accord referendum 
and we all know what the people said. They said no, and yet this 
government went ahead.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I wonder if the 
hon. member might assist the Chair. The first 10 minutes has 
lapsed and I am not clear whether it is an equal 10-minute split 
or if in fact, it is 20-minutes and the hon. member for 
Comox-Alberni will get the remaining time from the member 
for Yorkton-Melville.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> In a total of 20 
minutes, I have about a half-minute left.
<P>
	The government has run roughshod over everyone. It is 
implementing a concept that was not debated and approved by 
Canadians.
<P>
<B>(2020 ) </B>
<P>
	It is obvious this government does not even want this nation to 
debate this agreement. The people of Canada should be made 
aware of the fine print because really they are the ones who are a 
party to this agreement. It is between the Indians and the people 
of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have this opportunity to speak on Bill C-33, 
especially given the limited amount of time this government has 
allowed for the debate.
<P>
	This process that has taken place in the last 24 hours in this 
House has left me and many Canadians disappointed and 
disheartened. The same democratic principles that this House 
violated last night are ironically and also shamefully violated in 
this bill.
<P>
	I view with suspicion and concern the intentions of this 
government when the members of this House are denied the 
opportunity to debate this bill fully and completely. It appears 
that this government is trying to restrict debate and rush this bill 
through to hide the controversial contents of this bill from the 
Canadian public.
<P>
	This is the same strategy that the last government used a year 
ago in the Nunavut deal. Obviously this government has no 
intention to conduct business any differently than the last 
Conservative government. Indeed it has learned too well from 
its predecessors but seems to have forgotten the plunge to 
oblivion that closed door politics caused its predecessors.
<P>
	Bill C-33 sets a dangerous precedent and as such the contents 
of this bill cannot be viewed too lightly. I suspect that many 
members on the opposite side have not even read the terms of 
this agreement let alone given it constructive review. If they had 
I question how they could remain silent for so long on this issue. 
How can the members in good conscience agree to railroading 
this legislation through the way they are doing?
<P>
	There are many areas in this bill that need to be addressed and 
given careful consideration. Not only has this government 
moved closure on this bill but it also rammed the legislation 
through committee. This process increases the likelihood of any 
oversights. There has been little opportunity for honest 
discussion and debate on this bill as the government has made 
every effort to railroad it through the House at every stage of its 
passage.
<P>
	There are many flaws in this bill that must be addressed 
before they become law. This bill contains a clause which allows 
future changes to this legislation to be made, guess what, behind 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5772"> 5772 </A></B>
<P>
closed doors. As it stands, Bill C-33 allows for future 
negotiations and amendments to be decided by cabinet alone. 
This is another dangerous  precedent, not only with these 
negotiations but with future government negotiations.
<P>
	Is this how the government intends to conduct its business? Is 
this the new direction of the Liberal government? This makes a 
very sad joke of the red book commitments of more and open 
democratic government.
<P>
	Let me remind the government once again of its red book 
commitments and ask it to consider very carefully in light of this 
legislation. The red book says open government will be the 
watch word of the Liberal program. It is a shame that in reality 
these words are nothing but false promises.
<P>
	Why is this government in this bill planning to do business 
behind closed doors at the cabinet level? It clearly conflicts with 
the red book commitment of open government.
<P>
	Legislation should not be amended by a cabinet order. 
Legislation should be brought forward to this House, openly 
debated by each member elected here today.
<P>
	The laws of Canada must be created through democratic 
procedures to reflect the democratic system of every 
Parliamentarian in this House. The creation of new laws must be 
carried out in a fair and, I remind the House, open manner. Each 
elected parliamentarian represents his constituents in every vote 
to create or amend laws.
<P>
	In all fairness to the people of Canada who put us here today, 
every parliamentarian must be allowed to participate in this 
democratic process. This government has often lauded the 
principle that members are elected to represent their 
constituents' wishes in this House. However, cabinet on its own 
is not a democratic representation of the people and should not 
make legislative commitments.
<P>
<B>(2025) </B>
<P>
	If we are to allow cabinet to change and revise law without the 
consent of Parliament then why have we elected 295 members of 
Parliament when we only need 15 cabinet members to run the 
country? Is this the kind of red book democracy that we have 
been hearing about? Canadians deserve fair representation and 
this means bringing legislation before this House for all 
members to consider and debate in this House before it is 
passed.
<P>
	The scope of orders in council regarding future agreements is 
too large because this is little more than government by cabinet 
decree.
<P>
	Additionally, there are several other areas of concern in this 
bill. For example, section 14 states that there shall be paid out of 
the consolidated revenue fund the sums that are required to meet 
the monetary obligations of Canada under chapter 19. This is in 
the bill.
<P>
	According to the revision of this section more than $242 
million will be allocated to the 14 native bands which have 
agreed to the umbrella settlement with the federal government. 
Yet this government has not yet determined what its financial 
obligations toward these bands are. This bill gives money to 
native government without any obligation, requirement or 
mechanism to ensure that the money is distributed fairly. Where 
is the financial responsibility?
<P>
	When Canadians give their hard earned tax dollars to the 
government there is a measure of trust involved in the exchange. 
Canadians expect their government to be fiscally responsible 
and this section of the act clearly does not show that 
responsibility.
<P>
	I am sure that the government is aware of the need for 
financial responsibility and financial accountability to the 
Canadian people. I believe that is another red book commitment. 
Yet in this agreement the government arbitrarily provides a 
settlement that will amount to some $242 million and does not 
expect any financial accountability in return.
<P>
	Every individual is financially accountable to this 
government at the end of each year. Each of us here is expected 
to fill out our income tax forms and account for our earnings. 
Government departments, federally and provincially, are all 
accountable to the people. Why then are native groups exempt 
from this? There must be a system of financial accountability 
entrenched within this bill.
<P>
	Another area of concern is the section that gives the 
provisions of land claims or transboundary agreements still to 
be negotiated paramountcy over all federal and territorial laws. 
This means that these agreements and amendments to these 
agreements can supersede all laws of Canada. Federal and 
territorial laws must be paramount over all agreements in 
Canada. This should not even have to be a question. It should not 
even have to be discussed at this point.
<P>
	There can only be one set of laws to govern the people of 
Canada. We cannot have one set of laws to apply to one group 
and another set of laws to apply to another. This is clearly a 
dangerous precedent. It sets up two nations. It sets one group of 
Canadians apart from the laws that govern Canada and another 
group of Canadians.
<P>
	In summary, Canada is one nation. We must treat all 
Canadians equally under one law, not two or three sets of laws.

	The House proceeded to the consideration of Bill C-35, an act 
to establish the Department of Citizenship and Immigration and 
to make consequential amendments to other acts, as reported 
(without amendment) from the committee.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (for Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration)</B> moved that the bill be concurred in.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to.)
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> When shall the bill be

<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tobin (for the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration)</B> moved that the bill be read the third time and 
passed.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration):</B> Madam Speaker, I am very 
pleased to speak on third reading of Bill C-35.
<P>
	First I want to thank all members of the House for their 
co-operation and goodwill in seeing the bill through. Although 
the Department of Citizenship and Immigration Act is 
essentially a housekeeping measure, members from all parties 
have offered some very thoughtful and helpful comments.
<P>
	The bill has a straightforward and clear purpose: to provide a 
standard legislative basis for the Department of Citizenship and 
Immigration. The department now exists by virtue of Order in 
Council. For all its brevity and clarity the bill is significant for 
several reasons.
<P>
	One of the Prime Minister's first decisions-perhaps the hon. 
member for Beaver River would like to listen-on assuming 
office last fall was to create the new department. All members 
know why he gave it this priority.
<P>
	During the election campaign the Prime Minister spoke 
vigorously on the issue. Continuing to include immigration 
within a department of public security would send precisely the 
wrong message to Canadians and the international community.
<P>
	The bill carries through on the principles of the red book 
where we called for a dynamic approach to immigration, 
balancing humanitarian considerations with our demographic 
and economic needs.
<P>
	Under Bill C-35 the structure of the department will reflect 
that balanced approach. Joining citizenship with immigration 
has a compelling logic. It is a natural fit. To acquire citizenship 
is a significant step in integrating newcomers into Canadian 
society. It means making a personal commitment to Canada and 
understanding the requirements, privileges and responsibilities 
of becoming Canadians.
<P>
<B>(2035) </B>
<P>
	Citizenship completes the process begun by immigration. The 
department believes that citizenship and immigration spring 
from the same common values and aims. My hon. friend from 
Hamilton-Wentworth put it rather well in the House the other 
day. He said that immigration is the body of this country and 
citizenship is the soul. So the department makes good common 
sense in the way it brings together the operational policy and 
promotional aspects of both citizenship and immigration.
<P>
	The new department was created from parts of three others. 
Forging a common sense of purpose is not something that can be 
done overnight merely by order in council. Nearly 20 years ago 
the distinguished novelist and physicist C. P. Snow said that 
Canada has the finest civil service in the world today. I suspect 
that most Canadians do not realize it but it is a fact recognized 
by civil servants everywhere in the world. I hope that hon. 
members agree with me when I say that we want to be able to say 
that again, and sooner rather than later.
<P>
	With a legislative basis staff can concentrate on even more 
efficient delivery of services, knowing that their careers can 
progress on the same terms as in any other department. More 
important, as the minister said in the House on second reading, 
the legislation modernizes and streamlines the government to 
meet the needs of Canadians and gives us the tools we need to 
deal effectively with the myriad complex issues of citizenship 
and immigration.
<P>
	By taking programs, resources and responsibilities from 
several different departments and consolidating them in one 
department we make the government more accountable and 
more open.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5775"> 5775 </A></B>
<P>
	The department has a clear and logical continuum of 
responsibilities, stretching from the time someone applies to 
come to Canada to the time she or he takes on the obligations of 
being a citizen. These responsibilities include immigration 
applications, immigration levels and selection, 
federal-provincial relations on immigration, visa requirements, 
refugee matters, enforcement,  settlement, citizenship 
applications and registration, and citizenship promotion.
<P>
	Of course, citizenship does not end with swearing an oath and 
acquiring a document. In some ways it is only the beginning. 
That is why the new department will take a lead role in 
strengthening the values, identity and commitment required of 
all citizens, those who are born here and those who choose to 
come here. Citizenship, like immigration, is a two-way street.
<P>
	This week marks the 125th anniversary of Canada's 
immigration service. Indeed, today is the day. This bill marks 
one more step forward in our country's evolving and progressive 
history of citizenship and immigration legislation. This 
legislation will establish the integrated and simplified 
framework we need to address the challenges and the 
tremendous opportunities offered by immigration and 
citizenship.
<P>
	All members of Parliament recognize the need to overhaul our 
immigration policies and to consider the long term role of 
immigration and nation building. All of us recognize the need to 
improve the system. All of us know the importance of redefining 
and reinforcing our citizenship policies. All of us understand the 
profound effect that migration issues are having upon the world 
today.
<P>
	This government has moved actively on these important 
matters and we will continue to move actively. We are doing so, 
I believe, with a real sense of co-operation from all sides of this 
House. As Canadians we need to think about immigration in a 
bigger way. We need to get a clearer sense of where we are going 
and what kind of country we are building for the future. We have 
to clean up the problems with our immigration system, to stop 
the small number of abusers who undermine the overwhelming 
majority of hard working and honest newcomers.
<P>
	A Canadian author once said that the refugee is the every man 
and every woman of our time. We have to push even harder to 
ensure that the international community comes to grips with the 
problems confronting 20 million refugees every year, and 
especially the question of protecting women who are fleeing 
gender-based persecution.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The government has acted on this and it will continue to act 
and we do so with the co-operation of everyone in the House of 
Commons. With the legislation to establish the Department of 
Citizenship and Immigration, we will have the integrated and 
simplified structure that is essential for solving problems and 
taking advantage of the tremendous opportunities for 
immigration and citizenship.
<P>
<B>(2040 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This legislation establishes a modern, efficient and intelligent 
structure. With this structure we will be better equipped to 
introduce and carry through on fair and open policies to reunite 
families, offer safe haven for refugees, use immigration as a 
building block for economic growth and promote the concept 
and principles of citizenship.
<P>
	The legislation is obviously not designed to lay out specific 
details of immigration and citizenship policies. What Bill C-35 
does do is create a contemporary department that is best 
organized to carry out the policies we eventually agree on.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I began by saying that the legislation is short 
and straightforward and it is important.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I therefore urge members of the House of Commons to pass 
this bill without delay so that we can improve citizenship and 
immigration policies and thus contribute to our country's 
progress. This legislation is a step forward.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	With this positive step forward Canada and all Canadians will 
benefit.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise this 
evening to speak in the debate on third reading of Bill C-35, an 
Act to establish the Department of Citizenship and Immigration.
<P>
	Once again, as I already said on second reading, I tell you that 
I will vote against this bill, for almost the same reasons that I 
mentioned in my speech on June 13 in this House.
<P>
	Since there was no written document explaining this complex 
bill, which amends several laws, I carefully reread the speech 
given by the minister when he presented it. Unfortunately, the 
minister gave no details or precise justification at that time. His 
long speech covered only generalities concerning citizenship 
and immigration policy and of course he again praised his 
government.
<P>
	I agree with the principle of the bill and with merging 
immigration and citizenship in the same department. However, 
some people, myself included, question the department's name. 
Should it not be called the Department of Immigration and 
Citizenship and not the other way around? That is, should 
immigration not come before citizenship?
<P>
	In fact, the tens of thousands of new arrivals who come to 
settle in Canada every year are immigrants first and then several 
years later they become citizens.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5776"> 5776 </A></B>
<P>
	The main reasons that I will vote against this bill are as 
follows. First, clause 4 of the bill says that ``the powers, duties 
and functions of the Minister extend to and include all matters 
over which Parliament has jurisdiction relating to citizenship 
and immigration'' and I emphasize the word ``relating''.
<P>
	Obviously, this provision is too vague and too broad. 
Immigration has always been a shared federal-provincial 
jurisdiction and Quebec has had its own department and its own 
minister since 1968.
<P>
	Knowing the Liberal government's centralizing designs and 
judging by the inroads already made in these past few months, I 
fear that the minister and the department will unduly infringe on 
provincial powers.
<P>
<B>(2045) </B>
<P>
	I only mention the case of the COFIs here. In this House, we 
already denounced the minister's attempts to impose on this 
typically Quebec institution the obligation to promote Canadian 
unity. What a clear example of meddling in a field of exclusively 
provincial jurisdiction like education!
<P>
	The minister is required to respect the agreements signed by 
the federal government and the provinces, especially in 
Quebec's case, where the Cullen-Couture agreement and later 
the McDougall-Gagnon-Tremblay agreement are very specific. 
I want to warn the minister and tell him that the Bloc Quebecois 
will never allow the minister or his government to meddle in 
fields of provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	I remind you that other laws, including the one passed 
recently on the Department of Revenue, have specified and 
defined the minister's powers. Why was it not done in the bill 
under consideration? Another important provision is clause 5, 
which says that the minister, with the approval of the Governor 
in Council, may enter into agreements with any province, group 
of provinces or any agency thereof or with any foreign 
government or international organization, for the purpose of 
facilitating the formulation, coordination and implementation 
of policies and programs for which the minister is responsible.
<P>
	We submitted an amendment to eliminate the word ``agency'' 
to the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration. 
This is the only amendment that was accepted by the Liberal 
majority, since clearly the government must negotiate and sign 
agreements with the provincial governments which these 
agencies come under. We also proposed another amendment 
requiring the federal government to table the signed agreements 
in the House. Incredible as it may seem, the Liberal majority 
defeated this legitimate, very justified amendment.
<P>
	The Liberals even voted against tabling the agreements 
signed by ministers with other governments and with 
international organizations. Nevertheless, the tabling of such 
agreements is a common, justified practice in the legislatures of 
all democratic countries, since such  agreements sometimes 
provide for spending that the legislature is entitled to supervise, 
monitor and control. The minister and his department should be 
more open, especially because in his report for the fiscal year 
ending March 31, 1990, five fiscal years ago, the Auditor 
General of Canada devoted four chapters to all aspects of the 
immigration program.
<P>
	He came to the conclusion that the information provided to 
Parliament and therefore to the public was incomplete and 
fragmentary. The other major objection that we have to this bill 
concerns clause 10, amending the Department of 
Multiculturalism and Citizenship Act. This provision gives the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage and his Secretary of State for 
Multiculturalism the mandate to promote the Canadian identity. 
This is a new mandate and we have trouble understanding why 
the minister added this to a bill which he said is only 
administrative in nature.
<P>
	Why this urgency to promote the Canadian identity, if not to 
fight the sovereigntist movement on the eve of a provincial 
election in Quebec and a referendum to follow in 1995? 
Especially because when this government talks about Canadian 
unity, it denies or ignores the Quebec identity, for all practical 
purposes.
<P>
<B>(2050) </B>
<P>
	Another consequence of this provision is that it increases the 
already existing confusion between the mandate of the 
Department of Canadian Heritage and the mandate of 
Citizenship and Immigration. Although this function should be 
exclusive to the Minister of Canadian Heritage, the Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration has already begun to appropriate it 
by proposing new legislation on citizenship which according to 
him would be aimed at promoting both citizenship and 
important Canadian values.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the minister is becoming increasingly 
obsessed by the issue of Canadian unity. In the process, he is just 
fanning the flames of controversy between Quebec and English 
Canada. This discussion is not at all unifying, as the minister 
seems to think. The failure of federalism is the failure of Canada 
as a confederation.
<P>
	Last May the minister raised the rates for immigration 
services. For instance, an application for permanent residence 
for refugees, obtaining a visa, a minister's permit, passport, and 
so forth, all of which creates a lot of problems for refugees who 
do not have the wherewithal to pay $500 to obtain permanent 
residence.
<P>
	Yesterday, the minister announced new financing measures 
for immigrant services which will come into effect in 1995-96. 
The government will not pay the social benefits of teachers who 
give language courses for new immigrants, although these 
benefits are included in their collective agreements.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5777"> 5777 </A></B>
<P>
	This decision affects many agencies that receive funding to 
offer immigrants certain services such as programs for 
immigrant settlement and adoption and language training 
programs for immigrants in Canada.
<P>
	This decision will create a lot of problems for these agencies 
which are doing very good work, and for employees whose 
social benefits will be reduced.
<P>
	On Monday, the minister tabled another bill, Bill C-44, to 
amend the Immigration Act, the Citizenship Act and the 
Customs Act. Under this bill, persons convicted of a major 
crime will no longer be able to claim refugee status to gain entry 
into or postpone their deportation from Canada.
<P>
	We agree with these principles, but we want to look very 
closely at each and every one of Bill C-44's provisions. If 
necessary, we will move the appropriate amendments.
<P>
	At this time, however, we would like to make some 
preliminary comments.
<P>
	First of all, in my view, the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration has overly reacted to a very real problem, albeit 
one that is marginal and nowhere near as widespread as the 
Reform Party and the press would have us believe. I think the 
minister caved in too readily under the pressure and the sharp 
criticism voiced by certain Reform Party members.
<P>
	To my mind, some of the provisions in this bill run counter to 
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
<P>
	The bill also gives immigration officers the power to intercept 
and hold mail from abroad which could contain documents 
related to a person's identity, when the officers have reason to 
believe that these documents could be used for fraudulent 
purposes. Madam Speaker, do you not think that this provision 
clearly violates the principles and rules contained in the charter?
<P>
<B>(2055) </B>
<P>
	It is our duty as elected members to fight prejudice and 
discrimination against refugees. As the people's elected 
representatives, we must show compassion and generosity, 
which are fundamental values of Quebecers and Canadians. 
With all due respect, I think that my colleagues in the Reform 
Party who sometimes make inflammatory statements are 
encouraging public intolerance towards immigrants.
<P>
	I am extremely pleased that the vast majority of people I met 
in Alberta-I made two trips and visited Calgary, Edmonton and 
Banff-including lawyers, ethnic leaders and church members, 
do not share this approach of the Reform Party, which I consider 
anti-immigrant and anti-refugee.
<P>
	I want to pay tribute to Edmonton's ethno-cultural 
association and to Calgary's multicultural centre for the 
wonderful work they are doing to integrate newcomers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Twice I visited Calgary and met with a young Salvadoran who 
took sanctuary in the basement of a church. I showed my 
solidarity with this refugee. Unfortunately the refugee did not 
get shelter from the Reform Party. Fortunately now an 
understanding took place and this young Salvadoran is free.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I thank the pastors, university professors and professionals, as 
well as the Latin American community, for having helped this 
young Salvadoran who can now stay in Canada. I am proud of 
this Latin American community, which did such a marvellous 
job in Calgary for one of its brothers.
<P>
	In closing, I want to emphasize, on the 125th anniversary of 
the first immigration program and of the first Immigration Act 
passed by Canada, the outstanding contribution made by the 
hundreds of thousands of immigrants who have enriched Canada 
and Quebec.
<P>
	I also want to mention that I participated this past weekend in 
two very important ethno-cultural events in my riding of 
Bourassa, in Montreal North. First, a special event organized by 
the multi-ethnic community centre of Montreal North, which 
gave diplomas and honourable mentions to students who passed 
their French course. What a fine example of harmonious 
integration.
<P>
	The second event I participated in was the gala organized by 
L'Ouverture youth centre, which gave awards to the best 
students of ethnic origin in each of the schools in my riding. 
Most of these students were of Haitian, Latin American and 
Vietnamese extraction. I commend L'Ouverture youth centre 
and particularly its director, Félix St-Élien, for this initiative 
and for excellent work promoting closer intercultural links 
among young people in Montreal North.
<P>
	I take this opportunity to point out the efforts made by the 
Haitian community to solve problems and smooth their 
transition into Quebec society. Finally, I want to acknowledge 
warmly and express my deep gratitude to the thousands of 
volunteers and hundreds of organizations throughout Quebec 
and Canada that work so hard to provide settlement and 
integration services to our new fellow citizens.
<P>
<B>(2100 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise today and contribute to the debate 
surrounding Bill C-35 on third reading. As members know the 
bill's intent is to establish the Department of Citizenship and 
Immigration, but in fact this bill is simply standard 
housekeeping material and no real meat.
<P>
	My colleagues and I in the Reform Party would rather this 
government bring forward legislation that deals with some of 
the numerous problems our misguided Department of Citizen-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5778"> 5778 </A></B>
<P>
ship and Immigration faces.  Further, I believe that the 
government must begin immediately to look at new specific 
goals and new hard nosed policies for this department, using as 
criteria the safety of Canadian society and the economic needs 
of our country.
<P>
	At present this government is pursuing an immigration policy 
that will allow 250,000 newcomers into Canada this year. This 
represents about 1 per cent of our general population. What is 
the justification for this number? Where is the economic 
justification? The minister continues to claim that extensive 
consultations unprecedented in their scope and attendance has 
set this number. We in the Reform Party ask, what 
consultations? Who was in attendance? What views are being 
accepted?
<P>
	Let me tell you about this government's method of 
consultation. In fact its consultations are basically centred 
around special interest groups, particularly those that have 
direct interest in the maintenance of a complicated, expensive 
and slow moving immigration process. In most cases this means 
a financial interest.
<P>
	For example, it is estimated the processing of one refugee 
costs between $30,000 and $50,000. Do you believe that 
immigration lawyers who are consulted extensively during the 
minister's extensive consultation process are interested in 
streamlining determination systems? Not on your life.
<P>
	What about the consultation material received from polls? 
What about the opinions of rank and file Canadians? We have 
heard these consistently. Over the last few years polls have 
shown that a majority of Canadians believe that there should be 
a decrease in immigration numbers, particularly during tough 
times.
<P>
	However, the voices of Canadians are ignored in favour of 
listening to special interest groups with their own special 
agendas. Once again this government policy of higher 
immigration levels flies in the face of its infamous red book 
assertion that ``people are irritated with governments that do not 
consult them or that disregard their views''. The key word in that 
statement is people.
<P>
	This is an interesting contrast to the broadsheet published by 
the Department of Citizenship and Immigration and distributed 
earlier this year which asks for input to the consultations which 
are supposedly under way right now. It states: ``It is also 
important for information to flow from you and your group to 
the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration''. Note the phrase 
you and your group. Notice how the request for written 
submissions to the consultations task force is not addressed to 
individuals but rather to groups.
<P>
	What happened to the government's promise of consulting 
with the people on important issues? Where is the fulfilment of 
the red book promise? It is simply not there. It has not happened 
and will not happen because this government like the Tories is 
simply not interested in what ordinary Canadians have to say.
<P>
	Of the 250,000 immigrants this year, only 18 per cent will be 
evaluated for their potential economic benefit to Canada. 
Accordingly the skill level and education level of immigrants in 
comparison to Canadian citizens has been declining over the 
years. However, the fiction of the red book refers to an 
immigration policy that considers economic needs and our 
ability to absorb and settle immigrants.
<P>
	These Liberal election promises are in clear contradiction 
with their current policy of a 1 per cent ceiling and their current 
policy that only 18 per cent of immigrants will be screened for 
economic benefits. How does our current immigration policy 
deal with Canada's economic needs or our ability to settle 
immigrants? It does not.
<P>
	In addition, after much pressure this government recently 
introduced a bill to partially overhaul the outdated workings of 
the immigration and refugee board. However, even with these 
partial amendments there are still fears that the IRB will 
continue in its fumbling ways in creating a huge backlog of 
cases and by putting Canadians at risk by not deporting 
criminals. The present Minister of Citizenship and Immigration 
when in opposition on June 22, 1992, commented on the system 
of removal. He lamented about people who get refused and then 
not get deported at the end of the day. He said ``even the people 
who were denied were not deported in the end''.
<P>
<B>(2105) </B>
<P>
	In actuality very few people are removed. This limp-wristed 
approach to deportation has continued under the present 
minister's guidance. The lack of exit controls and the staying of 
removal orders by the IRB has resulted in a system of 
deportation that is inefficient, inept and creates a huge economic 
liability to the Canadian people.
<P>
	Last year the IRB in its wisdom granted 147 conditional stays 
of between two to five years to those under removal orders. Most 
disturbing of all, 145 of the 147 had criminal records. They 
range from drug offences to manslaughter to sexual assault.
<P>
	The operation of the immigration and refugee board is a 
travesty. With 250,000 immigrants arriving each year perhaps 
the minister should undertake to discover why the IRB believes 
that Canadian citizens need the company of 145 known felons.
<P>
	Recently an individual with an extensive criminal record was 
granted a five-year stay by the IRB and was involved in the fatal 
shooting of a woman in Toronto in April. Just today there was a 
funeral in Toronto. That is because a few days ago a metropoli-
<P>

<B><A NAME="5779"> 5779 </A></B>
<P>
tan Toronto police  officer was killed and his partner wounded in 
a gun battle with an individual who was ordered deported three 
years ago.
<P>
	With people waiting in line for years to immigrate to Canada 
why does the IRB quash deportation orders of known criminals 
and why does the department fail to execute deportation orders? 
I believe the minister should endeavour to find out, and I believe 
he should apply his words of June 22, 1992, to the workings of 
his own department. The system is clearly breaking down.
<P>
	Canada must cease to become a haven for immigrants and 
refugees who were involved in criminal activity. While we will 
continue to welcome genuine convention refugees, we must 
strive for an immigration policy that is driven by the economic 
needs of our great country.
<P>
	The average annual number of immigrants admitted to 
Canada over the last 25 years has been approximately 150,000. 
This should be our starting point. Then based on the health and 
the needs of the economy this number could be adjusted, up or 
down. Undoubtedly because of the immigration policies that are 
driven by special interest groups the government will denounce 
such a strategy.
<P>
	Quebec with its controls of its own program of immigration 
has decided that it will be cutting back and accept only 16 per 
cent of all newcomers to Canada this year. What is its reasoning 
for this? It is its economy, of course, a very fundamental reason I 
believe.
<P>
	Its economy is too sluggish and too weak at the moment to 
absorb and settle immigrants. To quote the red book again: ``If a 
province is utilizing this strategy why is it so incomprehensible 
to suggest we can use a similar strategy on a national basis''. 
The Reform Party's position is clear. Any immigration policy 
must be based on the economic needs of our country. What could 
make more sense?
<P>
	Finally, this government must reform our system of removals 
and deportation. Criminals and bogus refugees are being granted 
stays by the IRB. This must cease immediately. This policy in 
fact is to the detriment of legitimate immigrants, legitimate 
refugees, and to the detriment of the Canadian taxpayer who 
must fund legal representation for these people either before a 
never-ending string of immigration appeal boards or before a 
judge in the criminal justice system.
<P>
	Without real reform to the immigration policy and the 
workings of the Department of Citizenship and Immigration 
Canada's economic recovery will most assuredly continue to be 
weakened and the safety of Canadian streets will most assuredly 
continue to be compromised.
<P>
	This is not a time for simple housekeeping initiatives. This is 
a time to stop listening to special interest groups and start 
listening to the Canadian people. The Reform Party fully intends 
to be this government's worst nightmare on immigration 
policies until constructive, sensible and economy driven 
reforms are made to  Canada's immigration programs. They can 
go to the bank on that promise.
<P>
<B>(2110) </B>
<P>
	I would like to address briefly the fact that I am appalled 
closure would be used on a housekeeping bill such as this one. I 
would simply quote the member for Kingston and the Islands:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I want to start by talking about the fact that the government is using time 
allocation once again on this bill. Just to remind the House and the Canadian 
public of the Draconian approach this government takes to dealing with 
legislation in the House-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Those were the comments of the member for Kingston and the 
Islands in February 1993.
<P>
	In May 1991 the member for Ottawa-Vanier stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That is far from being democratic. Here we have an abuse of power by the 
majority because the government happens to have the numbers and it can impose 
upon the minority a process which, to say the least, is objectionable.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	On May 29, 1991 the member for Kingston and the Islands 
stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A new definition of democracy-I suggest that it is contrary to all the 
practices of this House for the last 124 years. It is a breach of the proprieties of 
this place. While the Speaker has ruled that the motion is in order, and I respect 
that ruling, I suggest that it is-morally wicked of the government to proceed 
with this motion and particularly then to apply closure to the motion and thereby 
curtail debate on it.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	On May 29, 1991 the member for Winnipeg St. James stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If there is going to be any debate, it will not put up with it very long, because 
it has a Draconian device, a Draconian mechanism called closure. If you deign 
and if you dare say anything in opposition to the government's proposals or to 
its motions, it will cut you off.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Finally on March 24, 1994 the leader of the government in the 
House of Commons stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Speaker, I said on behalf of the government it will be found over the life 
of this Parliament that this government will be using time allocation and closure 
far less frequently than its predecessor.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Four times in one night. He continued:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I challenge the opposition House leader to raise this again after a few years 
and see if I am right.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Perhaps after a few years it will be raised again. This 
housekeeping bill is no excuse for closure, but I will take this 
opportunity to close my address as one of the last speakers 
before the summer adjournment of Parliament.
