</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance)</B> moved that the second report of the Standing 
Committee on Human Resources Development and the Status of 
Persons with Disabilities, presented on Thursday, April 13, be 
concurred in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said:  Mr. Speaker, although today's debate brings us to 
report stage and a report from the committee, what is actually 
happening is that the government is bringing in time allocation 
on legislation.  I am sad to report that this is an all time 
championship, if one wants to call it that.  The government has 
closed debate and snapped time allocation on legislation which 
does not even tie the Mulroney Conservative record but breaks it, 
and we call this democratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a government that has just brought in time allocation on 
the debate today for a record breaking 67th time.  You and I have 
been here a while, Mr. Speaker.  You certainly know that we have 
seen this happen time and time again.  We saw it in the 1993 
parliament and we have watched it in the 1997 parliament.  The 
government has not only matched the Mulroney record of time 
allocation in closing off debate but has actually surpassed it 
now in much less time than the Mulroney Tories were here.  What a 
shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will highlight this travesty today and bring it to the 
attention of the Canadian people.  I certainly think that as 
taxpayers they deserve to know exactly what is going on here and 
how these folks across the way have become the king of the 
ramrod. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see colleagues across the way and I know that some of them 
would not be proud of this.  In fact, one of them even served 
with the Mulroney Tories, as I understand it, and I do not think 
he was proud of bringing in time allocation 66 times.  Now he is 
a Liberal, the hon. member for Edmonton Southeast for whom I have 
some respect, and he is a part of the government that has now 
brought it in 67 times.  I know he has lived down here a while. 
Maybe I could brand him one of the Ottawa 67s.  I wonder how that 
would make him feel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  If you don't like it then you should 
change the rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Someone is saying that we should 
change the rules.  What a wonderful idea that would be, but as 
soon as anyone would get up to try to change the rules the 
government would probably bring in time allocation or have a 
meeting and say that it does not like it that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something is ridiculous here when we see that there truly is an 
anti-democratic disease that has got a hold of the government, 
and it needs to be exposed.  I noticed that some members on the 
government side were free to write books about it and expose it a 
while ago, but I have not seen an exposé lately about the sin and 
corruption of government.  I would love the hon. member to let us 
know about that.  He is trying.  It is good to get into 
government and give it a try from the inside.  I think he knows 
and we know that it does not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians need to know what is happening here today so they can 
judge for themselves whether they are being well served by the 
government.  I do not think they are.  Right now downstairs a 
couple of my colleagues are holding a press conference.  They are 
making sure that the Canadian public knows exactly what is 
happening inside the Chamber here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In six years the government has brought in time allocation 67 
times.  The government uses closure to quickly silence the 
opposition of which it was a part in years gone by and will be 
again sooner or later.  Probably sooner.  We can look at how it 
uses closure to quickly silence the opposition on controversial 
issues as opposed to stopping a filibuster— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
just want to raise the issue of relevance.  The hon. member is so 
blinded by her partisanship she has forgotten that she has moved 
concurrence in a committee report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She is discussing a subject that has not even come up for 
debate.  I am not saying it is not a subject for debate, but she 
is so blinded by that partisanship she has lost the relevance.  I 
am asking the Chair to direct her back to the subject of debate, 
which is the committee report.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Is it not 
serendipitous that I just happened to be consulting with the 
clerk about that very thing and I just happened to have that very 
report in my hand so as to ensure that when that challenge was 
made the hon. Leader of the Opposition could be gently persuaded 
to touch on the relevance of the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I will get to 
the topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it rather amusing, or maybe I find it rather sad, that 
government members have to jump up and say “They are being 
irrelevant”.  Let me assure the hon. member, and let me assure 
you, too, Mr. Speaker, that I will get to what is happening now 
in the HRD committee.  The hon. member has absolutely nothing to 
worry about when I start quoting from this document and then 
start quoting from that document.  It is going to be so relevant 
it will make his head swim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding time allocation again, particularly this whole idea of 
report stage and what is going on right now with human resources 
development, it is absolutely amazing that a member of the 
governing side would stand to say “You are being irrelevant”. 
If what has been going on with this tragedy in human resources 
development over the last few months is irrelevant to Canadian 
taxpayers, I would bet a dollar they would want to storm this 
place.  They know perfectly well that a government that is out of 
control is a government that is mismanaging millions, in fact 
billions of dollars.  It is truly amazing that those members 
would have the nerve to stand and say this is irrelevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would I want to upset, harangue or offend some hon. members 
over there.  Let us just get to the point at hand.  This is when 
it really gets good.  Let us talk about transitional jobs funds 
for a few moments.  If that is not relevant to HRD and the 
committee, I do not know what is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at political manipulation.  My point with time 
allocation, which is certainly relevant, is that the government 
uses it for things that it simply wants to brush out of the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at transitional jobs fund contributions.  Here is 
something in the HRD department that is painfully relevant for 
the government and for every Canadian taxpayer.  An access to 
information request giving all transitional jobs fund 
contributions by constituency since its inception three years ago 
was analyzed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members are quiet now.  I think we are being 
relevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me quote from this document.  I will name the province, I 
will name the amount of money granted through the transitional 
jobs fund as a percentage of the total and the number of 
projects that were funded as a percentage of the total.  I know 
they are aware of how relevant this is, so let me give a few 
numbers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the province of Alberta the amount of money that was granted 
was $3,548,154.  My hon. friend from Edmonton Southeast knows 
that we are a sizeable percentage of the population out home in 
Alberta, but under the transitional jobs fund the percentage of 
total money that was grated through the TJF was 1.3%.  His math 
is probably better than mine, but I know that 1.3% of the funding 
went to Alberta, which has close to 10% of the population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also knows that there is a veritable dearth of government 
members in Alberta.  In fact, he is half.  His friend from 
Edmonton West is the other half.  I do not suspect he would think 
there was any political manipulation there in terms of granting 
through the TJF.  I would not think so.  I would hate to be that 
cynical to believe it.  For Alberta there was 1.3%.  The number of 
projects funded—six.  The percentage total—0.6%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we see him going home to Alberta saying “I am from the 
government and I am here to help you”? 
I have not seen him around town saying that.  I respect the fact 
that he is not out flaunting or dishing out money like some 
others would do.  At the same time, if we were to look at the 
bare bones and if people were to say that this is not politically 
motivated, my colleague on the Liberal side from Edmonton, as 
well as myself, would probably not believe them.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at British Columbia.  The amount of money granted 
was $17,680,920, which as a percentage of the total was 6.3%. 
B.C. has a fair population, but 6.3%?  That seems rather strange 
to me.  The number of projects funded through the TJF was 64. 
The percentage of the final total was 5.9%.  It is not exciting, 
is it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us move to Saskatchewan.  The total amount granted was 
$5,230,555.  As a percentage of the total it was 1.9%.  Granted, 
Saskatchewan has a somewhat smaller population, but 1.9%?  The 
number of projects funded was 43.  The percentage of the big 
total was 4.0%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us move to Manitoba.  The amount granted was $5,450,995. 
That also was 1.9% of the total.  There were 28 projects funded. 
The percentage of the big total—2.6%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us move to Ontario, which is a fairly hefty province in 
terms of population.  It was granted $31,308,862.  Its percentage 
of the total, with a huge percentage of the population, was 
11.1%.  The number of projects funded was 96.  Its percentage of 
the total was 8.9%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us move to Quebec.  The amount was $94,924,227 in terms of 
dollars granted, making its percentage of the total 33.7%.  There 
is the province that is over in terms of population percentage; 
that is, actual percentage in terms of numbers across the 
country.  There were 318 projects funded, representing 29.4%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know there would be some, if they looked up from their 
newspapers, who would say “There she is being critical again”. 
No.  It is rather funny, but that is where the Prime Minister's 
riding is and the ridings of others who perhaps had to buy a few 
seats from the separatists.  That gets expensive.  An incredible 
amount of money was granted, $94 million.  As I am making sure 
that I am relevant in this debate I will have a look later at 
some of the things that have gone on in terms of the TJF funding 
in the Prime Minister's riding and in that province in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go to New Brunswick.  The amount of money granted was 
$30,958,605.  As a percentage of the total that was 11%.  There 
were 143 projects funded.  In terms of the percentage of the big 
total it represented 13.2%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go to Prince Edward Island.  The amount granted was 
$9,724,041.  That was 3.5% of the total.  The number of projects 
was 35.  The percentage of the big total was 3.2%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go to Newfoundland.  The number of dollars granted was 
$49,800,368, which was 17.4% of the total, and 192 projects were 
funded.  As a percentage of the total it represented 17.7%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nova Scotia was granted $30,374,481, which was 10.8% of the 
total, and 137 projects were funded, for a percentage of 12.7% of 
the total. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Northwest Territories was granted $1,795,675.  The 
percentage of the total was 0.6%, and 17 projects were funded. 
As a percentage of the big total it represented 1.6%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is Yukon.  The amount granted was $1,380,000.  The 
percentage of the total was 0.5%.  Three projects were funded. 
Three projects for $1.3 million. 
As a percentage of the total it represented 0.3%.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If we add it all up the lottery looks like this:  the number of 
dollars granted was $281,384,883, for a total of 1,082 projects. 
It is a good deal.  It is amazing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear that my colleagues have returned from the press 
conference, which was incredibly relevant.  What they said at the 
press conference was, when these kinds of projects are handed 
out, when these kinds of dollars are involved, with the budget 
that the finance minister brought down and trumpeted, 
representing $13 billion in grants and contributions, and 
whatever the bills will be to deal with these things in 
legislation, the government says “All right, you have had enough 
time.  We are going to shut down debate”.  We are talking about 
$13 billion. That is big bucks.  There were some members who were 
screeching that this was irrelevant.  No, it is incredibly 
relevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What my colleagues will be bringing up later, and what they 
discussed at the press conference, is that this kind of stuff 
really irritated government members when they sat on the 
opposition benches.  Some members were not here at the time, but 
government members were extremely righteous.  How we remember the 
shrieking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, if you do not have the strength to sit through 
this, I am assuming that another Speaker will come along, and I 
certainly hope it is the member for Kingston and the Islands.  I 
have some quotes which are real doozies from him when he was in 
opposition.  I bet you a dollar he will think it is relevant, let 
me assure you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at some of the things that happened in terms of the 
transitional jobs fund grants.  There were a few anomalies.  We 
could look at the percentages and the dollars.  There are lots of 
ways we could describe it and explain it away, but let us look at 
a few of the anomalies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Parry Sound—Muskoka, who is the Secretary of 
State for Rural Development, received five transitional jobs fund 
grants worth a total of $1,257,289.  Three were given a month 
before the last election.  Mr. Speaker, I know you would find 
that hard to believe.  I know the table officers have never seen 
this happen in their history in this place before, that money 
would be dished out just before an election.  One grant was 
approved during the time leading up to the 1997 election and one 
was approved two days after the election.  Is that relevant?  You 
bet.  That kind of political manipulation has to stop.  The 
Ottawa '67s over there are the folks who have the power to do 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unemployment rate—and this is incredibly relevant—in that 
member's riding was 8.1% in May 1997.  Mr. Speaker, you were out 
on the hustings and so was I in May 1997.  We were busy 
door-knocking along with our friend from Edmonton Southeast.  We 
were talking about how shameful it was that the government would 
throw money into ridings during election times.  Were we not?  He 
is nodding.  You bet.  Yet it is lotto day in Parry 
Sound—Muskoka.  The unemployment guideline was 12%.  The 
unemployment rate in the member's riding was 8.1%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Denis Coderre:</B>  Let's talk about last night. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, someone said “Let's talk 
about last night”.  I bet a dollar he would not want to do that 
either.  The Liberals did not do so great. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the riding of the member for Edmonton West, who 
is another neighbour.  The girl just down the road.  Her riding 
received three grants worth $2,328,663 from the transitional jobs 
fund.  All but $70,000 was given in two TJF grants in late 
February 1997, three months before the election.  We knew there 
was an election coming.  The unemployment rate in the member's 
riding was about 7% in 1997.  It was into the single digits.  The 
guidelines, I am sure, were 12%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a memo to the minister about the TJF program dated 
November 1997, received through an access to information request, 
which says that there are no economic zones with 12% unemployment 
in Alberta.  To be relevant, I know that the HRD minister says 
that you could pick a pocket of high unemployment, that there 
were pita pockets, unemployment pockets, pickpockets, whatever. 
The benchmark was 12%, but if the minister felt it was deemed 
necessary people could dip into those pockets of unemployment and 
help themselves to a TJF grant.  The member for Edmonton West in 
1997 was told, through these sensitive documents that found their 
way into public hands, that there were no economic zones with 12% 
unemployment in Alberta. 
There should have been a period and a new sentence saying 
“Thanks anyway but you do not qualify”.  Of course, that did 
not happen.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the Minister of Human Resources Development, the 
member for Brant.  I want to make it clear that she was not the 
HRD minister back in 1997 but lotto days were alive and well. She 
received $1,769,012 from TJF but her riding boasted an 
unemployment rate of 8.1% in 1997.  It is even lower now at 8%. I 
doubt if it was government grants that created those jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at another one.  The leader of the Bloc Quebecois, 
the member for Laurier—Sainte-Marie, his riding had an 
unemployment rate of 15% in 1996.  He received $100,000 over 
three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Smell anything here?  Political manipulation?  I would dare any 
one of them to stand and say that there was nothing political 
about this.  Three government members whom I just listed got 
millions of dollars during the writ period in fact.  Yet, the 
leader of the Bloc Quebecois got $100,000 in TJF grants over 
three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration whose riding lies 
directly beside the member for Laurier—Sainte-Marie and had a 
lower unemployment rate of 12.1% at the time, received 
$5,650,577.  I am sure that is just absolute irony.  I cannot 
imagine it would be anything else. We look at the unemployment 
rates of two ridings.  One got $100,000 over three years and the 
minister who was probably having quite the fight of her political 
career got $5,650,577. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the member for Fredericton who was in the news 
awhile ago.  Things have been fairly quiet on the Fredericton 
front.  He received $571,509, yet the unemployment rate in 1996 
for his riding was 9.9%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are not screaming irrelevant now, but you do need to listen 
to this, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The guideline was 12% yet at 9.9% and 8.1% there was milk and 
honey.  When it is election time no price is too much to buy that 
seat for those in government, “Just let us know what you want 
and we will tell you about the deep pockets”.  But it is the 
Canadians' deep pockets that are springing the cash.  The folks 
across the way think they have every God-given right to help 
themselves to those pockets and dish it out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at what is probably the greatest anomaly in the 
whole program, the member for Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies.  This 
Liberal backbencher managed to receive $19,946,649.  That is an 
amazing pile of cash; $20 million over three years.  This is 
especially interesting knowing that the 1996 census identified 
his riding as having an unemployment rate of, oops, just 12.2%. 
It might have been one of those pick a pocket areas.  That is 
amazing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a swing riding held by the Bloc.  Now that is relevant. 
It looked like the Liberals were in danger of losing to the Bloc 
Quebecois.  Le député d'Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies, 30 millions 
de dollars.  A swing riding held by the Bloc.  The MP received 15 
transitional jobs fund grants just before and during the election 
worth a total of $5,851,720. Seven of those were signed during 
the writ period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot imagine that anyone would be proud to stand and say, 
“I lead the government and I want to tell you about how well we 
are going to manage your money”.  All these were signed during 
the writ period. 
It is absolutely amazing.  There is no shame.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister for International Trade, who was the minister of 
HRD back in the good old days before he got a transfer, signed 
off on 49 grants during the writ period of the last election, 
April 27 to June 2.  I can hardly imagine he had time to go out 
and knock on a door or two.  It seems pretty strange to me if he 
was that busy.  He was just writing and signing his name.  He 
thought he was autographing things as a famous person. It turned 
out they were grants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That amounts to 4.5% of all the grants when that one month 
period comprised just 2.8% of the total length of the program. It 
is hard to believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now he says, “Nothing was wrong at HRD.  I did a fine job. I 
was a great steward of that department”.  He turned it over to 
his buddy from Brant and it has just gotten worse since then. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were 49 grants during the writ period.  The writ period 
was about 37 days or so.  That was more than one a day. That must 
have kept him busy.  He must have had quite a campaign team out 
there knocking on doors and seeing businesses for him.  He was a 
busy boy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at the amount of money, we like this question answered. 
Why would any approvals be signed during the election writ period 
at all?  The Liberals had no idea they were going to be back in 
government.  They had absolutely no idea what was going to happen 
to them.  Yet while the cash is there, they want to keep signing 
their signatures and get that cash rolling especially in those 
awkward little seats, those persnickety people who looked like 
they were going to win the election, the Bloc.  They just try to 
buy them off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I woke up this morning and I noticed that we did not do 
particularly well in the byelection in Newfoundland, but we got a 
start and our name is known there now.  We have one way to go and 
that is up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me I saw on the news last night—and I could have 
been sleeping because I was tired and I must confess I was 
flipping back and forth to the hockey game—but I am sure I saw 
the Minister of Finance in Newfoundland announcing a $58 million 
ferry.  I suspect that would be confirmed by members on the other 
side.  I am convinced I saw that. I would have to ask my friend 
from Edmonton Southeast because he would probably know the true 
story on it.  I could have sworn I saw 58 million bucks being 
thrown into that byelection. Just buy a ferry and guess what, it 
did not work.  It happened but it did not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe the Canadian public is starting to say, “Hey, wait a 
minute.  That is not your money you are offering us in your great 
lovingness and largesse. That is our money”.  When I talked to 
Newfoundlanders a couple of weeks ago I made this point and I 
think they buy it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did not win the byelection but at least we doubled our vote 
in that byelection.  The Tories went down in that vote; they lost 
about 12% or something like that.  The Liberals lost a whole 
pile, up in the double digits again.  The NDP made an incredible 
gain.  I know there is one of them here who would celebrate today 
and say yea. Well, okay, he is nodding yea.  He is being very shy 
about that close second. We, the Canadian Alliance, doubled our 
vote.  That is more than any of those other parties.  Three 
cheers for wrestler Sailor White. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps that was a little irrelevant, but not particularly, 
because it is government money.  Who in their right mind would 
have the nerve to say, “Let us go buy this off”.  I remember 
when Lucien Bouchard was here and he ran for the Tories in the 
byelection in 1984 I think.  They said that his was the best 
riding money could buy. They paid for stuff that should not have 
even been paid by them.  Yet, here it is with a big wink, “What 
can we do to help you?  We will give you a hand here”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those days surely have to be over.  But with this government 
that rams more and more legislation through the House, it really 
goes at it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alleviating unemployment was the secondary criteria of the 
transitional jobs fund.  The Liberals said, “We will give you 
cash.  We will get that whole job creation program going and we 
will virtually eliminate unemployment”. 
That begs the question, and I am not the economist in the crowd—

admit it.  It begs this question which I will ask the member, if 
government funding for job creation programs was the answer, why 
do we still have such high unemployment in this country? Should 
we not have zero percent unemployment?  If throwing money at it 
will solve the problem, Lord knows between Mulroney and the 
present Prime Minister alone, they have thrown enough money at 
it.  Between those two guys alone we ought to have about 0.03% 
unemployment in the country, but it does not happen that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The primary criteria were regional and political visibility. 
That is relevant, “Let me help you get the seat, let me make 
sure everything is okay for you in your riding” and make sure 
that everything looks wonderful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some wonderful notes here which I will come across sooner 
or later.  They are really good.  They are notes about making 
sure that you look good, feel good, sound good. Here they are and 
for goodness sake, they are labelled “Calendar of Events and Site 
Visits”.  Is that not handy?  Let us move to that.  That is 
relevant too, thanks be for that.  If they are going to dish out 
some of those dollars, they might as well look good, sound good, 
feel good while it is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The “Calendar of Events and Site Visits” was obtained by 
opposition research through access to information on April 15, 
1999, barely one year ago.  Is that relevant?  Yes it is.  It is 
a 160 page list on legal size paper of government funded projects 
to visit.  Dated December 12, 1998 it was sent presumably on a 
routine basis to all Liberal members of parliament.  I thought I 
saw everything that came into my office and I am sure I did not 
get that list of projects. Accompanying the list is a letter 
dated December 16, 1998 on privy council letterhead.  Oh my. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier:</B>  It is like a Christmas present. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member says it is a 
Christmas present.  You bet.  It is signed by Peter Donolo, 
director of communications for the Prime Minister, who has 
crossed over the Atlantic and now has a wonderful position in 
Italy.  The letter says, “Specific dates for 
announcements/conferences remain opportunities for site visits as 
well”.  Spiff yourself up, polish your nose, you are going out 
to dish out government money as if it were your own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The calendar is designed to be used by the Prime Minister, 
ministers, secretaries of state, and no offence, last but not 
least, members of parliament on the government side of course, 
when planning visits to regions and home constituencies.  Is that 
not the sweetest that the government members would be the dishes 
of cash and the dishes would be the people who were getting this 
government grant by a government member saying “Here you are, 
you lucky people, here is some cash”.  Whose money is this 
anyhow? When money gets transferred from the government to a 
group or whomever in a riding, this is the living proof through 
access to information, that it is the government members who hand 
it out.  And I certainly have seen government members dish it 
out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were 1,006 sites listed.  Each site visit has a 
description, a contact name and a phone number.  I just wonder 
who it might have been that they were ringing up to say, “I am 
here from the government and I am here to help you with your own 
money, or with someone else's money that was sent into the 
coffers”.  Among the names to be contacted for photo ops are 
officials in universities, other public bodies and private 
companies.  That looks like photo op anonymous except it is not 
so anonymous.  One has to be a member of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Opportunities suitable for Liberal photo ops are youth oriented 
projects.  Do the Liberals think youth are too stupid to know 
they are getting a dish out?  I do not think so.  Young people 
more than anyone else have it figured out that when they send 
money to Ottawa it is swirled around and Ottawa takes its cut off 
the top and gives some back.  Come on.  Get your picture taken. 
Liberal photo ops with youth oriented projects indicate that 
Liberal members of parliament want to be identified with the 
youth rather than the elderly.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Live the dream.  Get those young people.  Does the House know 
with whom the Liberal members of parliament ought to have their 
pictures taken?  They ought to have their pictures taken with 
young people.  They should tell those young people that they are 
sorry that they left them a $600 billion debt.  That is a photo 
op I would not mind seeing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless any Liberal thinks this is irrelevant, for every single 
dollar that those young people pay in taxes, even those of us who 
are middle aged baby boomers or older people who are sending our 
dollars in, 30 cents out of every single dollar goes toward 
paying the interest alone on the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now those people across the way will say “Oh no, it was not our 
responsibility.  It was those Tories when they came in”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the Tories of course will say “Oh no, it was those lousy 
Liberals who left it to us”.  And we all blame each other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the actual numbers.  I think deficit financing 
started in about 1972.  The person who was the finance minister 
during those years was none other than the member for 
Saint-Maurice.  It really started with the Liberals spending more 
than they were taking in.  What a legacy Trudeau left us: Take in 
a dollar and spend $1.28. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A deal should be made to get a picture taken with young people 
saying “Sorry about that.  We spent so much money and racked up 
the MasterCard so high that you young people are the unlucky 
recipients of our debt”.  Any offers over there to stand up and 
get a picture taken with a young person with that little slogan 
underneath it?  I think not.  Yet they continue to say “Here you 
are.  Here is a cheque”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Multiple departments, ranging from the Departments of National 
Defence and Industry, to ACOA, the Atlantic Canadian 
Opportunities Agency—but as the Liberal minister from 
Newfoundland used to call it back when he voted against it in the 
days when he had principles and voted against the Tories even 
bringing this in, the Atlantic Canada overblown agency—to CMHC, 
the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, are represented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A heavy emphasis is placed on HRDC programs.  No wonder; $13 
billion was given in grants and contributions.  Wow, what a deal. 
The list demonstrates the government's ongoing intention to use 
government grants, especially HRDC grants, to profile its 
members.  I am very grateful that someone jogged my memory about 
that particular little list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am certainly not being irrelevant but I do digress.  Oh my, 
there is so much, Mr. Speaker.  I know you are not tired of 
listening and I do appreciate that so much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was talking about the TJF earlier and about some of the 
members who got in on that incredible windfall, but besides the 
TJF there is another little thing called the minister's reserve. 
Now that is another handy little pocket full of cash.  The TJF 
changed its name around 1996, I believe, to the Canada jobs fund, 
but it certainly did not change the sentiment.  Maybe because the 
transitional jobs fund had so many problems attached to it and 
certainly the reputation was not great they changed the name to 
the Canada jobs fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, they also have this little pocket called the minister's 
reserve.  This is something extra special.  There is more of an 
opportunity for political handouts.  The following information is 
taken from access to information documents obtained by the 
official opposition during the fall of 1999.  Surely no one on 
the government side would think that I am just jotting this down 
or making it up on my own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will me read a little bit of the information I received 
through access to information.  It says that “There is a 
multimillion dollar annual fund within the Department of Human 
Resources Development's Canada jobs fund job subsidy program 
called the minister's reserve”.  This is as if it is her own 
personal cash. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  It is like a special bottle of wine.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  This is like her own RRSP account from 
which she is generously withdrawing cash. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my colleagues said that it sounds like a special bottle 
of wine.  It is a special bottle of something or other for those 
who are getting cash under it.  Under the transitional jobs fund 
it was $3.3 million.  Of course that is never enough.  How could 
we get by on $3.3 million in our own personal reserve pocket?  It 
was raised to $5 million a year in fiscal year 1999-2000.  As if 
HRDC grants and contributions are not discretionary enough, we 
have the minister's reserve over and above. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each year the provinces are granted a notional allocation.  I 
remember in grade 8 home economics that we had to talk about 
notions:  sewing, buttons, thread and all that kind of stuff. 
Maybe it is the same thing, I have no idea.  Anyway, it is a 
notional allocation.  It is the total amount one can expect from 
the TJF and CJF, but the minister's reserve is not part of that 
notional allocation.  It is not as if we would sit down and have 
coffee and say that we have a notion to help somebody here.  It 
is over and above the notional stage.  Holy smokes, it is cash 
right out of the reserve.  It is not even part of that notional 
allocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 18, 1999, just a year ago, the Atlantic council of 
regional executive heads—I assume they had bodies and things to 
go with them but these were the heads—senior HRD officials, 
wrote to the assistant deputy minister asking questions about the 
use of the reserve.  At least—and good for them—they had the 
fortitude to ask the minister what this was all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To summarize the memo, it says “My colleagues in the Atlantic 
region are very concerned with respect to the proposed 
distribution under the CJF program”.  Thank goodness for people 
in the bureaucracy who stand up to the minister and ask some of 
these questions.  The memo goes on to say “Furthermore, due to 
the lack of regional consultation on the structuring of this 
proposal, we are requesting your review of our concerns”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be easy for the government to rant about the opposition 
making a fuss about this but these are its very own officials, 
and good for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this whole HRD scandal that we have witnessed swirling about 
us over the last few months, the minister has tried to stand up 
in question period and say that the official opposition, and in 
fact all opposition parties, were besmirching the officials at 
HRD.  Let me correct the record.  We are doing nothing of the 
sort.  These are good people who are trying to do their jobs but 
their political masters keep getting their paws in the way and 
they are not allowed to do the job that they were hired to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 12 the assistant deputy minister replied by saying that 
under the new Canada jobs fund the minister's reserve was to be 
$8 million but that the minister has agreed to $5 million.  Oh, 
my, do members not love it when they tighten their belts?  If not 
$8 million then I guess $5 million will do.  The minister has 
$3.3 million at her discretionary spending.  The government is 
trying to force her to take $8 million but I guess she can live 
on $5 million, which is over and above the $13.3 billion in 
grants and contributions from the government.  There it is, the 
minister is tightening her belt.  She has agreed to $5 million a 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the use of the minister's reserve, the assistant 
deputy minister said “—for proposals that meet the terms and 
conditions of the Canada jobs fund that the minister wishes to 
fund”.  What does that have to do with merit?  I am astounded. I 
assumed that these project, which the Liberals have been railing 
about for months, are based on merit.  If they are based on 
merit, why should the minister have to be involved at all?  That 
is a big $13.3 billion barrel.  This is the $5 million little 
discretionary fund in her personal reserve that the minister 
wishes to fund.  In brackets, it says “This continues the 
practice followed under the transitional jobs fund”.  Okay, then 
if it happened under the TJF it might as well happen under the 
CJF, right? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This simply means that the minister can do whatever he or she 
likes with the fund.  The note makes clear that a proposal under 
the reserve could be generated from the minister's office where 
we would not even have to hear about it.  We would not even need 
to get an application form or anything like that. 
If I am just out there trucking around and I see what looks to be 
a great little project, I could initiate it all by myself. That 
is hard to believe.

reserve was $3.3 million under the TJF but was increased to $5 
million, as I mentioned earlier.  The reason given was that the 
minister's office provided significant support to obtaining 
cabinet support for the Canada jobs fund and they felt that $5 
million a year for the minister's reserve was appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as we know, there were three disbursements totalling 
$1.38 million from the $10 million minister's reserve under the 
TJF.  To our knowledge, none have yet been made under the CJF, 
although maybe the minister in question period today could let us 
know if any of those things have happened.  Maybe we are not 
right up to snuff on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was $500,000 to Cornwall, the riding of the chief 
government whip.  It is not up to a $1 million but it is $500,000 
which is a step in the right direction, is it not?  It is halfway 
there.  The unemployment rate in his riding was 10.7% according 
to the 1996 census.  It was supposed to be 12% but, yes, he was 
higher than Brant which was 8%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Oh, my, $500,000 to Brantford.  Oops, that is the riding of the 
then Indian affairs minister.  The unemployment rate in her 
riding was 8.4% according to the 1996 census. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the HRD fund TJF projects in areas of less than 12% 
unemployment?  We have asked that any number of times in the 
House.  That is when we got the new creative line that it was the 
pockets of unemployment.  We could just pick a pocket and fund 
whatever we like. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other access documents showed that the 12% rule could easily be 
broken.  The rule is 12% but who cares.  We will just write a 
little rule to supersede the rule.  The rule says that individual 
communities and groups of communities that had unemployment of 
12% and greater but which were outside 12% unemployment insurance 
regions were also considered to be included in the 12% areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is called a run-on sentence in high school English but let me 
carry on.  In October 1997 Cornwall and Brantford were included 
as high unemployment areas.  That is hard to believe. It looks 
pretty loosey-goosey here.  It just goes on and on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This sounds like a shell game, does it not?   We have something 
under a shell, move it around, then we pick it up and we are not 
quite sure what we will find under it.  Twelve per cent was the 
limit but let us always remember that it is not this government's 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk for a few minutes now about the actual HRD audit. 
This was what broke loose when everyone was recessed out of the 
House in January.  I see that I am getting so relevant here that 
people are starting to hide behind the curtains.  Tell them to 
brace up because there is more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go on to the question of how the HRD minister was made 
aware of serious problems with the grants and contributions.  We 
have seen that it is a nightmare.  Let us take a look at some of 
the problems with the grants and contributions and what the 
minister did or did not do about them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On January 19, 2000 it was stated that Human Resource 
Development Canada manages grants and contributions programs that 
represent a significant investment in public funds.  That means a 
lot of cash and taxpayer dollars.  It was also stated that the 
audit looked at programs representing approximately $1 billion of 
annual spending.  That was a lot of cash. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was further stated that HRD initiated the internal review to 
get an objective assessment of the administration of its grants 
and contributions programs.  This type of review was part of an 
ongoing process to improve program management. 
Surely that is what we are all after.  The audit looked at a 
random sample of 459 projects from April 1997 to June 1999.  The 
review included a cross-section of projects from seven HRDC 
program areas across Canada.  A number of areas requiring 
improvement were identified in the report, including project 
monitoring, contracting procedures and general financial 
practices.

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the auditors found that of the 459 project files, 
15% did not even have an application on file.  Of the remaining 
applications, the following elements were missing.  Some 72% had 
no cashflow forecast.  In other words, what was going to be done 
with the money?  They were not sure because they did not know 
what their forecasts were. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some 46% had no estimate of the number of participants.  Half 
the people, almost one out of two, said they did not know how 
many participants there would be.  This is supposed to be job 
creation.  We are supposed to be making sure that people are 
working.  How many people were they going to have working?  They 
were not sure yet.  They had not figured it out yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some 25% had no description of the activities to be supported. 
Maybe it was going to be a cribbage tournament.  Who knows?  Let 
us get together down at the local hall, and who knows what we are 
going to do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another 25% provided no description of the characteristics of 
participants.  Who are these people they are trying to meet the 
needs of?  Who are these people they are trying to minister to? 
They are not sure yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some 11% had no budget proposal.  How much were they going to 
spend on it?  They did not know.  There was no budget proposal 
whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another 11% had no description of expected results.  What did 
they hope to accomplish by this?  They were not really sure. Just 
give them the cash anyway and they will try to figure that out as 
they go along. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was the review of 459 project files.  I think there were 
about 60,000 projects, if my memory serves me correctly.  If that 
is extrapolated, we are looking at a pile of cash.  We labelled 
this the billion dollar boondoggle.  Yet the minister continues 
to get up and say “No, we know exactly where that money is”. 
Maybe they do.  I do not know that I have accused her of saying 
that the money is missing, but I am sure saying the money is 
misspent.  Where is it?  This audit uncovered some amazing 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of all the files reviewed, 97% showed no evidence that anyone 
had checked to see if the recipient already owed money to HRDC. 
Nobody even asked if they had tried this one before.  Did they 
get cash once already?  No one even thought to ask that.  It 
seems like a pretty basic question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eight out of ten files reviewed, that is 80%, did not show 
evidence of financial monitoring and 87% of project files showed 
no evidence of supervision.  It seems to me that somebody 
somewhere ought to be asking these questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the billion dollar boondoggle that the minister tried to 
hide by saying that HRDC has already taken action to improve 
administrative standards and that a comprehensive action plan has 
been put into place.  Dear knows we have heard about that action 
plan on and on again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me look a little more specifically at the auditor general's 
report.  He certainly was concerned about some of the things 
going on there and these huge percentages.  The auditor general 
has made some comments on grants and contributions for many years 
now.  In the December 1998 report of the auditor general, in 
chapter 27, section 12, he stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have reported to Parliament on numerous audits of grant and 
contribution programs over the past 21 years.  Many of those 
audits identified similar concerns. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, here we go again.  There was inconsistent 
application or interpretation of government policy on grants and 
contributions.  We look at it and we say yes.  There were 
inefficient use of funds and inadequate measures to ensure 
accountability by program recipients.  Yes.  There was lack of 
control, monitoring and evaluation.  Yes.  Reporting in the 
estimates and public accounts was inadequate to facilitate 
examination and year to year comparisons by parliament.  Yes. 
That was in December 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw exactly that going on in 1999.  It was reported to the 
minister in January 2000 while the House was not sitting. We of 
course put in an access to information request on those 
documents. 
While that was over in the access department, the minister 
hurried and scurried and threw together a press conference to say 
that she wanted to be transparent and to bring this forward.  I 
cannot exactly concur with that.  It did not look transparent and 
forward to me.  It looked like when your hand is caught in the 
cookie jar and someone is ready to give you a snap for it.  You 
say you are sorry and apologize a little beforehand but only 
after you got caught.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chapter 27.15 of the December 1998 audit of the auditor general 
on grants and contributions states that the 1985 audit of the 
direct assistance programs of the Department of Regional Industry 
Expansion reported a number of weaknesses in control processes 
and program delivery practices.  In other words, it was not 
working.  It has gone on for years.  Any number of years ago I am 
sure the auditor general was making these same kinds of comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chapter 27.17 states that in 1988, as part of the audit of the 
Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, ongoing 
concerns were reported in two main areas:  the release of funds 
before complete documentation requirements had been satisfied and 
inadequate monitoring of band operations to ascertain whether 
funds were being spent for the purposes intended.  It is 
unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You run a business, Mr. Speaker.  You know that you have to keep 
a pretty tight watch.  You know also how much you lose through 
all kinds of things.  You know that well.  We talked about it 
lately.  You lose too much.  You have to use an iron fist when 
you are the manager of something because stuff leaks.  It 
disappears. Staff steal things.  Someone says “I really like 
these baguettes at the French Meadow so I am going to help myself 
to them”.  Yes sirree.  I would never accuse the member for 
Edmonton Southeast of stealing baguettes from French Meadow, 
but— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Does the member not have to speak to the 
item of business before the Chamber? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  It is a question of 
relevance.  I suspect we will have to leave it to the member's 
discretion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thought it was 
incredibly relevant because you and I spoke about the problem of 
what happens when you are not able to keep tight control of 
things, whether it be a bakery or a book writing magnate.  I have 
absolutely no idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me move on.  In Chapter 27.17 he states that in 1998, as 
part of an audit of Indian affairs, concern was raised about the 
release of funds before complete documentation requirements had 
been satisfied.  The paperwork must be done.  It has to be 
finished, and it was not completed in Indian affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Chapter 27.18 in the 1990 audit of citizenship development 
programs of the Department of the Secretary of State the need to 
establish criteria for evaluating applications and results 
against program objectives was identified.  Ten years ago they 
had the same concerns.  It does not look like a lot has been 
solved since then.  It was consistent with earlier observations 
concerning the need for departments to put more effort into 
monitoring and assessing program results.  Even before 1990 they 
were concerned about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chapter 27.19 states that in 1990 instances were reported where 
the Department of Industry, Science and Technology had not 
exercised due diligence.  Imagine, no due diligence.  Their work 
uncovered cases of projects being approved despite initial 
departmental analyses indicating that they did not meet 
eligibility criteria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chapter 27.20 of the auditor general's report of December 1998 
stated that the 1993 audit of the northern cod adjustment 
recovery program administered by fisheries and oceans revealed 
the lack of a clear legislative authority to deliver the program, 
significant difficulties in targeting payments to those closely 
affected by the moratorium on fishing northern cod, payments to 
individuals who did not meet eligibility requirements, and weak 
financial management and controls.  It looks to me like the 
nineties was kind of a painful decade for governments.  Of course 
we remember that the Mulroney Tories were in office in the early 
nineties up until 1993 and then the Liberals took over. 
Frankly I have not noticed a whole lot of difference.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, if we look at what is actually happening today 
regarding time allocation, it is just unbelievable.  In the 33rd 
parliament which commenced on November 5, 1984, after the 
September 4 election of that year, time allocation and closure 
under Mulroney were brought in 20 times.  There were 18 time 
allocation motions and 2 closure motions for a total of 20 times 
in that parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They got a taste for it.  I guess they figured it was not half 
bad.  They could just ram through whatever they liked.  The 
Tories were re-elected in November 1988.  That parliament ended 
on September 8, 1993, when the writ was dropped by Kim Campbell. 
Remember her, she was the girl that had a summer job in this 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 34th parliament the Tories got right into it and thought 
that they liked it so much they could ram anything through and 
perhaps they were divine.  They brought in time allocation and 
closed debate off 46 times; 31 time allocation motions and 15 
closure motions.  They kind of liked this power thing.  They 
could pretty well do whatever they liked here.  They could just 
motor through.  They could shove it through.  They could ram it 
through.  They could do whatever because, after all, perhaps they 
had the divine right to govern.  They were here so they could do 
whatever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we add 20 and 46, that makes 66 times in the 33rd and 34th 
parliaments which commenced on November 5, 1984 and went until 
September 8, 1993.  That is unbelievable.  Now there are some 
Liberals snorting over there, shaking their heads in dismay.  It 
was disgusting, certainly, but it was over nine years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at time allocation and closure in this parliament. I 
know one of the members over there is new and she probably could 
hardly believe these numbers herself, but let me just refresh her 
memory.  The 35th parliament began on January 17, 1994, after the 
October 1993 election.  As I recall it was about 54 degrees below 
zero that day.  Does anyone remember?  Some would and some would 
not.  In January 1994 when that parliament began it was cold, but 
boy it was hot in here.  They were gearing up for unbelievable 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry McCormick:</B>  It was not bike weather.  That is 
for sure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  It was not bike weather.  The member 
got that right.  In the 35th parliament which started on January 
17, 1994, 37 times the government closed off debate with 32 time 
allocation motions and 5 closure motions.  It is unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 36th parliament, which is still ongoing and seems longer 
all the time because we watch them in operation and it is 
thoroughly amazing, 30 times already the Liberals have brought in 
closure on various motions: 29 time allocation motions and 1 
closure motion.  That is why we have a record setting event here 
today on this report stage to which I am speaking.  It is hard to 
believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think any one of them should be proud of it.  I do not 
think any one of them is proud of it but they can explain it away 
so well.  The Ottawa 67s, here they are right across the way: 67 
times with 61 time allocation motions and 6 closure motions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They would have all kinds of reasons, I am sure.  They would 
have all kinds of reasons about how hard it is to govern and how 
they need to get all this magnificent legislation through.  Some 
of it has been pretty thin gruel, as you have noticed, Mr. 
Speaker, because you sit in that chair for some hours at a time, 
thinking to yourself, I bet, what does this have to do with the 
nation's business.  Precious little.  He is seized of the issue. 
Yet there it is.  It is all so important they just have to ram it 
through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of it probably need not be brought forward in the first 
place. Some of the big legislation we have to deal with in this 
place gets short shrift.  With 67 times these Liberals even 
outshoot and outscore the Mulroney Tories for closing off debate. 
They never thought they would hear that.  I am sure they did not, 
but they are there.  They are the record holder now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I like Mark McGwire's record myself a whole lot better.  There 
is a champ who knows how to hit a home run.  He is supposed to 
hit home runs.  That is what he gets paid for.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government does not get paid to stifle debate and ram things 
through.  The Mulroney Tory reign in power commenced on November 
5, 1984 and ended September 8, 1993, approximately nine 
years.  The Liberals under the Prime Minister came to 
power on January 17, 1994.  They reached their 67th use of time 
allocation and time restriction on May 16, 2000, today. 
What a sad day for democracy.  As I recall that bunch of 
people used to go pretty ballistic.  I was here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to read a few quotes which are really precious. Let 
us go back to Mackenzie King.  He was the longest serving Liberal 
prime minister.  He said in the 1930s that closure was, “The 
most coercive and arbitrary act of which a government is 
capable”. Imagine.  Something has changed between then and now. 
He was a Liberal prime minister too.  Is that not something.  He 
said that it was the most coercive and arbitrary act of which a 
government was capable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If given the chance the government members would leap to their 
feet and say that things have changed, that things are different 
now and they know what they are doing, that Mackenzie King had it 
easy.  I do not think Mackenzie King had a really great time in 
government in the 1930s.  Those were not happy times in our 
country.  Yet it is okay now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a speech given by Mr. Stanley Knowles against the use of 
closure, he referred to former Liberal minister Frank Oliver's 
statements on the subject when he said, “Closure is not a blow 
at the rights of the Canadian people.  When closure is imposed in 
this way by the moving of a motion that is out of order, it is a 
blow that strikes at the very heart of our democratic system”. 
Those were carefully chosen words.  That was a Liberal who said 
in 1956 that closure was not a blow at the rights of the Canadian 
people, it is a blow at the very heart of the democratic system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, the government members would say that things are 
different now too and that it is not closure.  I love that little 
argument.  They say it is not closure, that it is time 
allocation.  Not one person in the House, even the Liberals when 
the day comes when they are in the opposition, could be convinced 
that there is a big fat difference between time allocation and 
closure.  It is semantics.  It makes a precious argument and it 
looks good in the scrum.  But they will never convince me or 
anybody else across the country that there is any major 
difference between closure and time allocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No matter what the logistics of it are, the end run is always 
the same.  The government stifles debate in the House. When I 
first came here I thought this was the house of debate. Yet 
whatever it is, it does not suit the Liberals' purposes and they 
want to ram it through so they use time allocation or closure. It 
really makes no difference what we call it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me go to another one.  This is the member for Ottawa West in 
1989.  For goodness sake, she is here to hear it.  I am sure she 
will confirm it.  Talking about Mulroney, she said, “This 
government has shown it has no respect for the public process, no 
respect for parliament and no respect for the opinions of the 
public”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here she is today being dubbed as one of the Ottawa 67s.  In 
government it is so much easier.  It is fine when they are in 
government to ram it through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall:</B>  It is harder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  It is harder but still not too hard. 
Otherwise they would not have to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe we should get a banner made up. Maybe we could go to the 
hockey team.  Now that it is May we could get the Ottawa 67s 
jerseys and hand them over to those folks.  They would not be 
able to wear them proudly like the Ottawa 67s hockey club does. 
The Ottawa 67s hockey club is proud to wear them.  What does 67 
mean?  I was 15 and I remember that song.  We were proud in 1967 
of the Ottawa 67s hockey club.  Yet the deputy whip said it is 
harder when in government. 
Maybe it is.  But the question is, is it necessary?  I think not.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the legislation that has gone through the House probably 
was not necessary to even bring forward.  That which was, surely 
to heaven, if everyone in the House spoke for 10 minutes on it, 
that would not be insurmountable.  Members are given 10 minutes 
for speeches.  The Leader of the Opposition is given an unlimited 
amount of time which we appreciate, but not everyone is so lucky. 
I am lucky and I am blessed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say again for all hon. members who are either listening 
or pretending they are reading that being in government is an 
incredible, serious responsibility.  The government members 
cannot just toss this stuff off and say it was not okay in 
opposition, but it is okay now in government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is the Ottawa 67s and it says Liberals on the jersey.  Is 
that not cute.  They would be proud to wear those Liberal 
jerseys, I am sure.  Taxpayers' dollars were not used, an hon. 
member paid for it.  I bet he wears this jersey with a lot more 
pride than he would wear an Ottawa 67s jersey today because he is 
a member of the 67th time allocation government that is proud of 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me read a quote by another person who sits in the House, the 
current government House leader.  When I first came here in 1989 
I do remember the rants.  Oh my. I sat back up over there between 
the Liberals and the NDP.  I was the first and only Reformer for 
four and a half years, and oh, he was the professor, as one of 
his colleagues has said.  He thought differently of time 
allocation when he was in opposition, I dare say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though it is so difficult for him to bring it in, and 
harder as two of his colleagues have said, now that the Liberals 
are in government, this is what he said.  I thought he believed 
it because I was here in November 1992 when he said, “I am 
shocked.  Perhaps I should not be shocked. This government has 
used closure on dozens and dozens and dozens of occasions. This 
is just terrible.  This time we are talking about a major piece 
of legislation.  Shame on those Tories across the way”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was the government House leader.  How things change. How 
things change when they go from this side to over there.  Oh, it 
is harder.  It is like when your mom and dad say, “It kills me 
to have to give you a licking.  It hurts me more than it does you 
to have to send you to your bedroom. I am so sorry I have to do 
this to you”.   Nobody buys it. Nobody buys it at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I am not sure if you are ready for a shift change. 
I am delighted to have you here, but I have another good quote 
which I will set aside until the Deputy Speaker, the hon. member 
for Kingston and the Islands, takes the chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Winnipeg South Centre who is now our 
Minister of Foreign Affairs had this to say on March 31, 1993, 
“Madam Speaker, do you realize that with the vote this 
afternoon, closure has been used in this House 25 times since 
1988”. Oh, my, he was scandalized.  Twenty-five times does not 
hold a candle to what we are at today with 67.  He said, “That 
equals the number of times closure was used from 1913 to 1988”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Wow, it is growing exponentially now.  “In four years this 
government has used closure more often than all the other 
governments going back to 1913”.  From 1913 to 1988 of course he 
was scandalized by that as a Liberal opposition member.   Boy, he 
has eclipsed them now. He went on to say on March 31, 1993, 
“That is a direct demonstration of the kind of disdain the 
Minister for International Trade and his colleagues have for the 
Canadian people”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess we have seen disdain with a capital <I>D</I> here today. 
The Liberals do not want to hear a dialogue or a debate.  It is 
so awkward and just gets in the way of things.  It is so 
difficult to ram things through if people are being obstinate and 
they want to debate the issues.  Honestly.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be willing to waste that much time is unbelievable.  We would 
almost think the Liberals got elected to debate the issues or 
something.  They do not want to hear a dialogue or a debate; they 
simply want to close the door so they cannot hear the real voice 
of the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Liberal member in opposition back in 1993 said, “These kinds 
of arrangements concocted in the backrooms in the wealthy eating 
clubs the Minister for International Trade frequents are not 
working in the interest of Canadians.  They are not working in 
the interest of other working people around the world”.  How 
things change.  Yet they will say to me today, “Things are 
harder when we are in government.  It is so difficult to bring in 
time allocation and closure when we are in government.  It is 
hard don't you know, girl?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know a remedy for all that pain they are going through.  Let 
people in the House address it and have a debate when it is over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me read one more quote.  I have some really good stuff here 
about the minister's reserve and I will get right back to that, 
but let me finish the quote.  It hit the newspaper.  Not much 
from <I>Hansard</I> hits the newspaper but this did.  This was the 
article on April 1, 1993, “That is as many times as closure was 
used between 1913 and 1988 and displays the utter disdain with 
which this government treats the Canadian people, said an angry 
Minister for International Trade”. It is hard to believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was talking about the transitional jobs fund and I made 
mention also of the auditor general.  I think one of the 
particular funding lines that I was using in terms of amounts, 
was pretty staggering, it was a doozy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  It is well worth waiting for.  They 
are sitting on the edges of their chairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Good, they ought to be sitting on the 
edges of their chairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was talking about funding for the provinces and it was an 
amazing amount of cash.  It is hard to believe, it was millions 
and millions of dollars.  I would like to narrow that down a 
little and talk about some of the specifics of particular 
ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister for HRD oversees the whole thing.  I would like to 
use one example from her riding, that of Duchess Foods 
International which we asked a few questions about in question 
period not so long ago.  Let us look at this particular riding. 
We do not want to be critical of Duchess Foods in particular, it 
is just the example I am using today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an access to information document which we received in 
September 1999.  Duchess Foods International is a prosperous six 
year old business from Hamilton which makes frozen food products, 
such as stuffed baked potatoes, for the President's Choice label. 
It relocated to the riding of the HRD minister after receiving a 
transitional jobs fund grant of $369,000 on May 26, 1998.  The 
minister had provided her approval on May 9, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The company purchased land from the city of Brantford for 
$112,400 in June 1998 and received two Business Development Bank 
loans in January 1999 totalling $1.5 million. It also received a 
targeted wage subsidy grant of $20,305 on August 7, 1998.  That 
is my wedding anniversary.  I did not get exactly that on that 
day, but it got a grant of $20,000. The local mayor and 
development board officer were keen to move the factory.  A local 
Brant agribusiness opportunities agent also pressed for the 
grant.  The total project cost was $2.1 million and total federal 
assistance was $1.89 million, not much to take up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from Hamilton is here. I know that she was interested 
in this when it all happened.  It is hard to believe that on 
March 20 HRDC Brantford staff faxed this memo to the Duchess 
owner, “As mentioned, we do have a major concern regarding the 
displacement of jobs from one community to another, i.e., 
Hamilton to Brantford.  You may wish to clarify your position. 
Were these new jobs that were being created?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>HRDC itself said this looked like a transfer.  We just asked a 
question in here a few days ago about that very thing. 
It is that shell game that I mentioned earlier.  It takes this 
over here and shoves it over on this side and people get so mixed 
up they are not quite sure what happened in the first place.  But 
it looks to me, and probably to any other taxpayer who might be 
watching this, that if it took <I>x</I> number of jobs from 
Hamilton and slipped them across to Brantford, not many miles 
down the road, how in the name of good sense could they call that 
job creation?  I do not even think that is a possibility.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The funding analysis and recommendation document from the local 
HRD office explained:  “The employer has satisfied the issue of 
relocation from Hamilton to Brantford.  The number of jobs to 
Brantford is significant, especially at the non or low skilled 
level, which will meet the needs of our labour market”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who convinced them of that?  I do not think anyone was totally 
convinced.  On April 10, 1998 Duchess Foods wrote to the HRD 
office in Brantford explaining that it planned to renovate a 
facility in Hamilton, but decided it was not suitable and dropped 
the idea.  It pressed for a grant and made it clear that it would 
not move without it.  Oh, here comes the threat:  “We will not 
move without it.  Give us the money or else”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 9 Duchess Foods asked for a decision within three 
weeks.  Later it changed the deadline to May 8, saying “I am 
doing business in your riding.  I want to move my business 
because my facility is not big enough or good enough any more. 
Give me the money or I am out of here”.  That does not sound 
like cricket, Mr. Speaker.  I am not sure you would run your 
business that way:  “Give me the money or I am gone”.  No, you 
are in business because you think it is a good deal.  You will 
work hard and it will help you in your retirement.  You enjoy it 
while you are there.  I have seen you enjoy it while you are 
swabbing the decks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 7, 1998 the local HRD office stated that Duchess Foods 
had decided to purchase land and build, not lease, a building in 
Brantford.  This was also stated in the minister's approval 
document.  Application was made for the money on May 14.  The 
company preferred to stay in Hamilton to retain its employees. 
That sounds like ping-pong, going from Hamilton to Brantford and 
then back to Hamilton, saying “Give us the money.  If you do not 
give us the money we are not going to go.  Now we are going to 
stay here”.  On and on it goes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It decided to move because the facility in Hamilton was housed 
in three separate buildings.  It wanted to consolidate and 
expand, yet the old facility was a total of 29,000 square feet 
and the new one it constructed in Brantford was 13% smaller. 
Woops.  “We didn't have enough space with 29,000 square feet, so 
we are going to build a new place with 25,000 square feet”.  It 
is not bigger and better, that is for sure.  It says, though, 
that it could be enlarged.  When it gets some government cash 
down the road it might be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its application documents Duchess Foods indicated that it 
expected 96 employees to leave the company because of the move. 
These would be moved to Brantford and 60 more jobs would be 
added, for a total of 156, but only 60 of them would be new. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the speaker, Mr. Speaker, and you did too, I am sure. In 
fact, I have every question that has been asked about this whole 
thing in this document, which I will get to sometime later. I am 
sure she told me that 156 jobs were created.  Whoops.  In fact, 
most of it was shuffling the deck, transferring around—move them 
here, move them there, move them anywhere.  Only 60 of them were 
new. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The TJF program approval document, signed by the minister, 
mentioned:  “It is anticipated that a number of the current 
employees of the company will not transfer to the Brantford 
location”.  That seems pretty clear.  They are not going.  They 
probably had a long enough commute anyway and they are not 
interested in commuting any farther. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In February a large layoff—and we do not know the 
size—principally of Brantford residents, prompted complaints to 
the minister's office.  The reason was unclear.  The employer 
said they would not be rehired due to poor performance.  I guess 
they were doing okay at the Hamilton facility if they were going 
to be put in the new facility, but all of a sudden, poof, due to 
poor performance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The HRD office explained that the owner neglected to tell them 
that the jobs were seasonal—“Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you. 
You are laid off”—and then mentioned that a reorganization was 
necessary in order to maintain and attract new customers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As of February 25, 1999, just over a year ago, 60% of the 
employees were from Brantford and the rest were from Hamilton. 
Those from Hamilton were slowly dropping off.  I would not want 
to make that commute every day.  I know that traffic is very busy 
in that area and it would not be much fun to drive, I am 
assuming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only $101,762, or 27%, went to wage costs. 
The remaining three-quarters went to capital and building costs, 
and the cost of moving equipment.  I do not think that is allowed 
under that grant.  I think most of it was supposed to go to wage 
costs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The approval document signed by the minister stated “The 
funding will be taken from the minister's TJF special allocation 
for Brantford”.  Dippity do.  Presumably this referred to the 
$500,000 allocation from the minister's reserve.  As of August 5 
Duchess Foods had not submitted a final report on its project, 
due on June 2, the first anniversary of the official signing of 
the TJF grant.  Of course, there are a few questions that would 
need to be asked.  We have asked many of them.  It is a pity they 
are not answered.  But, anyway, we will ask them again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The HRD minister said that the $500,000 allocation from the 
minister's reserve was never spent, yet the document signed by 
the former minister of HRD, now the Minister for International 
Trade, said that it was.  One says it was signed; the other says 
it was not signed.  Who is telling the truth?  It is a pretty 
simple question.  If one says <I>A</I> and one says <I>B</I>, and 
they are diametrically opposed, then surely somebody is not 
coming forward with the goods.  We need that answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is another question.  The approval documents signed by the 
minister showed that the unemployment rate was 10.3%.  Why was 
the main TJF rule broken for the minister?  We know it was 12%, 
but it is the old “We have pockets of unemployment.  We can just 
pick a pocket and put the cash in”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is another one.  Why was so much federal money given to the 
company?  The project appears to have been 90% financed by the 
federal government.   Who would not want a sweet deal like that? 
It was 90% financed by the federal government.  Do hon. members 
think that if they had a business in the same area, in the same 
sector, that they might be a little frustrated because it might 
put them at just a hair of a disadvantage?  That is unbelievable. 
How could anyone run a business side by side with this company? 
When it moved in it got 90% of its funding from the federal 
government.  Are other businesses supposed to compete with that? 
I do not think so.  How could any company resist this 
proposition?  How could anyone turn up their nose at it?  It only 
had to put up $200,000 to get an entirely new building. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is another question.  Why was a successful company, 
operating profitably in one community, given government money to 
move to another community?  Why was federal TJF money used to 
displace workers, to ship them from here to there?  That is 
unreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is another question.  Why did the HRD minister claim that 
156 jobs were being created when only 60 were created?  That is 
quite a discrepancy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is another question.  The highest paying job created was 
$10 an hour.  Were federal tax dollars used to trade higher wage 
jobs in Hamilton for lower wage jobs in Brantford?  I guess that 
is a legitimate question that needs to be answered.  If there is 
a good straightforward answer for it, then we want to say “Sure, 
we will buy that”.  But I do not think the Liberals have ever 
come forward with an answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The highest paying job created was $10 an hour.  Were federal 
dollars used to trade higher wage jobs in Hamilton for lower wage 
jobs out in Brantford?  That is another example of how the 
minister could get her paws, get her claws, get her hands on an 
amazing amount of money.  That is the riding of Brant.  I could 
go on and on about that riding, but I will spare hon. members. 
There is a better one coming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members will remember that I told them about how much money 
went into Quebec.  In large measure, of course, it was to buy 
some seats for the Liberals.  But, boy, I would say that in the 
Prime Minister's riding it was a bonanza. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give hon. members a little chronology.  The Prime 
Minister's misuse of the transitional jobs fund:  a chronology. 
This one is precious.  Hon. members read this in the newspaper, I 
am sure.  Oh, yes, they read it in the red book.  I am not sure 
if it was quoted directly in the red book, but it was in the 
newspaper when we were campaigning in Edmonton in 1993.  The 
article is from the <I>Gazette</I> of October 15, 1993, which 
stated:  “In each public appearance in the region Wednesday 
night and yesterday the Prime Minister reminded them that he will 
probably have enormous clout as Prime Minister to pull government 
strings.  `When a dossier for Saint-Maurice lands on a cabinet 
minister's desk—need I say more?' he said to rounds of laughter 
during one meeting yesterday”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There it is.  Is that the raison d'être that a Prime Minister 
comes to power?  Is it for this?  “When a dossier for 
Saint-Maurice lands on a cabinet minister's desk, you bet I will 
be there”. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1140"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who could brag about that?  “Just keep the requests coming.  If 
I am the guy in charge and it lands on my desk, I will be there 
for you.  I will look after you.  I will pay you off”.  That was 
in the <I>Gazette</I> of October 15, 1993.  That is not something 
I could even dream up.  That is an exact quote from the Prime 
Minister when he was running for office.  He ought to be ashamed 
of himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at number one in the chronology, the Auberge du 
Gouverneur Shawinigan.  This $6.4 million hotel project is owned 
by Pierre Thibault, a businessman from Belgium.  He received 
federal government grants and loans.  An amount of $600,000 was 
announced on March 13, 1997 under the HRD targeted wage subsidy 
program, which was then changed to the transitional jobs fund 
when Mr. Thibault claimed that he needed capital funding 
immediately.  He could not afford to wait for wage subsidies, he 
needed the cash right away.  He had a promise from the man who 
would become Prime Minister, saying that if a dossier for 
Saint-Maurice landed on a cabinet minister's desk it would be 
looked after.  What was Pierre Thibault to do?  He had $600,000. 
He could not wait to go the legitimate route. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Thibault lobbied for and received $100,000 under the TJF in 
January 1999.  He had a Business Development Bank loan in the 
amount of $925,000 and a $400,000 unsecured loan for his numbered 
company—and this is a good one, 9047-4412—from Canada Economic 
Development for Quebec Regions, a federal regional development 
fund, in September of 1998.  This totalled $2,025,000.  That was 
a portion of the $6.4 billion, but I am just getting warmed up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me mention political donations.  Quality Inn La Rocaille, 
which is also owned by Mr. Thibault, gave the Prime Minister a 
reception worth $1,054 after the election on June 19.  The 
election was held in October 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The $600,000 grant was announced without any departmental 
paperwork.  That made it simple and fast.  It was advertised in 
the Prime Minister's householder, dated April 1997.  I am not 
privy to what the Prime Minister thinks, but I knew there was an 
election coming.  The writ was dropped, I believe, on April 27, 
1997.  There was no paperwork on this grant, no nothing, but it 
was advertised in the Prime Minister's householder.  Someone in 
his office knew to print this up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Thibault is a self-confessed embezzler.  He has said this 
and there are criminal investigations going on.  He is the 
subject of a criminal investigation and involved in legal 
disputes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 16, 1999 the opposition revealed a memo showing that 
the Prime Minister's office felt it had no choice but to approve 
the grant because the Prime Minister had already personally 
promised the money to Mr. Thibault.  He had even announced it at 
a press conference, even though it did not meet Quebec regional 
TJF guidelines banning funding for restaurant and bar facilities. 
The Prime Minister said he had to approve the loan.  He had a 
gun at his back.  No way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister had already personally promised the money to 
Mr. Thibault.  He could not go back on his promise.  He told him 
that he would give him the money and he announced it at a press 
conference.  The Prime Minister could not be embarrassed.  He 
told Mr. Thibault that he would get the money and he got it. That 
is nuts.  That is the story of the Auberge des Gouverneurs de 
Shawinigan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Things do not stop there.  I am only at page one.  I 
feel like Paul Harvey. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Auberge Grand-Mère is a hotel owned by Yvon Duhaime.  We 
have heard Mr. Duhaime's name before in the House.  This hotel 
lies adjacent to the Grand-Mère golf course, purchased in 1988 by 
a numbered company, 161341 Canada Inc., in which the Prime 
Minister held a 25% interest.  The address of the head office of 
161341 Canada Inc. is still listed as the Auberge Grand-Mère.

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister says that he sold his interest in the company 
to Toronto real estate developer Jonas Prince a few days before 
becoming Prime Minister, but Mr. Prince stated in the press that 
he only purchased an option to buy the shares and chose not to 
exercise it.  There is a big difference between saying I sold it 
and you bought it and saying I sold it and they were actually 
options for shares and somebody chose not to exercise them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In January 1996 the Prime Minister phoned the ethics counsellor 
at home and said that the deal had fallen through.  He was 
advised that he could resume ownership of the shares but he would 
have to declare his interest publicly.  Since he was never paid 
for the shares he knew that he owned them.  Over three years 
later his lawyer, Debbie Weinstein, sold them.  That is 
unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suspect this is getting painfully relevant here.  We see a 
pattern when a government says how well it is managing everything 
for us and “Trust me.  I am from the government and I am here to 
help you”.  This is the way personal affairs are conducted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see what is happening in the House today.  The Prime Minister 
and many government members when they were in opposition said it 
was a dreadful thing.  They were not able to control their shock 
and amazement at the idea of how scandalous it was for the 
Mulroney Tories.  Now all of a sudden they say it is harder when 
in government.  It is so hard and difficult they bring in time 
allocation.  I can see the pain written all over his face as we 
watch the House leader when he is out in scrums.  This is so 
relevant that it hurts every taxpayer in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Duhaime received the following in loans and grants: $615,000 
from the Federal Business Development Bank in 1997; $164,000 from 
HRD transitional jobs fund in July 1997, right after the 
election; $50,000 from the federal regional development fund in 
1997; and $60,799 in five different HRD wage subsidy grants in 
1997 and 1998.  That is a total of $889,799.  That is a lot of 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look a little deeper into the numbered company, 161341. 
It sounds like a CB: 161341 calling.  Let us say earth to 161341. 
Let us look at it.  We received an access request in the 
official opposition from the office of ethics counsellor 
revealing that the Prime Minister did not formally resign his 
dictatorship in the above numbered company, which owns the 
Grand-Mère golf course, until March 4, 1994, almost five months 
after he became Prime Minister.  The document was signed on March 
8 and filed on March 14, 1994.  It also states that the Prime 
Minister phoned the ethics counsellor personally at home on the 
evening of January 27, 1996, to discuss the fact that he still 
owned his shares in the company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that if he had a little problem he might phone 
the guy during office hours.  If it was life threatening he might 
have to do something like that, but the Prime Minister again kept 
standing in the House and saying that everything was okay, 
everything was absolutely legit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I have to phone my staff at home in the evening it would have 
to be very serious.  I do not think it is my business to just 
ring them up and say “Hey, I want you to look into this for 
me”, unless it was a pretty big crisis.  They have a life too. I 
do not know how busy the ethics counsellor is day or night, but 
if he is getting a call at night from the Prime Minister I know 
there is something going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also reveals that Mr. Wilson, the ethics counsellor, kept in 
close contact with Peter Donolo, a handy little relationship.  He 
was the communications director I mentioned some time earlier who 
crossed over to Italy, I think.  The Prime Minister's lawyer, 
Debbie Weinstein, whom I mentioned a few minutes ago, perhaps 
helped the Prime Minister to defend himself against charges of 
conflict of interest.  We have to get the whole team in on it 
now.  Things are getting dicey.  He has to phone the ethics 
counsellor at home.  He has to phone the lawyer.  He has to keep 
Peter Donolo in there because surely he could put a good spin on 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the Prime Minister has repeatedly maintained that the 
sale of the shares has been in the hands of his lawyer since he

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Oops, if that were the case, I would bet a dollar he would not 
have had to phone Howard Wilson late at night.  Here is a quote 
from June 8, 1999: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I became PM I sold those shares and I gave the problem or 
the receivable to my trustee as with my other assets.  She is in 
charge of managing it. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was June 8, 1999, in <I>Hansard</I>.  Then we see in March 
1994 that he phoned the ethics counsellor.  We know the Prime 
Minister phoned the ethics counsellor and the counsellor 
subsequently met personally with the Prime Minister about it on 
February 12, 1996 and July 18, 1996.  The Prime Minister took a 
very active role and personal interest in the file.  It is in 
<I>Hansard</I>, and dear knows <I>Hansard</I> is gospel, where he 
said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I became PM I sold those shares and I gave the problem or 
the receivable to my trustee as with my other assets.  She is in 
charge of managing it. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is why the heck is he phoning the ethics counsellor 
and meeting with him personally on various occasions about this 
thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the Prime Minister has repeatedly said that his golf 
course shares were out of his hands.  They were out of this world 
but not out of his hands.  A chronology included in the access to 
information request implies otherwise.  Let us look at the dates 
of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On January 27, 1996, the Prime Minister called Mr. Wilson at 
home to tell him the sale of shares had fallen through.  On 
February 12 Mr. Wilson met personally with the Prime Minister. On 
May 8 Mr. Wilson met with the Prime Minister's lawyer, Debbie 
Weinstein.  On July 18 Mr. Wilson met personally again with the 
Prime Minister.  On July 18 Mr. Wilson sent a model blind 
management agreement to Debbie Weinstein.  In other words this is 
the way it is done.  It has not been done right.  Do it this way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a wonder he had time to run the country.  He was busy, 
busy meeting with Debbie Weinstein, Peter Donolo and Mr. Wilson. 
It is hard to imagine he would have had the time or the energy to 
run the country in between golf games. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This implies that the Prime Minister was told that he would have 
to set up a formal blind management agreement in order to have 
his lawyer deal with the sale of shares.  A blind management 
agreement is struck when one person manages the property of a 
politician on his or her behalf.  Some of us should be that lucky 
to be in that position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The necessity for such an agreement would indicate that the 
Prime Minister, the ethics counsellor and the lawyer all assumed 
that the Prime Minister still owned the shares in the golf 
course. Otherwise why would he be filling it out? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the Prime Minister has insisted that he resigned his 
directorship in 161341 Canada Inc. before he became Prime 
Minister.  On June 1, 1999, a week before, he said again in 
<I>Hansard</I>: “I quit this company before I became Prime 
Minister”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we learn that he really did not formally resign his 
directorship until March 14, 1994, more than four months after he 
became Prime Minister.  It appears that Mr. Wilson struggled to 
get him to quit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is similar to when we go to a fair and they have these little 
holes in which gophers keep popping up.  We get a great big 
hammer and we are allowed to just bang and bash these guys down 
into their holes but they keep popping up again.  I am sure that 
is how Mr. Wilson felt.  I am sure he thought he looked after the 
problem and got him to put it in a blind trust but poof, up it 
comes over here.  He tried to solve it by getting Debbie 
Weinstein to look into this blind trust, and then poof, it pops 
up over here.  He had a heck of a time getting the Prime Minister 
to actually quit that directorship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the dates.  On October 21, which is four days 
before the election in 1993, the ethics counsellor's office told 
the Prime Minister's lawyer, Debbie Weinstein, that he was still 
a director of the company and must resign.  In other words, this 
guy might be the Prime Minister in four days.  Get him to resign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 8 the Prime Minister made a personal information 
statement on appointment to office of the ethics counsellor.  On 
December 22, we are getting close to Christmas here, a 
confidential report written by the ethics counsellor indicated 
that something was wrong.  Merry Christmas.  He has had two 
months since October 25.  It is now almost December 25 and there 
is a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On January 27, 1994, the counsellor's office phoned the 
assistant to the Prime Minister, Monique Bondar, who promised to 
ensure that he was no longer a director of 161341.  Oops, there 
comes the gopher head again.  She says okay.  She gets into it 
now and says she will look after it, as she bonks it on the head.

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The contents of letter from Monique Bondar of February 1994 were 
severed.  It said that the prime minister no longer had an 
interest in the golf course.  Boing, she thought she had the 
gofer down in the hole.  Whew, she had that out of the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 1, 1994, the Prime Minister signed a statement of 
public declaration of past outside activities stating that he was 
a director of the Grand-Mère golf club, formerly 161341 Canada 
Inc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 1 there was also a letter from Howard Wilson to the 
Prime Minister that raised an issue which was severed.  What was 
that issue?  Why is there a lack of transparency?  Why did he 
need this little meeting with the Prime Minister?  Why, through 
access to information, were the contents severed?  It seems to me 
that if it is information which is helpful and legit it might as 
well be brought forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Who appoints that guy, anyway? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Questions could be raised as to who 
appoints the ethics counsellor, what is his job and to whom 
should he report?  He gets appointed by the Prime Minister and 
reports to the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  And he investigates the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  He investigates the Prime Minister. He 
does not report to parliament.  If I were to ask you, Mr. 
Speaker, to make me accountable, then I ought to be accountable 
to people who are watching.  Instead, if I asked you to make me 
accountable and then we have a quiet coffee some place for you to 
tell me if you think I am accountable or not, what will it look 
look or what will it smell like?  The whole thing is pretty 
suspicious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure this poor ethics counsellor is trying his darndest to 
make sure everything is legitimate.  However he does not have to 
answer to anybody.  He just has to have coffee with the Prime 
Minister and say here is how it looks, Joe, John, Harry or 
whoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 16, a couple of weeks later, a letter from the Prime 
Minister's lawyer to Mr. Wilson stated that the document removing 
him as director was filed with the incorporations branch of 
Industry Canada on March 14, 1994.  Why would he say on June 1, 
1999, that he quit the company before he was Prime Minister? Also 
he said it on June 8, 1999: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I became PM I sold those shares and I gave the problem or 
the receivable to my trustee...She is in charge of managing it. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not look good.  On November 15, 1994, a minute sheet was 
signed by the ethics counsellor.  Of course the contents were 
severed when we got the information.  It is entitled “Ownership 
Interest of Grand-Mère Golf Club”.  This implies that the issue 
was not yet resolved.  Otherwise, why would they have a document 
about it?  It could be that the resignation was recorded in the 
private minutes of 161341 Canada Inc. before he became Prime 
Minister and the routine official documents were filed after the 
fact, but the exchange of letters and calls from Mr. Wilson's 
office obviously suggest otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I beg anyone in the House or outside to say that this is perhaps 
irrelevant.  I do not think so.  This is so relevant that it 
hurts.  We see the business practices of the Prime Minister.  We 
see a person who said before the election that if anything 
crossed his desk or any cabinet minister's desk which had to do 
with his riding, he was being a good little MP.  Perhaps it is 
not so good.  We are so far in debt and yet we see this kind of 
political manipulation and interference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two important issues.  First, the Prime Minister's 
word is what is relevant to the whole debate today.  How good is 
his word?  There appear to be contradictions between what he said 
and what he did.  There is proof through access to information 
that is exactly what happened.  That is a case we have uncovered. 
Lord knows how many more there are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are some more unanswered questions which never get answered 
in question period but need to be raised.  It would be great if 
they ever did get answered.  Did the Prime Minister declare that 
he was a former director of 161341 Canada Inc. when he was in 
reality a current director? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious he was a director from the election in October 
1993 to March 1994 when somebody caught up to him and said that 
he was still a director.  Why did he declare that he was a former 
director when at that time he was a present director?  If he was 
a director during those four months, was he in a position of 
conflict of interest at any time? 
Those were huge questions because the Prime Minister's attitude 
was “Cross my desk and I will look after you.  Just let me know 
if you need help and I will look after you”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Prime Minister was appointed to office, what did he 
declare in his December 8, 1993 personal information statement 
about his directorship?   We have proof that he was still a 
director.  Howard Wilson would tell us that if we could ever find 
him.  He only has quiet coffees with the Prime Minister but we 
would love it if he would come here and report to parliament, 
which is, I think, what his job ought to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What exactly was in his statement of December 8?  The contents 
were severed from the request.  We ended up with a couple of 
pages that were mostly whited out and five or six pages missing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  They must buy that whiteout by the 45 
gallon drum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>   Maybe 161342 Canada Inc. is a 
whiteout company for which he is partial owner.  Who knows? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a confidential report by the ethics counsellor about 
this matter dated December 22, 1993.  Why was it necessary and 
what did it say?  It would be great if we could have a look at 
that document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is another one.  When did the Prime Minister learn that his 
sale of shares had fallen through?  What other active interest 
did he take in the management of 161341 Canada Inc. prior to and 
following January 27, 1996?  I wonder just how closely his 
fingerprints were monitored there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is another question.  Did the blind management agreement 
have anything to do with the sale of land and the golf course 
owned by 161341 Canada Inc., which took place only weeks later? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is another one.  Almost all the contents of the 700 page 
request were severed.  There were 700 pages but we only got four. 
It was like being told that there were 700 pages but that we 
could only get six and a half.  Most of the pages were just 
completely gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Prime Minister has nothing to hide, why will he not 
release all the relevant information and lay this matter to rest? 
It seems absolutely unbelievable why he would not just say that 
he has it and that he will come forward with it.  There is an 
amazing chronology there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me go to another case in Shawinigan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Does it ever end? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  No, it never ends, but question period 
will be here soon.  Maybe we will be able to ask some questions 
about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me get to Aérospatiale Globax Inc. and the illegal trust 
funds.  On March 7, 1997 the owner, René Giguère, received a TJF 
grant of $2.04 million, announced a month prior to the election 
call.  There we go again, $2 million right before the election. 
In other words “If something happens to us here we want to make 
sure you get the cash first”.  Its two daughter companies are 
Placeteco and TechniPaint.  Questions have also been raised any 
number of times in the House on those two companies.  As recently 
as yesterday, the minister said that if anything was coming out 
through access to information that we could have it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if we look at the track record of the government when 
it comes to forwarding documents, most of the pages in the 
documents have either been whited out or shredded out and 
precious little is left to get our hands on to really look at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the political donations of this bunch:  $4,000 
from Globax to the Prime Minister's personal campaign in 1997; 
$10,692.40 from Globax to the Liberal Party in 1997; $3,467.90 
from Placeteco to the Liberal Party in 1997; $604.48—I am not 
sure how someone gives 48 cents to a political party unless it is 
rounded out—from TechniPaint to the Liberal Party in 1997; and 
$569.60 from Placeteco to the Liberal Party in 1998.  This totals 
$19,334.38.  This is not a bad return.  Get a grant and give back 
a donation and things are looking pretty sweet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What a wonderful way to do business:  Give some, take some, give 
some and on and on it goes.  That is the way the Prime Minister 
says that business goes.  He says that he is just being a good 
little MP for his constituents.  That was in March 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 23, 1997, just before the writ was dropped, the first 
instalment of $440,000 was disbursed to the company.  Yee hee, 
here is $440,000. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1205"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 27, 1998, almost a year later, on the last day of the 
1998 fiscal year, the second instalment was paid to a trust fund 
set up with the law firm Champagne Cleroux Avocats.  To ensure 
that TJF funds did not lapse at the end of the fiscal year, the 
lawyer involved was Gilles Champagne.  We have seen his name 
before if we have looked through <I>Hansard</I>.  I have some 
<I>Hansard</I> clippings here, that I will get to in a little 
while, but they are precious.  Gilles Champagne was talked about 
quite a little bit.  He was a two-time political appointee of the 
Prime Minister to Canada Post Corporation.  His contract was 
renewed on September 28, 1999 and he is still there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 5, 1998 an HRDC staffer commented by e-mail, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The subsidy being an interesting element for a future buyer, the 
Office of the Prime Minister wishes that HRDC do all that which 
is legally possible to do because if the sale does not take 
place, a bankruptcy and layoffs will result. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Businesses do go bankrupt and layoffs do happen but this is a 
staffer saying “Come on, better get this going here.  Do all you 
possibly can”.  It is a very strange thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 11, 1998 TJF officer, Clément Parent, wrote that he had 
serious reservations about the sale.  This was somebody who was 
pretty worried about this.  Did the Liberals pay any attention? 
No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 17, 1998, just a few days later, HRDC authorized that 
all but $10,000 of the $1.2 million in the trust fund be paid to 
the Globax subsidiary, Placeteco, now purchased by Claude 
Gauthier owner of Transelec Inc.  We have seen him on the pages 
before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It carries on.  On December 10, 1998 Placeteco went bankrupt 
anyway.  All the jobs that the minister and the Prime Minister 
talked about, all the wonderful jobs that were created, were 
created and then the employees were laid off.  Mr. Gauthier 
re-purchased it.  Do we not just love it?   We can go bankrupt 
and then just re-buy the thing a few days later, eight days 
later. He stated that as the new owner he would not be bound by 
the hiring requirements contained in the contract with HRDC and 
resumed operations with just 62 employees, less than half of the 
155 jobs he had agreed to.  It never ends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Gauthier got government money, went belly up and then 
re-bought eight days later and said “Here I am again, all you 
lucky people, and I do not have to abide by your guidelines.  I 
do not need to hire 155 people. I will hire a skeleton crew of 62 
to do the work”.  That is what we call cash in our pockets.  It 
is a sweet deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 7, 1999, just a year ago, the last instalment of the 
$400,000 was paid in trust to Deloitte & Touche at the request of 
Mr. Giguère who claimed that a big deal for TechniPaint was in 
progress.  It is like someone saying “Stay tuned, a big deal is 
coming.  We want more money and we are coming for more. 
Everything will be okay because we have a big deal cooking”.  If 
it was such a big deal there ought to have been enough private 
people to invest in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 25, 1999, almost a year ago, HRDC headquarters heard of 
trust funds and found that the first trust fund violated section 
34 of the Financial Administration Act and Treasury Board 
guidelines.  This was starting to get serious.  It was not just 
my word against his word.   This was the Treasury Board 
guidelines and the Financial Administration Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second trust fund violated Treasury Board guidelines.  The 
funds had to be closed and the money, with interest, returned to 
the consolidated revenue fund.  Great, that is a really sweet and 
practical use of taxpayers' dollars.  Why this money is being 
shipped out to these people in the first place would be a really 
good question to ask. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on.  Number five is the lobbying activities of René 
Fugère.  I wish I could be reading members a novel and that this 
was chapter five of a fictitious work, but this is so true that 
it hurts and it so relevant that it hurts even more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure all members remember René Fugère.  I am sure they read 
<I>Hansard</I>.  Whatever they miss in the daytime they catch up 
on at night and they will know René Fugère.  On May 28, 1997 René 
Fugère, an unpaid aide to the Prime Minister, appeared on the 
Prime Minister's behalf at a press conference four days before 
the 1997 election to announce a TJF grant of $164,000 for Yvon 
Duhaime and the Auberge Grand-Mère. 
Why in the world, during a writ period when an election was on, 
was the Prime Minister muddling around giving cash to anybody?  I 
suppose it looked legitimate because somebody was working on his 
behalf.  René Fugère was out there.  It would have almost gone 
against the guidelines that I read from a little earlier about 
the wonderful on site visits that Liberal MPs can have.  These 
were really good.  The criteria was, of course, that it was 
really good for site visits as well and designed to be used by 
the Prime Minister, ministers, secretaries of state and members 
of parliament when planning to visit regions and home 
constituencies.  With an election on, the Prime Minister had to 
be somewhat astute and undercover, so René Fugère went on his 
behalf and said, “Here is the cash, Yvon”.  That was $164,000 
right at election time.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On August 9, 1997 we had the Auberge des Gouverneurs in 
Shawinigan.  Old René Fugère had a hand in that as well. Access 
documents showed that Fugère lobbied for and received an extra 
$100,000 in January 1999 for Mr. Thibeault.  That was not bad. 
That was on top of the $600,000 TJF grant he had already received 
in 1997.  He was a fairly profitable fellow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 12, 1998 Celebrity Boats gave all lobbying authority to 
Mr. Fugère in writing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>   He must be a registered lobbyist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  One would almost think that he would 
be a registered lobbyist.  However, surprisingly, he is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Fugère was part owner of a former incarnation of that 
company.  The company began but it had a few problems.  It was 
not able to live on government money and it collapsed.  However, 
before we knew it, it was reincarnated.  Now I have never 
believed in reincarnation, and I still do not, but when René 
Fugère is involved in the business world it really makes one 
wonder.  He lobbied for $600,000 and got $368,235.  Well, he did 
not get it all, but he did get over 50%.  That was not bad.  He 
asked for $600,000 and got $300,000 and felt that it was all in a 
day's work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 26, 1999 there was the Salle de Quilles Biermans.  This 
bowling alley, owned by Claude Bellerive, burned down.  Whoops. 
It then received $45,000 from TJF with Mr. Fugère's help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 Cirtech Inc., a company also owned by Claude Bellerive, 
gave $4,000 to the Prime Minister's campaign.  I am sure it was 
just a complete irony, but it looked like a 10% rebate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  11% 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  I appreciate 
being corrected.  Nonetheless, he received $45,000 and gave 
$4,000 back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 14, 1999 the <I>National Post</I> reported that EARTH 
Canada received a $38,400 interest-free loan from Canada Economic 
Development after Fugère was made a director of the company on 
January 13, 1999.  Is it any wonder that any company would want 
him on its list of directors?   It seems to me that he would be a 
pretty worthwhile asset when looking for government cash. Mr. 
Fugère received 150,000 stock options in the company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gilles Champagne, and we have heard that name before, is a 
lawyer friend of the Prime Minister, from Shawinigan, who 
established two illegal trust funds for TJF recipients, was twice 
appointed director of Canada Post Corporation by the Prime 
Minister.  He was made president, chairman and CEO.  He got 
500,000 shares.   May 14 was a lucky day for EARTH Canada.  It is 
saying “EARTH to Fugère.  EARTH to Champagne”.  These two guys 
are very close and are now hitting the big times.  They are 
members of the board, the president, the chairman and the CEO of 
EARTH Canada.  They also have stock options. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 19, 1999, almost a year ago, the ethics counsellor wrote 
to the RCMP asking it to investigate the activities of Fugère for 
a possible breach of the Lobbyists Registration Act.  Was it any 
wonder?  He was certainly busy.  When one writes to the RCMP 
asking for an investigation, it would seem that things are not 
exactly legitimate or above board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us move on to November 1999, just a few months ago, and a 
company called Les Maisons Beam.  The <I>National Post</I> said 
that Mr. Fugère asked for 6.5% of whatever he could get of a TJF 
grant for this company. 
The company paid him $15,000 in service for 1988 but when he 
asked for $8,000 more, the company refused.  It is not a good 
thing to get greedy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fugère allegedly phoned the department and told it to shelve the 
application.  In other words “Oh, oh, I got caught here.  Better 
shelve the thing and keep it quiet”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>December 15, 1999, just a few months ago, the <I>National 
Post</I> reported that 10 days after the first TJF disbursement of 
$100,000 was received by the Auberge Grand-Mère, Yvon Duhaime cut 
a cheque for $11,500 to Fugère. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  One would wonder if it was a 
commission.  I guess we cannot really say that it might be a 
commission or a cut, but boy, I will say it looks like dollars 
for dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 29, 2000, leap year day just a couple of months ago, 
the opposition revealed that Mr. Fugère also lobbied for the 
Scierie Opitciwan sawmill on a reserve in Quebec in the riding of 
Champlain, next door to the riding of Saint-Maurice.  Does the 
hon. member remember the old quote?  I am not sure he was here 
when I was reading the quote of the Prime Minister before the 
election in 1993, so I will make sure I share that with him 
because it is incredibly relevant to the Scierie Opitciwan 
reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 15, 1993, just a few days before the election, the 
Prime Minister reminded the people in a public appearance that he 
would have enormous clout as Prime Minister to pull government 
strings.   He said, “When a dossier for Saint-Maurice, anything 
out of that riding, lands on a cabinet minister's desk, basically 
I will be there to look out for you”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It looks like that is exactly what happened with the Opitciwan 
sawmill on the reserve in Quebec.  The sawmill received in 1998 
$300,000 from TJF, a $1.8 million loan from Canada economic 
development for Quebec regions and a $200,000 subsidy from the 
Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. Not bad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us do a little tracking of the donations to the Prime 
Minister's 1997 campaign.  Exactly one-third, 33% of the 
donations to the Prime Minister's personal election campaign can 
be linked to grants, contributions and contracts in his riding. 
There would be people who could make all kinds of claims that 
this is a terrible thing for us to do and we should not be 
connecting these things one to another, but these are the facts 
and these are the dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aérospatiale Globax Inc. gave $4,000 to the campaign and got $2 
million in TJF grants.  Les Confections St-Élie gave $1,500 to 
the Prime Minister's personal election campaign and got two TJF 
grants totalling $285,108. Megatech Electro gave $400. That is 
not very good because it got a $1.3 million TJF grant. It hardly 
makes it all worthwhile.  The Liberals did all the paperwork for 
the grant and they got $400 back for their campaign.  It is not a 
very good percentage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is a better one.  Transelec gave a single cheque of $10,000 
to the Prime Minister's personal election campaign.  It received 
a CIDA contract.  There was $1.19 million to Globax subsidiary 
Placeteco acquired by the owner of Transelec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Les Industries Fermco gave $2,000 to the Prime Minister and 
received a TJF grant of $200,000.  That is getting a little 
better percentage. It gets $200,000 and gives $2,000 back; I mean 
it made a donation of $2,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cirtech gave $4,000 to the Prime Minister's campaign.  It is 
owned by Claude Bellerive who received a $45,000 TJF grant in the 
Prime Minister's riding for Salle de Quilles Biermans. Les 
Consultants Mesar gave $1,000 to the Prime Minister and received 
HRD grants in the Prime Minister's riding worth $13,000.  That is 
a pretty good percentage too. That is a fair chunk of change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Stone Consolidated gave $5,000 to the Prime Minister's campaign. 
The Prime Minister was a former director of this corporation 
which received HRD grants of $13,000 in the Prime Minister's 
riding.  It gave $5,000 back as a campaign donation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Muniressources gave $2,000.  Shawinigan International Inc. 
received $46,305 from Canada economic development for Quebec 
regions.  Muniressources is a co-founding company of Shawinigan 
International.  Is it not handy the way they are all kind of warm 
and intimately linked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is Abatoir A.L. Bellerive Inc. which gave $500. 
It received a CIDA contract worth $117,400 even while the RCMP 
were investigating its involvement in a $1.4 million tax fraud. 
But it can still give the money over.  That totals $30,400.  That 
is 30% of total personal and business donations of $90,325.  That 
is a fair chunk of change to come up with in someone's personal 
election campaign.  That was not even donated to the party.  That 
was just to the Prime Minister's personal campaign.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another one we cannot forget about, the great water 
fountain in Shawinigan. Canadians have heard about that. A few 
questions have been asked in question period about it.  This is 
pretty hard to believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 8, 2000 Economic Development Agency of Canada for 
the Regions of Quebec which is the federal regional development 
agency for Quebec, announced a $200,000 non-repayable 
contribution to build a lighted fountain in the Saint-Maurice 
River in the Prime Minister's riding.  A non-profit group called 
Heritage Shawinigan is heading the project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are some facts about the actual application.  On March 31, 
1998 the office of the minister for the economic development 
agency received a file from the Prime Minister's office.  A note 
says, “The file was sent by Denise Tremblay of the Prime 
Minister's office”. In other words, “Hint, hint, look out, this 
comes straight from someone important in the PMO, tick, check, 
pay attention to it”. I bet there was a red flag on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 5, 1998 a letter from the EDA for Quebec regions 
indicated that the formal application for funding from Heritage 
Shawinigan was received on May 4, over a month after the Prime 
Minister's office sent the file to the EDA for Quebec regions. 
The file had already been in process for two weeks when the 
application was received.  Might as well get a jump on it.  Might 
as well move ahead a little bit, get a bit of a jump on it.  It 
is so awkward when they have to wait for the application form to 
come in.  They might just as well get the ball rolling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another note further explains, “The file was submitted by the 
office of the Prime Minister and sent to us for analysis on April 
18, 1998”.  This suggests that the Prime Minister actually 
initiated the grant process prior to an application from the 
project's sponsor.  The timing on this is unbelievable. That same 
note dated May 28 recommends that the project be approved. The 
internal approval process took just over three weeks.  That is 
faster than greased lightning around this place. It is just 
unbelievable.  All of a sudden the thing is through. The project 
was approved by letter to Heritage Shawinigan dated July 6, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Les Consultants Mesar undertook a feasibility study on the 
proposal for which Heritage Shawinigan paid it $8,000; $5,000 of 
this amount was received from the Department of Canadian 
Heritage.  Les Consultants Mesar donated a total of $1,000 in 
three separate gifts to the Prime Minister's personal election 
campaign in 1997.  It is just so easy to say, “Here's to you. 
Thanks very much”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The project was supposed to have been completed by September 1, 
1998 but the announcement was delayed until February 8, 2000, at 
a time of controversy surrounding grants and contributions.  No 
reason was given for the delay.  In other words, “Oh, oh, it is 
getting a little close to home here.  Those troublesome 
opposition members of parliament are asking questions about these 
things so we had better lie low for a while”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the terms and conditions of the agreement signed and 
accepted by the sponsor dated August 3, 1998, the client had to 
begin the project on September 1, 1998 and finish it no later 
than September 1, 1999. The announcement for the funding came 
five months after the project was supposed to have been 
completed.  It had to go underground for a little bit, or under 
water let us say.  By the time the thing was supposed to be 
finished, the announcement did not even come until five months 
later.  It still has not happened.  The project will be 80% 
funded by government.  Imagine, such a worthwhile deal and it is 
80% government funded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  I rise on a point of order, Madam 
Speaker. I know the motion we are dealing with today has to do in 
particular with HRD spending, abuse within the HRD system and so 
on.  The member has been speaking at length about problems within 
the HRD system but she has been talking about other grants as 
well. 
I am wondering if she could point out the relevancy.  I want to 
make sure that it is relevant to the debate, whether the grants 
and so on she is talking about are actually HRDC— 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1225"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am afraid the hon. 
member is debating right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Madam Speaker is convinced that this is 
relevant. Members know it is not just HRDC.  The government is 
dishing out $13 billion in grants and contributions. HRDC is 
certainly a large part of it but boy, it just flows over every 
description. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are lots of Liberal non-answers to the shenanigans in 
Shawinigan which we have talked about.  The whole Shawinigan 
shakedown has gone on for quite a while now.  The Liberals do not 
allow questions.  Let me give a couple of examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 25, 1999 the Liberal member for Essex who chaired the 
industry committee in response to Tory questions about whether or 
not the two hotel owners in question were up to date in their 
loans, said that questions about individuals would not be 
allowed.  That does not make a whole lot of sense to me.  If 
during a debate we have some questions to ask in the House or in 
any standing committee, it is unbelievable that it would filter 
down from the top, from the Prime Minister to the committee 
chairmen, to everyone else to say something like that. Or they 
just do not show up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 6, 1999 ethics counsellor Howard Wilson appeared before 
the industry committee for the first time since June 1994.  Did 
the red book not say he was going to report to parliament?  I was 
sure it did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How about the “I believe I sold them” line?  The Prime 
Minister said “I will feel until I die”.  Do we not love that 
one, “I will feel until I die that I sold the shares in 1993”. 
Remember the fracas I just went through in listing the whole 
chronology.  He said he was a director then he said he was not a 
director.  He said he sold his shares and was not a director of 
the company anymore, until he got caught and found out several 
months after the 1993 election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about claiming innocence?  On June 3, 1999 the Prime 
Minister said “I have followed all the rules for 36 years”. But 
he had just said in the House a couple of days earlier that he 
had sold all his shares and was not a director when he became 
Prime Minister.  Howard Wilson, the ethics counsellor in March 
1994, months after the 1993 election said that the Prime Minister 
was a director. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“The Prime Minister's grants are like any others” is another 
tactic used by the Liberals.  On June 2, 1999 the Deputy Prime 
Minister said that the projects in the riding of Shawinigan were 
no different from the job creation projects approved in reform 
party ridings.  Let me put that little myth to bed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has the levers of power and the levers of 
money. When people go to him as their little MP to get help or to 
lobby, it is not like going to even a Liberal backbencher or an 
opposition member because they have nothing to give in return. 
But in the Prime Minister's situation, a whole pile of stuff can 
be given in return. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 18, 1999 the Minister for International Trade said that 
one of the strengths of the transitional jobs fund was to consult 
with local members of parliament.  As soon as local members of 
parliament get involved, there may be some good feedback and 
input, but the whole thing is subject to political interference. 
There are some members who would be tempted to interfere 
politically in order to get grants for their people. 
I know he wears his Liberal sweater proudly at the hockey games, 
so he would never be seen doing anything foolish like that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Skating around in circles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Skating around in circles, but make 
sure that the skates are on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is another one:  “I am just doing my job”.  I love that 
excuse.  I am just doing my job as a good little MP.  The Prime 
Minister is more than just an MP.  He is the one to say to any 
cabinet minister, to a deputy or an assistant speaker “Do 
this”, “Do that”.  There are a lot of members who know that 
feeling.  How about this one for size.  The Prime Minister says 
“You are in cabinet now.  Do as I say.  Vote as I tell you, or 
else”.  There are some in this Chamber who know exactly what 
that feels like. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has a tremendous amount of power.  When 
cabinet ministers have to succumb, they know perfectly well that 
he has the power and heaven help them if they do not follow 
through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 1, 1999 the Prime Minister said:  “With great pride I 
stand here and say I will always defend the best interests of my 
constituents so they can have a good living in the great country 
that is Canada.  My electors were treated like the electors of 
any riding in Canada”.  If they had projects that were based on 
merit, then let them be based on merit.  I have always said to 
the people in my constituency that I am not interested in going 
down to the HRD office and getting politically involved.  I paid 
tribute to HRD bureaucrats here earlier and I will do it again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have said time and time again, with these summer programs that 
we are going through, when they give the MP the option to get 
involved with these seed programs, these summer employment 
programs for students, “You are the people who know this 
industry.  You are the people who will make the decisions based 
on merit and merit alone.  I am not getting involved in this 
project”.  I think the HRD people probably appreciate that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should I be in there telling people who make their living at 
this, these public servants, what to do?  They know what are good 
projects and what are not.  Why would I trample on them and say 
“Move over, I am making those decisions”?  It is not right.  To 
me it belittles those people who work in those departments, who 
know what it is they are suppose to be doing, and yet they have 
to succumb constantly, time and time again, to the pressure of 
their political masters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course the government threatens to sue the opposition.  There 
is another little tactic it uses sometimes:  “Say that outside 
the House”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 1, 1999 the Prime Minister said:  “If they have any 
decency they will make a clear accusation that I have a conflict 
of interest and have the guts to make it outside.  We will meet 
them in court after that”.  That is a lovely little tactic. “I 
will sue you”.  If we say something he disagrees with, he 
threatens to sue us.  Is that not unbelievable?  It is hard to 
believe that a prime minister of a country would be in a position 
to say “Let's meet in the parking lot”, or something ridiculous 
like “Let's meet in the courtroom”.  Or, the Liberals call the 
opposition names.  There is a good one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The former Minister of Health, the member for Sudbury, said: “I 
have never seen such despicable behaviour.  I have been in the 
House for over 10 years and never have I seen such shameful 
behaviour by members of parliament”.  I might agree with her, 
but I have not seen such behaviour from a Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hate to think you are going to get bumped out of the chair, 
Madam Speaker, as I see the member for Kingston and the Islands. 
I digress and pray that this is relevant.  I have a doozy for the 
Deputy Speaker.  Forgive me for being irrelevant for just a 
moment, but I want members to hear this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some time ago I was speaking about the fact that when the 
Liberals were in opposition it used to bother the daylights out 
of them when the Mulroney Tories brought in that thing called 
time allocation.  Yes, members remember it well.  My notes tell 
me that time allocation was brought in 66 times over nine years. 
Today we are not celebrating and having a party; we are having 
what might be called a wake.  In six years' time the Liberals 
have brought in time allocation or closure more times than the 
Mulroney Tories.  It is not a happy sight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read a quote from the current House leader, whom the Deputy 
Speaker knows well.  I am sure he remembers some of his rants 
back in the good old days when they were in opposition. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1235"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then I read one from the member for Ottawa West—Nepean.  She 
said in 1989:  “This government has shown it has no respect for 
the public process, no respect for parliament and no respect for 
the opinions of the public”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the government House leader said:  “I am shocked.  Perhaps 
I should not be shocked.  This government has used closure on 
dozens and dozens of occasions”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, they were haranguing the Liberals—I mean the Tories. 
Oh, it is so hard to tell the difference.  It was the Mulroney 
Tories when they formed the government before 1993.  Again, I 
digress.  Forgive me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This quote, though, is probably the best of them all.  This 
comes from the current Deputy Speaker, the member for Kingston 
and the Islands.  He said:  “The government is using time 
allocation once again on this bill.  Just to remind the House and 
the Canadian public of the Draconian”—and that is with a 
capital D—“approach this government takes to dealing with 
legislation in the House, closure has been used 15 times in 
parliament since the November 1988 election”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How scandalous.  Fifteen times.  That was in 1993.  Imagine, 15 
times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to say:  “What we have here is an absolute scandal 
in terms of the government's unwillingness to listen to the 
representatives of the people in the House”.  For goodness' 
sake.  “Never before have we had a government so reluctant to 
engage in public discussion on the bills brought before this 
House”.  I digress.  Now we do.  It is here now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  “I suggest that the government's approach to 
legislating is frankly a disgrace”.  That was not with a capital 
D, but I am sure he meant the same.  “It cuts back the time the 
House is available to sit and then it applies closure to cut off 
debate”.  That was in 1992. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then he said:  “This is not the way to run parliament.  This is 
an abuse of the process of the House”.  I say to him “Amen, 
brother”.  He puts on his sunglasses and is gone, almost like 
this is some kind of a joke.  But the government has broken the 
record today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those members were scandalized on this side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier:</B>  I was not here then. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>   No, the member across was not here 
then.  I am sure things would have been a whole lot different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I love it when a candidate says “I will be a member of 
government and, boy, I will tell you, I will straighten out that 
government”.  The fellow who won the byelection a couple of 
years ago in Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam said “I am no 
yes-man”.  Wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another favourite little tactic is that they repeat everything. 
Everything is all right.  Everything is normal.  It is just 
business as usual and everything is going to be just fine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister said on June 1, 1999:  “I am very happy with 
the system because it is doing what has to be done for the good 
of the taxpayers of Canada”.   A few of them, I guess; the ones 
who were getting the grants, but certainly not all of the 
taxpayers of Canada.  I do not think so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about leaving more of our money in our hands in the first 
place?  It would seem sensible to me that if we send money to 
Ottawa, the government should not take such a huge cut from it 
when it is swirling around and then send a little back to the 
regions or whatever the government thinks with its personal 
largesse to make everyone feel good about it while at the same 
time claiming that it is giving tax cuts.  I love that excuse 
too.  “We are giving tax cuts”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask any of the Liberal members, any of the huge number 
of them who are here, when was the last time someone came into 
their riding office and said “Oh, this tax cut just feels so 
good”? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the member from Edmonton Southeast is here.  His riding is 
not very far from mine.  We are just across the city from each 
other.  I would love to know if someone has come into his office 
and said “Look at my tax statement.  That tax cut just feels so 
good”.  I would love to tell him how I am going to spend that 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not happening, is it?  It is not happening.  The finance 
minister says that they are coming forward with tax cuts, but 
nobody is seeing it at the ground level.  This whole idea that we 
are in charge and we are looking after you, everything is okay, 
is nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is a good one:  “Someone else ordered the contract”. On 
March 12, 1999 the solicitor general was talking about why Yvon 
Duhaime's father-in-law got an untendered contract for the 
guardhouse on the road to the Prime Minister's cottage.  Members 
will remember that a little while ago a new guardhouse was being 
built.  The contract was untendered.  He said:  “The RCMP is 
responsible for the security of the Prime Minister.  It requested 
that this firm be hired because it was in the area for security 
reasons”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The firm just happened to be in the area.  I do not know, they 
might have been camping over at Meech Lake.  I am not too sure, 
but they were in the area, so give them the contract.  It saves a 
bus ticket.  Just hire them because they are close by. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet when I think about the solicitor general, it is pretty hard 
to believe. 
Yesterday in the House we were asking questions about murderers, 
prisons and some other things.  As everyone in the House and 
anyone who watches the proceedings knows, the solicitor general 
always says that the RCMP and the Correctional Service are at 
arm's length.  I am not sure how long that is, but it ought to be 
about out to here.  He says that he has nothing to do with them, 
that he cannot be the one to tell them what to do.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday there was a question about the dreadful situation of 
the two people who were put together in jail after murdering 
someone.  He said that he phoned right away.  He did not phone 
from downtown Ottawa but from downtown Washington D.C.  He called 
the Correctional Service and told them to split those people up. 
That was not very arm's length.  There was a telephone on the end 
of that arm.  He picked it up and used it. When we see these 
discrepancies it is hard to believe that the solicitor general 
continues to say that the RCMP is responsible and he does not get 
to talk to them.  Yesterday he was on the phone in jig time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is this one:  “The Prime Minister was involved, but 
not all the time”.  He is kind of a part time prime minister or 
he is only involved part of the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 22, 1999, just a year ago, the Deputy Prime Minister 
said that he had a representative of his office attend meetings 
with officials.  As far as he was aware, the decisions were made 
at other meetings when the Prime Minister and his staff were not 
involved.  Can we believe that?  Oh, no, he was not really 
involved.  He was not at the meeting.  No, he was not there, so 
it was someone else just acting on his behalf.  That one is 
pretty hard to believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us say that we were HRD officials sitting around with the 
crew we work with all the time, with whom we are comfortable 
working, doing what it is we are supposed to be doing, and 
Poopsie, or whoever, comes in.  She says that she is from the 
Prime Minister's office and is just coming to take part in the 
meeting. Do we sit down and ask what are we going to do?  That is 
nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are sitting there as a bunch of bureaucrats, doing our 
job, and someone walks in— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Kilgour:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I do not know how long the hon. member has been speaking, 
but I think it has been well over three hours.  I noticed that 
she was sitting on the side of a chair, which the rules bar us 
from doing.  I think it is outrageous that the hon. member would 
do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  It was very 
thoughtful of the hon. minister to give the opportunity to the 
hon. member to sit for a moment and relax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, just to take the minister 
back a few seconds, I was acting as Poopsie from the Prime 
Minister's office who was coming to sit and take part in a 
meeting.  However, I appreciate his concern.  I know he has grave 
concerns about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How about this one?  “The matter is in a blind trust”.  It is 
just so easy for people to say that it is in a blind trust and 
they have absolutely nothing to do with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 8, 1999 the Prime Minister said:  “It is in a blind 
trust.  Blind means blind.  I am just doing what is required. 
From the day I became Prime Minister I have had no decisions to 
make on it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whoops.  Remember what I just said about October 1993 to March 
1994, that he really was a director?  Maybe blind is not blind 
when it comes to blind trusts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is another precious one:  “I have no recollection”.  It 
sounds like Bill Clinton.  I have no recollection of that at all. 
On June 3, 1996 the Minister of Human Resources Development, who 
is now the Minister for International Trade, back in the good old 
days when all of this was happening was talking about Transelec 
Inc.  He said:  “I have no recollection of only three Quebec 
firms having been kept on the short list.  I have never seen 
three Quebec firms on a single short list since I have been 
minister.  We will look into it and report back to the member”. 
That is another precious one.  We will put a committee on that. 
We will just get a little committee together to study that for 
the next several years.  It is just unbelievable how it goes on 
and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are more miscellaneous things.  Ignace Saw got a Canada 
jobs grant, which is the successor of the transitional jobs fund. 
That firm got $250,000.  That numbered company is 1191546 Ontario 
Ltd.  It is in the riding of Kenora—Rainy River, which happens 
to be the riding of the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development.  It was okayed December 3, 1999 by this HRD 
minister, only two weeks after she was briefed on the disastrous 
internal audit, which was released on January 19, 2000.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course she had known about it for some time but thought it 
would never get public, probably.  She thought she would just 
look after it internally, everything would be okay and she might 
as well just keep dishing out the cash. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even on the day the minister was briefed about it she repeatedly 
gave the appearance of normalcy in the House of Commons.  I may 
get to this or I may not.  It is hard to say, but I have every 
question that has been asked about this matter.  We could give 
any number of examples of what she actually said.  Here is a 
statement in response to a question from yours truly on November 
17, 1999.  She said to me: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As is the case in all regions where the transitional jobs fund 
has been used, Canadians are working.  The unemployment levels 
are coming down and the government is working with communities 
together to make sure that this happens. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 1, 1999, she said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I want to make clear to the House that no rules were 
broken on the application for transitional jobs funds in my 
riding. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She would of course extend that to mean any other riding.  Now, 
with the history of a few months behind us and under our belts, I 
am not sure how many RCMP investigations there are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  About a dozen or so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  A dozen, at least, that we know of. 
Dear knows how many more will be coming forward.  Absolutely no 
rules got broken.  Nothing happened.  Everything is a-okay, but 
whoops, we have the RCMP investigating several of them.  It does 
not exactly look cleaner than clean to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ignace Saw donated $1,150 to the personal 1997 campaign of the 
member for Kenora—Rainy River.  The Canada jobs fund grant of 
$250,000 was approved by the minister on December 3, 1999, 
according to the list made public by the minister.  By year's end 
$150,000 of the grant had already been paid to the company, and 
on and on it goes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned earlier the Scierie Opitciwan sawmill which gave 
$1,200 to the Liberal Party in 1998, $3,700 to the Liberal Party 
in 1997 and $164 to the Liberal Party in 1996, for a total of 
approximately five grand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there was ACOA funding for the Clarenville Regional 
Sportsplex.  This is one that we uncovered not so long ago.  This 
saga continues in Newfoundland as we speak.  Here is a little 
detail about the actual project.  The Clarenville Regional 
Sportsplex is a pool, fitness centre and restaurant.  It was 
given ACOA funding in 1997 and 1998.  Clarenville is in the 
riding of Bonavista—Trinity—Conception, one of the few Liberal 
ridings left in that area, as far as I know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Application was made on February 12, 1997.  Its evaluation began 
on April 24, 1997, three days before the writ was dropped, if 
members recall.  The letter of approval for funds came on May 26, 
1997, and the offer was accepted June 10, just a week after the 
federal election.  All this stuff was milling around while there 
was an election going on.  If that does not look like political 
interference, I surely do not know what does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 7, 1997, ACOA sent 75 environmental screening 
applications to the Department of the Environment for 75 
different projects including the sportsplex and requested they 
all be approved on a rush basis.  There was no time to think it 
through.  There was no time for applications.  There is an 
election on.  They had to buy a few seats, so they had to get at 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They said they would appreciate having all the completed 
environmental screenings no later than April 25, 1997. It looks 
like someone else knew when the writ was going to drop.  I was 
not exactly sure what day it was, but it looks like they did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province planned to announce all approved projects by the 
end of April 1997 and the election was called just days later. 
Government contributions were $478,000 from Newfoundland, 
$478,000 from federal infrastructure funds, $127,000 from the 
infrastructure program for the cost overrun, and $620,000 from 
the business development bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal assistance was $605,000 in grants and $620,000 in loans. 
That is a fair pile of cash.  Total federal assistance was $1.2 
million.  Whew, the project was one of the largest submitted in 
the province of Newfoundland.  It was to create 40 full time 
jobs.  It appears that no private funds were expended on the 
centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sportsplex contains a fitness centre, squash courts, a 
sauna, hot tubs, massage rooms, solariums, a competition size 
swimming pool, two golf and putting simulators, classrooms, 
change rooms, a dance studio, a pro shop and a restaurant. 
Yikes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 28, 2000, just a matter of weeks ago, after less 
than two years of operation the town of Clarenville confirmed 
that the sportsplex—I ask my colleague to guess the answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Do I get a lifeline?  I guess it went 
broke. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1250"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  He is right.  It went broke.  It 
closed its doors.  There is a sign on the front door indicating 
that the building is closed because of “mechanical problems 
resulting from the design of the building”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My husband is a builder. If a sign is hung on the front door of 
any building he ever built saying that “mechanical problems 
resulting from the design of the building”, he would be some 
upset.  I know this is quite creative, but before he built the 
building he would want to make sure that it was designed to be 
mechanically sound and not have its doors shut two years later. 
Apparently there is a legal dispute regarding the lining of the 
pool in the building.  Bren Power is suing the contractor who 
built the pool claiming defective work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My husband has been building an addition on a house.  All last 
fall he worked on it for someone who is building a swimming pool 
in the Edmonton area.  He would not be impressed if the thing got 
shut down after a year or two because the swimming pool part did 
not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  He probably did not get a million 
dollars in government help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  He did not get a dime in the form of a 
government grant.  ACOA signed a contract with Bren Power stating 
that the facility had to remain open for 10 years.  It did not 
make it.  If he sells the facility before the tenth year, he must 
pay back the money in an amount declining by 10% each year until 
the tenth year.  In other words, he still owes a pile of cash on 
that building. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was local opposition to the project.  In November 1998 
business people started complaining.  Chris Newman, the owner of 
a local sports shop, complained in the press by saying that was 
built with their tax dollars to provide in return direct 
competition with other local businesses.  Here is some guy who 
owns a sports shop and then the federal government funds a huge 
percentage, almost all, of another sports complex.  He asks how 
he is supposed to make a living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I bet you would hate, Mr. Speaker, to see government coming in 
and building a nice big hefty bakery just a couple of blocks down 
the road on White Avenue.  It would make it pretty hard to sell 
those baguettes and cinnamon buns.  Ralph Matsson, owner of the 
local Jungle Jim restaurant actually went out of business after 
the Don Cherry restaurant opened.  He cites the government 
assisted competition of Don Cherry as an important factor in the 
closure.  Now the Don Cherry restaurant has moved into the old 
Jungle Jim location in the St. Jude Hotel downtown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An undated ACOA backgrounder indicates that the media reports 
the sportsplex facility contains a Don Cherry sports bar which is 
not well received by local business.  Bren Power advises that 
while the sportsplex was publicly funded, the restaurant and 
sports bar were funded with private funds.  Don Cherry is a good 
businessman.  He builds Don Cherry restaurants and he gives great 
commentary on <I>Hockey Night in Canada</I>.  However we see what 
happens when we get tied into government phoney funding.  It 
skews the whole business community and makes it very difficult 
for businesses to make a go of it.  Don Cherry has moved 
downtown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An ACOA backgrounder indicates that it did not know that a 
restaurant would go into the space in the sportsplex.  All it 
knew was that space had been allocated for food services.  It 
sounds like a cafeteria.  ACOA's environmental screening report 
dated April 24, 1997, indicates that a pro shop and a restaurant 
would be part of the facility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The project received some letters of private support.  However 
the mayor of Clarenville indicated publicly that the local town's 
letter of support was sent to Mr. Power after a presentation he 
made to council.  Council did not know that infrastructure funds 
would go toward the sportsplex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would probably define infrastructure funds as sewer, water 
and making sure that everything works okay regarding water and 
sewers so that if I build a building on top of it everything will 
be okay.  That is infrastructure.  Then the superstructure is 
built on top of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mayor said that the town of Clarenville would never support 
the fact that the provincial or federal government would divert 
much needed infrastructure money intended for water, sewer and 
roads into a private development.  That is our concern about the 
whole matter.  Everyone in this area would support such a 
project, but everyone in this area would not expect the 
provincial government to take money away from the chronic care 
facility of Clarenville and put it into that.  They just took the 
money, put it in there against the mayor's good judgment and that 
of lots of other people.  It is just unreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell the House about the owner of this facility.  His 
name is Bren Power.  He is from Clarenville.  He ran for 
nomination for the provincial Liberals, whoops, in the riding of 
Trinity North in 1992 against Doug Olford.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The centre has already been the subject of controversy in the 
Newfoundland house of assembly.  Mr. Jack Byrne, member for Cape 
St. Francis, said during question period: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we looking at pure, partisan politics and Liberal patronage 
to the uppermost levels? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They could figure it out.  These things are politically 
motivated.  Mr. Byrne repeated in the press on March 1: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I'll say it again, it's another case of political patronage. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Power reportedly raised funds for the member for 
Trinity—Bonavista—Conception.  No Liberal donations have been 
found.  The gym equipment has reportedly been sold to another 
pair of businessmen who also received an HRD grant.  On and on 
the saga goes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is just a grab bag of a few miscellaneous boondoggles. Rama 
Reserves, a tiny reserve near Orillia, Ontario, has 600 band 
members.  The Majikaning band has operated Casino Rama for three 
years and has full employment.  An HRD office opened in that area 
in June 2000 at an initial cost of $164,000.  The band just 
negotiated a deal with the province of Ontario to share casino 
profits.  The deal is worth $123 million.  Not bad.  That is 
$200,000 for every man, woman and child on the reserve.  This was 
reported in the Toronto <I>Star</I> on February 9, 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Wal-Mart has a market capitalization of $250 billion and profits 
of $1.92 billion for the three month period ending January 31, 
2000.  It paid Metrus Properties, another huge company with 
longstanding Ontario Liberal connections, to build a huge $60 
million warehouse in Cornwall with 172 loading docks.  Metrus 
received a $300,000 transitional jobs fund grant, yikes, thus 
benefiting Wal-Mart.  That is a pretty good deal with 300,000 
bucks off the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>American based RMH Teleservices was enticed to the riding of the 
minister of HRDC using $1.6 million in HRD grants over the 
protests of a neighbouring Liberal MP.  Later RMH executive 
vice-president Michael Scharff said in an interview that they 
would have located there without the grant anyway.  He said he 
was sure they would be in Brantford one way or another. It was 
kind of icing on the cake.  Who would not take it?   If he did 
not take it someone else would.  The next guy would.  That is the 
very frustrating part of trying to do business across Canada.  We 
see phony, trumped up government grants.  It is ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Wiarton, Ontario, received $50,000 from HRD to hold a groundhog 
festival featuring the rodent Wiarton Willie II.  The original 
one is gone.  He has crossed over.  It is not like Peter Donolo 
who has crossed over to Italy on a plum post.  Wiarton Willie has 
really crossed over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Aerospace Group in Nipissing, Ontario, received 
$917,000 of a $1.3 million TJF grant before going bankrupt 
without building any aircraft.  Then the minister has the nerve 
to say that we are being critical of some of these programs.  You 
bet we are, Mr. Speaker.  When we call it the billion dollar 
boondoggle, that is exactly what it is.  I am going through list 
after list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was supposed to be better.  The Prime Minister campaigned in 
1993 and again in 1997 that it was going to be good.  He said as 
recorded in <I>Hansard</I> in 1991 when he was standing on this 
side as leader of the opposition: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we form the government every minister in the cabinet that I 
would be presiding will have to take the full responsibility of 
what is going on in his office. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It could be her office.  There are women cabinet ministers and 
competent ones at that.  He continued: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And if there is bundling in the department, nobody will be 
singled out but the minister will have to take the 
responsibility. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Boy, Mr. Speaker, if you have not seen bungling, you have not 
been watching.  The HRD department is an embarrassment because of 
the things and the bungling that have gone there.  The minister 
says she has instituted a six point plan, which I will read in a 
minute, as if that will solve everything.  The Prime Minister 
says he will make sure they take responsibility for it.  There is 
no responsibility taken there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister said on February 1, 2000, that administrative 
problems of this kind happen all the time.  This was quoted in 
<I>L'Acadie Nouvelle</I>. 
They will just pick out the administrative people and say “Those 
horrible people over there at HRDC, I am going to get that 
department straight”.  It is blamed on somebody else.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is another one.  He said, “Do you think it was better 
under Mulroney?”  The member for Edmonton Southeast ought to 
know because he was a member of the Mulroney government before 
1993.  It makes it all right because, “It was worse under 
Mulroney so I am not bad”.  What a way to run a country.  It is 
absolutely ridiculous that it was worse under Mulroney so maybe 
he is not doing too badly.  He said that in the Ottawa <I>Sun</I> 
on February 3, just a couple of months ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  The Liberals are worse on time 
allocation, we know that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Yes, they have hit the record on time 
allocation now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said, “What is boondoggle?  Give me the definition of that. 
Tell me, is there money that has disappeared?”  I remember that 
great happy day when the Prime Minister came out of his office to 
the scrum.  The HRDC minister was in the scrum trying desperately 
to answer questions. She was having a hard time answering.  We 
all remember that.  The Prime Minister whisked past her and 
turned around and came back, “I will take this from here, I will 
look after the questions from here, dear” in that patronizing 
way and shuffled her off down the stairs in humiliation.  He 
said, “I will look after this now.  What is boondoggle?  Give me 
the definition of that.  Is there money that has disappeared?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, there probably is. Even though we were not 
accusing the minister of money being missing, it is turning out 
from some RCMP investigations that some of the money really has 
gone missing.  It is certainly not $1 billion.  A lot of the 
cheques can be traced but there is some money that has actually 
disappeared. I would say “Yes, Mr. Prime Minister, on February 
5, 2000, maybe some money has disappeared”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And what is the definition of boondoggle?  It is when a minister 
acts irresponsibly so that she is not in full control of her 
department to know exactly where the money is going and why. 
That would be a definition of boondoggle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said in <I>Hansard</I> on February 9, “Of $11 million of 
so-called problems there was an overpayment of a little bit more 
than $250”.  I hardly think so.  Maybe it was that at the time, 
but of course only 459 files had been looked at out of 60,000. 
Now there are any number of RCMP investigations, many of which 
are in the Prime Minister's riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then he said, as Andrew Coyne cited in the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> 
on February 22, “Listen, we are the government. I don't see why 
we can't get credit for what we do.  I hope we do so.  There is 
nothing to be ashamed of, we do it all the time.  I am the 
government”.   Remember the quote from 1993, “Any file from 
Saint-Maurice that comes across any cabinet minister's desk, you 
bet I will be there for them.  You get the cash”.  He must feel 
like Regis Philbin on <I>Who Wants to be a Millionaire</I>; just 
pass out the cash. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here he is again, “We ought to get credit for what we do.  I 
hope we do. There is nothing to be ashamed of, we do it all the 
time”. At least he admits that the Liberals do it all the time. 
It is absolutely unbelievable and shameful and it ought to stop 
very soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said, “I think it happens to you at the end of the month to 
see that you have spent a few more dollars than expected”. Spend 
a few more dollars than expected.  This seems ridiculous.  In the 
London <I>Free Press</I>, February 19, 2000— 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Denis Coderre:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. I want to

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Well, there you are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I understood every word 
and frankly, I have made history before in this place so we might 
as well add that to the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said further in the London <I>Free Press</I> on February 19, 
2000, “I think it happens to you at the end of the month to see 
that you have spent a few more dollars than expected”.  A few 
more dollars.  We have all been in that position where we have 
spent a few more dollars but $1 billion seems a little excessive. 
All of a sudden the Liberals had no idea where this money was 
with this great boondoggle.  There were hundreds of projects and 
they had no idea where the money was and what the people were 
doing with it and he said that it is a few dollars at the end of 
the month.  It is unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the London <I>Free Press</I> on February 19, it was a busy 
day, he said, “Recipients have not complained at all”.  As the 
kids would say, well, duh.  Who will complain about getting free 
money?  It is pretty sad.  It goes on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I made reference to the six point plan. The minister has told us 
time and time again, “We have instituted a six point plan and 
everything will be wonderful”.  Everybody can just sit back and 
feel so much at ease that the government is really managing its 
money because it has a six point plan and all will be well.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister claims that she incorporated the views of Deloitte 
& Touche in the final draft of the six point plan to strengthen 
the administration of grants and contributions.  She made the 
following claims on May 3 a few days ago.  She said in 
<I>Hansard</I>: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have added aspects of training and aspects focusing on 
accountability.  We have have ensured that senior management know 
what their roles are and what accountable role they will have to 
play. We actually put together a grants and contribution team, a 
team focused on this. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should the focus team not have been in place before the whole 
thing started rather than after the boondoggle was blown loose? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She also said “We made sure that senior executives were making 
the final sign-off on those transfer terms”.  She should have 
been doing that a long time ago.  She went on to say “They said 
that we should make sure we address the root cause of the audit 
findings.  We are doing a number of things in that regard, making 
sure employees have training”.  That is great.  They should have 
training.  She went on to say “We did indeed address and assign 
authorities and responsibilities”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The day before that, the minister for HRD said in <I>Hansard</I>, 
regarding her six point plan: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They said that we needed greater cohesiveness to orchestrate the 
various actions in an integrated fashion.  What did we do?  We 
established a grants and contributions team to ensure that we 
meet their recommendations. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps they have jerseys too or maybe the hon. member could buy 
them some.  She went on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They said that we needed assurance that funds had been 
transferred according to program requirements.  What did we do? 
We put in place a departmental directive on the issuance of 
payments which require sign-off by senior executives to ensure 
that the payments are made appropriately. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Unless the minister's fund is involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Yes, the minister's reserves are right 
there. We have to ask a question in rebuttal. The grants and 
contributions performance tracking group was established in 
September 1999.  It was stated in the program integrity audit on 
page 14, released on January 19.  This is hardly something new 
and creative which she came out with in February, March and 
April. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The directive on the issuance of payments was issued January 20 
requiring sign-off by senior executives prior to any new payments 
anyway.  What is the big deal about everything being new and 
wonderful? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Deloitte & Touche brought forward its recommendations on 
February 2.  It said in committee that the final draft was 
completed February 6.  This version was put on the Internet on 
February 21 along with lots and lots of pages of grants and 
contributions made public by the department.  Deloitte & Touche 
never even got another look at it.  It was hired to look at it 
and made a few little changes.  You will see in a minute, Mr. 
Speaker, and I am sure you are rapt with attention on this, that 
the final version of the six point plan is precious little 
different from the draft version Deloitte & Touche looked at and 
said was abysmal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The number one subject was to ensure that payments meet 
standards.  Here is the six point plan.  I am sure there are 
Canadians who wonder if there really was a six point plan.  There 
is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Number one is to ensure payments meet standards.  Number two is 
to resolve issues with past files.  Number three is to equip and 
support staff. Number four is to get the best advice available. 
As if they needed to come up with a new six point plan to say to 
get the best available.  Number five is accountability in 
reporting. Number six is communications.   As if this is 
something new and creative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These basic things should have been in there since the 
beginning.  Ensure payments meet standards; obviously.  Resolve 
issues with past files; who is not going to give money who has 
not checked it out?   Equip and support staff; that would be a 
really smart thing to do.  That should have been done off the 
top. Get the best advice available; anybody would know that. 
Accountability in reporting; as if this is something new with 
government money.  It should be accountable and report every 
cent.  Communications; sometimes we need good communications to 
get our point across. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the six point plan. It is unbelievable that a minister 
of the crown would stand and trumpet that day after day, as if 
there has been an amazing discovery and everything is okay and 
from now on the government will look after us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The draft version which Deloitte & Touche looked at said that 
there would be no new payments without verification, to review 
all files by April 30 and have two senior officials approve them, 
and to monitor new agreements.  In the final version the same 
points were addressed, the same officials were named and there 
was the same timeline. When the minister stood in her place a 
couple of weeks ago and said they had taken its recommendations, 
they had not done a thing. They just reprinted them in the next 
column. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The draft version said to resolve all issues with past files by 
February 29; review 37 files and develop methods to choose others 
for review; by August 31 apply screening methods; and to study 
cost effectiveness of looking at files prior to 1998-99.  Those 
were the draft version recommendations. 
The final version says by February 18, review the 37 files. So 
the date was changed by 11 days.  Oh, those are substantive 
changes. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1310"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On number three the draft version says to “equip and support 
staff, conduct training, arrange temporary additional resources, 
add staff response on the standing item on national management 
board agenda”.  That was Deloitte & Touche in the draft version. 
In the final version the same vague steps were implemented, but 
the first round of training was scheduled to take place by 
February 28.  That was a real sign of commitment, putting a date 
in there.  This is hardly a substantial amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Number four was to get the best advice available.  Deloitte & 
Touche in the draft version said to “consult with TB, AG”—that 
is the treasury board and the auditor general—“other deputies, 
contract senior private sector financial expert for technical 
advice”—that is, the best advice available—“review progress 
quarterly with treasury board and meet monthly with the assistant 
auditor general”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the final version, the same steps were taken.  It notes that 
it incorporated treasury board and AG advice. The website was 
changed on May 3 to read that it incorporated Deloitte's as well 
as treasury board's on-site executives' advice.  On May 3, much 
later, the website was changed, “Whoops, got to fix this up and 
make sure everything looks parallel”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Number five in the six point plan is accountability in 
reporting.  “Report regularly to the minister, staff, senior 
managers, obtain outside expert advice on progress of plan, by 
March 31 assess cost benefit of applying the ISO 9000 to 
programs”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what happened in the final version.  The dates were 
changed.  The dates of June 2000 and January 2001 for external 
review of the progress of the plan were added.  I hardly think 
the minister could stand in her place and brag about the fact 
that they have brought in all these recommendations.  They 
changed a date here and there.  This is hardly substantive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Number six was communications.  Deloitte & Touche said “Brief 
sponsors, press, correct misinformation as appropriate, brief all 
staff on February 7, communicate regularly with program staff”. 
This is what the minister's draft version looked like.  Deloitte 
& Touche had some serious concerns about all these draft versions 
of the HRD six point plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final version added “report to parliament through 
parliamentary committee and performance report”. The final 
version said that they are going to report to parliament, through 
parliamentary committee and performance report.  The minister 
clearly would come in, stand, make a fuss and say, “Everything 
is okay.  Trust us.  I am from the government and I am here to 
help you.  Remember me?  I have a six point plan implemented and 
everything is absolutely fine.  It is going along well”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That six point plan is unbelievable.  The minister talks about 
the six point plan, and especially number six, the communications 
angle of it, I would bet a dollar that she is not terribly 
impressed with the communications.  Many in her own department 
have come forward and she did not act of course, “Uh oh, looks 
like this could be a real land mine”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  It is called spin doctoring, I think. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  It is very frustrating. Today I have 
talked about the government becoming the latest incarnation of 
the Ottawa 67s.  It now has brought in time allocation 67 times, 
even beating the record of Brian Mulroney, who in just over six 
years closed down debate in this place 66 times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we see a new champion across the way, a government that 
railed and went on and on about how horrible and sinful it was. 
Yet when we look at the Prime Minister who has a heavy hand in so 
many areas, we should not be surprised.  People seem shocked by 
this, but maybe when we look at it we should not be so shocked. 
We are certainly saddened by it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a history in this place of being the only reformer, now a 
Canadian Alliance member.  Neither of these guys was here then. 
I used to sit with the Liberals in the lobby.  I remember many of 
them.  I ate with many of them.  I visited on airplanes back and 
forth with many of them.  I can remember times when they were so 
upset and outraged in that back lobby.  Boy, they could hardly 
put a lid on it. 
The member for Kingston and the Islands would come back 
practically vibrating because he would be so upset about the 
Mulroney Tories and how terrible they were.  I also remember the 
words by the hon. member for Broadview—Greenwood, when he was 
sitting in the lobby right behind where I am standing now, over 
what happened in government. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1315"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT40"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT40"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1315

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember visiting and speaking to many of those people. When I 
was first sworn in here I sat up in the corner.  I was surrounded 
by the member for Broadview—Greenwood and I think the former 
member for Acadie—Bathurst, Doug Young, who for some strange 
reason is no longer in the House.  The minister for Indian 
affairs was also there.  We were all left-handers sitting up in 
the corner, or the dummy corner as it was dubbed.  We had some 
good visits and some good times up there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I visited with those members back in the lobby, while we 
all ate left-handed—but you have to love us—they told me that 
they would not be like the Tory government.  They said “When we 
get to government it will be different.  I asked them to promise 
me that if they did form the next government that they would not 
do the same as the Mulroney Tories.  They said “Oh, yes. Scout's 
honour, Deb”.  It was as if everything was going to be okay and 
we would not have a thing to worry about.  I remember them saying 
that they could never be that arrogant.  They said that they 
could never be as bad as the Tories on time allocation and 
closing off debate.  They said that free trade was a horrible 
thing and that they were against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does anyone remember the 1988 election?  The Liberals ran some 
good ads.  The only problem was that they did not believe them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Hec Clouthier:</B>  Very bad.  Vous êtes méchante. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Free trade is all right?   He became a 
member of a party whose word was not good on that.  His party was 
against free trade in 1988.  Now that it has become government, 
free trade is okay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals should have known all along that free trade was 
okay.  If we are going to close our walls in and not trade with 
other people, we are in big trouble.  I do not mind admitting 
that perhaps the member saw the light, which I know is a goofy 
phrase, but I think what frustrates him is joining a government 
that is not true to its word. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lucien Bouchard who was another Mulroney Tory.  I mentioned him 
earlier.  He ran the best byelection money could buy.  I 
respected him and I know the member for Edmonton Southeast 
respected him.  At least Mr. Bouchard admitted in the House that 
he was a separatist.  His word was good.  When he formed the Bloc 
Quebecois, I disagreed vehemently with the separatists.  There 
were a lot of people in the Mulroney government and in fact in 
the Mulroney cabinet who did not have the nerve to stand their 
ground and say they were separatists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I disagree with the Bloc, with separatism and with 
Lucien Bouchard, at least we have to respect them.  They were 
true to their word. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Kilgour:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  My hon. friend is not alleging that all the people in the 
Mulroney cabinet were separatists.  There were three.  I think 
she will be kind enough to admit that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  A salient point of 
order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>   Mr. Speaker, I am certainly not 
accusing all the Tories.  Of course he is not a Tory anymore. 
There were a few of them who did not have the nerve to stand up. 
I cannot name them all but I know Marcel Massé was one of them. 
Maybe the member could jump up and tell me who they were. He was 
probably intimate friends with them.  Nonetheless, Lucien 
Bouchard was true to his word.  There are others in this Chamber, 
I am sad to say, who perhaps were not and are not.  To me, that 
is a pity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we see the Prime Minister saying one thing about free trade 
and then doing another, who says one thing about not being a 
director of a company anymore when he was, when we see the Prime 
Minister saying “I am just making all these excuses and I am 
doing a great job” and maybe he is not, then we have to say 
something is wrong here with the Prime Minister who says one 
thing and does another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give a couple of examples of that.  APEC comes to mind. 
At the APEC meeting in Vancouver a few years ago, the meeting was 
to be held on the UBC campus.  We know what happened there. 
I am not making any accusations here.  I have asked probably 100 
questions about it in the House of Commons over the years and 
have never received a straight answer.  The Prime Minister likes 
to laugh and say that he likes pepper steak.  This is not funny. 
People are asking these questions in coffee shops.  It would be 
good for the Prime Minister to clear his conscience if he went to 
the commission to give his answers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien:</B>  I am not going to Stornoway 
either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me say on the record 
that I am not living at Stornoway as the Leader of the Official 
Opposition.  I have a place in Ottawa and I am staying there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are saying that the Prime Minister's office directed 
police to use pepper spray and dogs against UBC students so that 
a third world dictator would not be embarrassed when he visited 
Canada.  Who should we be concerned about in terms of 
embarrassing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When asked about the use of pepper spray, the Prime Minister 
joked “For me, pepper is something that I put on my plate”. 
This is a head of state.  This was the Prime Minister of our 
country who made this joke at his little press conferences. This 
gave <I>Air Farce</I> and <I>This Hour Has 22 Minutes</I> great 
stuff to use, but it was hardly something that we would expect 
from the Prime Minister of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might add that a riot breaks loose every time the Prime 
Minister goes to Vancouver.  People had a fit in front of the 
Hyatt Regency Hotel when the Prime Minister attended a 
fundraising dinner in 1998 where he continued with his joking. He 
said “Usually it is a rubber chicken dinner, but when we come to 
the west we have beef.  Sometimes we have pepper steak”. Somehow 
there is nothing hilarious about this.  He might think that it 
gets a great rousing laugh from the crowd but it is not very 
funny.  He talked about the merits of using pepper spray over 
tear gas, baseball bats or water cannons.  The point is, why were 
they doing that in the first place?  Was it to make Mr. Suharto 
comfy in Canada?  That is the question we need to be asking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not just look at the Prime Minister's behaviour on the 
APEC deal.  What about the auditor general's staff, the guys who 
look over the books and make things so uncomfortable for a 
government when it messes around?  In 1998 the auditor general, 
Denis Desautels, was reprimanded by finance department officials 
for presuming to criticize accounting practices of the 
government.  What do the Liberals expect the auditor general to 
do?  His job is to audit the books.  If the government is not 
coming across really well he will criticize accounting practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the government use generally accepted accounting 
principles?  It seems to me that it shoves a whole lot off to 
future years to be reckoned with then.  The auditor general was 
reprimanded by the finance department for pointing out those 
criticisms.  I guess we have to ask the Liberal members whether 
we even have to trifle and be inconvenienced by an auditor 
general, because, as I said, he often does get in the way when we 
talk about government financing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998 inspectors at Environment Canada were warned not to 
testify before a commons committee on the cutbacks in their 
department.  There is no real freedom of speech when a government 
member can stand up and say “If you get up in that committee and 
say <I>x</I>, <I>y</I> or <I>z</I> you will be in big trouble and 
there will be repercussions”.  These people should be begged for 
information because they are the people who are working on the 
front lines.  They are the ones who can give us the real 
practical help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked to someone the other day in the finance department. 
This was a person from whom I wanted to get information because 
the person knew what was going on over there.  This person was 
warned not to testify before a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998 six Health Canada scientists said they were warned not 
to speak publicly about their concerns over a bovine growth 
hormone.  This was another threat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see a government in power that is just so full of 
mismanagement and fear tactics that it should cause fear in all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada Director Joseph Losos was chastized by the privacy 
commissioner for rummaging through the files of departmental 
critic Michèle Brill-Edwards.  Michèle Brill-Edwards is a very 
bright woman.  Joseph Losos was chastized by the privacy 
commissioner for rummaging through her files. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I think we have a dress code in the House of Commons.  I 
see the hon. member has no shoes on. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1325"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I really do not know 
what to say about that.  I guess the hon. member for Brampton 
Centre is a very observant person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on the same point 
of order.  I am not sure if the hon. member has a quotation from 
either the standing orders, Beauchesne's or some other precedent 
setting moment that he would like to quote.  I am sure we would 
all be interested.  However, as the hon. member well knows, the 
dress code in the House of Commons has to do with men wearing 
ties and being able to vote and certain other dress codes.  If he 
has something to add to that, perhaps we would all be enlightened 
if he could bring it forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I suppose that if we 
were looking for a rule dealing with shoes it would be under the 
standing orders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is only common 
decency that when we are in the House we should have our shoes 
on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, obviously something is 
afoot here, and it is that members on the government side do not 
like to hear the truth that the leader of the opposition is 
giving them. I suggest that they just sit in their place, take it 
on the chin and bear with it.  These are the facts and the truth, 
the whole truth and nothing but the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  We will settle it 
right here.  We have been here before and in other circumstances 
we have said that it is not what is on the feet but what is in 
the head that counts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, you are absolutely right.  I 
am just getting more and more impressed by the moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will recall a comment made a while ago by the Secretary 
of State for Multiculturalism and the Status of Women. My own 
status is about 3/4 inches shorter right now than it generally 
is.  She accused me of being barefoot, pregnant and in the 
kitchen.  I am barefoot but I am certainly not in the kitchen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will carry on.  I was talking about 1998 when the courts said 
that the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans does not have the 
authority to proceed with the aboriginal commercial fishery.  The 
government replied that it was one man's opinion.  It just tossed 
the ruling aside and ignored it.  What a way to toss things off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998 the Prime Minister refused to appoint two senators 
elected from Alberta.  Now there is a good one.  Everyone knows 
that we had an election in Alberta.  I think the hon. member for 
Edmonton Southeast even supports those senatorial elections 
because he has seen what has gone on in the Senate over the 
years, which might lead me to another good point.  Those men, Ted 
Morton and Bert Brown, were elected by hundreds of thousands of 
people in Alberta and they were told that they could not go into 
the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One might ask how that could happen to people who were elected. 
Of course no one is elected in the Senate.  Just look at who has 
been named to the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  Did you call me? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Oh, the hon. member for 
Broadview—Greenwood.  Come and sit over here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  Do I get to speak? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  No, I am sorry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  You just want to take shots but you 
won't let me speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will take all kinds of 
shots. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just mentioned the hon. member for Broadview—Greenwood and 
the fact that we used to visit up in the dummy corner.  I am sure 
he remembers.  I thought I was making kind remarks earlier when I 
talked about the hon. member for Broadview—Greenwood.  I said 
that when we used to sit up in that corner and have the odd bite 
of food out in the lobby, I asked him if he would promise me when 
his party came to government that it would be different than the 
Mulroney Tories.  His response to me was “Absolutely, we will be 
different than the Mulroney Tories or better”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  They're worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Well, on this particular day I guess 
he has nothing to brag about because it is not better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some who would say that bigger is better but when it 
comes to time allocation and stifling debate, the Liberals are 
bigger today.  They are at 67 rather than 66.  Oh, my, how they 
used to rail about Mulroney and the Tories and how horrible it 
was that they had brought in so much time allocation.  How 
dreadful it was—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Denis Coderre:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I seek the unanimous consent of the House to 
congratulate my colleague, who had a vision when he sat on the 
other side, now that he is in the government. I seek unanimous 
consent to congratulate him. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Is there unanimous 
consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was talking about the 
Senate.  I know my friend from Broadview—Greenwood and I have 
had a few discussions over the years about the Senate.  Let me 
have a little look at some of the Senate appointments and some of 
the Liberal connections.  Again, I know there is no theme to 
this.  Nobody would ever think that there was political 
manipulation or anything like that, which I have mentioned time 
and again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who has been put into the Senate since this Prime Minister has 
taken office?  Sharon Carstairs, the former Manitoba Liberal 
leader.  She was appointed on September 15, 1994.  Landon 
Pearson, who is married to the son of the former Liberal Prime 
Minister Lester Pearson, was appointed on September 15, 1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gar Knutson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
There is a rule to prevent members from being disrespectful to 
the other place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. 
parliamentary secretary has a very good point.  We refer to the 
other place as the other place, and as an organ of governance we 
respect each other.  They respect us; we respect them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was not paying 
disrespect.  I was listing their names and their political 
connections to the Liberal party.  You have said that we should 
refer to it as the other place.  You know perfectly well that the 
Speaker of the House has allowed us to call it the Senate for 
some years now.  If it would make the hon. member happy, I will 
call it the other place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk about some members of the other place and their 
Liberal connections.  I mentioned Sharon Carstairs and Landon 
Pearson, both of whom are very pleasant people, but they ought to 
have been elected to the position and then they would have a 
mandate and authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lise Bacon, a former Liberal deputy premier of Quebec, was 
appointed on September 15, 1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I am trying my best to stretch my imagination to imagine 
what the relevance might be of the hon. member's comments to the 
topic she is presumably discussing, which I believe is the report 
of a committee of the House.  That has absolutely nothing to do 
with the other place, the people who sit in it, or how they got 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The point of order, 
of course, is relevant to the relevance.  I, for one, was also 
most interested to see how the Leader of the Opposition was going 
to weave this back into relevance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  I will do it immediately, Mr. Speaker. 
I am going to weave this together to show that these senators, 
who basically have no authority and no mandate, approve every 
single dime that goes through this place and through the Senate, 
including all HRD spending.  I did that in less than 35 seconds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me tell hon. members who those people are in the other 
place.  Jean Robert-Gauthier was appointed on November 23, 1994. 
He was a long time Liberal member of parliament.  John Bryden, a 
candidate for Liberal leader in New Brunswick, who managed the 
Prime Minister's 1990 New Brunswick Liberal leadership campaign, 
was appointed on November 23, 1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is still relevant.  Then we have Rose-Marie Losier-Cool, 
Céline Hervieux-Payette, Marie Paule Poulin, Doris Anderson, 
William Rompkey and Lorna Milne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me back up to Bill Rompkey for a minute.  He and I served 
together in the House.  I saw him this morning.  He is a fine 
fellow, again, but I bet he would have a whole lot more relevancy 
if he were elected to the place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shirley Maheu is another former member of parliament who used to 
sit in the chair.  She has now gone over to the other place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nick Taylor was the Alberta Liberal leader in days gone by. 
Nick is a great guy.  We had lots of fun together.  His 
provincial riding took a portion of my federal riding in Beaver 
River.  He and his wife Peg and I had some wonderful visits back 
and forth. He could have run in that election in Alberta and I 
bet he would have won. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the hon. member for Edmonton Southeast if he 
agrees with me that Nick Taylor could have won a Senate election 
had he run.  He looks doubtful, but there we are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jean Forest is, again, another pleasant woman with whom I have 
ridden back and forth on the plane any number of times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eugene Whalen was a former Liberal cabinet minister under 
Trudeau. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we have Léonce Mercier, Wilfred Moore and Lucie Pépin. 
Catherine Callbeck is another member I sat with in the House in 
days gone by.  Then we have Sister Peggy Butts.  Fernand 
Robichaud is another former MP.  Then we have Marisa Ferretti 
Barth and Serge Joyal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thelma Chalifoux is another great woman from Alberta with whom I 
travel back and forth on the plane all the time. 
She said to me one time “I probably could not get elected 
because I am a woman”.  I think she said she was Metis.  Surely 
she could have been elected.  Thelma has some real abilities. 
She is serving in the other place.  I do not disrespect her, but 
she would have a lot more of a powerful punch if she were 
elected.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The list goes on:  Joan Cook, Archibald Johnston, Ross 
Fitzpatrick, and Tommy Banks, whom I have not yet seen on the 
plane.  He was just appointed on April 7, 2000.  He is the one 
who was put in Ron Ghitter's place, when we have two fine 
senators-elect from Alberta, Bert Brown and Ted Morton.  They are 
the senators in waiting.  They are the legitimate senators. 
Although Tommy Banks plays a fine tune, he has no legitimacy here 
because he was appointed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The list continues:  James Bernard Boudreau; Ione Christensen; 
Sheila Finestone, another Liberal member with whom I sat in the 
House; Joan Fraser, who is a great woman; George Furey; Aurélien 
Gill; Richard Kroft; Frank Mahovlich, the big <I>M</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members are concerned about this.  We can see how touchy this 
is.  It has sparked some fireworks.  The problem is that these 
people who are appointed to political work, to get their reward 
and their favour in the other place, put through every single 
dollar of spending by this government, and that is illegitimate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  What is wrong with it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  The member for Broadview—Greenwood 
asks what is wrong with it.  That is exactly what is wrong with 
the Liberals and the political system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frank Mahovlich:  “He shot; he scored”.  Then we have Marion 
Maloney, Melvin Perry, and Vivian Poy, another wonderful woman. 
She is Adrienne Clarkson's sister-in-law.  She is a great woman 
who has no legitimacy in the other place.  Then we have Douglas 
James Roche, another fellow from Alberta who has made a real name 
for himself; Calvin Woodrow Ruck; Nick Sibbeston, who was the 
former N.W.T. premier; John Wiebe from Saskatchewan; Lois Wilson; 
and Jean Louis Roux. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is, we have these HRD scandals.  We have a government 
which has proven that it is truly illegitimate because of the 
heavy hand of the Prime Minister, all of the grants that I have 
documented today, the HRD mess that this government has put us 
into, and the idea of political interference.  The member for 
Broadview—Greenwood knows perfectly well that there is political 
interference.  He and I have had discussions over the years when 
he has been so frustrated that he has marched up and down the 
hall.  He knows it.  He is still frustrated.  I probably cannot 
help that.  It is part of life.  Sure it is part of life, but we 
do what we can to get over the frustration.  We do not just carry 
on with the system the way it is and say “That is the way it 
is”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me get back to government spending and government 
mismanagement in terms of grants and contributions.  We have just 
finished the end of the fiscal year.  I would like to point out 
what happens to grants and contributions when March madness 
takes— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  The member is aware of my deep respect for her.  However, 
I think there is something she said earlier that might be 
misunderstood by the millions of people who are watching this 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, this is a place where nearly every day of the week one can 
experience frustration.  However, I would not want my community 
in Toronto or other communities across Canada to think that I am 
opposed to Human Resources Development Canada.  Do we have 
mistakes and do we— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I am sorry.  That is 
getting perilously close to debate.  I gave the hon. member as 
much latitude as I could.  I would ask the hon. member for 
Broadview—Greenwood to come to the point please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was just about to 
make my point.  It is very important.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I want to make is that, in spite of frustration, in no 
way, shape or form should the member leave the image with the 
people of Canada that we do not support Human Resources 
Development Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, standing to set the 
record straight is a good try.  I understand that the member gets 
frustrated, but I think his constituents know that he is a 
tireless worker on their behalf.  They probably also know that he 
believes in HRD funding.  I know he has supported the minister 
time and time again.  I disagree with him on that, but I 
certainly respect his right to do so.  I want to set the record 
straight on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was talking about the Senate, but I think I should go on to 
something else because I am upsetting the people on the other 
side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to move on, Mr. Speaker, because my time is short.  I 
want to talk for a few minutes about March madness, fiscal year 
end spending, which I mentioned before I was interrupted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance Party has analyzed an access to 
information request received from Public Works and Government 
Services Canada, listing all grant and contribution spending over 
four fiscal years by all departments and agencies of the federal 
government.  Spending by 30 departments and agencies is listed 
over the period April 1 to March 31 for the years 1996-97 to 
1999-00.  The month of March 2000 was not available at the time 
of request. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Year end spending was an issue addressed by the disastrous 
program integrity internal audit of human resources development. 
It noted that HRD money was spent to avoid losing it at the end 
of each fiscal year.  In other words, there was <I>x</I> amount of 
money in the budget and if March 1 arrived before a department 
spent it all, the department would look for ways to spend the 
money to avoid it being taken away at the end of March. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  Put it back into the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Here we go with the Liberal viewpoint 
of hurry up, spend it, get it back into the economy.  I can see 
why the people in charge think that March madness is the way to 
go now that we have a $600 billion debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The review found that across all 1998-99 contribution programs 
examined, some $261 million, or 26.3% of all project expenses, 
was paid out after March 1.  One-quarter of the year's spending 
was spent in one month, the month of March.  These expenditures 
are typically advances for the coming fiscal year to avoid 
lapsing funds at the end of the year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The total amounts of grants and contributions spent by fiscal 
year across all departments and agencies of the federal 
government were as follows:  1996-97, $14.12 billion; 1997-98, 
$14.26 billion; 1998-99, $15.22 billion; and 1999-00—and of 
course the month of March is not available—$11.60 billion.  This 
brings the total to $55.2 billion.  That is unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the fact that I have drawn attention to these things I can 
understand why some Liberal members are frustrated when they look 
at these facts.  It is probably a little embarrassing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will get ready to wind down because we do have to get to 
question period.  I am sure that Liberal members are grateful 
because I know they want to be drilled and grilled again about 
some of their general mismanagement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members have been pressing me to tie this issue together.  It is 
easy to tie together.  This government is out of control.  It 
says that it is managing our money and looking after Canadians. 
Yet we see massive amounts of money being spent that is based on, 
I believe, political manipulation.  We see a government whose 
members say that they are in control and claim that everything is 
okay.  Yet the same government has invoked closure more times 
than the Mulroney Tories.  I never thought it would happen.  I 
believed these guys.  I guess that shows how naive I was.  I 
believed members when they told us that things would be a whole 
lot different when the Liberals formed the government.  I do not 
see a lot of difference and I do not think my friend from 
Broadview—Danforth does either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to cite a few things from question period.  I am 
sorry that I will barely be able to touch the surface of this 
binder.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the questions we have asked and some of the answers that 
have been given to us have frustrated us because the Canadian 
public is not getting the answers, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me refer to question period on February 7, the day after the 
HRD boondoggle had blown loose.  The former leader of the 
opposition, the member for Calgary Southwest, said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, Canadian taxpayers pay the highest personal income 
taxes in the western world.  No wonder they are angry therefore 
when they find out that more than a billion of those hard earned 
taxpayer dollars have been grossly mismanaged by the Minister of 
Human Resources Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the human resources minister had any respect for Canadian 
taxpayers and respect for the principle of ministerial 
accountability, she would rise in her place today and resign from 
cabinet. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Remember the note I talked about earlier from the Prime Minister 
when he said his ministers would take responsibility.  She did 
not.  Would the minister resign?  Of course the Prime Minister 
said he would not accept the resignation if it were offered. That 
goes a little counter to what he had said earlier.  Then the 
former leader asked: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister intervenes not to protect Canadian taxpayers, 
but to protect the discredited minister. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the folks who are footing the bill on all this stuff. 
He went on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1991 the Prime Minister said “When we form government, every 
minister in the cabinet will have to take full responsibility for 
what is going on in their department.  If there is any bungling 
in the department, the minister will have to take 
responsibility”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When did the Prime Minister abandon the principle of holding 
cabinet ministers accountable? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister responded by saying that she was just doing 
okay and that everything was fine.  The member for Calgary 
Southwest went on to say: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—a fish rots from the top down. 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We pointed out last year that moneys from the transitional jobs 
fund were being misused in the Prime Minister's riding.  The 
Prime Minister excused it.  He accepted no responsibility.  He 
set the wrong example.  Now that little scandal from Shawinigan 
has become the billion dollar boondoggle in human resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the Prime Minister not start accepting responsibility 
for this gross misuse of taxpayers' money and fire the Minister 
of Human Resources Development? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That did not happen and it has dogged them.  It has gone on and 
on and on.  It has now come down to the coffee shop level.  In 
fact, my husband and I were at the Alberta land titles place a 
while ago.  A fellow came up to me.  I forget what he was asking 
about, but he said he ought to get an HRD grant for it.  When 
people are talking at the ground level about it, we know that it 
has resonated from the holy hill all the way down to people at 
the ground level.  When they start talking like that, it makes us 
wonder how much general respect there is for a government and a 
Prime Minister who is not terribly concerned about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we came back on February 7, I asked the following question: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is one thing for the minister to say that everything is going 
just great in her department.  She has borrowed a pair of 
flip-flops from the industry minister. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He had just gone through a wonderful deal for the NHL hockey 
teams that lasted about 24 hours.  She was following his lead.  I 
went on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First she said everything was really well managed and that she 
was just proud as punch of it.  On November 4 she said, “Nothing 
inappropriate was done in terms of the administration of the 
approval process”.  But now she admits that maybe some things 
were overlooked, little things, like application forms and things 
like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why will the minister not just accept the responsibility she has 
for this billion dollar bungle and resign? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said no, that everything was okay.  She said “Let me repeat 
again that there have been no $1 billion lost”.  I did not say 
that there had been a billion lost.  I said there was a billion 
dollars bungled and pretty hard to track down.  Of course the 
RCMP are trying to track some of it down right now.  She said 
“We know where the money is”.  On and on its goes.  One of my 
colleagues from Edmonton—Strathcona said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The human resources minister should take advice from the Prime 
Minister.  Back in his righteous days he said “When you are a 
minister and your bureaucrats do well, you take the credit.  I 
always took the credit.  On the other side...when I made a 
mistake, I took the blame. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister said that earlier.  Who has the HRD minister, 
in fact probably all of them, blamed?  The bureaucrats.  It is 
not their fault.  They are getting the political direction from 
the top and they are doing what they have been told to do.  To me 
that is the pity of it because their political masters are 
getting involved in some of the things they should be making wise 
decisions on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the questions we asked in February.  There were 
no answers.  In March it was the same thing.  We asked any number 
of questions. 
If we were to get an answer there would not be so many pages of 
questions that we have to ask. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1350"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In April, not long ago, we were asking all kinds of questions. 
The unfortunate part is they are not being answered correctly by 
the government.  Sure, answers are tossed off to have something 
in <I>Hansard</I>, but at the same time the minister knows that 
she is not out of the woods yet.  We continue to find more and 
more information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me just make a couple of remarks in closing about what has 
gone on in the HRDC committee.  I could go on for a long time 
about it.  We have seen some of the results.  When a minister 
gets brought to committee, it is unbelievable some of the things 
he or she will say which simply do not make a lot of sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the minister was called to committee on Thursday, February 
10, the chair, the member for Peterborough, said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The gavel has now gone down.  I would ask the media to leave. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an open and happy little affair.  Upon asking the 
witness to take her seat, the minister did so.  On and on and on 
we go.  She talked about all kinds of things.  None of them gave 
answers, though.  Basically I could condense probably 150 pages 
to quote the minister as saying it is okay; we have the six point 
plan; everything is all right; everything will be okay.  It goes 
on and on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then Claire Morris was called in.  She was asked a lot of 
questions.  Then Mel Cappe was brought in and he was asked a lot 
of questions.  I went to that particular meeting that day.  It 
was fascinating because Mel Cappe basically said that he was not 
really free to answer that question.  If we are talking about 
government money and taxpayer dollars, there had better be a lot 
of people who are willing to answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I hate to interrupt the member's remarks, but she did mention me, 
the member for Peterborough, as chair of the Standing Committee 
on Human Resources Development.  She implied that the media were 
not present at the meeting.  This is not true, as she knows.  All 
the meetings were fully televised.  At meetings which are 
televised by the House of Commons it is normal practice not to

statement which the member quoted from me at the meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that 
correction.  I think I probably said that the media was asked to 
leave the room.  I forget the comment I made after that.  I will 
have to check the blues.  I know those meetings were publicized 
and I appreciate that rebuke.  I thank the member very much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  As well they should have been. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>   As well they should have been. As 
time is drawing to a close because we have to move forward to

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  More, more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  I would be happy to say more.  I would 
like to ask if we could have unanimous consent in the House to 
cancel question period and I will carry on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. Leader of 
the Opposition has asked for unanimous consent to cancel question 
period.  I do not know if we can do that even with unanimous

consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, many people over there 
came here in the 1997 election.  It is easy to throw the shots 
across.  I like to take it as well as I can give it.  I 
appreciate the comments from the other side today, but they were 
not here in the 1988 election.  The minister of state was not 
here in the 1988 election.  She was not sitting in the back with 
many of us.  The member from Broadview—Danforth was not here 
listening to all the promises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development from 
Kenora—Rainy River was here.  We sat side by side.  Things were 
going to be a whole lot different.  Things were going to be 
better.  He could say maybe they are, but in terms of shutting 
down democracy in this place, or what we would hope would be 
democracy in this place, it seems to me something dreadful has 
gone wrong in their dreams or their plans.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have quoted members of the House today about how horrible it 
was under the Mulroney Conservatives.  It was an affront to 
democracy that they did not get a chance to speak.  Democratic 
debate was shut down in the House.  They were exercised about it. 
They were sick about it.  Things were going to be different. 
Things were going to be better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard from two members today earlier in the debate that it is 
much harder to do this when one is the government.  Bunk.  They 
have not had to shut down debate.  In terms of major pieces of 
legislation since this bunch formed the government back in 1993 
there is precious little of longstanding repute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me, when we look at some of the major pieces of 
legislation, that we could have had any amount of time to have 
every member of the House bring forward a regional flavour on how 
a particular piece of legislation would affect them.  Yet the 
government says it is too busy doing the great things of the 
nation and moving forward.  The House leader rants in a scrum and 
talks about horrible opposition members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Mulroney was on the other side bringing in time allocation, 
the House leader was one of the worst people over here for making 
a fuss about it.  Members who were here know that.  Yet here he 
is today, the proud champion of the head of the Ottawa 67s.  Some 
67 times the government has brought in closure or time allocation 
on debate in six years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  You are still here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  I am still here.  I am saying how 
frustrating it is for people across the country.  They think 
something will be debated in parliament and then they see a 
government absolutely shut it down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now they are the champs. They railed about it.  The Deputy 
Speaker railed about it in 1991 and 1992.  How he went on.  The 
table clerks remember.  They were here.  They remember what an 
affront to democracy this was and how terrible it was.  Now they 
are in government it is different. It is so bad from this side, 
yet it is so good when in government.  It is absolutely 
ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In six years, 66 times the Mulroney Tories shut down debate in 
this place.  Now it is 67 times as of today for this government, 
even more than the Mulroney Tories.  It is unbelievable to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the legacy of shame:  Bill C-18, electoral 
boundaries, 1994; Bill C-34, Yukon First Nations Act; Bill C-33, 
Yukon First Nations Act; Bill C-32, Excise Tax Act; Bill C-35, 
Department of Citizenship and Immigration Act; Bill C-74, 
supervision of longshoring and related operations at west coast 
ports; Bill C-77, Maintenance of Railways Operations Act; Bill 
C-77, Maintenance of Railways Operations Act, another report 
stage or second reading; again Bill C-77, Railway Operations Act; 
and Bill C-68, Firearms Act.  That was a special one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I regret interrupting the hon. member, but I 
see that it is almost time for Statements by Members.  The member 
has one minute to wind up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am watching the clock 
carefully.  I see it is almost two o'clock.  In my one minute of 
wrap-up, I cannot believe with HRDC, the billion dollar 
boondoggle and all that has gone on, that the government says 
“Trust me, I am here to manage your money”.  What a disgrace 
for every government member in the House to say that they are 
managing our money.  It is hard to believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They railed about the Mulroney Conservatives when they were on 
this side, as you were, Mr. Speaker.  You heard it all, as I did. 
Now they are over there and they have broken the record of Brian 
Mulroney by using time allocation and closure 67 times in the 
House.  I say shame on them.

Room Walkathon to benefit St. Joseph's Health Centre Foundation 
and the Lori's Room fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Established by her parents, Doug and Lorna Martin, in 1996, the

that support patients at St. Joseph's.  Through the refurbishing 
and refurnishing of rooms, St. Joseph's hopes to make Lori's room 
more like a residential setting that is more conducive to rest, 
relaxation and healing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The five kilometre walk began at Humber Bay Park and finished 
off with a celebration at St. Joseph's Health Centre.  To date, 
$22,000 has been raised from the walkathon through pledges and

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to congratulate the organizing committee and a very 
special thank you to Lorna-Lynn's parents, Doug and Lorna Martin.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will be brief.  The government has 
now broken the all time record set by Brian Mulroney for shutting 
down debate in the House.  Mulroney used closure 66 times but 
with this government we are up to 67. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me quote the government House leader back in his purer times 
when he was in the opposition.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am shocked...This government has used closure on dozens and 
dozens of occasions.  This is just terrible. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How hard was it for the Prime Minister to force his House leader 
to abandon his principles 67 times and counting? 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I hate to give a lesson in 
parliamentary procedure to the Leader of the Opposition.  I have 
not used closure once since the last election. 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, he can get technical about time 
allocation and closure, but he knows perfectly well it means the 
same thing, that we are not allowed to debate in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us see if he can guess who this is.  I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have here is an absolute scandal in terms of the 
government's unwillingness to listen to the representatives of 
the people in the House.  Never before have we had a government 
so reluctant to engage in public discussion on the bills before 
this House. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was the Deputy Speaker of this parliament.  I guess he 
spoke too soon.  Why did the Liberals have one set of principles 
in opposition and quite another in government? 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the only thing that is shameful 
around here is the continuous obstruction on the part of the 
Leader of the Opposition and her colleagues, which is what they 
have tried to do in the case of this particular bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, we have not yet moved time allocation on it even 
though it might come later today.  The hon. member has moved two 
measures of obstruction to prevent last year's budget bill from 
coming into place.  That tells us the kind of imagination hon. 
members across the way have.  None. 
<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it might tell us about a House leader 
that is not able to shepherd things through the House properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals make Mulroney look like a slowpoke.  It took him 
nine full years to invoke closure or time allocation on debate 66 
times.  It has taken this government barely six years to do it 67 
times.  It has done it one-third faster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is another dandy quote.  This one is a doozie.  It is from 
a Liberal who flew a little too close to the sun.  I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It displays the utter disdain with which this government treats 
the Canadian people. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was the Minister of Foreign Affairs back in his days of 
purity in the opposition.  If shutting down debate 66 was utter 
disdain, what is 67?  Is it contempt? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  I know it must be a noise 
from another place, because I keep hearing one sound down at the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of

the question of the Leader of the Opposition and her colleagues

change commas to semicolons.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Department of Transport 
stated that the transfer of WestJet's inspection to Ottawa was 
just a paper exercise.  When WestJet was only serving western 
Canadians, the government felt that it was sufficient to inspect 
it in Edmonton.  Now that it flies in eastern Canada, it has to 
be inspected in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister explain why inspections in Edmonton were good 
enough when it was western Canadians flying but not good enough 
now? 
<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, there is a silver lining in this, that these changes 
have been made because WestJet has become truly a national 
airline, something the government thinks is a very good thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going back to the 1970s, the regulatory oversight process was 
established which said that certain airlines operating coast to 
coast over a certain weight limit, 100,000 pounds, would have its 
inspection co-ordinated in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be no additional cost to WestJet.  There is no 
inconvenience.  What it means is a western Canadian airline has 
become national and is subject to national standards.  I think 
that is good. 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the minister for 
assuring WestJet that it will not have to move its planes and its 
pilots to Ottawa for inspection purposes and that there will not 
be any cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe the minister could explain why when WestJet complained 
about Air Canada's anti-competitive practices of slashing fares 
and increasing capacity on the Toronto-Moncton route nothing was 
done.  However, when Air Canada called transport to say that 
WestJet should be inspected in Ottawa, the department immediately 
complied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who is calling the shots in Transport Canada?  Is it the 
minister or Robert Milton? 
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is entirely wrong.  The decision 
with respect to WestJet was made long before any inquiry was made 
on behalf of Air Canada.  I will say quite frankly in this 
Chamber that the safety regulatory oversight process is none of 
Air Canada's business.  That is something that is done by the 
inspectors of the department without interference from any 
airline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member gives the impression that somehow all of 
WestJet's equipment has to come to Ottawa to be inspected.  That 
is not the case.  The inspections occur right through the 
country, including Calgary and Edmonton.  All it means is that 
the paperwork now is co-ordinated centrally as with all other 
airlines.

acknowledged across the country.  All the stakeholders in Quebec 
oppose this bill.  She alone sees the light, it seems.

incarceration is used too much in this country when one is 
dealing with first time and non-violent young offenders.  In

continues.  Not only did taxpayers get hit with a $200,000 bill

lobbied for thousands of taxpayer dollars for a feasibility study

Mr. Speaker, I can tell you that, although I have never been 
personally lobbied by the Prime Minister on this particular

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sheila Copps:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as early as yesterday I

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr.

because here we see a pattern continuing.  The Prime Minister's 
office asked the heritage minister for money that went to a 
company in the Prime Minister's riding for a feasibility study 
for a $200,000 fountain.  What happened?  The company got the 
money to do the feasibility study and the Prime Minister's 
campaign got a donation.  That is very interesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This appears to be an oft-repeated theme.  Is it that the Prime

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> I believe you are raising a question of privilege 
on something that has not occurred as yet.  Therefore, I do not 
know how we can argue a point of privilege as a matter of fact on 
something which may occur or may not occur.   Perhaps the hon. 
opposition House leader could explain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if you will allow me to 
give this entire point, I think I can explain why you should not 
even recognize the government House leader and you should look 
the other way when he tries to move the motion. The problem is, 
once the motion is moved the House must be seized of it.  I hope 
to argue and convince you, Mr. Speaker, with this question of 
privilege that you should not even hear the motion to invoke a 
record number of time allocations.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on a question of privilege in regard to a matter 
relating to what I believe constitutes intimidation and a 
deliberate attempt to withhold information from me because of my 
activities in the House during a proceeding of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday after I asked a question during question period, Lynn 
Ballice, the assistant to the commissioner of Correctional 
Service Canada, phoned my assistant for particulars of a report 
which I spoke about during question period.  She told my 
assistant that it was a report done by an independent consultant 
they had hired and it was given to Jan Fox, their regional 
director in March. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While my assistant offered to fax the report to her, she pointed 
out that the report came from Correctional Service Canada and 
that is where Ms. Ballice should start looking.  Ms. Ballice then 
called back a few minutes later and said all her management 
people were out west at a conference and insisted that my 
assistant fax her the report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I returned to the office I instructed my assistant not to 
fax the report.   To me, the situation was getting beyond what 
was at first maybe humourous and quite frankly was beginning to 
get just a little frightening.  I was beginning to wonder if 
anyone was in charge at Correctional Service Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At 4:30 p.m. Lynn Ballice phoned back to my office and said she 
had the commissioner of corrections, Ole Ingstrup, on the 
speakerphone.  She asked why my assistant had not faxed a copy of 
the report.  When advised of my decision, Lynn Ballice said that 
Correctional Service Canada would not offer me any help or 
information on this particular report in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This threat came about because of a question I asked in the 
House.  I appreciate the frustration and the embarrassment that 
this may have caused the commissioner but that does not give him 
the right to deliberately deny information to a member of 
parliament, and it does not give him the right to intimidate the 
staff of a member of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 16, 1980 a Speaker made a ruling in regard to 
information to which a member of parliament was entitled.  The

made where there was a deliberate attempt to deny information to 
an hon. member.

</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK164"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, earlier today you ruled that I could not raise a 
question of privilege regarding the putting of a motion on time 
allocation, even though the notice of time allocation had been 
given by the government House leader and we knew that it was 
going to be before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I could point out three other points on that point, I would 
like to raise it as a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, on October 8, 1997 the hon. member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona raised a question of privilege regarding the 
closing of debate on Bill C-2.  He did it in exactly the same 
manner in which I would have liked to have done it today.  In 
other words, there has been notice of time allocation.  We know 
it is coming.  The member for Winnipeg—Transcona raised a 
question of privilege and spoke to it.  You accepted the question 
at that time, Mr. Speaker, and he made his arguments to you at 
that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, on Motion No. 8, which was previously before parliament, 
we had discussion before the motion actually was tabled in the 
House.  It was on the notice paper and we in the House were 
seized of it before it was actually moved.  Eventually that 
motion was withdrawn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, in the last parliament the Speaker also ruled that a 
member could not raise a point of order about the acceptability 
of a motion if the motion had already been accepted by the Chair. 
In other words, Mr. Speaker, once you accept the motion we have 
to accept that it is in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You have put me in a bit of a catch-22 in asking me to wait 
until the motion is tabled, because once it is tabled I am not 
allowed to speak to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I could, I would like to raise as a point of order the 
reasons I think you should hear this as a point of order.  I 
think it is a point of privilege, but I will present it to you, 
if you wish, as a point of order as to why the motion of time 
allocation put by the government House leader is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Do you think you are in a catch-22?  You have 
put the Speaker in a catch-22.  Let me quote to you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I quoted, I believe, in 1997 is found at page 570 of our 
new book, <I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I>, by 
Montpetit and Marleau, which states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As with closure, the Speaker has ruled that the Chair possesses 
no discretionary authority to refuse to put a motion of time 
allocation if all the procedural exigencies have been observed. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the hon. member said.  What I am saying is that you 
cannot argue your point until the motion is put.  On the other 
hand, you are saying that you cannot argue it after because I am 
going to make that decision.  You are right.  That is the 
decision I would have made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If you would like to try to convince me, I will listen to you 
for about three minutes.  If you can convince me in three minutes 
that I should be listening to you, then I will listen to you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not sure if I can do it 
in three minutes, but I will rush to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today would be a record setting number of times that time 
allocation would have been used.  In Beauchesne's sixth edition, 
citation 3 outlines some elements of our Constitution Act, and it 
is relevant.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>More tentative are such traditional features as respect for the 
rights of the minority, which precludes a Government from using 
to excess the extensive powers that it has to limit debate or to 
proceed in what the public and the Opposition might interpret as 
unorthodox ways. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, there is another way to look at it. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1520"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going back to the argument presented by the hon. member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona, he suggested that the Chair intervene on the 
collective rights of the minority.  The case has been made that 
the Chair possesses no discretionary authority to refuse to put a 
motion of time allocation, but I do not agree with this claim and 
I will prove that the Speaker does not possess this authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 2, 2000, during a discussion of the rule of time 
allocation at the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs, the Clerk of the House of Commons, Robert Marleau, 
responded to a question regarding the Speaker's authority to 
protect the minority in the manner prescribed earlier.  The Clerk 
said: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—it exists intrinsically in the role of the Speakership all the 
time—where there could be the tyranny of either side.  It could 
be the tyranny of the majority or the tyranny of the minority. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a subsequent meeting on May 4 the Clerk suggested that with 
time allocation the Speaker is less likely to intervene.  There 
is a reference to this at page 570 of <I>House of Commons 
Procedure and Practice</I>.  However, he used the extreme example 
that if the government time allocated every bill the Speaker 
might intervene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My interpretation of what the Clerk said is that there does 
exist a limit to what a majority government can do with respect 
to time allocation.  There comes a line in the sand, Mr. Speaker. 
I mentioned that earlier when I quoted Beauchesne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Clerk used the extreme example of every bill in his response 
because he knows it is not up to the Clerk to establish the 
limit.  Obviously 66 times was not the limit because it went 
ahead last time.  However, yesterday the government gave notice 
of its intention to move time allocation for the 67th time.  In 
search of a benchmark of what constitutes excess, I would suggest 
that 67 closure and time allocation motions moved within six 
years for the sole purpose of muzzling the opposition is 
excessive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At page 369 of Marleau and Montpetit there is reference to an 
intervention by the Speaker on time allocation related tactics 
used by the government.  It describes how Speaker Fraser ruled on 
the government tactic of skipping over Routine Proceedings in 
order to go to orders of the day.  As we are all aware, this 
tactic, if allowed, secures for the government the opportunity to 
move time allocation regardless of where it is in the orders of 
the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While Speaker Fraser ruled such a motion in order on April 13, 
1987, page 369 of Marleau and Montpetit references another ruling 
where the Speaker ruled out of order a similar motion only months 
before.  In other words, the discretion is with the Speaker as to 
whether it is acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rules governing time allocation can be found in Standing 
Order 78, but when the government allows only a minimum amount of 
time to debate each stage of a controversial bill, this prevents 
the opposition from doing its job.  It prevents the opposition 
from enlisting public support.  The right of an opposition to 
raise the profile of an issue is an indispensable principle. 
Beauchesne's sixth edition states: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—to protect the minority and restrain the improvidence or 
tyranny of a majority; to secure the transaction of public 
business in an orderly manner; to enable every member to express 
opinions within limits necessary to preserve decorum and prevent 
an unnecessary waste of time; to give abundant opportunity for 
the consideration of every measure, and to prevent any 
legislative action being taken upon sudden impulse. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is all about debate, and the reason we are here is to have 
debate.  Speaker Fraser put it this way: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is essential to our democratic system that controversial 
issues should be debated at reasonable length so that every 
reasonable opportunity shall be available to hear the arguments 
pro and con and that reasonable delaying tactics should be 
permissible to enable opponents of a measure to enlist public 
support for their point of view. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1949 the Right Hon. John Diefenbaker said this to the Empire 
Club in Toronto:

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit, therefore, that you do not have full political 
democracy, let alone the economic as well as political democracy, 
unless you include a full and unquestioned recognition of the 
rights and functions of the opposition to the government of the 
day.  Only in this way can you protect the rights of the 
minorities; only in this way can you make sure that the force of 
public opinion will be brought to bear on the legislative 
process. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons the opposition exists is to someday replace 
the government.  The opposition should conduct itself in 
parliament so as to persuade the people of the country that it 
could be an improvement on the government of the day.  Our system 
of government works best when there is a change of government, or 
at least an opportunity to change government at reasonable 
intervals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government continues to silence the opposition at every 
turn, the opposition will never be able to use parliamentary 
debate to persuade the people of Canada.  While the rights of the 
opposition are immediately and most visibly at stake, ultimately 
the threat is to democratic rights and freedoms generally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would like to offer three points.  One is for 
the Chair to consider and two are for the House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, perhaps now is the time for the Speaker to look the other 
way, as the member for Winnipeg—Transcona suggested at the 
beginning of this parliament, not see the minister and prevent 
the 67th motion from being moved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second suggestion is that the government and this House 
should seriously consider reforming the way we do business by 
sitting the proper calendar period, sitting the days we are 
supposed to sit, and consider using free votes so that the 
government is not forced to use time allocation so often. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another way is to change the rules of debate so that we get to 
important business and controversial business in a timely 
fashion, instead of waiting until the last dog is hung. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A short delay of even a day would send a message to the 
government that you, Mr. Speaker, believe the line in the sand 
has been crept up to and is in danger of being passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Dante's <I>Inferno</I> he described the nine circles of hell. 
In the context of the Canadian parliamentary system, I believe 
the government has brought us into circle number eight.  Circle 
number eight is the place for the sowers of discord.  This 
government has brought us dangerously close to a dysfunctional 
parliament by risking the rights of the minority and by using 
such a controversial way to bring so much legislation through the 
House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK165"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I too have searched through the books 
which would say that the Speaker has the discretion after the 
government has brought in time allocation 20 times.  Some people 
would say 20 times is too much.  Other people would say, as you 
have, that because it broke a standard which was set by another 
government, then that point is too much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speaker has no guidance from the House as to what is too 
much or what is too little.  At this point I would imagine, as 
Speaker Fraser said, if every bill and every motion were 
subjected to time allocation, that would be a bit much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I am very much interested, as Speaker and as a servant 
of the House, in what the hon. member had as a second suggestion. 
At this point at least the hon. House leader of the opposition 
wants me to draw a line in the sand, saying that this is as far 
as it goes.  I would much prefer that the House deal with this 
problem, as House leaders have for 133 years.  They were able to 
sit down to figure out what would be a reasonable amount of time 
for debate and, after that amount of time, what would be 
reasonable in terms of the use of time allocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is discord in the House, surely it is not up to the 
Speaker to jump in and cause more discord.  The five House 
leaders are here to listen to what I have to say.  If there is 
this discord which the hon. House leader of the opposition has 
brought up, then I would encourage the House leaders to get a 
system which would work for all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think, at least at this point, that I would not be prepared to 
intervene, but I am very much prepared to encourage the House 
leaders who are here today to come together to find a solution 
that we could all live with so that members of the House can 
perform the functions for which we were elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is here to present motions and bills.  The 
opposition is here to make them better; to question them along 
the way.  We all understand that the opposition, the dissenting 
voice, has every right to be heard.  On the other side, Speaker 
Fraser has said, and I am paraphrasing him, that the government 
has the right to govern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time, is the House dysfunctional?  I would argue 
that if there is this discord, that it be addressed by the House 
leaders.  I would ask you to do this as soon as possible and, if 
at all possible, before we adjourn for the summer.  I think that 
suggestion is an excellent one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see that the hon. member for Winnipeg—Transcona, who is a 
respected parliamentarian, wants to make an intervention and I 
will permit a very short intervention if he wishes to add 
something.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
as one of the House leaders I would certainly undertake and be 
willing to be part of a discussion among the House leaders as to 
what might be done in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some difficulties that would certainly have to be 
overcome if the House leaders were to be able to arrive at the 
kind of advice that I think the Chair is seeking with respect to 
how to exercise this discretion.  It has not been exercised very 
often, or one could argue at all, certainly in the time that I 
have been here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to make the argument in principle, as I have before, 
that this discretion on the part of the Speaker should exist and 
should be practised.  I take the point that the Chair might want 
some guidance, if that is possible.  There is room for judgment 
that emanates from the Chair itself and not just from the House 
leaders in this respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think it is a matter of numbers, although it does stand 
as a condemnation of the government that it has now broken the 
record of a previous government with respect to the introduction 
of time allocation.  I nevertheless think that if the Chair were 
to exercise this discretion it would have to be judged on the 
merits of each and every time allocation and not now that we have 
reached 55, 65, 10 or whatever.  I do not think that is a very 
strong argument.  It may be a strong argument in terms of how the 
government behaves, but I do not think it is a potential source 
of guidance to the Chair as to when this discretion should be 
exercised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that the record was broken on an old piece of 
legislation when it probably should not have been.  It is an old 
piece of legislation.  It is not something that is momentous.  I 
can think of lots of pieces of legislation that have come before 
parliament that have been time allocated which were very 
significant and never should have been time allocated.  It would 
have been nice to have had this debate around those pieces of 
legislation rather than the bill we are having it around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just wanted to make the point that I think there are occasions 
when the Chair should take it upon itself.  It is also true that 
I think the Chair has the right to ask for some guidance from the 
House, if it is possible, on these matters.  Hopefully we might 
be able to do that in the near future. 
<P><A NAME="LINK167"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to add some brief remarks as well. 
Being a member of the party that held the previous record, one of 
which we are not necessarily proud, we are certainly glad that 
although the hon. House leader in his wisdom railed against such 
high handed tactics when in opposition, wailed like a banshee, he 
has now surpassed the dubious honour of invoking time allocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know a fine nuance was invoked in question period today when 
he referred to the fact that it was not closure.  It is akin to 
differentiating between a club and a sword as to the method of 
shutting down debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would as well offer support for the Chair in its wisdom of 
seeking advice and in the suggestion that House leaders convene a 
meeting to discuss this matter.  It seems to me that in principle 
part of the problem which has led us to this point is a breakdown 
in communication.  It is incumbent upon the opposition in its 
willingness to try to come to some agreement with the government 
House leader as to how we resolve matters of debate in the House 
without coming to a breaking point where the government House 
leader feels that he has to invoke the heavy handed measure of 
shutting down debate in such a unilateral fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the short time that I have to make these remarks, I want to 
offer support for the suggestion the Chair has brought forward to 
convene a meeting where this communication perhaps can be 
improved. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1535"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps in the future, although it has been only six years that 
the government has taken to surpass this benchmark or high water 
mark that it took the previous administration nine years to 
achieve in a dubious way, we can hopefully make better use of 
alternative channels of communication, the meetings of the House 
leaders being one and perhaps the best.  In this way we could try 
to avoid getting to the point where all members of the House are 
being affected in a very substantial way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the member for Winnipeg—Transcona when he says 
that there are more important pieces of legislation and matters 
of debate that would have led to discussions of this nature 
earlier.  I do not mean to call this bill inconsequential, but it 
is simply, as pointed out by the opposition House leader, that we 
have reached a point in this short time where there is almost 
something like creeping softness and acceptance of the use of 
time allocation as a procedural blocking mechanism for debate. It 
has become an accepted manner of shutting down what is only to be 
deemed as the last bastion of debate on matters for the 
opposition to call the government to task on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strongly encourage the Chair to give this matter urgent 
attention.  We cannot have this as an accepted practice.  I would 
suggest that for us to do otherwise is to acquiesce and show 
apathy toward the deterioration of the procedures, the workings 
and the functions of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I am going to give the floor to the member 
from the Bloc Quebecois, but another statement has been made by 
the House leader of the Conservative Party.  I believe he called 
for moderation on all sides of the House, and that includes all 
five parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have two suggestions.  The first is that the House 
leaders in some way discuss this matter and, second, that there 
has to be openness and give and take on both sides.  It is in the 
best traditions of the House that the House can grapple with a 
problem and that the House, through its House leaders if 
necessary, can come to some kind of conclusion. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK168"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish you to 
know that, in my opinion, your suggestion that the parliamentary 
leaders seek a way of settling this problem, as is often done, 
is a reasonable one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would, however, like to point out that, every time the 
government or the opposition makes use of mechanisms to hold up 
debate, to speed it up, to limit its length, it must be an 
exception. We all agree on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the official opposition and the other parties are 
complaining of what seems to us to be an excessive use of time 
allocation motions by the government.  I think that the figures 
will show that there has been a certain increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this opportunity to remind my colleagues that this is not 
the only point of dispute in our discussions.  Hon. members are 
aware that a motion was backed by the government in the 
procedure and House affairs committee, and it was also supported 
by other political parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of that motion was to have the mechanism used by the 
opposition to allow it a little longer, on occasion, to vote on 
a number of bills set aside, by giving each party whip the 
ability to vote on behalf of his colleagues.  I and my party 
have always been opposed to such a mechanism. 
I have been told that it has not yet and may possibly never be 
introduced in the House at this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this opportunity to point out to my colleagues on this 
side of the House that, in both cases, the problem is exactly 
the same.  It is no more interesting for the opposition to watch 
the government abuse time allocation than it is for the 
opposition to watch the government adopting mechanisms to 
prevent us from using our own exceptional mechanism, or one of 
our own exceptional mechanisms, in order to prolong the debate, 
that is, multiple votes or other strategies such as long 
debates.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would simply like to say that if we came away from this place 
today at the end of a debate, which has not lasted long, but 
which has taught us a lot, if we came away with some sort of 
unanimity recognizing that your suggestion is very wise, that we 
should all discuss time allocation motions, that we should all 
discuss means that might be put forward in order to limit the 
opposition's ability to impede the work of the House but that 
could as well allow us to discuss the government's right to move 
files along, we would see this parliament as balanced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If, for one reason or another, parliament does not function in a 
balanced manner, if the opposition or the government abuse their 
respective privileges, we are headed for a bleak period in this 
place.  Whenever this happens, democracy is always put on hold 
and thwarted, and this is not what anybody really wants.  What 
we want is to be able to function as democratically as possible 
here, and to use the means passed on to us by our predecessors 
to best advantage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view, the only way forward in the dispute that concerns 
us, as well as the House leader of the Canadian Alliance and all 
other members of the House, today is to go along with the 
Speaker's suggestion that the House leaders get together and 
discuss the matter.  I believe that, if balance is to be 
maintained, any decisions made must involve agreement between 
the parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with your suggestion, Mr. Speaker, and I hope that 
nothing will be done without agreement between the House 
leaders.  Since it is everyone's goal to leave a positive mark 
in this parliament, I sincerely believe that we will do 
everything we can to work out an arrangement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am willing to go along with your suggestion and I hope that 
the government leader will show the same openness to your 
recommendations, and that the other party leaders will do 
likewise.  I think this is the way to go if we want to function 
efficiently. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK169"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The House leaders have spoken today. 
They have given their opinions.  As I reiterated, it is not up to 
the Chair to make a hard and fast ruling, but it is up to the 
Chair surely to encourage not only House leaders but all members 
of the House to make it so that the House functions in a 
reasonably amicable way and that we can carry out our functions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two suggestions were made, one by the opposition House leader 
and one by the House leader of the Conservative Party.  The words 
which were added by the hon. House leader of the New Democratic 
Party and by my colleague from the Bloc Quebecois should help us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I cannot order House leaders to come together 
to settle this matter.  That is a given, but I can surely 
encourage House leaders to come together, at least in the spirit 
of trying to find some kind of solution to an area which probably 
could take a bit more looking at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have given my advice to the House.  The House leaders 
generally have given their opinions in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Some have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Yes, I am corrected.  I invite all House 
leaders, if they wish to partake in the particular discussion, to 
do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The floor of the House of Commons is not the usual place for 
these discussions to take place, but surely in private if the 
House leaders wanted to come together I for one would look upon 
this favourably so that the Chair is not called upon at different 
times in different circumstances to say that 67 are too many, 97 
are too many, or 180 are too many. 
The House leaders have traditionally found ways to get along in 
the House and that is what I would encourage for the House, the 
House leaders and, indeed, all members.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>INCOME TAX AMENDMENTS ACT, 1999 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK178">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from May 4 consideration of the motion that 
Bill C-25, an act to amend the Income Tax Act, the Excise Tax Act 
and the Budget Implementation Act, 1999, be Read a second 
time and referred to a committee, of the amendment, and of the 
amendment to the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK179"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Children and 
Youth), Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with 
the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance.   Thank 
you very much for the opportunity to speak today at the second 
reading stage of Bill C-25, the 1999 income tax amendments act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last fall Canadians were promised, in both the speech from the 
throne and the Minister of Finance's economic and fiscal update, 
that the government would set out a multi-year plan for further 
tax reductions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Budget 2000 delivered on that commitment through a five year tax 
reduction plan that indexes the tax system against inflation, 
reduces the middle tax rate and overall cuts taxes by at least 
$58 billion by the year 2004, an average annual tax cut of 15%, 
with even greater relief for families with children.  It is a 
plan that will provide further real and lasting tax relief for 
all Canadians.   It is also a plan that had its foundations laid 
in previous budgets, including that of 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-25 deals with the measures announced in the 1999 budget. 
The measures in Bill C-25 demonstrate the following principles of 
tax fairness: tax relief must be fair and we must start with 
those who need it most, low and middle income Canadians, 
especially families with children; priority must be placed on 
personal income taxes where the burden is greatest and where we 
are most out of line with other countries; ensure that Canada has 
an internationally competitive business tax system; and, tax 
relief must not be financed with borrowed money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-25 goes a long way in addressing these issues.   Many of 
these measures are the result of consultations with the industry 
or clients affected, a process to which our government is 
dedicated in any major policy change.  Each measure addresses an 
inequity, inconsistency or a discrepancy in the tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to focus on the measures that deal with the concerns of 
low and middle income Canadians and those who need it most.  In 
particular, I want to speak about the following measures:  tax 
credits for individuals, the Canada child tax benefits, medical 
expense tax credits and tax co-ordination with first nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of personal tax credits, which will bring tax 
relief to all Canadians, with the high cost of living in the 
north this will go a long way to alleviating some of the strain 
on families, especially those with children.   Women will also 
benefit greatly as they remain among the poorest of the poor in 
Canada. Nearly half of the retired widows live below the poverty 
line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The following personal tax credit measures will be of great 
assistance.  First, the 1998 budget raised the amount of money 
that low income Canadians could receive on a tax-free basis by 
$500. The 1999 budget extends this relief to all taxpayers and 
increases that amount by $175.  As a result of these two 
measures, all taxpayers will benefit from a basic personal credit 
sufficient to allow the receipt of up to $7,131 of tax free 
income.  That is an increase of $675 over what was available in 
1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amount upon which the spousal credit is calculated will also 
be increased by $675 to $6,055.  The threshold where the spousal 
credit begins to be reduced will increase from $538 to $606. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1998 budget began the process of eliminating the 3% surtax 
that was brought in by the previous Conservative government.  The 
surtax was eliminated for taxpayers with incomes of up to $50,000 
and reduced it for those with incomes between $50,000 to $65,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1999 budget completes the process by eliminating the 3% 
surtax for all taxpayers, so all Canadians will no longer have to 
pay the 3% surtax.  This is a very significant amendment. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1645"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT73"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT73"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1645
<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition there is the removal of 600,000 Canadians from the 
tax rolls.  Together the 1998 and 1999 budget measures removed 
600,000 Canadians from the tax rolls and reduced taxes for all 
15.7 million Canadian taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While all taxpayers will benefit from these measures, low income 
earners have the most to gain.  A typical one earner family of 
four that receives an annual income of $30,000 or less will pay 
no net federal income tax.  A similar family earning $40,000 will 
enjoy a 15% federal income tax reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next point is the Canada child tax credit.  The 1998 budget 
announced a further $850 million under the child tax benefit for 
the national child benefit system.  The 1999 budget sets out the 
design for the increased assistance agreed to by the federal, 
provincial and territorial governments targeted at low income 
families with children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Effective July 1, 1999 the national child benefit supplement is 
$785 for the first child, $585 for the second and $510 for each 
subsequent child.  As of July 2000 the supplement will be 
increased to $955 for the first child, $755 for the second child 
and $680 for each subsequent child.  The increases are quite 
evident.  This will be an increase of $350 for each eligible 
child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For both Canada and the Northwest Territories the percentage of 
lone parent families has steadily increased over the past 15 
years and slightly faster in the Northwest Territories.  They 
have faced greater challenges in terms of income and labour force 
activity. Some 57.1% of single parent families led by women with 
children under the age of 18 live in poverty based on the 1997 
statistics.  The child tax benefit will be of benefit to these 
families in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Turning to tax relief for Canadians with disabilities, hon. 
members are aware of how this will affect those individuals. They 
are aware of the government's continuing commitment to help these 
Canadians by building on the assistance that is already 
available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last two years additional assistance has been provided 
through such measures as a caregiver tax credit, a refundable tax 
credit for low income earners with high medical expenses and the 
addition of new eligible expenses under the medical expense 
credit known as METC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The METC is being extended further to cover expenses for the 
care of people with severe disabilities living in a group home, 
therapy for those with severe disabilities and tutoring for the 
learning disabled with severe disabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition talking textbooks for individuals with perceptual 
disabilities who are enrolled in educational institutions will be 
included on the list of eligible equipment for persons with 
disabilities.  This will make the lives of those people 
immeasurably easier.  It will help.  It will not be the total 
solution but it will help.  This measure will be of great 
assistance to those who need it most in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first nations taxation co-ordination measure was not 
announced as part of the 1999 budget.  It is designed to help 
implement taxation agreements with the first nations providing 
for a reduction in federal tax for individuals who are subject to 
the income tax legislation of certain first nations.  This 
amendment puts the federal government's tax sharing agreements 
with self-governing Yukon first nations into force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the personal income tax collected from residents 
of these Yukon first nations settlement lands, the federal 
government will vacate 75% of its tax room for the Yukon first 
nations government to occupy.  The bill will also ensure that the 
tax burden of an individual subject to first nations taxation is 
the same as in its surrounding jurisdiction. This is an example 
of great progress on the issue of first nations taxation and 
self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members know, the government remains committed to 
providing substantial tax relief to Canadians on an ongoing 
basis.  Bill C-25 and budget 2000 deliver on this commitment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude by saying there are many measures here that are going 
to help the average Canadian and which will help those people who 
need it the most.  We must not forget when we as government take 
certain steps to alleviate pressure on those impacted groups that 
we do it with the sensitivity that is needed and in a universal 
manner that reaches all those people who need it the most.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is sad to see the 
opposition taxing the patience of members of the House by trying 
to delay legislation that would reduce the taxes of Canadians, 
but then logic and consistency have really never been the strong 
suit, or should I say the long suit, of the party once known as 
reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion proposes that: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“this House declines to give second reading to Bill C-25...since 
the principle of the Bill does not provide for a Single Rate Tax 
Plan as proposed in Solution 17.” 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I may offer some friendly advice to the hon. member and his 
colleagues, if they ever want to build a truly national 
constituency, it is time they got out of the single rate rut. 
The flat tax proposal of the Canadian Alliance fails miserably in 
the two most important tests:  the test of equity and the test of 
simplicity.  I hope I can show that in my remarks which follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of trying to sell a phoney silver bullet solution, they 
should be helping the government enact its program of tax relief, 
including the $58 billion in tax savings proposed in the February 
budget.  They are real tax savings for all Canadians and fair tax 
savings that provide the greatest benefit for families in the 
greatest need rather than reward the rich. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government knows that Canadians are tired of the tax burden. 
That is why, with the deficit eliminated for good, we have 
taken clear, concrete action to get taxes down.  We have made it 
clear that the actions in budget 2000—including those contained 
in this bill—are just a minimum. As revenues improve, we will do 
more. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But a single tax rate is not on that agenda because it is not on 
anybody's agenda.  They should put effective, equitable public 
policy ahead of desperate partisan politics.  This point was 
emphasized in a column last week in the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I>. In 
referring to the hon. member for Medicine Hat, it states that he: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—points out that (Premier) Harris `has been agnostic' on the 
(single rate) tax.  Yet, in last week's budget, the Ontario 
Premier missed the opportunity to move in the direction of a 
single-rate tax.  And there are few other examples for the 
Alliance to point to:  Only Latvia and Hong Kong have flat taxes, 
and five American states have single-rate taxes. 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>More impressive is the list of those (from Thatcher's Britain, 
to Reagan Republicans, to an early Reform Party task force) that 
have studied the flat tax and rejected it. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason that so many jurisdictions have rejected the 
opposition's solution 17 approach, just as a decade's worth of 
U.S. primaries rejected the flat tax mania of millionaire 
presidential wannabe Steve Forbes, is that it is both 
wrong-headed and wrong-hearted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that solution 17 with its 17% single rate would 
provide much larger tax reductions for high income individuals 
compared with middle and low income individuals.  This would 
violate the widely held view in our democratic system that a key 
objective in providing tax relief should be to deliver it first 
to those who need it most:  middle and low income individuals and 
those with families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thinking caring Canadians understand that it is important to 
ensure that the tax system recognizes the ability of individuals 
to pay by taxing at a lower rate middle and low income families. 
But reform's solution 17 heads in the opposite direction.  It 
would significantly reduce the progressivity and fairness of the 
tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  The Speaker ruled some time ago that our party would from 
here on in be known as the Canadian Alliance.  I have heard many 
instances where other parties have referred to us otherwise.  I 
am going to ask that you rule that in every case that we be known 
as the alliance or else we will find new names for the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The hon. member 
certainly has a point.  I would ask the hon. member from the 
government side to address the other side as the Canadian 
Alliance.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B>  Certainly, Madam Speaker.  I am not sure 
whether it is an alliance party or a movement but I am happy to 
comply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance solution 17 heads in the opposite 
direction.  It would significantly reduce the progressivity and 
fairness of the tax system.  For incomes above the basic 
exemption, it would tax a lone parent earning $30,000 a year at 
the same rate as a wealthy CEO making $2 million a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us step back for a second and look at this issue on a 
broader conceptual basis.  Indeed several different flat tax 
proposals have been put forward in recent years both in Canada 
and abroad.  Typically such proposals involve the replacement of 
a progressive rate structure with a single tax rate and the 
elimination of many deductions and credits.  The resulting tax 
structure is of course appealing for its superficial simplicity. 
However, these flat tax proposals raise a number of issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Flat tax systems can be designed to be progressive, like the 
current income tax system, through the provision of a relatively 
high basic personal exemption for low income filers.  Providing 
such an exemption with the reduced single rate would result in a 
significant reduction in income tax revenues.  We have to 
consider the cost of any proposal especially over the long term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition's 17% solution, including an increase in personal 
exemptions to $10,000 and a new $3,000 exemption per child, would 
cost in the range of $34 billion a year.  That is almost 
one-third of the entire federal program spending budget for this 
year.  Even including the tax cuts we have announced, it would 
entail major cuts to federal programs.  Which programs would the 
hon. member want to cut: health spending, support for R and D or 
old age security?  It would be cuts like these that are the real 
cost of the tax savings the opposition seeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the issue of simplification?  Here too the opposition 
is playing fast and loose with both fact and philosophy.  The 
real fact is that most taxpayers would not find tax calculations 
much easier if only one rate were used.  Simplicity generally 
comes from the elimination of deductions and credits, not from 
reducing the number of tax rates.  Again we get a glimmer of the 
real bottom line agenda of the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the real world many of the deductions and credits that would 
have to go to deliver tax simplification and to pay for the 
reduction in the tax rate would hit painfully and punitively on 
modest and middle income Canadians.  It could mean for example 
getting rid of the child care expense deduction, the medical 
expense and tuition fee tax credits.  Perhaps the hon. member for 
Medicine Hat has no problem getting rid of this targeted relief 
aimed at those who are in the greatest need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the solution this government would ever embrace 
because Canadians demand better of us.  Canadians understand that 
eliminating these deductions and credits would provide less 
recognition of the ability to pay tax of individuals in different 
circumstances.  Canadians recognize that such action would mean 
less flexibility for the government in delivering social and 
economic policy in a volatile global economy; policies designed 
to help our country seize new economic opportunities while 
protecting those who can be buffeted when the winds of change 
blow too harshly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is where we can see clearly and cleanly the basic 
philosophy difference between our government and the opposition. 
We both may agree that a key objective of national policy must be 
to lower tax rates in order to leave Canadians with as much money 
as possible so that they can provide for their needs.  However, 
we differ diametrically when the advocates of flat taxes justify 
the elimination of deductions and credits by arguing that the 
government should not use the tax system to pursue social and 
economic policy.  The sad irony is that if these deductions and 
credits are carried forward in the solution 17 flat tax proposal, 
then clearly they would not have made the income tax system more 
simple, as many Canadians believe to be the advantage of flat tax 
system. We cannot have it both ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I agree that taxes should be lowered, this government also 
believes that how and how fast we cut taxes is also critical.  To 
make those decisions, we believe that fairness should be 
paramount. The government must ensure that the most vulnerable in 
society are not left behind. 
This in turn has a concrete corollary which recognizes that the 
ability of Canadians in different circumstances to pay must 
remain a key concern.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion I emphasize that looking for ways to improve the 
fairness of the tax system while keeping it as simple as possible 
are ongoing objectives of the government.  We are committed to 
bringing the overall tax burden down as fast and as far as we can 
without jeopardizing Canada's hard won fiscal stability.  Never 
again will we risk a return to deficit financing, especially not 
with pie in the sky tax solutions. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And that is the problem with the idea that underlies this 
time-wasting motion.  Against every element of a proper template 
for tax action—fairness, effectiveness, compassion, and long-term 
fiscal prudence—the opposition's approach fails, and fails badly. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not reward that failure by wasting much more time here 
today.  We should get the motion defeated and get on with the 
real tax cutting as contained in the income tax amendment act 
before us.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to debate the amendment to the 
amendment to Bill C-25.  I will start by saying that either my 
friend across the way is completely out of his depth on the issue 
of single rate taxes and flat taxes, or he is misrepresenting the 
position put forward by the Canadian Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As he scurries away, I would simply say to him that it is not 
the Canadian Alliance that caused a situation where today in 
Canada there is not a single— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order only because it has happened several times already today. 
The rules of the House have been ignored by the opposition in 
commenting on the presence or absence of members in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask that the Chair inform the member that it is not 
permitted under the rules, or I will be forced to start 
commenting on the presence and absence, which is noticed right 
now, of Canadian Alliance members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member is 
absolutely correct.  As a matter of fact, I heard it and I should 
have made mention of it too.  We do not reference the absence or 
presence of other members.  We know that they are busy in 
committee and have other responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me just say that he 
beat an intellectual retreat.  My friend across the way has to 
know that it was not the Canadian Alliance which put Canada in a 
position where we now see that not a single province in Canada 
has disposable income that matches even the poorest of the poor 
American states.  It was not the Canadian Alliance that caused 
that situation.  It was government members across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the weekend the Standard & Poor's DRI report on Canada 
pointed out that disposable incomes in Canada continue to plummet 
relative to the United States.  That report showed very clearly 
that the state of Mississippi, the poorest American state, has 
disposable income which is 10% higher than the wealthiest 
Canadian province, Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is that?  It is precisely because of some of the 
disincentives we find in the tax system in Canada today that our 
country has fallen so far behind, which is why solution 17 makes 
so much sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will simply address head on some of the accusations and 
misrepresentations I heard from across the way a few minutes ago. 
My friend across the way suggested that somehow solution 17 was 
unfair to people on the low end of the income scale.  I simply 
have to point out that under solution 17, 1.9 million low income 
Canadians would be lifted right off the tax rolls.  They would no 
longer pay the taxes which the government forces them to pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unbelievable to me that they stand there and pretend they 
are the champions of the little guy.  The only little guy they 
care about is the little guy from Shawinigan.

<A HREF="#LINKT76"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth is that 1.9 million low income Canadians pay taxes 
today who should not and solution 17 would solve that problem. 
They would no longer have to pay taxes to the finance minister 
and to the Prime Minister to fund all the questionable causes, 
shall we say, that we currently fund.  I want to deal with that 
one head on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I want to address the accusation that somehow what was 
inferred was that people at the high end of the income scale 
would pay the same tax rates as people at the low end.  That 
simply is not true.  They would pay a rate that is the same but 
the effective tax rate would be completely different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will illustrate what I mean with an example.  Let us consider 
someone who makes $1 million a year in income and compare that to 
someone who makes $24,000 in income, say a single mom with one 
child.  The difference between those two incomes is about 40 
times.  The person with the million dollar income has an income 
40 times larger, but under our system that person would pay 1,000 
times more tax than the single mom making $24,000.  She would pay 
$170 and the person with the income of $1 million would pay 
roughly $170,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the member across the way was suggesting completely 
misrepresents the situation.  It is simply not the case.  It is a 
desperate attempt by members on the other side to try to scare 
people away from a proposal which they know is intuitively 
appealing to Canadians.  We know that is the case because we even 
have finance department polling which shows that people favour 
this kind of idea.  They understand that Canada is in a 
competitive situation and that we have to start to remove some of 
the impediments to wealth creation which have caused us to fall 
so far behind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned a minute ago that relative to the United States our 
wealthiest province has after tax disposable income on average 
that is lower than the poorest of the poor American states.  That 
is not the only evidence we have to bring forward that the 
government has dropped the ball when it comes to finding ways to 
increase the productivity of the nation and through that the 
standard of living of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most revealing reports we have is from the OECD.  It 
demonstrates very clearly that over the decade from 1988 to 1998 
Canada languished in terms of producing real per capita output 
or, to put it another way, Canada's standard of living grew by 
5%.  Over 10 years, a lot of it under this government, our 
standard of living grew by a scant 5%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How fast did it grow elsewhere?  In France it grew three times 
that fast; in the United States, four times that fast; in 
Australia, four times that fast; in Norway, six times that fast; 
and in Ireland it grew by a remarkable eighteen times the rate 
that it grew in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend across the way from Hamilton says that is remarkable. 
It is.  I want my friend to understand the reason for it. Is it 
that Ireland has so many more resources than Canada? Hardly.  It 
has good management.  It made the right public policy decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact the DRI report I referred to earlier talked a bit about 
Ireland.  It said that many things were similar between the 
situation Canada is in and the situation Ireland is in.  We both 
have well educated workforces.  We concede that.  That is true. 
We are both next to big prosperous markets.  In Ireland's case it 
is Europe; in our case it is the United States.  We have these 
things going for us.  We have access to those markets.  We have a 
free trade agreement.  Ireland is part of the European economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing that separates us, and DRI pointed it out, is that 
Ireland took the commonsensical approach of reducing taxes to 
attract investment.  In Canada we have marginally lowered taxes 
so that we do not fall behind quite as fast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has been the difference?  As I mentioned a minute ago, the 
economy in Ireland grew exponentially, 18 times faster than 
Canada's over that 10 year period.

<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has been the impact on the Irish economy?  We know today 
that a country like Ireland, which for 150 years lost population, 
is now actually starting to add numbers to its population.  It is 
increasing in population for the first time in 150 years, just 
because of public policy decisions.  It is in a situation now 
where with 1% of the population in Europe it now attracts 20% of 
all new investment in Europe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an amazing story.  In fact its economy is growing rapidly 
now and it is projected to grow just as rapidly into the next 
five years.  It is bringing in so much revenue with much lower 
taxes that it now provides free university education for all its 
people.  It is an amazing story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we do in Canada?  The government tries to convince 
people that it is addressing the situation by bringing down the 
last budget and arguing that it delivered $58 billion in tax 
relief.  It simply was not so.  The DRI report points to the 
flaws in what the government has done.  In the $58 billion that 
it talks about we find that about $8 billion of it is the child 
tax benefit.  It is a sweetening of the child tax benefit.  It is 
a social program, and the Liberals are calling it a tax cut.  It 
is hardly the same.  A tax cut is when we leave the money in 
people's pockets in the first place.  We do not take it out and 
then run it through— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I am wondering if it is possible to seek unanimous 
consent to return to Routine Proceedings so I may have the chance 
to table the minority report which I did not have a chance to do 
this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  As a matter of fact 
during Routine Proceedings today the hon. member for 
Edmonton-Strathcona was on his feet.  I did not see him during

consent at that time to revert to presenting reports from 
committees to give him a minute to present the report and we did 
not obtain it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will ask for it again.  Will the House give unanimous consent 
to the member for Edmonton—Strathcona for one minute to present 
his minority report? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall:</B>  Mr. Speaker, may I ask which

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Canadian

was important to include a minority report with the committee's 
report this morning because we feel that the committee report 
lacks balance.  The recommendations that were made would 
unfortunately divide stakeholders rather than bring collaboration 
between groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance simply could not support the tone and 
overall direction of the report that failed to recognize the 
tremendous gains which manufacturers and user groups of

and especially safety top priorities.  Stakeholders in 
particular, manufacturers, agricultural producers— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of

presented and tabled, the opposition always has the opportunity

seconds and he has 20 more seconds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was on my last 
statement.  Stakeholders in particular, manufacturers, 
agricultural producers and other user groups have been taking 
extraordinary measures to promote a safe, transparent and 
effective regulatory system in a co-operative way with the PMRA, 
and this has been largely ignored in the committee report.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Kilger:</B> Madam Speaker, I would ask the indulgence of 
the House for a moment on a point of order.  Earlier today the 
House unanimously adopted a deferral of the private member's 
bill, of course with the approval of the member for 
Lambton—Kent—Middlesex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the day having run slightly longer than anticipated, I have 
not had time, respectfully to all my colleagues on both sides of 
the House, to do the normal negotiations.  I submit, in the 
spirit of co-operation, especially since it is Private Members' 
Business, I would ask for the unanimous consent of the House 
that the vote be deemed requested and deferred, so that members 
who have other obligations will have the ability to do so with 
the agreement of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Is there unanimous 
agreement to proceed in such a fashion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Gruending (Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise at report stage and speak to 
Bill C-276.  This is the latest incarnation of the member for 
Sarnia—Lambton's longstanding effort to severely curtail the 
practice of negative option marketing in areas of federal 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Negative option billing happens when companies we are already 
buying a service from unilaterally change the terms of our 
agreement with them.  In effect, they start to sell us something 
more or something different on the assumption that if we did not 
want it, we would have told them so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cable companies learned the hard way a few years back that 
Canadians do not appreciate this.  Most people are busy and have 
better things to do with their time than to pour over the fine 
print of every piece of junk mail that comes through the slot. 
We in the NDP believe they should not have to pour over that fine 
print.  The NDP government in British Columbia moved to curb this 
practice after that cable fiasco in 1995.  I note that the 
Government of Quebec has put similar legislation into effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking today about a proposed amendment by the Bloc 
Quebecois which would carve out Quebec from the applications of 
the current bill.  The Bloc believes that the regulation of 
commerce is an exclusive provincial jurisdiction and that 
businesses falling under federal jurisdiction in Quebec currently 
observe and comply with the Quebec law on this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have two issues here, one factual and one political, although 
they run together.  First, let us talk about the factual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Evidence presented by the Quebec consumer groups at the 
committee hearings suggested that this was not an exclusively 
provincial jurisdiction.  In fact, the Action Réseau Consommateur 
reiterated just yesterday in an e-mail sent to all members of 
parliament just how necessary it believes this bill to be in the 
province of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other issue is political and it is one on which I am afraid 
we in the NDP cannot agree with our colleagues in the Bloc.  The 
federal government does have the right to regulate industries 
falling within its areas of jurisdiction.  Once it does, the same 
rules must apply all across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us today moves farther than the member's first 
attempt to respond to negative option billing by the cable 
companies back in 1995.  At that time he sought to amend the 
Broadcasting Act to prevent cable distributors from repeating 
such business practices in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While that bill enjoyed the support of the House in all three 
stages, it then moved on to the Senate where it got bogged down 
in a series of complex legal and cultural arguments.  It died on 
the order paper when the election was called in 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current version of this bill extends its application to 
other industries under federal jurisdiction.  I am talking here 
notably about the banks and telephone companies, as well as the 
holders of so-called broadcast distribution undertakings, that is 
to say the cable companies.  The member broadens this definition 
by amending the Competition Act instead of the Broadcasting Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Sarnia—Lambton presented numerous examples at 
committee of how the banks and telephone companies have used 
negative option marketing. 
They have done so in much the same way that the cable companies 
did back in 1995 when they started charging everyone for cable 
channels if they were not cancelled within 30 days.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember when this happened to me.  I called the cable company 
to tell it that I did not want the service.  It told me that I 
would obviously keep the service because I needed it.  As I 
recall, I was treated as if I were unintelligent because I was 
not going to take all of the television channels.  I assured the 
company that I had enough television channels and that I could 
not understand why it was pursuing this negative option plan.  I 
felt it was unfair to me and to other consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, there was a great deal of outrage among consumers at 
the time about the negative option being practised by the cable 
companies.  That was the reason the hon. member brought forward 
his bill at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The banks, the telephone companies and the cable companies, 
which we are now talking about, are among the largest companies 
in Canada.  Although they have recently been opened up to 
competition in varying ways, they have all had a substantial head 
start over their competitors, thanks to an assured place in the 
market in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Historically in Canada, because we needed to provide telephone 
service, banking and entertainment in a diverse country, we chose 
the route of giving a few large Canadian companies the right to 
develop and sell services without foreign competition.  This was 
a social contract.  In return, they promised to be fair to 
consumers and accountable to government regulators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although there was clearly some difference in how this principle 
was translated into the different methods of regulating the three 
industries under discussion today, I believe that it fairly 
characterizes the philosophical approach that was adopted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today technology is changing our economy and our society in many 
ways.  These changes should offer the promise of allowing 
consumers more choice and more control over the services they buy 
from banks, telephone companies and cable companies.  These 
technological changes make the provision of legislation such as 
this even more necessary, just as it makes it more possible for 
the companies to provide us with more choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Companies will no longer be able to argue that it is too 
expensive to write three letters to every consumer or to obtain 
consent prior to every transaction.  In fact, they are going to 
find that they may lose business unless they accord us this 
respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is important for legislators to keep in focus and in 
balance during these changing times are three principles.  First, 
we must ensure that services and infrastructure are available to 
all our citizens in this large and geographically diverse 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we must promote Canadian providers of these services 
wherever possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we must put the interests 
of consumers, both their short term and long term interests, at 
the centre of our efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the hon. member's bill takes an important step in 
these directions and follows these principles.  I am pleased to 
support his bill for that reason.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to speak to the hon. member for 
Sarnia—Lambton's private member's bill, Bill C-276, which seeks 
to amend the Competition Act to ensure that Canadian consumers 
are not unwillingly participants of negative option billing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Negative option marketing is the practice of offering products 
or services while placing the onus on the customer to expressly 
decline or opt out of whatever is offered.  If the consumer does 
not do that or does not know about it, then the consumer is on 
the hook to pay for the product or service even though he or she 
has not consented to the purchase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members of the House and many Canadians know the work that 
the member for Sarnia—Lambton has done with respect to negative 
option marketing.  I wish to acknowledge his good work to protect 
senior citizens, those on fixed incomes and others, and all 
consumers who may not be aware of the consequences of negative 
option marketing until it affects them. 
We thank him for his efforts to date.

<A HREF="#LINKT89"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-272 is designed to prohibit the practice by federally 
regulated businesses such as banks, cable and telephone companies 
of implied consent billing.  It would require the consumers' 
explicit consent before they could be billed for a product or 
service, thus putting an end to the practice of negative option 
billing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consumers across Canada demonstrated their intense frustration 
when cable providers attempted to automatically charge for new 
programs unless the service was expressly rejected.   It is clear 
that in a monopoly market such as telephone and cable services 
consumers cannot easily switch to a service provider who does not 
engage in this sneaky marketing tactic.  That is why the people 
of Quebec should not be denied the benefits of this legislative 
proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment we are discussing today is from the Bloc which is 
insisting that Quebec be exempt.  I believe that Quebecers 
deserve to be protected by the laws of Canada and an exemption 
for federally regulated industries in Quebec is unworkable and 
unfair to the Quebec consumer.   Personally I like the principle 
that businesses should obtain consumer consent before charging 
for new services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the inclusion of the banks in Bill C-272 makes me 
wonder if the consent requirement is practical for all 
industries.  For example, the banks tell us that only about 30% 
of their customers currently receive bank statements.  The 
financial review group of the Department of Finance told the 
industry committee that the complaints they receive tend to be 
general complaints about the cost of bank service charges rather 
than changes to service charge packages.  This reflects my 
experience with my constituents.  I received hardly any 
complaints regarding negative option billing with respect to the 
banks.  More important, there is competition in the banking 
industry and choices are available to the consumer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provincially regulated credit unions and others will not 
have the same obligation so there would not be a level playing 
field.  Perhaps this issue would be better examined during a 
review of the Bank Act planned for this summer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Competition laws and regulation can profoundly restrict economic 
freedom and market efficiency.  A general move toward 
strengthening these laws should be approached with caution.  The 
federal government must strive to ensure that our competition 
laws do not become overly intrusive and generate a muddled 
business environment.  Competition law must balance the rights of 
the consumer and the aspirations of companies striving to expand 
their market share.  We must act vigilantly to create competition 
through deregulation in the interest of every Canadian consumer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Negative option billing is a practice common to federally 
regulated industries that enjoy market protection inasmuch as 
they can restrict or limit a customer's ability to seek out 
alternative providers of a product or service.  Therefore, the 
deregulation of federally regulated industries would be the first 
step to eliminate negative option billing and other practices 
that do not properly serve consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would much rather have an initiative that worked to limit 
government regulation and increase competition.   The Canadian 
Alliance supports limited government but recognizes the important 
role of government in creating an economic environment with fair 
and transparent rules which protect both consumers and 
businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We differ from the Liberals in that we believe that markets 
serve consumers well as long as competition is permitted.  This 
bill in a sense is a band-aid solution made necessary by the 
Liberals who maintain protectionist policies and regional 
monopolies in federally regulated industries such as cable and 
telecommunications, despite the fact that these policies hurt 
consumers.  The drive for profits in a competitive and 
deregulated industry will give more power to the consumer to seek 
the most favourable terms for them.   It is the invisible hand of 
capitalism or the market at work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, it is clear that the Liberal mismanagement of 
federally regulated industries has created an economic 
environment in which consumers suffer the ill effects of limited 
competition.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is 
with pleasure today that I rise to speak to Bill C-276, the 
legislation that addresses the issue of negative option billing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important when we are developing solutions to complex 
problems that we do not use solutions which are overly simplistic 
and may not in fact address the actual complexities of the 
problem.  H. L. Menkin, the American humorist, once said that for 
every complex problem there is a neat, plausible solution that is 
wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some concerns as a member about the legislation.  That 
being the case, I recognize the position of the hon. member for 
Sarnia—Lambton in bringing forward the legislation and support 
the ends he is trying to achieve.  I am just questioning whether 
or not this may be the most effective means to achieve those 
ends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every industry that may use negative option billing is different 
and operates within different parameters.  For instance, cable 
companies are clearly different from industries within the 
financial services sector or the banks.  In an effort to reduce 
negative option billing or to address the issue of negative 
option billing, we have to be careful that we do not create an 
onerous level of regulation in one industry where it is more 
prevalent and impose the same level of regulation on another 
industry that in fact is not utilizing negative option billing as 
much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This may lead to greater costs for consumers with a complicated 
process where effectively participants in that given industry, 
for instance the financial services sector, may find that it 
creates a competitiveness disadvantage relative to industries in 
other areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One issue that needs to be addressed is the fact that in 
mailings from banks or financial institutions to customers there 
is only a 5% return rate currently.  As such, it would create an 
immense amount of administration within a financial services 
institution or a bank to actually try to eliminate completely any 
level of negative option billing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If negative option billing is being used, for instance to bundle 
or to package services in ways where a customer may in fact 
benefit in some way or that would actually reduce the costs to 
the customer, there is no negative to the customer.  That is the 
case for some of our financial institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to realize that we heard from the Minister 
of Finance last June with a response to the MacKay task force of 
the Government of Canada.  Those measures have not yet been 
implemented.  I believe they should have been implemented 
earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is in fact stalling on implementing its response 
to the report on the financial services sector.  The legislative 
enabling of that response should have taken place by now but it 
has not.  When the Senate looks at the legislation it should 
ensure that it somehow fits within this private member's bill and 
that any recommendation would fit within the parameters of the 
government's white paper response to the MacKay task force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of the competitiveness of our banks and our financial 
institutions is paramount right now.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently we are seeing around the world immense changes in the 
financial services sector relative to information technology. 
Effectively the forces of technology and globalization are 
transforming the financial services sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to be very careful in Canada.  For instance, this type 
of legislation does not exist in the U.S.  There is nothing like 
it relative to negative option billing in the U.S.  As we 
increase levels of competition or access to Canadian markets by 
foreign banks, there is a risk that if we handcuff Canadian 
financial institutions with this type of legislation we in fact 
may be imperilling Canadian banks and creating a deleterious 
impact on them and their shareholders, which in fact include 7.5 
million Canadians who actually own bank shares in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to ensure that legislation that is designed on one hand 
to help Canadian consumers does not on the other hand hurt the 
7.5 million Canadians who directly or indirectly depend on their 
investments in our chartered banks for part of their retirement 
income or in many cases in most portfolios a significant part of 
their retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of addressing the differences between industries is 
paramount.  If we create some type of regulatory body or vehicle 
and focus on protecting people from one industry which affects a 
broad range of industries, clearly it may have a lot of 
unforeseen and unintended consequences.  We have to be awfully 
careful of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are supportive of the ends of this legislation, in that 
negative option billing may be something that is more common in 
Canada and have a more negative impact on Canada than members of 
the House are aware.  We are studying and discussing as a caucus 
our position on this matter currently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we are crafting public policy in the House we have to be 
sure that we are crafting it around realities as opposed to 
perceptions.  It is very easy sometimes to develop public policy 
around perceptions in the current environment of poll driven 
policy as opposed to policies that reflect the realities of what 
is going on in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would prefer to see a greater level of competition in all 
these sectors, including the financial services sector.  I would 
like to see the government truly address issues of 
competitiveness, including greater opportunities for smaller 
financial institutions to compete fully with the banks in Canada, 
and thus enable both on the consumer side and on the lending side 
Canadians to have a greater range of services from a greater 
variety of financial institutions in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we address the basic fundamental issues of 
competition and do not treat these issues with a less holistic 
approach.  It is important to recognize that effectively we 
should try to ensure that our regulatory burden in Canada is not 
grossly different from that which exists in countries with which 
our Canadian companies need to compete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly the issue the hon. member from Sarnia raises is a very 
important one.  We have to ensure that the means by which he is 
proposing we address it are the most appropriate means. 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I am pleased to participate in the debate on Bill C-276 sponsored 
by the member for Sarnia—Lambton who has been quite active on 
the whole question of negative option billing or marketing. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1900"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians will recall the national event involving a cable 
company which tried to introduce additional services.  These 
services were going to be charged automatically unless the 
customer let it be known that they did not want the services. 
This is the whole concept of negative option billing.  As members 
will recall, the consequence was the uprising of consumers who 
said that this was unfair, this was not right.  The cable company 
withdrew its proposal and the consumer won. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is about consumer protection.  There is a very good 
reason why it should be characterized as that and why it should 
be before the House.  In my experience in business, as a member 
of parliament and as an observant consumer, it is my view that 
consumers need help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many times have we seen people go to an automatic teller 
machine to withdraw $20?  How many times have we seen someone go 
to McDonald's and use a debit card to buy a Big Mac?  People do 
not realize the cost of a transaction.  It is pervasive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many times have people received in the mail a credit card 
that was unsolicited?  How many times have we seen someone at the 
till look at the onion sheets of bad credit cards?  Why would all 
of these unsolicited cards be given if there was not, as there is 
in gambling, a winner?  Considering the number of cards that are 
now issued in the credit card industry, this business is very 
profitable, despite the fact that many accounts go bad and losses 
are incurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that consumers need protection because they are not 
alert.  Consumers are distracted by life, by their own interests, 
and they have been conditioned to assume that everything will 
take care of itself.  Many people do not pay their full Visa 
balance or Mastercard balance and they are charged interest.  It 
is only a few dollars.  It is not a big deal.  But with millions 
of consumers all having the same lazy consumer habits, the 
sponsors of the credit cards receive a tremendous profit, even 
though there are losses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If an individual does not have a special arrangement with their 
bank, they could be paying anywhere from 30 cents to 75 cents 
every time they use their debit card.  People think that the 
debit card is convenient because they do not require cash in 
their pocket.  The card is pushed into a machine, a number is 
keyed in and the machine pays exactly the amount owing. 
Individuals do not have to worry about cash.  Consumers think 
that is convenient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A cashier at a large grocery store told me that the smallest 
purchase made at the store by a customer using a debit card was 
the purchase of a newspaper.  It was 50 cents for the newspaper, 
but there was a 75 cent charge for the use of the debit card.  It 
makes absolutely no sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consumers need to be educated.  They have to be educated about 
the tied value of money.  They have to be educated about the fact 
that there is a transactional cost no matter what we do, whether 
we are using debit card machines, green machines or any other 
electronic device.  The costs have to be recovered somehow.  We 
know what a computer costs.  We could imagine what this equipment 
would cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill really is a proxy for all the frustrations felt by 
consumers.  Consumers need protection, not because they are 
incapable of working this out for themselves, but because they 
are busy people.  It is not that they are lazy; they have 
families and jobs and they assume things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every now and then the cable company, the telephone company, a 
bank, almost anyone will do something and it is very subtle. 
We do not think it is a great deal even if we see something, 
although there is an additional five cents or three cents charged 
on an additional withdrawal in this account. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1905"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not enough for one individual to get excited about, but 
when that additional increase is spread over millions and 
millions of transactions, then we are talking about a significant 
amount of money taken out of the consumers' pockets on the basis 
of marketing strategies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who came up with the concept of negative option billing?  Was it 
consumers?  Did they say that business should do this because it 
is going to help them?  Of course not.  Negative option billing 
or marketing is a concept of business.  It is a concept of 
consumer transactions within which the consumer perhaps might not 
win, but they surely can lose in certain circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we go back to the credit card analogy, everyone knows that we 
get a period of 20 days or so between when the bill is received 
and when it is due.  There is a grace period between when the 
money was spent or the purchase was made and when the cash has to 
be disbursed.  In a perfect world, if we took that cash we would 
have otherwise used to pay for the purchase and put it in a bank 
account, and always left in the bank account all the moneys that 
we charged, at the end of a certain period, if it was an interest 
bearing account, we would accumulate a fair bit of money.  We 
could accumulate a fair bit of money over a period of several 
years and still meet all of our obligations with regard to the 
banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do people not do that?  The reason is quite simple.  It 
takes time.  We have to keep track of things.  If we miss just 
once, all the work done over a couple of weeks could be gone by 
missing one transaction or one day.  People are not in the 
business of trying to make nickels and dimes on odd amounts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I liked this bill conceptually when we went through the first 
round in the last parliament.  Now we are into an amendment to 
the Competition Act.  Quite frankly, negative option billing or 
marketing has been described as a deceptive marketing practice. 
That is a harsh description or characterization, but it is 
accurate and I would like to make that clear.  The reason it is 
deceptive is because if we do not do something, then something is 
going to happen to us.  What if I am busy or away?  What if I do 
not quite understand or have misread something?  What if I am an 
elderly person and cannot read very well any more?  What if I am 
just so tired that I cannot do it?  What if someone misses 
because they just happen to be a human being?  Chances are they 
will lose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a high risk area for those who are maybe less able or 
less capable than some to protect their own interests.  That is 
why, generally, all consumers should say that in principle we do 
have to protect the consumer population because within our group 
there are some who really are vulnerable.  The stories we hear 
about abuse of the elderly, as a simple example, is certainly one 
reason alone that we just cannot be soft on high pressure, 
scientifically proven, financially viable marketing strategies 
that have been very successful.  With the velocity of 
transactions that are taking place through Internet banking, et 
cetera, things are happening very quickly, Madam Speaker, so 
please do not blink, as you might miss part of my speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to make the point that the velocity of information is 
changing.  The options are there.  There are so many things that 
we can do.  Quite frankly, we are in transition as a society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People have to have a comfort level that they are going to be 
protected, especially when others want to change the nature of 
the environment in which they are going to do their consumer 
transactions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to congratulate the hon. member for Sarnia—Lambton.  He 
has been a champion for the consumer in this place.  I believe 
that all hon. members respect him for his hard work.  I hear that 
he has again reached report stage of a very important bill, and I 
know he is very much looking forward to having this accepted by 
the House so that he can go back to entertain his friends, the 
senators.

article which appeared on December 17 in the <I>National Post</I>: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bank mergers were squelched last summer because of concerns over 
how the super-banks would treat customers.  So why would Ottawa 
want to make it easier for the banks to sell Canadians services 
they don't want?  Mr. Gallaway's bill should pass as is. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The competition commissioner stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I don't see how negative optioning could ever be pro-competitive. 
The basic, underlying concept of a competitive market is that 
consumers have a choice and exercise that choice, and they 
exercise it knowingly.  If you have a negative option, you don't 
even know this has happened.  You never get a choice. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is taken from testimony before the Standing Committee on 
Industry in November and it comes from Konrad von Finckenstein, 
the Commissioner of the Competition Bureau of Canada.  The 
commissioner is recognizing on behalf of Canadians the problem 
that exists, the problem that the member is trying to solve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us continue with the testimony before the committee: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bureau feels that negative option marketing cannot be seen 
as a competitive technique that would be good for consumers.  The 
Bureau believes that consumers should have the opportunity to 
make an informed choice when buying new services.  We have never 
had and we do not yet have any objection to Mr. Gallaway's bill, 
which would apply to banks, the cable industry and broadcasting. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That statement was made by Johanne D'Auray, the Deputy 
Commissioner of the Competition Bureau of Canada, in testimony 
before the Standing Committee on Industry on February 17 of this 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the consumers' association have to say?  In testimony 
in December 1999 the Consumers' Association of Canada said that 
it believed support for Bill C-276 is a vote to restore to 
Canadian consumers the right to choose.  That came from Mrs. Gail 
Lacombe, the president and chief executive officer of the 
Consumers' Association of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is that right, the right to choose the services that we want, 
the right to choose the things that we will purchase, that is 
embodied in the bill.  It is sad in a way that we even have to 
have this sort of legislation.  It is sad that we would ever 
question a person's right to make an informed choice about the 
kind of purchases they will make and their right to know what 
kind of charges will be imposed upon them before they agree to 
it.  It is astounding in a way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting, but I do not think that some of the negative 
option marketing has been a stunning success.  Representatives of 
Rogers Cable indicated that before the committee.  In their 
testimony they indicated that they would never again do it 
because they have had such a negative reaction from consumers.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is astounding to me that in the past we have never had 
protection to prevent companies, particularly companies that had 
monthly billing practices, from altering the amount of money we 
were being charged without our ever knowing what it was for 
unless we took the time to look at it.  They did not ask us as to 
whether we wanted to purchase those new services or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill represents the kind of work all of us like to see done 
in the House.  It started with a member having a concern brought 
to his attention by people who lived in his riding.  He came back 
and met with other members from all sides of the House.  This 
bill has had support from all sides because they shared the 
concern.  He worked diligently to produce a piece of legislation 
that would provide the protection that consumers were requesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, perhaps you could give me a bit of advice.  I 
understand there is a desire for the mover of the bill to have 
the right of reply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  There is no right 
of reply tonight.  About two minutes are left in debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock:</B>  Madam Speaker, there has been a lot said 
on this bill, on the need for it and what it will do for 
consumers.  I will spend the last bit of time reflecting on the 
responsibilities all of us have in the House to protect and work 
on behalf of the people we represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has acted in the finest traditions of the House to 
bring forward a grievance that a great many Canadians have.  He 
has not just raised the question, he has gone beyond that and 
devised a solution to the problem, a solution that all members of 
the House can support.  It is a great credit to the member and it 
is a great credit to the members of this institution that we were 
able to take a stand together on behalf of the consumers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Gruending (Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, last month Canadians were outraged when they 
learned that 90,000 tonnes of toxic waste from an American 
military base in Japan was bound for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A shipment of PCBs, toxins that have been linked to birth 
defects and illnesses including Parkinson's disease and cancer, 
were on a boat bound for the port of Vancouver.  From there this 
toxic waste was going to be shipped all the way across the 
country to northern Ontario where it was going to be concentrated 
and then shipped back across the country once again to Alberta 
where it was destined to be burned.  That is right.  Toxic waste 
was going to be shipped from one end of the country and back 
again, toxic waste that was not even produced in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we might expect, Canadians were shocked to learn that their 
health was going to be put at risk to do the U.S. military a 
favour, while making a fast buck for an American company that had 
set up shop in northern Ontario to get around U.S. environmental 
laws.  Imagine an American company setting up shop in Canada to 
get around environmental laws.  Americans used to be afraid of 
losing jobs to Mexico because of the combination of low 
environmental standards and people's dire need for work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the House and many Canadians will remember one of the 
great fears people had during the NAFTA negotiations.  It was 
that Mexico's so-called trade advantage vis-à-vis employment, 
health and environmental standards would result in a race to the 
bottom in our country. 
We would have to do that in order to prevent job losses to 
Mexico.  Well, things have switched.  It now appears that Canada 
and not Mexico is the environmental patsy in North America.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are looking at a law for example to protect endangered 
species.  If it is passed without amendment it is going to be the 
weakest on the continent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On another matter, officials from our own environment ministry 
are leading the charge to muzzle the Centre for Environmental 
Cooperation.  That is the NAFTA watchdog that holds our 
governments accountable when they fail to enforce environmental 
laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday in the House I urged the environment minister to 
instruct his officials to stop undermining the work of the 
centre.  He said at the time that I was talking rubbish.  But 
last night Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is an environmental lawyer 
in the United States, spoke to a public meeting here in Ottawa. 
He made exactly the same charge, that is that Canada is leading a 
movement to undermine the Centre for Environmental Cooperation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are serious matters. We have a damning report as well, I 
might add, from the auditor general leaked only today which says 
that Canada is incapable of protecting its citizens from the 
illegal traffic, the improper storage and the wrongful disposal 
of hazardous waste. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Americans have banned the import of PCBs into their 
country, Canada is prepared to take them.  There are tonnes and 
tonnes of domestically produced PCBs sitting in storage sites in 
this country waiting to be dealt with and technologies which 
could dispose of them safely.  We do not have to ship them back 
and forth across the country and burn them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The promises made by the Liberals during the last two election 
campaigns and as recently as the throne speech last fall are 
looking more and more like empty rhetoric.  Under them we have 
slipped to the point where Mexico has stronger laws in place to 
protect the environment than we do.  When it comes to protecting 
the health of Canadians, the government is failing all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing I urge the government to put the health of Canadians 
before all else when it comes to environmental issues which we 
confront. 
<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to report that 
the shipment of waste containing PCBs from U.S. military bases 
was not off-loaded in Vancouver and is on its way back to Japan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are pleased that the U.S. government has taken responsibility 
to dispose of this cargo outside Canada.  Throughout we have 
maintained that the cargo and its disposal were the 
responsibility of the U.S. Department of Defense and Trans-Cycle 
Industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of this incident we have asked the U.S. Department 
of Defense to inform us in advance of any shipments of PCB 
contaminated waste intended for Canada no matter what the PCB 
concentrations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would ensure that our obligations under the Basel convention 
and all federal and provincial regulations are complied with 
before any decision on allowing such a shipment is rendered. 
Under our regulations Canada ensures that hazardous waste imports 
and exports are handled in a manner that protects the environment 
and human health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new Canadian Environmental Protection Act provides enhanced 
authority to control imports and exports of hazardous waste.  We 
will introduce new regulations to implement specific criteria to 
assess the environmental soundness of proposed imports and will 
refuse any import if these criteria are not met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An outright ban on the import of all hazardous waste is neither 
required nor appropriate.  A ban would neither be consistent with 
Canada's international obligations nor with the policy of sharing 
facilities with either side of the Canada-U.S. border which under 
the proximity principle allows both countries to use the nearest 
approved facilities thereby reducing transportation distances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada intends to continue to honour all of its international 
obligations and will take steps to continuously improve the 
standards for hazardous waste whether these wastes are domestic 
or international in origin.

<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to stand tonight and speak about the future of CBC 
regional programming.  It seems like a never ending story.  On 
April 6 I asked the Minister of Canadian Heritage whether she 
would commit to intervene with cash to save regional TV news 
programs if the corporation decided to kill supper hour shows. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1925"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT98"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT98"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1925

<A HREF="#LINKT97"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was on April 6.  Today coincidentally the president of the 
CBC came before the heritage committee to talk to us on that very 
subject.  The heritage committee had expressed a great deal of 
concern about rumours about impending cuts to regional 
programming.  We asked if he would come before the committee to 
discuss it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we heard today from the president of CBC was a confirmation 
that due to 16 years of Liberal and Conservative cuts, 17 local 
supper hour shows are to be reduced, quite possibly to one per 
time zone, each one co-hosted from Toronto.  The president made a 
very glossy presentation, a video of what these new shows would 
look like.  Peter Mansbridge would co-host with a host from each 
region.  The news would be recycled through Toronto, Peter 
Mansbridge being the mainstay of the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think there was much appetite in the room for that kind 
of treatment of local and regional programming.  I think it would 
be quite fair to say that the committee en masse, both sides of 
the House, every party, had passionate statements about the 
importance of regional programming and local programming to 
Canadian culture, to the survival of people's political knowledge 
of their area so that they would be able to understand the actual 
governance of their own region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Fredericton talked about the fact that there was 
no other programming that was available other than the CBC.  The 
member from Windsor talked about the fact that Windsor is a tiny 
little enclave surrounded by American production and was very 
concerned.  The leader of the New Democratic Party came to the 
heritage committee specifically to talk about the importance of 
regional programming to the Atlantic region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have four local supper hour news shows in Atlantic Canada and 
all of them have excellent ratings.  For example, the percentage 
audience share for the May 10, 2000 ratings compare the supper 
hour shows with <I>Hockey Night in Canada</I>, <I>Royal Canadian 
Air Farce</I> and <I>The National</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed changes which were alluded to by Mr. Rabinovitch 
and by Mr. Redekopp last Friday while speaking to the regional 
staff talked about beaming one supper hour show through Toronto 
with various inserts.  This is not something that people in 
Atlantic Canada want.  We want to see our own talent.  We want to 
hear our own stories.  We do not need it recycled through 
Toronto.  In every market the supper hour news is more popular 
than <I>The National</I>.  In three out of four markets the 6 p.m. 
news beats hockey during the height of the playoffs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where the New Democratic Party is coming from as always over the 
years is that it is important to maintain stable and secure 
funding for the CBC.  At this point in time, this quite historic 
day when the president finally acknowledged the fact that the CBC 
is underfunded, we ask the Prime Minister to reinvest in our 
national broadcaster.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I wish to take this 
opportunity to say that I too participated in the meeting to 
which the member for Dartmouth referred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that the members who attended took advantage of the 
opportunity to pass on to the president of the CBC the concerns 
raised by their constituents. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a golden opportunity as members of parliament to convey 
to the president of the CBC concerns that have been expressed to 
us about the importance of the regional aspect in CBC Radio 
Canada's mandate.  That has been done.  Today the president of 
CBC committed to the members of that committee to report directly 
to the board of CBC Radio Canada the concerns that have been 
voiced by a number of people but also the concerns that were 
voiced today by members of parliament who were reflecting 
comments received from constituents from all across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That also points out that a decision has not been made. One can 
hope that the concerns expressed indeed will be reflected in 
whatever decision is finally made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot ignore that CBC gets some of what my hon. colleagues 
have called stable funding.  The funding has been stabilized. 
This is the third year of a five year stable funding program.  It 
was marginally increased to reflect some cost of living 
adjustments.  It was also increased to absorb one time costs 
related to the Y2K concerns and so forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Proof that some things were working was presented to us today by 
the president of CBC in that radio is fine and in that French 
television is fine.  Let us not forget Radio Canada International 
which has also received secure and stable funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All told, the focus was on English television.  Despite funding 
problems there were things that the president wanted to do which 
he might do even if he got more money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  A motion to adjourn 
the House is now deemed to have been adopted.  Accordingly the 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m. pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1).
