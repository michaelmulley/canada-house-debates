	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North, Ref.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should consider allowing 
the provinces greater flexibility in the provision of health insurance and 
services.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, the request in my motion is simple. The 
Reform Party, like all Canadians, Canadian political parties, 
Canadians working in health care and a multitude of other 
Canadians, including the provincial premiers, recognizes the 
provinces have been delegated legal and constitutional 
responsibility to provide health insurance and services in 
Canada.
<P>
	As the provision of health services and insurance has been 
delegated to the provinces, I am asking they be given the 
authority to achieve it or to carry it out.
<P>
	The actual delegating of this task is not the hard part. The 
giving up of the authority over the actual control of how the task 
is carried out is the hard part. Unless the delegator, the federal 
government, is willing and able to devise the plan, update it as 
necessary and authorize each aspect of it prior to its 
implementation, in which case this is not feasible, the delegator 
must be prepared to delegate out some authority and in order to 
achieve what they want they identify what is to be achieved by 
the provinces, what components or principles are to be included 
and what standards of performance are expected. Then they give 
the authority necessary for the provinces to achieve this.
<P>
	As a national government we can legislate these guidelines, 
standards or principles, or both, or whatever else we should call 
them. We have done this via the Canada Health Act. We have 
established five fundamental principles to be incorporated by 
each province in its approach to providing health insurance and 
services. The principles are accessibility, comprehensiveness, 
portability, public administration and universality.
<P>
	The Reform Party believes these are sound national 
principles. The problem is not the principles themselves but the 
accompanying description or definition applied to each of them. 
For example, in the act the definition or interpretation of 
accessibility includes only one aspect of what access to care can 
actually mean, based on a person's ability to pay. That is 
commendable, as it opens the door for all Canadians regardless 
of their personal financial position to receive or have access to 
health care.
<P>
<B>(1110 ) </B>
<P>
	However, another aspect of access is when does one have the 
access to the actual treatment necessary for the condition one is 
presenting. I am thinking now in relation to the when part from a 
clinical or medical point of view. If a person requires a hip 
replacement, for example, or finds a lump on their body in some 
area it should not be, to get access to treatment can take 
sometimes weeks or months. Access to treatment from a 
medical and clinical aspect is extremely important, sort of the 
stitch in time premise.
<P>
	Early intervention in many situations saves future grief and 
discomfort for the individual as well as saving health care 
dollars in the long run, as one is addressing or presenting a 
condition much earlier than one would be by leaving it for 
months or weeks and so on.
<P>
	There are other problems with the Canada Health Act. There 
are restrictive clauses that create these problems. Portability 
comes to mind as another one.
<P>
	These problems must be addressed and resolved. The act 
needs revising and updating, allowing for more flexibility for 
the provinces not only in the administration and management of 
the service but also in the actual meaning or interpretation of the 
five principles. The meaning of decentralization of authority 
must play a much larger role in our health care system to 
preserve it.
<P>
	In the <I>Financial Post</I> on April 22 of this year an article was 
written by Alan Toulin entitled ``Decentralization Appeals to 
Canadians' Desire for Control''. Alan Toulin is saying 
Canadians want more control over the things that directly affect 
their lives, and governments at all levels are feeling the pressure 
of this growing public sentiment.
<P>
	He also quotes a leading business figure from Quebec, André 
Bérard, the National Bank chairman and chief executive officer. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12566"> 12566 </A></B>
<P>
Mr. Bérard apparently delivered a speech in Ottawa on how the 
process of decentralization is an inescapable force for both 
businesses and governments at all levels.
<P>
	Mr. Toulin makes reference that Mr. Bérard argues that those 
levels of government responsible for the spending of the money 
are the ones who should decide how health care, education and 
income security should be organized:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Citizens are more vigilant and can have more direct control over the actions of 
provincial and local governments when it comes to the spending decisions on 
behalf of the public interest, Mr. Bérard believes. In a country as large and diverse 
as Canada it is clear that many citizens feel Ottawa is a remote, lumbering 
government that cannot be controlled by them.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``The nearer the level of government is to the citizens, the more merciless these 
citizens are when they see public waste. They know that they are the ones who will 
ultimately pay. They are merciless because they know that they will have real 
power; that their voice will be heard; that their vote will not be diluted by millions 
of others'', Bérard said.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He goes on further to sing the praises of decentralization.
<P>
	That is basically what we are saying in this motion. There 
needs to be more flexibility. That kind of authority can go to the 
provinces and they can get on with providing health care 
according to the five major principles. Then they will be 
evaluated by the people in the province.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	Another component in the health care system that needs some 
serious revamping is funding. The initial agreement between the 
federal government and the provincial governments was a 50:50 
split. Over the years that has eroded. We have a system of tax 
points and cash payments known as established program 
financing. Because the tax points grow over time as the 
economy grows, the cash portion of EPF is shrinking. It is down 
to 23 per cent now from 50 per cent.
<P>
	Established program funding was introduced in 1977, 
replacing the cost sharing of post-secondary education and 
health care with a fixed per capita block funding transfer. That 
was the first time federal funding growth was unrelated to 
provincial program costs. It was designed to increase the rate of 
growth in population and in the national economy.
<P>
	Over the years further amendments were brought into the EPF 
system. In 1986, Bill C-96 reduced the growth of the EPF 
transfer. The payments were still tied to economic and 
demographic growth but their annual per capita growth rate was 
2 per cent lower than what it would have been under the old 
formula.
<P>
	In 1991, Bill C-69 froze the EPF transfers at their 1989 levels. 
That was to be applicable for two years. In 1991 Bill C-20 
extended the freeze on the per capita transfers to provinces for 
another three years. Therefore the provincial entitlements will 
continue to increase at the same rate as the population.
<P>
	Beginning in 1995-96 the rate of increase of the EPF 
entitlements will be limited to per capita rates of increase in the 
GNP minus 3 per cent. We continue to play little games in the 
funding component of our health system.
<P>
	Instead of just health and post-secondary education in the 
block transfers, government has added welfare into the block. 
From an article on April 13 in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> entitled 
``Ottawa is trying to heal health-care strife'', by Edward 
Greenspon, he says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Part of the logic of lumping the three programs into a single fund was to allow 
Ottawa to blur their minds of where cuts fell and to pass to the provinces the hot 
potato of how to distribute the pain.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Further along in the same article, he goes on to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Figures in the budget show that Ottawa will, in fact, reduce its cash transfers 
over the next three years to $10.3 billion from $17 billion, a rollback of almost 40 
per cent. And the government has given no assurances of when it will end.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Federal funding in support of health insurance and services 
should be unconditional and should recognize different levels of 
economic development in the provinces.
<P>
	The federal government has established five fundamental 
principles via the Health Care Act. It needs to be looked at from 
the point of view of interpretation. It is a little ambiguous in that 
the government can interpret it one way and the provinces can 
see a different interpretation. We also need to look at whether we 
actually need the cash component of the EPF as a whip to keep 
the provinces in line. Is that really necessary?
<P>
	In the article to which I made reference, I beg the question 
whether it is actually necessary to have that kind of control over 
the provinces. If one decentralizes it into the provincial area, the 
people will rise up and say what they want. If they are not happy 
with what they are getting, especially if they have the five 
guiding principles from the national government to make some 
sort of evaluation judgment, they will rise up and tell their 
government to spend their health care dollars with less waste or 
they can vote the government out and get one which will provide 
the services.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	Put the control there. Let the provinces establish the methods 
of providing health care according to the five basic principles, 
and define them a little better so they are not ambiguous 
interpretations, and let the people judge whether they are 
satisfied.
<P>
	In the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> on May 1 an article entitled, ``Time for a 
tonic'' stated: ``The provinces-are demanding more leeway in 
controlling their costs. And increasingly, provincial cost-cut-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12567"> 12567 </A></B>
<P>
ting measures are running afoul of the federal government's 
reading of the Canada Health Act''.
<P>
	To my mind the word ``leeway'' in that article is very 
suggestive of flexibility. The provinces are asking for 
flexibility. The article also makes reference to the government's 
reading of the act. That could be interpreted as suggesting 
different methods of interpreting how one can read the act; the 
federal government reads it one way and the provinces may read 
it another way. That again points to the need for revision of the 
act, allowing for broader and more flexible definitions. At the 
same time the need for using the cash payment as the whip 
should be addressed.
<P>
	The government must do something concrete and substantial. 
It must take some positive action to preserve the health care 
system for Canadians. It has been stated it is a priority of the 
government by both the Prime Minister and the health minister. 
However, when we consider the financial threats which our 
health care system is facing and the lack of action by the 
government to diminish those threats we wonder what kind of a 
priority it is.
<P>
	The most apparent action to date has been on a reactive or 
defensive basis. With respect to the user fee situation in British 
Columbia and the private clinic situation in Alberta, the 
government's action was based on its interpretation of the 
ambiguous accessibility clause of the health care act That has to 
be addressed. So far that is the most assertive or aggressive type 
of behaviour we have seen from the government in relation to 
health and it has been in a defensive mode.
<P>
	Other actions taken by the government tend to leave us 
confused and without a sense of direction. It campaigned in 
1993 on no cuts to health care. During its first year in office it 
continued to say that it would protect the health care funding to 
Canadians. However, earlier this year we started hearing things 
like ``cuts to social programs, including medicare. We have to 
address all social programs. If they are all going to be cut, then 
health care will be rolled in there with them''.
<P>
	We also heard the system needs to be reformed, that there are 
problems with the health act and those problems must be 
addressed. We also heard from various ministers the provinces 
should be given more flexibility to manage their affairs.
<P>
<B>(1125 ) </B>
<P>
	Block funding was set up, including the three components: 
health, post-secondary education and welfare. This is being 
sold, to my mind, as an opportunity for provinces to have more 
flexibility but in a sort of backhanded way. They are given less 
money and then told they have three components where they can 
be flexible applying that money.
<P>
	That is not what we are saying in our flexibility plan. It is what 
the government is trying to sell when it says that flexibility must 
be given to the provinces. I think it was Ted Byfield who said we 
have inflexible flexibility, which is basically what we are 
looking at here.
<P>
	Reformers believe that the provinces are fully capable of 
providing quality health care to their residents as long as they 
are allowed the stable funding to do so. They need the resources. 
A workman is only as good as the tools he has.
<P>
	The leader of the Reform Party said it best in Toronto last 
November to the Ontario Hospital Association. I would like to 
quote him. ``It is the provinces, not the federal government, that 
have the constitutional jurisdiction to operate on our health care 
system. It is the provinces, not the federal government, that 
provide the bulk of health care funding. And it is the provinces, 
not the federal government, that have the greatest experience in 
health care delivery''.
<P>
	I suggest a prescription. If the decision is to devolve health 
care to the provinces what does this mean in a detailed type of 
prescription? I would like to make three suggestions: first, 
transfer tax room to the provinces; second, define core health 
services; and third, amend the Canada Health Act with those 
things in place on a national basis. The provinces would have the 
guidelines and authority to get on and provide a health care 
program that we can not only afford but want as well.
<P>
	The Reform Party taxpayer budget outlined how we could 
decentralize health care by ceding addition tax room to the 
provinces. This would ensure more stable funding for provincial 
health care over time. The provinces would not have to worry 
about what new legislation, steps or cuts the federal government 
would be making from year to year or the interpretation that 
each different government would make to the various 
components of the health act.
<P>
	At the end of the process of the transferring tax room, 
provinces would present the revenue levels and flexibility 
necessary to fund health care according to the demands of the 
electorate and within fiscal restraints.
<P>
	Decentralization of health care would ensure that services 
were delivered and funded by the level of government closest to 
the people. I made reference to that earlier.
<P>
	From the point of view of defining-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The member's 20-minute 
period is up. I wonder if she might give us some indication of 
how much more time she might need to conclude her remarks, 
and I say this respectfully, as the mover of the motion. Will the 
member for Surrey North give us some indication whether she 
could summarize and close within the next minute or so? I am 
very reluctant to cut off anyone who moves a motion, but the 
rules are very clear that the mover has 20 minutes.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Bridgman:</B> I will be about a minute, Mr. Speaker.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12568"> 12568 </A></B>
<P>
	In conclusion, I proposed this motion because the federal 
government seems unwilling to address the fundamental 
problems facing health care in Canada: declining federal 
financing, combined with the lack of provincial 
manoeuvrability. The government has ruled out amending the 
Health Care Act and the minister has portrayed herself as a 
defender of it and thus medicare. This is not so and we must 
defend it.
<P>
<B>(1130 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure today to speak to 
the motion of the hon. member for Surrey North. I have worked 
with her on the standing committee on health and have great 
respect for her thoughtfulness.
<P>
	The hon. member raised the issue of more flexibility for the 
provinces. The provinces already have flexibility. The 
provinces are responsible for managing the whole system of 
health care for people in their provinces. The flexibility depends 
on the needs of their people. The provinces decide where the 
services go, how they are done and by whom and the payment for 
people who deliver those services. They have all the flexibility 
they need within the parameters of the Canada Health Act and 
within the parameters of the five principles of medicare which 
the member has just agreed that she supports wholeheartedly.
<P>
	The member said that she supports those five principles. Then 
in the next sentence she said that she disagreed with them 
because she does not like what they mean. How can one support 
the principles and then not like what they mean? It is inherent 
that a principle means something. I find that a little confusing.
<P>
	Those five principles have helped our health care system to 
become one of the best systems in the world. If we want to judge 
the best systems in the world, we should judge them by the 
outcomes. Canada ranks second or third in the world depending 
on how we look at the outcomes of some of those services. 
Canada has one of the best health care systems in the world. That 
is not only in terms of mortality, how people live or die, but also 
the quality of their lives. This defines the kind of system we 
have. We stand tall in terms of our health care system.
<P>
	The member talks about problems of accessibility. 
Accessibility has made our system what it is. Accessibility 
means that as Canadians we all have access to health care 
services when we need them, regardless of the size of our 
wallets. That is probably the single most important thing about 
our health care system that makes it unique. The size of a 
person's wallet does not dictate the kind of health care received 
or the kind of health care we have access to. The only thing that 
dictates the kind of health care received is the clinical 
symptoms, depending on whether it is needed, how urgently, and 
when and how much is needed at the time. A very appropriate 
way to deal with health care services is to define them according 
to clinical methods rather than pocketbooks.
<P>
	The member also talked about problems of portability. The 
whole idea is that Canada is one country and this is a national 
system and Canadians move across borders daily, weekly and 
yearly. Our parents may live in one province, our children in 
another and our grandchildren in another. The fact that we can 
move across the country knowing that we have health care 
coverage when we get sick no matter where we are in the country 
is one of the most important strengths of the Canada Health Act 
and of medicare. To ask that portability be removed and try to 
balkanize medicare would do the country a great disservice. It 
would destroy the strength of the program.
<P>
	The member also said there are decreases in funding of 
programs. Every reputable study done around the world tells us 
that money is not the major and only criteria for a good system 
of health care. If it were, the United States would have the best 
health care system in the world but it does not. At the moment 
Japan has the best health care system in the world according to 
outcomes and it spends the least amount of money on health 
care. Money is not the only criterion. There is also how and 
when the service is delivered.
<P>
	Eventually we must look at issues like health promotion, 
prevention, the quality of life, poverty, and other things that 
define health care. Those are the things we need to look at, not 
costs. All of us know and all the studies tell us that we could 
spend a lot less money on our health care system. If we provided 
proper services and managed them appropriately we could have 
an even better health care system.
<P>
	When we talk about accessibility and outcomes, let us look 
again at the United States where there are such poor outcomes. 
The United States spends the most of any country in the world in 
percentage of GDP on health care and it has the worst outcomes 
of any developed country. In fact, the United States sits among 
the developing countries somewhere between Cuba and 
Czechoslovakia in terms of its outcomes.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	I do not understand what the member means when she talks 
about the fact that she disagrees with these issues because they 
are not borne out by fact nor by statistics.
<P>
	The member is also concerned about the health and social 
transfer, the fact it has become one massive block fund and that 
it is a negative thing. This strengthens and interdigitates 
services that rely upon each other. We know poverty is one of the 
major determinants of health. It stands to reason that in a block 
transfer, social assistance should be lumped alongside and close 
to health. If we are going to concentrate on prevention then one 
of the issues we are going to have look at is the issue of poverty 
and how people should live in this country to give them a better 
health status.
<P>
	Another thing the member says is that she wishes the Canada 
Health Act would recognize the different economic 
development of provinces. We do. It already does. When we 
look at transfer payments and  equalization payments it is built 
in to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12569"> 12569 </A></B>
<P>
ensure that provinces which are not as wealthy as others have 
been brought up to a level at which they can provide these 
services.
<P>
	I do not understand what the hon. member is concerned about 
when all of these things are already being addressed in the 
system of medicare and within the Canada Health Act.
<P>
	Decentralizing, as the hon. member suggests, will give us less 
control and will completely decrease, diminish and eventually 
kill medicare.
<P>
	The hon. member talked about evaluation. That is exactly 
what the Canada Health Act does. It evaluates the system to see 
whether or not it does follow the five principles of health care. 
Again, I am a little confused as I try to understand what the 
member wants when these things are already in existence. 
Perhaps the member is not familiar with what these things really 
mean.
<P>
	The provinces are asking for more flexibility. The whole 
Canada health and social transfer has been made to give the 
provinces more flexibility. The provinces already have total and 
complete flexibility in how they deliver services.
<P>
	For example, not one single principle or clause of the Canada 
Health Act prevents innovation and renewal of the health care 
system which is what we are talking about today when we talk 
about the health care system. It allows the greatest flexibility.
<P>
	If we look at some of the other provinces like British 
Columbia, it is moving closer to home. New Brunswick has 
closed down hospitals and brought community care to the 
forefront. Ontario is looking at regionalization and is looking at 
how it can provide services in different ways.
<P>
	Some provinces provide different providers to give care and 
other provinces do not. Who gives care, when they give care, 
where they give care, how they give care is completely under the 
jurisdiction of the provinces. Therefore, the hon. member 
perhaps needs to reconsider her motion and wonder if she is 
asking for things that are not already built into the system.
<P>
	The strength of this system is that the provinces can manage a 
system and deliver the care. They are able to respond better in 
terms of practical availability to the needs of their own regions. 
Within each province there are differences between regions 
including the urban and rural regions whose needs are very 
different. Provinces have the ability to do all of that.
<P>
	The only thing the federal government does is to enshrine the 
five principles within the Canada Health Act which says this is 
one country. We will all have certain principles that will ensure 
every Canadian has access to health care regardless of ability to 
pay and regardless of how chronically ill they are or what 
genetic illnesses they have. All of that does not make any 
difference to the quality of health care or their access to it.
<P>
	In the United States it does happen. Those who have a chronic 
disease are uninsurable. No matter how wealthy they are, they 
cannot buy insurance. That does not happen in this country. The 
strength of this country is the fact that each province does what 
it does best in its own local way, providing good services for the 
community. At the same time the federal government ensures 
medicare, which is the heart and soul of what Canada is, is kept 
sacrosanct across the country so we can continue to have 
universal, accessible, portable, comprehensive and publicly 
administered health care.
<P>
	If we listen to the member's motion, actually she does agree 
with the system the way it is.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome this opportunity to speak to the House for the next few 
minutes and comment on the motion presented by the hon. 
member for Surrey North. The motion seeks greater flexibility 
and thus greater autonomy for the provinces in the provision of 
health insurance.
<P>
	For some time now, the Canadian health care system has been 
at the centre of a wideranging debate on its current, disturbing 
state, its uncertain future and indeed its very survival. There are 
many who maintain that our health care system has reached a 
critical point in is history. We on this side of the House deplore 
the fact that Canada's Department of Health is consciously 
absent from the debate, since we believe that the main cause of 
the sorry state of health care in this country is the federal 
government's decision to make drastic cuts in funding.
<P>
	We must not forget that federal cutbacks in health care 
funding have serious consequences for the public finances of 
Quebec and other provinces. Quebec Finance Minister Jean 
Campeau told Quebecers last week about the impact of federal 
offloading on Quebec's commitments, commitments the Quebec 
government cannot ignore. The federal government, however, is 
doing just that, with predictable consequences for the provinces.
<P>
	The federal government saved several billion dollars at the 
provinces' expense by unilaterally imposing a freeze on transfer 
payments for health care.
<P>
	Moreover, in the last budget, Minister Martin made it very 
clear that the government would continue to save money at the 
provinces' expense by cutting $2.5 billion in 1995-96 and about 
$4.5 billion in 1997-98.
<P>
	By the end of 1998, $8 billion will have been cut since 1982. 
And people are surprised to see Minister Rochon cutting mil-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12570"> 12570 </A></B>
<P>
lions of dollars in order to be able to keep providing health care 
services. Eight billion dollars, Mr. Speaker, can you imagine? 
What can the provinces do in the face of this kind of offloading?
<P>
	It should come as no surprise that a motion is before this 
House, asking the federal government to give the provinces 
more flexibility so they can decide how to meet the challenge of 
providing adequate care services to their people.
<P>
	Members of the Bloc Quebecois cannot support this motion 
because we feel this would let the government off the hook for 
the harm it is doing to the entire system. It would be too easy.
<P>
	It has been some time since the federal government met the 
commitments it made to its provincial partners in 1977. Today, 
however, we are being asked only to seek more flexibility 
which, at best, would mean privatizing certain services or 
approving the use of private clinics and double billing.
<P>
	For us there is only one solution: the federal government must 
withdraw altogether from this provincial jurisdiction and give 
the provinces fair compensation in the form of tax points.
<P>
	It is clear that the federal government has reneged on its 
initial commitments to the provinces. It is also clear that by 
continuing to apply its standards to an area that falls under 
provincial jurisdiction, while refusing to pay the real cost, the 
federal government is like someone who asks you out to dinner 
and leaves you with the bill.
<P>
	Although at the time it was very critical of the policy initiated 
by the previous Conservative government, the present 
government is accelerating the advent across Canada of a 
two-tier health care system, with on one side, basic services 
covered by medicare and on the other, specialized care and 
advanced technology available to those who can afford it. This 
means waiting lists for some, but no waiting if you can afford to 
pay.
<P>
	Without comprehensive reform and the vision that is 
necessary for a balanced health care system, excessive funding 
cuts will set the new standard for the health care system.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	They can promise deep reforms all they want, and a national 
forum presided over by none other than the Prime Minister, it 
will mean nothing until they go beyond those empty promises.
<P>
	The problem is that the Minister of Finance could not wait to 
impose his reforms. In addition, just like his predecessors, he 
coupled his unilateral, insidious and heavy cuts with mandatory 
health care system reforms.
<P>
	You would have to be naïve not to realize that the Canada 
social transfer is just a veiled attempt to slash funding for 
education, social assistance and health. You would also have to 
be naïve to believe the Minister of Health when she says that the 
Canada social transfer will actually ensure that the health care 
system stays the way it is, yet give Quebec and the provinces 
more room to manoeuvre. How can the minister actually say 
such things, and believe them?
<P>
	Let us be serious now; there is a paradox in the federal 
government talking about giving Quebec and the provinces 
more room to manoeuvre so that they can dispense quality 
health care services yet all the while continuing to increase the 
burden placed on the public finances of the provinces.
<P>
	In 1977, when the federal government created the Canada 
Health Act, it agreed to assume 50 per cent of the cost of 
maintaining the health insurance system. Over the years, we 
have seen that contribution shrink to 38 per cent. Betraying the 
campaign promises made in the red book, the current 
government would reduce its share to 28.5 per cent.
<P>
	The federal government still does not understand that all of 
these years of offloading to the provinces has aggravated their 
financial situations as much as it has jeopardized the survival of 
social programs. What is more is that by imposing overlaps in 
areas that its own constitution does not give it powers, and by 
continuing to cut funding, the federal government is preventing 
Quebec and the provinces from finding real solutions to the 
financial crisis they are fighting.
<P>
	As many studies have shown, the federal government's 
financial intransigence is propelling our health care system 
towards radical changes. Nevertheless, Quebec and the 
provinces are all trying to come up with solutions to forestall the 
disappearance of the current quality standards.
<P>
	The very essence of the motion before us today bears witness 
to the will of Quebecers and Canadians to pull out all stops to 
find a solution. Everybody is working towards this goal, except 
the centralist government which refuses to live by its own 
constitution and to respect the provinces' exclusive power over 
health care.
<P>
	What is sad, and history proves it, is that the federal 
government has always had the same ambition: being the only 
government in Canada.
<P>
	In conclusion, the Bloc Quebecois cannot support the Reform 
Party's motion. Although this motion supports certain 
principles that we defend and denounces to a certain point the 
federal government's unilateral pull-out from the Canada 
Health Act, the contract it signed with the provinces in 1977, it 
does not get to the crux of the matter.
<P>
	In our opinion, the provinces should be the only operators in 
the area of health care. From parliamentary commissions to 
consultations of all kinds, Quebec and the provinces have 
demonstrated that they are capable of rising to the health care 
challenge. If only the government would stop penalizing them 
with cut after cut without any financial compensation, they 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12571"> 12571 </A></B>
<P>
would be able to guarantee dignified health care services which 
treat people with respect. That is the real solution.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak in support of private member's Motion No. 
424, tabled by my colleague from Surrey North.
<P>
	The motion is straightforward. It asks that the government 
allow the provinces greater flexibility in the delivery of health 
services. The motion before us recognizes that we have reached 
a watershed in health care funding in Canada. The old system is 
becoming increasingly unsustainable as federal and provincial 
governments groan under the weight of a $72 billion doctors' 
bill.
<P>
<B>(1150 ) </B>
<P>
	The challenge facing these governments, which the hon. 
member for Surrey North addresses in the motion, is how to 
reduce funding without threatening the fundamental principle of 
medicare, which is that no Canadian will be denied access to 
health care based on an inability to pay. What we now have to 
ask ourselves is how this can best be done. I believe that Motion 
No. 424 identifies the proper course.
<P>
	Before discussing the motion, I would first like to provide you 
with an explanation of how the health care funding crisis came 
to pass. The starting point in all of this is to acknowledge that 
health care falls exclusively under provincial jurisdiction. No 
one disputes that fact. The only reason the federal government is 
involved at all in the funding of health care is that 30 years ago it 
promised the provinces it would pay 50 per cent of the tab if they 
played by some of the rules. The culmination of this dollars for 
influence funding arrangement was the Canada Health Act, 
which was passed in 1984.
<P>
	While the Canada Health Act may have been enacted with the 
best of intentions, it effectively restricted the ability of 
provincial governments to innovate and experiment in 
delivering health services. Creative ideas and efforts in cost 
control were automatically excluded from consideration. The 
straitjacket of the Canada Health Act was not so onerous to the 
provinces when the federal government was paying up to 50 
cents of every provincial health care dollar. However, beginning 
in 1977 the federal share of health care spending began to 
decline. First the government shifted to a block grant, then it 
imposed restrictions on the grant's rate of growth, and finally, in 
the last budget, the federal government announced that the cash 
portion of the grant would be reduced by 39 per cent over three 
years.
<P>
	Today the federal share of health care spending in Canada has 
shrunk from 50 per cent to only 24 per cent. The cash portion of 
that share is only $7 billion, which is 10 per cent of the $72 
billion we will spend on health care this year alone.
<P>
	In coping with cuts of this magnitude the provincial 
governments face three stark choices: they can try to make up 
the lost federal dollars by raising their own revenue; they can cut 
the level of quality of their health care services; or they can find 
newer, leaner ways of providing the level of services 
constituents deserve. Clearly, the first two are not options. 
Provincial governments are just as financially strapped as is the 
federal government. Raising taxes simply is not a viable 
solution any longer. Indiscriminately slashing programs is not 
an option either. The only realistic avenue open to the provinces 
is to come up with new ways of providing these services more 
cheaply, more quickly, and better than before. However, the 
Canada Health Act is standing in their way. The provinces do not 
have sufficient flexibility and freedom to institute the kinds of 
reforms that can put medicare back on a sound financial putting.
<P>
	This places the ball back in the federal government's court. It 
has two options: either continue to insist on preserving the rigid 
interpretation of the Canada Health Act, in which case Ottawa 
will have to resume picking up 50 per cent of the cost, or amend 
and reinterpret the act to give the provinces the freedom they 
need in order to meet the funding challenges ahead. No party can 
pretend that the first is a realistic option. The federal 
government cannot now nor will it ever again be able to pick up 
half the tab of medicare as it exists today. Health care consumes 
10 per cent of our nation's GDP, a greater proportion than any 
other nation except for the United States.
<P>
	What this motion is saying is that the federal government can 
no longer have it both ways. The longer we insist on having it 
both ways the greater the chance that our national health care 
system will collapse under its own weight. The only realistic 
course of action is the one this motion recommends; that is, 
giving the provinces the ability to redesign their health care 
services, allowing them to experiment and to improve on old 
ways of doing things, and ultimately letting the voters of each 
province decide how much health care they are willing to pay 
for. This is the approach taken by Reform.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	What we have said in our blue book and what we have 
reiterated in the taxpayers budget is that a Reform government 
would provide unconditional federal funding in support of 
health care services. While our taxpayers budget proposed 
reducing current funding levels by $800 million, it also included 
a pledge to turn over to the provinces additional tax points, 
which would grow along with the economy.
<P>
	What the present health care debate comes down to is the 
question of trust. Reform is saying that provincial governments 
can be trusted to uphold the fundamental principle of Canadian 
health care: that nobody will be denied adequate health care 
based on inability to pay. By refusing to amend or reinterpret the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12572"> 12572 </A></B>
<P>
Canada Health Act,  this Liberal government is effectively 
saying that the provinces cannot be trusted to uphold this 
principle.
<P>
	My question for the government is this. Why on earth can the 
provinces not be trusted? After all, medicare was not dreamed 
up in Ottawa. It originated from one province experimenting 
with new and better ways of caring for its people. Medicare 
itself was born precisely because the federal government of the 
day provided provincial governments like Saskatchewan with 
flexibility in the field of health services.
<P>
	I would also ask the government why it questions the 
provinces' commitment to health care at a time when the federal 
government itself is steadily reducing its own share of the 
burden. Cash transfers for health amount to less than 6 per cent 
of total federal program spending. Yet the provinces typically 
devote between 30 and 40 per cent of their budgets to health 
care.
<P>
	Who are the true guardians of health care in this country? It 
would seem to me it is the provinces. From a more pragmatic 
viewpoint, why would this government doubt for a moment that 
the voters of any province would allow a provincial government 
to undermine the fundamental principles of medicare?
<P>
	In closing, I would like to point out that the governments 
closest to the people are held closest to account. Ultimately, in a 
democratic society it is the people who should decide how a 
province fulfils its constitutional duty to provide health care 
services, not a federal bureaucracy.
<P>
	I hope everyone will give their support to Motion No. 424.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I an indeed pleased to be able to participate in this 
debate. I personally believe very strongly in the principles of 
medicare and I know that they are also of great importance to 
people not only in my own riding but across the country.
<P>
	The Canada Health Act is a brief, simple act. It sets out the 
five principles: public administration, universality, 
accessibility, portability, and comprehensiveness. It has a few 
definitions and deals briefly with penalties for failure to achieve 
these principles. It does not, could not, and should not set out 
how provinces operate their systems.
<P>
	The preamble of the Canada Health Act is clear on this. 
Provinces are free to build their own systems within the broad 
framework of the Canada Health Act.
<P>
	The guiding principle of medicare has long been that 
Canadians' health and access to quality care should not depend 
upon their financial means. In 1984 the Canada Health Act was 
introduced by a Liberal government and passed unanimously. 
The preamble of the Canada Health Act recognizes that 
``Continued access to quality health care without financial or 
other barriers will be critical to maintaining and improving the 
health and well-being of Canadians''. This concept is also 
brought out as the primary objective in Canadian health care  
policy: ``to protect, promote and restore the physical and mental 
well-being of residents of Canada and to facilitate reasonable 
access to health services without financial or other barriers, as 
described in section 3 of the act''. It is within this framework 
that I wish to address the motion before us today.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	Contrary to what some members in the House would have us 
believe, the government does not have a rigid view of how 
health care should be organized in Canada. The provinces 
already have a large degree of flexibility in the organization and 
provision of health insurance and health services. They have had 
this flexibility for many years. The only conditions the federal 
government assigns are that the provinces respect the 
requirements of the Canada Health Act.
<P>
	Within the requirements provinces can experiment and 
change the way they deliver care, and many have been doing so. 
Nothing in the Canada Health Act limits the flexibility of 
provinces to realign the delivery and organization of their health 
care systems. Almost all provinces have embarked over the last 
few years on major reforms of their health systems.
<P>
	The public administration criterion of the Canada Health Act 
presents a good example of the flexibility inherent in the act 
both in the provision of health insurance and in the delivery of 
health services by the provinces. The criterion applies to 
provincial health insurance plans and not to the administration 
of individual components of the health care system such as 
hospitals. This means, for instance, that private sector 
management of publicly owned hospitals is permitted. In 
addition the criterion allows administration authority of a 
provincial health insurance plan to be delegated to an agency if 
that is the wish.
<P>
	Another example of flexibility inherent within the Canada 
Health Act relates to hospital services. These services are not 
directly tied to an institutional setting. Thus it is permissible for 
acute care to be provided in the community in a patient's home, 
for instance. It is always the provinces, not the federal 
government, that determine which services will be given in 
which setting.
<P>
	The extramural hospital in New Brunswick is an example of 
provincial use of the flexibility. Under the program the patient is 
formally admitted to the acute care program. However, all 
required services are brought to the patient's home and not to the 
most expensive operating unit within the hospital structure 
called the emergency ward.
<P>
	I emphasize, however, that the government recognizes the 
need for flexibility. On other hand it will not compromise on the 
fundamental values upon which the Canada Health Act and 
medicare in Canada are based. We are and we will continue to be 
flexible in our approach to health care, but we will not permit 
financial barriers to impede access to health services. If 
flexibility means turning our health care system into a private 
one  that profits from the misfortunes of Canadians, the 
government 
<P>

<B><A NAME="12573"> 12573 </A></B>
<P>
wants no part in it. We will not tolerate direct charges to patients 
for medically necessary care.
<P>
	During this period of constraint creative processes are being 
produced by creative individuals in every province in handling 
these fiscal problems. There are solutions and money can be 
managed much more effectively than it is at the present time.
<P>
	One of the most cherished services enjoyed by Canadians is 
the health care system. Health care issues constantly rank as 
number one across a variety of polls. The federal government is 
the ultimate torch bearer of the one of the last truly national 
programs. The central government, therefore, is morally 
obliged to defend the Canada Health Act against policies that 
seek to destroy it.
<P>
	I believe as do many Canadians that the Canada Health Act 
should be kept as it is. Undoubtedly any changes to the 
fundamental principles upon which health insurance is founded 
would cripple the most notable gains attained by the Canadian 
health care system.
<P>
	We need only look south of the border to realize how fortunate 
we are to enjoy the health services we do. In the United States 
approximately 35 million people are without adequate health 
coverage. Health care horror stories abound south of the 49th 
parallel. Even Americans who have medical insurance can be hit 
by very high medical bills. In some cases, because of poor 
family coverage, if a family member has a serious illness or an 
accident the extra bills can be financially devastating. Moreover 
American company medical insurance plans lock many 
Americans into their jobs. This is because once a person 
develops a chronic illness no other insurance company will 
provide insurance at reasonably affordable rates.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	Certainly wealthy Americans can receive the finest possible 
health care. However this is certainly not the case for the middle 
and lower socioeconomic classes. It is interesting that the 
opposition in the House is advocating a very similar system to 
that of the Americans.
<P>
	Some detractors of our health care system indicate that we can 
no longer afford medicare in its present form as a result of our 
fiscal situation. However most health economists agree that it is 
not our medicare policy in and of itself we can no longer afford, 
but the inefficiencies in the manner in which medicare is 
implemented and delivered.
<P>
	Significant improvements could be made in a number of areas 
without compromising national standards. For example, the 
unbridled growth of unproven and costly new medical 
technology has ballooned health care costs without any apparent 
return on the money spent. Another problem pertains to the 
manner in which drug prices have skyrocketed over the recent 
past. As well it appears supply and distribution of our medical 
manpower need improvement.
<P>
	These are but a few of the areas where efficiencies, if 
introduced, could reduce the cost of delivering health care in 
Canada. Above all, provinces must listen to those who deliver 
and maintain health care services as well as those who receive 
the services. Although some problems exist we must do what we 
can to improve the system without destroying it. In a nutshell, 
the difficulties facing our health care system are the result of 
unlimited demands upon a limited pool of resources.
<P>
	I feel compelled to rise today before the House to speak 
against a motion that would ultimately lead to the dismantling of 
the health care system that is dear to the hearts of many 
Canadians. In sum, Canadians demand and expect direction 
from the federal government for the preservation of our most 
sacred national program. The government has a moral right and 
the legal authority to ensure that this is the case. That is why we 
must vote against the motion before us today.
<P>

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am pleased to open debate on Bill C-89, an act to 
commercialize the Canadian National Railway.
<P>
	This is an historic occasion, one that marks a very clear 
turning point in the history of transportation in Canada. In 1923 
the federal government completed the amalgamation and 
takeover of five privately run railways: the Grand Trunk, the 
Grand Trunk Pacific, Canadian Northern, the Transcontinental 
and the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12574"> 12574 </A></B>
<P>
Intercolonial. CNR was the result. With the help of the deep 
pockets of Canadian taxpayers, CN grew into what it is today.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	Rail is not the only transportation method available now. Our 
shippers have other choices: the trucking industry, which has 
taken on a large part of the business; air freight; or through the 
seaway and the Great Lakes by ship. There is potential for strong 
competition in transportation in Canada, which is absolutely 
essential in any modern economy.
<P>
	The legislation is part of our government's intention to have 
the private sector operate in areas where it can do the job best. 
The Minister of Finance said in the budget last February:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Our view is straightforward, if government does not need to run something it 
should not, and in the future it will not.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[Translation] 
<P>
	Under this bill, 100 per cent of the government's share in CN 
will be sold in a public offering. All Canadians, including CN 
employees, will have a chance to buy shares. A maximum of 15 
per cent of shares may be held by any one individual or 
company; there will, however, be no restriction on foreign 
investors.
<P>
	CN employees will continue in their current positions in the 
new CN, and their pensions will be protected under the Pension 
Benefits Standards Act. A standard stock savings plan will be 
offered to CN employees to encourage their participation in the 
new company.
<P>
	The Head Office will remain in Montreal, and the Official 
Languages Act will continue to apply to CN employees. These 
provisions will have not impact on CN's ``saleability'', because 
they have both been in place for a long time and have served the 
CN and its customers well.
<P>
	We believe that putting CN on a solid and viable financial 
footing is the best way to ensure that it will be able to maintain 
coast to coast rail service. CN must have every opportunity to 
compete fairly and aggressively with all its competitors, 
primarily, the trucking industry, CP Rail and the U.S. railroads.
<P>
	To achieve these objectives, we have struck a balance between 
the obligations we wish to impose on the new company and the 
negative effects these could have on both the viability of CN and 
on the value of our equity.
<P>
	The size of the public offering of CN stock is the largest in 
Canadian history and makes this balance a very delicate one. We 
need to be careful about imposing too many restrictions on CN. 
We must attract international investors, especially those in the 
U.S., with positive experience in rail investment. We want to 
ensure that the CN is free to function and finance its operations 
as its competitors do.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is not our intention to impose onerous foreign ownership 
and service obligations on the new CN that do not apply to CP. 
We want to make sure that control of CN is broadly based so that 
no single individual or company controls more than 15 per cent 
of the shares.
<P>
	CN has to be put on a sound financial footing. To achieve this, 
CN's current debt of $2.5 billion will have to be reduced to 
approximately $1.5 billion. CN's debt will have to be reduced to 
a level where it will receive an investment grade rating similar 
to that of its main Canadian and U.S. competitors. Our goal is to 
have CN in a capital position that would allow for at least a BBB 
bond rating.
<P>
	The company is expected to raise funds to reduce debt prior to 
the sale by selling assets such as CN Exploration, which it has 
recently done, and the Scribe hotel in France which is currently 
being marketed. CN is also currently pursuing the sale of 
CANAC and its AMF maintenance shops in Montreal as well as 
some leasehold interests. CN's Canadian non-rail assets are not 
part of the deal. They will be retained by the crown. Our 
intention is to put the new company in a competitive position, 
not to tip the level of the playing field in CN's favour.
<P>
	The legislation represents the government's firm 
commitment that both the company and the taxpayer must be 
treated fairly when the shares go to market. We have put 
together a unique structure to manage what will be the largest 
initial public offering in Canadian business history.
<P>
	We have an agreement with three investment banks, 
ScotiaMcLeod Inc., Goldman, Sachs and Company of New York 
and Nesbitt Burns Inc., to form a consortium for the purposes of 
leading the deal. The arrangement will allow the Government of 
Canada and CN to draw on the resources and experience of these 
institutions in the decision making process.

<P>
	Competition and a viable railroad system from coast to coast 
is burdened by the current regulatory environment. It is my 
intention to present to the House legislation that will chart the 
way to major reforms of our regulatory regime before summer. 
The legislation will provide the regulatory framework for the 
future of transportation in Canada. It will encourage the creation 
of short line railways and it will provide for real competition.
<P>
	The regulatory process will ensure there will be no 
abandonment of service unless no one, private sector or 
government, wishes to take up the line. That will be the most 
obvious benefit of the reform but it will go much further. It will 
also provide the framework to allow all modes of transportation 
to perform efficiently and effectively without needless 
government intervention.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12575"> 12575 </A></B>
<P>
	The aim is to put in place the framework for integrated 
transportation based on a policy that is  consistent, transparent 
and fair for everyone. Transport Canada will focus its efforts on 
maintaining and improving the world class safety record 
enjoyed by our transportation industry, whether on the surface, 
in the air or on the water.
<P>
	Our transportation system must be modern, dynamic, 
innovative, growing and as unrestricted as possible. We must 
constantly move forward to find newer and better ways to move 
our goods and our people if we are to remain competitive as a 
nation.
<P>
	The air sector has been modernized with a national air force 
policy, open skies, bilateral agreements with the U.S., the 
international air routes policy and the commercialization of the 
air navigation system that will take place in April 1996. We will 
also announce the marine policy initiative the government 
intends to pursue before the end of 1995.
<P>
	I support the motion to refer this legislation to the Standing 
Committee on Transport for review prior to second reading. I 
believe the Standing Committee on Transport will be well able 
to handle this task, as evidenced by the national marine strategy 
report tabled recently by the chairman, the member for 
Hamilton West. I look forward to hearing its suggestions and 
views on this legislation.
<P>
	Over the years successive governments have attempted to 
maintain a reasonable level of competition in our rail 
transportation system. That strategy has only been relatively 
successful. It is time now for the government to withdraw from 
the direct operation of railroads and let the private sector do its 
job. It is time to put the private sector entrepreneurial skills we 
know exist to work to make CN a viable, successful and 
competitive operation.
<P>
	I have every confidence that with this legislation the 
government is taking another step in its commitment to 
providing for an integrated, affordable, viable and competitive 
transportation system in Canada.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before following up on 
the debate, I remind the House the debate will be at the 
maximum 180 minutes-three hours-before the question is 
put. Interventions will be no more than 10 minutes without 
questions or comments.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Bloc Quebecois approves in principle the 
government's proposal to sell CN to private interests. However, 
it has serious reservations about certain provisions of Bill C-89.
<P>
	I will propose amendments to these provisions in committee. 
We object to clauses 8 and 16. We will also recommend an 
amendment to clause 6 regarding CN property that may be 
transferred to the Minister of Transport so that he can put it up 
for sale later.
<P>
	Let us start with clause 8. One purpose-undoubtedly 
laudable-of its seven subsections is to prevent any individual, 
corporation or associate as defined in subsection (4) from 
holding more than 15 per cent of voting shares.
<P>
	Notwithstanding these provisions, subsection (5) allows two 
such associates to disassociate, so to speak, from each other for 
the purposes of the act by submitting a statutory declaration 
stating that they are not acting and will not act in concert with 
respect to their interests in CN.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	Each of the declarants may acquire voting shares up to a 
maximum of 15 per cent as if he or she was not associated with 
the other person. This dispensation, which broadens the pool 
and purchasing power of potential buyers, is probably necessary 
given the size of the operation. However, CN administrators 
must still be able to check if, in fact, declarants comply with the 
terms and conditions of their statutory declarations.
<P>
	We feel that such control would be difficult to exercise in the 
case of foreign buyers. We are therefore proposing an 
amendment under which subsection (5) respecting the statutory 
declaration would be restricted to Canadian buyers. As a result, 
two or more foreign associates will not be able to exceed the 15 
per cent limit by submitting statutory declarations.
<P>
	If clause 8 aimed at preventing an individual or corporate 
takeover of CN must be approved in principle, the same cannot 
be said of clause 16. Regrettably, even in this bill whose 
provisions should have been purely financial in nature, the 
government could not resist, once again, one of its old demons: 
trying to invade an area of provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	Clause 16 may appear harmless. It reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(1) The railway and other transportation works in Canada of CN, of every 
subsidiary of CN and of every corporation formed by any consolidation or 
amalgamation of any two or more of those corporations are hereby declared to 
be works for the general advantage of Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The catch is that, once they are declared to be for the general 
advantage of Canada, these works will be subject to federal 
legislation. If CN reaches a joint ownership agreement with a 
short-line railway, this railway will shift from provincial to 
federal jurisdiction, as suggested in the Nault report, we should 
point out. And the deed will be done.
<P>
	Not only is the principle of this federal encroachment on a 
provincial jurisdiction unacceptable, but so are the economics 
of it, as we all know that one of the main reasons short-line 
railways can operate on sections considered non profitable by 
major companies is that they are not subject to cumbersome 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12576"> 12576 </A></B>
<P>
federal railway regulations. Short-line railways need the 
operating flexibility provincial regulations give them, at least in 
Quebec.
<P>
	This federal initiative is therefore likely to discourage the 
creation of short-line railways and limit their numbers. We must 
realize that each one of these railways is a section saved from 
abandonment. If the government now interferes with the 
development of short-line railways, this will mean that a larger 
part of the rail network in Quebec and Canada will be 
abandoned. So, we suggest that only interprovincial works of 
CN and its subsidiaries, and not those works which are entirely 
comprised within a province, be declared to be works for the 
general advantage of Canada.
<P>
	Moving on to the intention expressed by the minister to 
purchase and sell separately CN non-railway assets, including 
AMF, a Quebec company. This company employs some 1,300 
people whose jobs could be endangered if the company's ties 
with CN were severed. Under clause 6 of the bill, the minister 
may, while CN is a Crown corporation, direct CN to transfer 
such property. We will move an amendment providing that, 
before selling these companies, the minister, to protect jobs, 
will ensure that they are viable and, if need be, will take steps to 
ensure that they are.
<P>
	To conclude, while agreeing in principle with privatizing CN, 
the Bloc Quebecois cannot help but notice that, far from 
resulting from a rail policy based on the requirements of the 
economy, this transaction pursues the purely budgetary goal of 
bringing in a lot of money very quickly. It is not a rational 
choice. It is a fire sale by a hard-pressed government.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	Pressured by creditors, obsessed by Moody's downgrading of 
its rating, the federal government is putting up for public sale 
one of our crown jewels, a national treasure, because it 
desperately needs money to pay the interest on the accumulated 
debt caused by 20 years of mismanagement. There may be no 
other way out, but what an admission of failure.
<P>
	We are witnessing, stunned by such incompetence and the 
misfortune of being governed by such poor leaders, the decline 
of a government that had its heyday before the current Prime 
Minister began, some 20 years ago, as the then finance minister, 
to dig this bottomless grave into which our national debt is 
dragging us, and the proceeds from the sale of CN will be but a 
shovel full of dirt in this grave.
<P>
	In the face of this failure, how can one resist the temptation of 
comparing the Canadian federal system to a father who has to 
sell the family furniture and silver to pay household bills after 
getting deep into debt because of profligate spending and 
improvidence? No wonder, Mr. Speaker, that we, Quebecers, are 
anxious to get out of the house.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when I made my first speech in the House I stated I was 
not here to oppose for opposition sake. If the government 
brought forward good legislation I would be the first to 
congratulate it. I also stated if I thought the legislation was not 
good I would offer constructive alternatives as to how the 
legislation could be made better. Bill C-89 covers both of these 
situations.
<P>
	There is no denying the primary concept of the bill, to 
privatize CN Rail, is a good move. It is something the Reform 
Party has been pushing for since before the election. I spoke 
strongly in favour of privatization during transport committee 
hearings with the NEWCO concept and again when I made a 
presentation to the all Liberal task force on CN Rail.
<P>
	The tone of the discussions by the members of the all Liberal 
task force raised the concern with me they might not be working 
toward the privatization of CN Rail. I am very pleased to see the 
government finally got around to doing the right thing. It is 
certainly better late than never.
<P>
	In keeping with the first part of my maiden speech, I 
congratulate the government for accepting yet another Reform 
policy. However, as it seems to be a constant pattern with the 
Liberals as they adopt Reform ideas and policies, they lose most 
of the common sense in our ideas when they put their own stamp 
on them. This brings me to the second part of my first speech, 
constructive alternatives needed to make a badly worded 
concept a viable reality.
<P>
	The Reform Party will support Bill C-89 at first reading so it 
can be sent to committee where I hope the government will be as 
receptive to amendments necessary to make this legislation 
work sensibly and fairly as it was in following our idea on the 
concept. In supporting the bill at first reading, I can assure the 
House it is the concept and not the content we are in favour of.
<P>
	With regard to the content, there are many problems I will be 
addressing at committee. Areas of concern include the 
minister's unrestricted power to reduce or even eliminate CN 
Rail's debt. In this there is a potential for disaster for both the 
Canadian taxpayer and the rail transportation industry. If the 
minister plans only to do what is reasonable then he should not 
mind restrictions in the bill to confirm this. If he plans to go 
further than is reasonable then he must be stopped.
<P>
	In the same area of concern is the question of the real estate 
assets of CN Rail being separated from the rail operation to be 
sold. The sale of these assets should be the primary method of 
debt reduction of loans carried by CN Rail. That sale should go 
to the private sector, not from the taxpayer owned corporation to 
a department of the government using the taxpayers' money to 
buy their own assets from themselves. This action would bring 
us to a new height of creative accounting.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12577"> 12577 </A></B>
<P>
	There seems to be some confusion between government 
departments, the Liberal dominated Standing Committee on 
Transport and the minister as to what is really planned. The 
Reform Party is quite prepared to help them sort that out in 
committee.
<P>
	I am also concerned about the section which limits the share 
of purchases to a maximum of 15 per cent of the total shares. In 
marketing the shares of CN Rail to the public there are only two 
types of investors who would look at such an offer. One is the 
common investor made up of individuals, companies or 
investment groups. This type of investor buys shares primarily 
for a return on investment. CN Rail's track record does not 
provide a very rosy picture for this sort of investor unless they 
feel a new private sector operator can run the company much 
more efficiently than it has been run in the past.
<P>
<B>(1230 ) </B>
<P>
	This brings us to the second type of investor: a company or a 
group of individuals who believe they can operate the rail 
company much more efficiently than in the past, thus raising the 
value of their investment. Such an investor would be far less 
likely to invest if they felt they could not purchase a large 
enough portion of the company to ensure that the needed new 
operating efficiencies would be implemented. Let us not kid 
ourselves, the general investors are not going to be lining up to 
purchase a company with such a losing track record as CN Rail 
has had.
<P>
	Two provisions contained in the legislation that would create 
restrictions on a new company when formed are neither common 
to their competitors nor necessary. These two restrictions are the 
requirement to maintain the corporate headquarters in Montreal 
forever and the requirement to maintain the current official 
language policy of the government. It makes no sense to require 
a company to maintain its headquarters in any one city, nor to 
require it to follow any other restrictions that are not followed 
by the rest of their industry. As I said earlier, this company is 
going to be hard enough to market without placing a bunch of 
ill-conceived restrictions in the way of the sale.
<P>
	Other concerns involve items that are not contained in the 
legislation. These include some measure of protection for 
Canadian investors, including individual workers and unions in 
the company. The rail industry in Canada has occupied a special 
part in the building of this country. Many Canadians may want to 
try to be part of the revitalization of one of our national rail 
companies and certainly should be given every opportunity to 
participate. One way to ensure they would have this opportunity 
would be to restrict the sale of shares upon introduction to 
Canadian individuals and companies before opening it up to the 
international market. I know that it will likely take an 
international market to sell off all the shares of CN Rail, but 
what is wrong with offering a little benefit to the Canadian 
people who we are here to represent in the process?
<P>
	Another area to be considered is the suggestion I made in my 
presentation to the all Liberal task force last year. That idea 
involves the consideration of selling only the rolling stock and 
buildings of CN Rail and retaining the track infrastructure to 
form a common rail system that would be open to all railway 
operators on a cost recovery basis. This would include revenue 
from diesel fuel taxes paid by the rail companies. To be 
successful this would have to incorporate CP Rail's track as 
well, but it would not have to be government owned. It could be 
set up as an industry and user operated system, just the same as 
we are in the process of doing in the aviation sector with air 
navigation services. This would open up the track to any rail 
operator, which would greatly enhance the potential for short 
line operators.
<P>
	These are some of the concerns I will be bringing to the 
committee stage of the legislation. The government has shown 
good sense in accepting the concept of Reform policies on this 
issue. I hope the good sense will continue, so that they can also 
accept the amendments necessary to change this from a good 
concept to good legislation.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to participate in the debate on Bill C-89, particularly 
after hearing the objections made by the hon. member for 
Kootenay West-Revelstoke to the CN head office's remaining 
in Montreal. I simply want to thank the hon. member, because he 
is helping us win the upcoming referendum. We often hear 
members from English Canada say that Quebec gets too much 
and that the federal government is too generous with our 
province. It is just incredible to hear such comments.
<P>
	That being said, my purpose is to tell those Canadians who are 
watching us today about this important bill.
<P>
	This will only be a foretaste, if I can put it that way. Indeed, 
the real fight will come in committee, where our party intends to 
condemn this bill. The Minister of Transport will appear before 
committee members tomorrow afternoon, at 3 p.m. We hope that 
he will answer our questions in a more explicit manner than he 
has usually done in the House, where he is arrogant and often 
hurls insults at the opposition.
<P>
	As well, I can hardly wait until Wednesday, when the 
transport committee will welcome CN's president, Paul Tellier, 
the one who benefited from a generous interest-free loan of 
$300,000 to buy a $345,000 house in Westmount. This will be 
my first encounter with Mr. Tellier, since that generous loan was 
granted to him.

<P>
	And now for the most important aspects of this bill. In 
committee, our party, the Bloc Quebecois, will seek 
amendments because of two major objections we have to this 
bill. The first one concerns clause 8. This clause is very 
important because it imposes limits on the total percentage of 
shares that may be owned by a person or a group of persons.
<P>
	Let me tell you about some of my concerns. For instance, I am 
afraid of an indirect U.S. takeover through company affiliates. 
Presumably, the minister or the parliamentary secretary will say 
that they plan to cap the percentage of shares held by Canadian 
or foreign companies at 15 per cent and that this point is very 
well covered. My point is that, as happens from time to time, 
some companies might have certain agreements. I am not 
talking about collusion. Certain agreements might be made 
under the table, as they say where I come from, in order to do 
indirectly what they could not do directly.
<P>
	Clause 8 also contains the provision that CN shall maintain its 
head office in the Montreal urban community. Obviously, Mr. 
Speaker, unlike the Reform Party, our party cannot object to this 
recommendation.
<P>
	Subclause 2 of clause 8 refers to strict provisions that will be 
enforced in the case of non-compliance with the 15 per cent 
limit. Of course, there is no restriction on shares held by the 
Government of Canada.
<P>
	Subclause 4 provides a detailed definition of the term 
associate. The Standing Committee on Transport will have to 
consider this point later on. We find subclause 5 very disturbing 
because it provides for exceptions to subclause 4. That is 
something we will have to discuss in connection with the 15 per 
cent ceiling on ownership of CN shares.
<P>
	Another point that will also gain by further study is the 
provision that the directors of CN shall determine whether 
persons in the group comply with the statements in a statutory 
declaration and are acting independently and not in concert. The 
reason the government included this paragraph is probably that 
it did not want to exclude companies which are part of vast 
financial consortiums with independent subsidiaries from 
becoming shareholders in CN.
<P>
	I will give you an example. Could Bell Canada Enterprises 
buy a 15 per cent share; Northern Telecom, 15 per cent; 
Montreal Trust, 15 per cent; and Bell Canada itself, another 15 
per cent? This would be tantamount to the situation I mentioned 
earlier in which one interest could indirectly achieve what it is 
prohibited from doing directly. The related companies I just 
named could take a 60 per cent share of CN. That is food for 
thought. In itself, this exception is certainly important, but it is 
not particularly worrisome because clause 8 prohibits 
companies from associating to form a controlling interest in CN.
<P>
	Another paragraph of clause 8 defines control. Essentially, 
``control'' means control in any manner that results in control in 
fact, whether directly through the ownership of a majority of 
shares or through negotiations between shareholders. Regarding 
the definition of a voting share in clause 8, I would like to ask 
what is the technical implication of the stipulation that a voting 
share is a share carrying voting rights, including a security 
currently convertible into such a share and currently exercisable 
options and rights to acquire such a share or such a convertible 
security? The Standing Committee on Transport will have to get 
answers to these questions.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	With respect to clause 8, I have set out our party's position 
very clearly for you. The Bloc Quebecois will propose an 
amendment to close the gap we found in the bill.
<P>
	We also strongly disagree with clause 16. We disagree with it 
completely, because we believe it gives the federal government 
the option of getting involved in what we in Quebec call the 
CFILs, local trains, or what the rest of Canada calls short lines.
<P>
	We consider this clause particularly underhanded, because it 
declares Canadian National works and subsidiaries to be works 
for the general advantage of Canada and implies that these 
subsidiaries and works will remain under federal jurisdiction. 
Thus, under any joint ownership agreement CN concludes with 
CFILs, these short lines will come under federal jurisdiction. In 
Quebec, a CFIL was set up for the lines linking the Abitibi and 
the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean regions, where employees 
agreed to operate the CFIL according to an agreement with CN.
<P>
	Therefore, we consider that clause 16 flies in the face of 
CFILs as an intraprovincial form of transportation, one that 
operates within the province, which are thus currently under 
provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	I do not claim to have a monopoly on truth. The people at 
Transport Canada, the minister and Mr. Tellier will tell us the 
opposite, but our understanding of clause 16 is that it will make 
this means of intraprovincial transportation-that is, within the 
province-, currently under provincial jurisdiction, come under 
federal jurisdiction.
<P>
	As you no doubt know, Mr. Speaker, our party, which has 
repeatedly had occasion in this House to reject all the federal 
government's attempts at centralization-what the Prime 
Minister calls flexible federalism-will not let the federal 
government try to lay its hand on this field of provincial 
jurisdiction. In any case, this also came up in the Nault report, 
which suggested that CFILs should come under federal 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	You remember the Nault report, the work of a partisan group 
comprising only Liberal members and one Liberal senator and 
excluding the opposition parties, the democratically elected 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12579"> 12579 </A></B>
<P>
Bloc Quebecois and Reform Party.  This is part of what we 
consider totally inadmissible, and we will call for amendments 
to clause 16.
<P>
	In closing, there is a third point where we require more 
information. It concerns the future of CN's current subsidiaries 
such as the AMF locomotive works in Montreal or the Can-Car 
plant. We also want reassurance about the future of these 
subsidiaries with a privatized CN.
<P>
	With that being said, the best is yet to come on Tuesday and 
Wednesday before the Standing Committee on Transport.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to make my contribution as one of the first 
speakers on Bill C-89, which would privatize CN's rail assets, 
including their track, rolling stocks, buildings, et cetera.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the bill excludes a major part of CN's assets, 
such as non-railway real estate assets, probably the most 
valuable part of the company. Reformers would like to see these 
assets sold off before the privatization effort takes place, in 
order to reduce CN's debt load.
<P>
	My hon. colleague has described a number of flaws with the 
bill that need to be fixed. These include prohibiting the 
government from arbitrarily cancelling all or part of CN's debts 
prior to privatization; removing the requirement to leave CN's 
headquarters in Montreal; removing the requirement that CN 
comply with the government's policy of official bilingualism; 
and removing the 15 per cent ownership restriction.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	I want to use my time today not just to point out the obvious 
flaws in this bill but to talk about privatization in general and 
introduce a number of ideas for consideration by the 
government before this bill is sent to committee.
<P>
	The privatization of CN is a good thing, but the government 
has an opportunity to make it a great thing. I want to suggest the 
government use this, its first effort at privatization, as a testing 
ground for the privatization of all crown corporations.
<P>
	In 1987 Madsen Pirie, president of the Adam Smith Institute 
in London, a world renowned expert on privatization, spoke at a 
Canadian symposium on privatization organized by the Fraser 
Institute. He had this to say about the fundamentals of 
privatizing a crown corporation:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When government engages in an activity such as privatization, it is speaking to 
several audiences. Among the audiences that government speaks to are the 
managers of crown corporations, the workers who are employed in them, the 
members of the general public who are customers of crown corporations, the 
general public who are taxpayers and who pay subsidies to support the losses of 
those corporations, potential investors who might buy shares in those 
corporations, the financial and business community which takes an interest in 
their performance, and the media commentators who observe this process and 
comment  on the results and declare it to be a success or a failure. Every act of 
privatization speaks to all of those audiences, and every act should be tailor made 
to maximize the support of each of those different groups.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	When reviewing this bill we should test it against Dr. Pirie's 
list of vested interests or audiences. Bill C-89 must address each 
of the groups affected by the privatization: the managers, the 
workers, the customers, the taxpayers and the investors. If Bill 
C-89 does not specifically address each of the needs and 
interests of these groups, amendments will be necessary.
<P>
	Dr. Pirie also outlined three key principles of privatization. 
First, never cancel a benefit. If people are deriving a benefit 
from the public activity of a crown corporation, never cancel it, 
however unjust it is.
<P>
	Second, make friends out of your enemies. Find out who the 
people are who might lose on the privatization process and 
structure the policy to make sure they gain instead.
<P>
	Third, disarm the opposition. Identify all possible objections 
to privatization and tailor make the policy so every single one of 
these objections is dealt with in advance. The government 
should ensure it has considered each of Dr. Pirie's three 
principles in planning for the privatization of CN and the 
necessary legislative measures are included in Bill C-89.
<P>
	Based on these audiences and principles I believe that every 
privatization initiative must have a list of groups with a vested 
interest in the sale of CN and give them the first opportunity to 
buy CN shares. CN employees should be given the first 
opportunity and the highest priority. CN customers come second 
on the priority list and Canadian taxpayers and investors are 
third.
<P>
	I would also like to explore some new ideas for consideration 
by the government before Bill C-89 becomes the law of the land. 
What about linking two or more government objectives into 
one?
<P>
	For example, the government is giving landowners in the west 
a one-time payout for eliminating the WGTA subsidy for the 
railways, commonly known as the Crow rate. Would it be 
possible to give western farmers the choice to have their Crow 
rate buyout in the form of shares rather than cash? Farmers 
could then have a direct financial interest in the economic 
performance of CN. If done properly, the government could 
overcome opposition to both the Crow rate buyout and the 
privatization of CN with one move. I offer this idea to be 
explored by the government to lessen some of the negative 
effects of both programs.

available and to open entry into rail carriage to anyone who can meet the basic 
requirements related to safety and liability coverage. Instead of regulating the 
activities of CN and CP in their capacity as providers of the roadbed, the 
management of all track could be assigned to a new publicly owned track 
authority. This would require the nationalization of CP's roadbed and the 
separation of CN's track from the other components of its operation. 
Alternatively, a public track authority could be created, based exclusively on the 
infrastructure of CN.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	This is an idea whose time has finally come. The government 
should give serious consideration to establishing a public track 
authority which would operate similarly to our highway system. 
This would eliminate the tax disadvantage placed on rail 
companies because while they pay fuel taxes, they also have to 
pay the full costs of maintaining their own railbed. Trucks on the 
other hand pay fuel taxes but their roadbed, the highways, are 
maintained at public expense.
<P>
	Such a public track authority could charge user fees to rail 
companies based on the use they make of the tracks and as a 
result could be self-financing. At some point in the future even 
the public track authority could be privatized.
<P>
	The Canadian Chamber of Commerce supports a fully user 
pay rail infrastructure. It had this to say in its 1994 submission 
to the special joint committee reviewing Canada's foreign 
policy:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Canadian businesses are increasingly pointing to an unlevel playing field 
between the Canadian and U.S. commercial environments-.One tangible 
example among many can be found in the Canadian transportation industry. 
Rail, for example, provides the most economic mode of transportation for a 
large part of Canada's freight and for many shippers is the only cost effective 
mode. It is fundamental to Canada's trade, moving 40 per cent of Canada's 
exports and provides a fully user pay infrastructure not liable to ongoing public 
funding.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Finally, I would like to comment on the importance of the port 
of Churchill to the farmers of Saskatchewan and Manitoba. The 
privatization of CN should be seen as an opportunity to 
privatize, expand markets, modernize and increase exports and 
imports through the port of Churchill.
<P>
	This will take more than just the privatization of CN. It will 
take the co-operation and likely the privatization of both VIA 
Rail and Ports Canada. It will take the co-operation of the 
federal government, the governments of the provinces of 
Manitoba and Saskatchewan, and the co-operation and support 
of every community and producer whose future will be 
improved by taking advantage of the most cost effective 
shipping route for  bulk commodities to our customers in 
Europe, Africa and South America.
<P>
	I respectfully ask the government not to look at the Churchill 
line and the port of Churchill as a liability but as an opportunity 
requiring creative thinking and a co-operative creative 
privatization strategy. I hope to have an opportunity to comment 
on a few of these ideas in future debates on Bill C-89.
<P>
	I would like to close with the comments Dr. Pirie made at the 
1987 Fraser symposium. He describes the most exciting part of 
the privatization process. He said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>You will find privatization enables you to bring opportunities to ordinary 
people. It gives your citizens a chance to take part in the wealth creating process. 
It speeds up economic growth. It cuts the costs of government. It turns losses into 
tax revenues. In Britain, it is ending the old politics of division-the old politics 
of ``us who don't have it and them that do''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	These are the real reasons that Reformers support 
privatization of crown corporations.
<P>
<B>(1255 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to begin by commenting on the process here. As I 
understand when the procedure for referring a bill to committee 
before second reading was thought about in the standing 
committee on procedure some time ago, frankly I do not think 
this was the kind of bill we had in mind for referral to committee 
so early on. In my judgment this is the kind of bill on which there 
should be a full second reading debate on the principle of 
whether or not CN should be privatized.
<P>
	I would like to register my objection to what I would consider 
to be a misuse of this particular procedure. Presumably it is in 
order to avoid just that kind of full scale debate about the 
privatization of CN, although I do not know why the government 
would bother to avoid it. Obviously there is a great deal of 
agreement between itself and at least the Reform Party on this 
measure.
<P>
	Also, the government has an obligation to instruct or ask the 
committee, whatever is appropriate, to consult with the 
communities and other stakeholders that will be affected by the 
privatization. Just to have the hearings in Ottawa without going 
to Winnipeg and other places where people have good reason to 
be anxious about the effect of the privatization of CN is a 
mistake. It is certainly something the government should 
reconsider although I do not expect it too. It seems to be in an 
unholy rush to have this all over and done with, a rush which I do 
not understand.
<P>
	This is a very sad day for me. I will have been in this House 16 
years come next week. I have spent those 16 years defending and 
promoting the role of CNR as a publicly owned railway compa-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12581"> 12581 </A></B>
<P>
ny. I had hoped and for many years I had thought that this day 
would never come. I certainly did not expect it to come under the 
auspices of a Liberal government.
<P>
	At times I felt if the Conservatives had been re-elected that at 
some point they would have done this. I remember back in 1978 
when I was just a candidate for Parliament and had not yet been 
elected. I was critical of Harvie Andre, then a Conservative 
member of Parliament for Calgary for his proposal to privatize 
the CNR. I always thought that this was something in the back of 
the collective Conservative mind. The fact that it is happening 
now under a Liberal government to me simply makes the 
point-I wonder if the Bloc Quebecois could have their caucus 
meeting somewhere else, Mr. Speaker. I am trying to make a 
speech.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. Our colleague is 
seeking the co-operation of the House. I would ask those who 
wish to talk to do so outside the House if possible.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Blaikie:</B> The fact that this is now happening under a 
Liberal government is proof positive to me of the consistency 
and the continuity of the corporate agenda which involves 
deregulation, privatization and free trade. I have to say that even 
I, and I have been here for a long time and know just how 
devious and how flexible shall we say the Liberal Party is, find 
the initiative taken by the government for the privatization of 
CN to be deeply surprising and deeply wounding.
<P>
	In my own case, I do not think there is a person in my family 
for three generations who has not worked for the CNR at one 
time or another or worked there their entire life. That is true of a 
lot of people in my home town of Transcona where the main 
back shop for the CNR is.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	I understand the position of the Bloc Quebecois in defending 
that part of the legislation which calls for the retention of 
Montreal as the location for the headquarters of the new 
privatized CN. However, I hope it will be equally understanding 
when it contemplates my anger that my community is not 
protected in the same way. Transcona is every bit as much a part 
of the history of the CNR as Montreal, going back to pre-CNR 
days when the shops began to be constructed in 1908 and 1909 
around which the town of Transcona was created.
<P>
	I object to the notion some people are protected by this 
legislation and others are not, that Montreal is protected; where 
the headquarters of the CNR is and will be is protected. 
Transcona's role in the life of the CNR is not protected. 
Presumably Transcona shops can be sold, cannibalized, 
balkanized, anything can happen to them. This legislation does 
not even acknowledge the existence of that place. Therefore I 
would like to register my objection to that.
<P>
	I find it doubly insulting, offensive and tragic that not only is 
CN to be privatized but it could very well be sold to a variety of 
foreign interests. I see the solicitor general across the way. I 
remember being inspired when I was yet a high school student 
by the Gray report on foreign ownership of the Canadian 
economy. We have come a long way since then. We have come a 
long way since we hoped to repatriate elements of our economy 
that were under foreign ownership. Now we have a Liberal 
government, of which that same member is a member, 
privatizing and at the same time making it possible for foreign 
interests to own significantly Canadian National.
<P>
	There is nothing in the bill to prevent the wholesale 
dismantling of the CNR or its being broken up into a number of 
fragments and sold off. I just finished reading this bill carefully 
and there is nothing in it to prevent an informal alliance of 
interests by which four or five American railways or other 
companies could buy 15 per cent each of the CNR and through 
that natural convergence of interests that does not fit any of the 
legal descriptions we find in the bill manipulate the future and 
the nature of the CNR to their own advantage in a way that may 
not be to the advantage of Canada.
<P>
	Perhaps that is the point. Perhaps it is passé to talk about 
Canada. Perhaps it is passé to talk about making the economy or 
the marketplace accountable to something called the country or 
something called the public interest. Over time we have seen 
that notion erode and finally, I think with this bill, completely 
fall away so that voices like mine sound vaguely romantic or 
unrealistic in this context.
<P>
	Nevertheless, I think I speak for a notion of the country which 
many people still cherish and which they regret seeing disappear 
as a result of this.
<P>
<B>(1305 ) </B>
<P>
	There is no provision in here for the future of VIA. It says the 
new CN can continue to charge VIA whatever it pleases. I would 
like to have seen something in here which would have demanded 
some accountability for what the new company would charge 
VIA. Is this to be the way VIA will disappear because the new 
company will charge VIA rates not tenable and therefore the 
next thing to go will be VIA? I would like not to have seen any of 
this but if it has to happen I would like to have seen 
consideration of the notion of having all the track in Canada 
owned by the government so that at least the government would 
continue to have a stake in our transportation system.
<P>
	Finally, I believe none of this had to happen. I believe with the 
proper reregulation of our railway system the CNR and the CPR 
could have been healthy and viable. Instead, thanks to 
deregulation, thanks to imitating things happening south of the 
border we allowed ourselves to evolve to a point at which our 
railways are no longer viable.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12582"> 12582 </A></B>
<P>
	With the appropriate policy changes on the tax side and 
various other changes we could have built a transportation 
system publicly owned on one side by CNR and privately 
owned on the other by CPR which would have been 
environmentally friendly because it would have been in favour 
of the railways. We have failed to do that. This will only lead 
to more trucking and to a transportation system which in my 
judgement will be less fit for the future than the one we have 
now.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
happy to participate in the debate on Bill C-89. You may wonder 
why the health critic is interested in privatization or in Bill 
C-89. I am interested in this matter because CN trains go 
through my riding; they even go through one of the largest cities 
in my riding.
<P>
	This bill would allow the government to privatize the most 
symbolic of Crown corporations: CN. It is surprising, to say the 
least, to see how fast symbols are disappearing from Canada 
these days. Institutions that were previously considered a sacred 
trust are now faced with the sorry state of government finance.
<P>
	The CBC's mandate has gradually eroded, since the 
government no longer gives this corporation the financial 
resources needed to meet its original goals. The Canadian health 
care system is also caught in our government's financial mess. 
While some still see our health care system as the great 
Canadian unifying project, many realize, in the light of what is 
happening across Canada, that the provinces can only do so 
much given the federal government's unilateral cuts.
<P>
	Privatizing CN would remove another page from our album of 
Canadian symbols. No other institution has done so much to 
help shape Canada as we still know it today.
<P>
	How many towns and regions took shape and developed 
around the railways? Yesterday's symbols are being destroyed 
by the government's financial impasse. Through this bill, the 
government wants to establish a mechanism that would allow it 
to remove one of these symbols from its public accounts.
<P>
	By and large, we agree with this move. We will, however, 
monitor this operation very closely so that privatization does not 
become a mess like the recent shady deal relating to Pearson 
airport in Toronto. We clearly cannot let the interests of the 
government's wealthy financial backers prevail over those of 
taxpayers, who own CN. There are some justified fears that the 
Pearson airport mess does nothing to allay.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	The bill says that the shares of CN will be transferred to the 
Minister of Transport, who will hold them in trust for the 
Government of Canada. On the direction of the Minister of 
Transport, CN will have to submit an application for a 
certificate of continuance under the Canada Business 
Corporations Act. In fact, CN will cease  to exist as a crown 
corporation and become a business corporation.
<P>
	The bill imposes certain constraints on the new articles of 
continuance of CN. First, the voting shares that an individual or 
group of persons can hold is limited to 15 per cent; second, the 
head office is to remain in Montreal; and third, once privatized, 
CN will remain subject to the Official Languages Act.
<P>
	If passed, this bill would authorize the Minister of Transport 
to deal with shares of CN with the approval of the Minister of 
Finance. The Bloc Quebecois has nothing against the principle 
of privatizing CN. However, we hope that CN will really see its 
efficiency and competitiveness increase as a result of 
privatization, as the government claims it will. To ensure that 
the transaction will produce the expected level of 
competitiveness for the new owners, CN should not be sold at 
reduced price. We intend to monitor the government closely in 
that regard, to prevent taxpayers from making a nice big gift to a 
privileged few.
<P>
	So, reviewing the provisions of this bill, we find certain flaws 
that we would like to see remedied before final approval. Clause 
8 of the bill imposes a constraint on the total percentage of 
shares that an individual or group of individuals can hold. The 
limit is set at 15 per cent. On the other hand, under clause 8(5), a 
group of individuals known to be associates would be allowed to 
hold more than 15 per cent of CN shares on presentation of a 
mere solemn declaration to the effect that these individuals will 
not act in concert.
<P>
	It would be up to CN management to determine whether the 
group in question stood by their solemn declaration and really 
acted independently rather than in concert. Our main concern is 
that this leaves the door wide open for a foreign takeover, since a 
holding could meet these conditions. Several companies 
operating independently may in fact have the same majority 
shareholder. This provision, combined with the lack of 
constraints on foreign ownership, makes us fear a possible loss 
of Canadian control.
<P>
	It is the minister's responsibility to keep this asset, built with 
money from the taxpayers of Quebec and Canada, under 
Canadian control. It would be unacceptable, after investing 
billions in public funds in that railway network, to let it fall into 
the hands of foreign interests. CN must remain under Canadian 
control to avoid a rerouting of its traffic to feed American 
railway companies.
<P>
	Clause 8(5) is unacceptable in its current form, since it allows 
a foreign group made up of related companies to acquire a 
majority of CN's shares. The only protection against an 
effective takeover is a decision by CN's board members to the 
effect that these businesses comply with their pledge not to act 
in a concerted manner.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12583"> 12583 </A></B>
<P>
	As you know, a company acts first and foremost with its 
shareholders' interests in mind. If the companies which own 
CN's stocks are all owned by the same shareholder, they do not 
have to act in a concerted manner to do the same thing. 
Consequently, Clause 8(5) must be reviewed or, at least, its 
application should be restricted to Canadian groups.
<P>
	We also object to clause 16, where railway and other 
transportation works, as well as every subsidiary of CN, are 
declared to be for the general advantage of Canada. That clause 
would allow the federal government to interfere in areas which 
fall under provincial jurisdiction, such as short-line railways. It 
would be totally unacceptable, as well as economically 
inefficient and unjustifiable, to have these railways come under 
federal jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	These companies successfully operate sections which are 
considered to be unprofitable by major railway companies. They 
can do so because they are not subjected to the numerous federal 
regulations on rail transport. These companies need the 
flexibility afforded by provincial regulations to operate 
successfully. This attempt by the federal government could 
deter the development of such companies and could limit their 
number. It must be understood that each of these short lines 
operates on sections which were going to be abandoned. If the 
government interferes with the development of such short lines, 
more lines in Quebec and in Canada will be abandoned.
<P>
	I am also concerned about the survival of existing CN 
subsidiaries whose activities are not related to railway 
transport. The minister said that those CN subsidiaries which 
are not directly related to rail transport will be sold separately. 
These subsidiaries include some Quebec companies which are 
currently experiencing financial difficulties. We will have to 
ensure that these companies can survive without CN, and that 
their current level of employment is maintained.
<P>
	In conclusion, we will have to review major elements of this 
bill, so that a badly planned privatization does not result in a 
waste of all the money the taxpaters of Quebec and Canada 
invested in CN.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
about time a Liberal government realized the private sector can 
operate and manage a commercial enterprise far better than 
government can. I have been waiting a long time to hear that.
<P>
	We on this side of the House support ending government 
involvment in the financial sinkhole of political policy that 
operated CN Rail. We do, however, have some concerns about 
the manner in which this government is turning the former 
government operated financial sinkhole into a commercial 
operation.
<P>
	As members know, when government sold off the money 
losing Air Canada to private interests government also wrote off 
Air Canada debt, which caused other Canadian airlines grievous 
harm. The question to be asked is whether this government will 
have the political courage to rid taxpayers of the money losing 
CN without causing unjustified harm to Canadian Pacific. Will 
this Liberal government act fairly, or will it continue 
government intervention into private industry? I fear that on 
both counts the answer if no.
<P>
	This Liberal government has already written into this 
legislation interventions that will severely harm CP Rail and 
place manacles on the new owners, if any, of CN. This 
government, in its usual haste to appear to do something, has 
allowed the taxpayers to once again bail out previous 
government errors.
<P>
	Instead of ending government involvement in CN, this 
Liberal government divorced one sector of CN holdings from 
the other. Instead of having taxpayers bail out debt, why is this 
government not selling off CN real estate assets and using that 
money to pay down the debt? Why is government holding on to 
the assets instead of sparing taxpayers further pain?
<P>
	This Liberal government is asking taxpayers to forgive debt 
that is rightly payable by CN. They ask taxpayers to once again 
pay for governemnt mismanagement. This governent is also 
asking anyone who purchases CN to be bound by rules and 
regulations that will hamstring its future owners.
<P>
	Why is this Liberal government making as a condition of sale 
that the head office for future CN owners must remain in 
Montreal? If this condition does not or will not make good 
business sense, must the future owners be shackled with another 
political decision? If CN is to be privatized, let the new owners 
be free to decide what is best for the railway and its customers.
<P>
	Why does the Liberal government always preach freedom of 
enterprise and freedom for private business to operate in the 
marketplace yet always place restrictions upon private 
enterprise? That is anything but free. This governemnt states 
that private industry can operate better than governemnt in the 
marketplace, but then this government places cost consuming 
measures, such as maintaining an official languages policy, on 
prospective purchasers. Again, we have this government stating 
one goal while doing everything in its power to prevent 
accomplishment of that goal.
<P>
	Why can this government never get it right? Why can this 
government not understand that intervention in the freedom of 
the marketplace or in constituents' lives will not encourage 
growth and prosperity? We on this side of the House understand 
fully that private initiative is the best means to economic growth 
and wealth and that private initiative reacting to a free market-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12584"> 12584 </A></B>
<P>
place will create opportunity for Canadians. Unfortunately, this 
government cannot or will not believe that independent  
Canadians know what is best for a continuation of prosperity.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	The members opposite continue to believe that private 
property owned by free citizens must have government 
interference to be viable. With that in mind, why is this Liberal 
government restricting ownership by any one sector to 15 per 
cent of outstanding shares? What if western grain producers and 
operators can afford to and wish to purchase as much of CN as 
they can to maintain a say in what prices will be charged to move 
their grain to market? What if western interests want to make 
certain CN will charge the price that is necessary to move the 
grain and make a profit but prevent outside interests from 
arbitrarily setting extremely high rates to ship their grain? What 
if these Canadian interests wish to purchase more than 15 per 
cent? Why can they not?
<P>
	Why does this Liberal government continue to talk free 
enterprise but always intervene in the free market? Why does the 
government always put up barriers to the free movement of 
goods, services, and enterprise? Can it not understand that its 
outdated measures are holding back the future growth and the 
competitiveness that are required to make Canada an effective 
force in the world market?
<P>
	Several ideas have been forthcoming that would allow 
hard-pressed taxpayers to recover some of their investment in 
CN. One idea is rationalizing the CN operation for public sale 
based solely on offering rolling stock, trucking, and real estate 
for public tender and having government retain ownership of the 
iron highway. Taxpayers have purchased the asphalt highways in 
this land. Why not allow taxpayers to keep the iron highways 
they have purchased?
<P>
	Just as government levies a fee to use the open road, a realistic 
fee could be charged to all users of the iron highway. This 
measure will allow taxpayers to receive some return on the 
investment that opened this land from sea to sea. This measure 
has been tried and found to be viable in Great Britain. Granted, 
some may shout that government has no place in the iron 
highway, and some may point out that there are wrongs to this 
plan, but why does this government not allow discussion on this 
point? This government is quick to shout that it has consulted on 
many items in the agenda. Why is this government afraid to 
consult on this measure in the House?
<P>
	Do not misunderstand my criticism, Mr. Speaker. I am a firm 
supporter of privatization, a firm believer that private industry 
can operate an enterprise far more effectively and efficiently 
than any government. I am a firm believer that private industry 
can create jobs and economic wealth far better than any 
government. However, there are several issues in this legislation 
that do not offer the best value for the dollar to Canada's hard 
pressed taxpayers. Make no mistake, it was tax dollars that 
created the CN this government now wants to pass to private 
ownership. I have no problem with that  decision. I only have a 
problem with the manner in which this initiative takes place.
<P>
	Taxpayers deserve maximum return for their investment. 
Taxpayers deserve liquidation of CN real estate assets to pay 
down the CN debt, which may make this sale unattractive to 
some purchasers. Taxpayers do not deserve to have their hard 
earned dollars used to rid this company of one cent of debt while 
any asset remains.
<P>
	Taxpayers do not deserve to have a hidden agenda set by this 
Liberal government, such as head office location or official 
languages requirement, which other private enterprises can 
forgo, to hinder the sale to and the profitability of future owners.
<P>
	I believe I have raised several issues that require answers. I 
believe I have pointed out to taxpayers why this government is 
not giving them the best value for their dollar. It is now up to the 
government to answer those concerns, and I challenge them to 
do so.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome the opportunity today to speak on second reading of 
Bill C-89, whose purpose is to privatize Canadian National, a 
decision that was announced in the last budget and is well on its 
way to being implemented.
<P>
	However, before this bill does what it is supposed to do, which 
is to privatize CN, there are a few points I would like to raise for 
the benefit of the Minister of Transport and his colleagues, and I 
am referring to the importance of the railways for resource rich 
regions like the Abitibi in Quebec, the riding I represent in this 
House. My concern is that this bill should benefit, not penalize 
the railways.
<P>
	The railway system was one of the keys to the economic 
development of the Abitibi and, as we all know, was also 
instrumental in the development of many other resource regions 
in Quebec and Canada. I often wonder, when I see these small 
rural municipalities along the railroad tracks, whether they grew 
up around the railway station or attracted CN to the area so they 
could expand.
<P>
	We have to ask whether this government, like previous 
governments, will again be wide of the mark with its railway 
development policy and this new policy of privatization.
<P>
	Could it be that once again, Quebec has been the first to 
realize the importance of having a modern railway adapted to 
the needs of today's economy?
<P>
	We all know that the decline of our Canadian railways is not a 
measure of their usefulness, since during the recent debate on 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12585"> 12585 </A></B>
<P>
special legislation tabled by the Liberal government to put the 
railway companies and their employees back to work, much was 
made of the importance of the railways for the economy in 
general.
<P>
	Oddly enough, the railways were called an essential national 
service. so that the government could force a settlement during 
this latest dispute, while in our region we had to fight to justify 
maintaining sections of the railway network in order to preserve 
our principal means of shipping our natural resources, our 
mining and forestry products.
<P>
	Despite the importance of the railways, the reason for their 
decline is simple: no government has ever made a serious 
attempt to remedy the situation when there was still time, 
although it provided substantial grants for operating the 
railways.
<P>
	We have been trying to placate unions for too long, instead of 
searching for efficient or cost-effective solutions for both the 
employer and the employee. What effort has this government or 
previous governments made to promote this means of transport 
over the past 20 years? Absolutely none. We can sum up the 
actions of the successive governments by the word ``cuts'' and 
the federal leitmotiv ``we cannot afford it''. Infusions of capital 
were certainly not the best solution, as we can see by the results 
today.
<P>
	Over the past twenty years or more, the only notable things 
about the coast to coast rail system have been staff cuts, 
abandonment of lines and cuts to client services. Instead of 
investing in this great Canadian asset and creating jobs, the 
government is cutting.
<P>
	On the other hand, the government found a way to meet the 
needs of western grain transporters, justifying itself by saying 
that we need international trade and that our wheat producers 
have to be competitive. Why did the government not place the 
same importance on the transport of wood and minerals from 
northern Quebec and northern Ontario?
<P>
	Natural resources, and the jobs they create, are the foundation 
of our economy. The executives controlling rail transport in this 
country exhibited a flagrant lack of leadership skills. They 
failed to rationalize an essential service and to make it cost 
effective when they had the chance. They neglected their 
responsibilities by letting rolling stock age without replacing or 
improving it.
<P>
	The longer they let it go, the higher the costs of getting the 
equipment back on track. They had gotten so behind in their 
upkeep and replacement of rolling stock that the situation came 
to a head at the beginning of the 1970s. The situation only 
worsened under VIA which, with the weather beaten material it 
inherited from CN, was never able to break even.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	Furthermore, the leaders at the time denied the importance of 
also maintaining efficient, competitive and aggressive 
passenger service, deeming it less profitable than freight 
transportation and not essential because road transportation was 
available by car or bus. Through its policy, the government 
supported this situation rather than look for solutions that would 
put the industry back on a solid footing and would serve the real 
needs of the  communities affected by the flood of lost jobs and 
services.
<P>
	Is the government trying to isolate distant localities once and 
for all by taking away their trains, airports, TV stations and even 
the social programs the people have contributed to in large and 
ever growing measure? No study has compared the huge costs of 
highway maintenance with rail line maintenance in northern 
regions such as Abitibi, with its notorious climate. The potential 
end of rail transportation could mean increasingly poor roads. 
The people in my riding know about this problem. They are 
faced with increasing numbers of trucks on the road, since the 
railway was not competitive and lacked the services to compete 
with the trucking industry.
<P>
	In my region, this type of transportation is causing a lot of 
problems, since the highways were not designed to take such 
heavy loads. It is always the same problem, unfortunately-a 
lack of consultation. Government makes decisions without 
consulting the regions and without taking their particular needs 
into account. Even today, privatizing CN as outlined in this bill 
does not guarantee that services will be maintained in outlying 
areas. In spite of this, the federal government gives itself the 
power to interfere in short-line railway operations through 
clause 16 of Bill C-89.
<P>
	This is totally unacceptable, since short-line railways were 
created thanks to the initiative of rail staff and unions, who took 
the risks that our leaders had avoided taking in the past. These 
people feel that some sections abandoned by CN and the 
government can become profitable through sound management. 
To fulfil their potential, short-line railways also needed the 
operating flexibility that only provincial regulations could 
provide.
<P>
	It would be dishonest for the government to discourage the 
creation of short-line railways, or to try to hamper the 
development or operations of those already in existence by 
interfering whenever it feels like it. The short-line railway in 
my riding of Abitibi is a very good example of a CN section. It 
meets with the Lac-Saint-Jean line. We managed to rescue it 
from abandonment with all the attendant advantages for our 
region in terms of jobs, economic benefits, development, 
transport, and so on.
<P>
	I would also like to take this opportunity to address clause 8 of 
this bill. As it now stands, this clause is unacceptable. Let me 
explain. The government plans to sell most of CN, an institution 
over 100 years old, through the largest share issue in Canadian 
history, which would amount to some $2 billion.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12586"> 12586 </A></B>
<P>
	Like my Bloc colleagues, I deplore the fact that this 
government did not include in the bill a clause explicitly 
prohibiting foreigners from holding a majority of shares. 
Today, I will try to explain to the Minister of Transport and all 
his colleagues how important it is to encourage local purchase 
by local investors if possible or any concrete gesture through 
short-line railways.
<P>
	Railways have played an important part in the development of 
my region and many others, and they can still play this role if we 
make the effort of identifying the needs of people in the regions 
and helping them meet these needs. May I point out that we are 
not dependent on the U.S., and yet the danger is real. The 
presence of Goldman Sachs, an American firm, among the 
brokers appointed by the government confirms the 
government's need to issue shares outside the Canadian stock 
market.
<P>
	We also know that American investors are used to assessing 
railway companies. There are at least a dozen on the stock 
exchange list in the U.S., while in Canada, there is only CP, 
hence the risk that less informed Canadian investors may not 
recognize a good deal when they see it. That is why I propose 
that clause 8(5) be deleted or at least amended to apply only to 
Canadians.
<P>
	To conclude, if the railway system was the connecting link for 
all the regions of this country, and promoted its development, 
why is it that today, on the eve of the 21st century, we are not 
able to find innovative ways of making it profitable? The 
railway is an essential public utility, connecting people and 
businesses.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	If a committee to save the railway system were set up, I am 
sure that we could come up with solutions, because I am still 
convinced that solutions do exist and that short-line railways 
are part of the solution. Personally, I think that privatizing CN is 
not a bad idea in itself since investors are needed to boost the rail 
industry if it is to become more performing and modern. And I 
think that regional business functions may offer solutions.
<P>
	Privatizing must take place in the interests of all stakeholders: 
customers, employers and employees. In terms of profitability, 
CN is not doing as bad as in 1992, with estimated profits for 
1994 between $240 million and $250 million.
<P>
	Perhaps we have the time and resources to make the right 
choices. Let us take the time to weigh up the pros and cons of 
Bill C-89 to try to make up for the mass of not so great decisions 
made by rail officials and our governments over the past 20 
years.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réjean Lefebvre (Champlain, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to participate in the debate on Bill C-89, which seeks to 
privatize CN. First, it should be remembered that the Canadian 
National was always a symbol of unity, with its lines crossing 
the country from east to west and going deep into remote 
regions. However, that symbol is disintegrating, just like 
federalism, and no longer meets the aspirations and needs of 
Canadians.
<P>
	I agree with the Minister of Transport when he says that, given 
its current structure, CN is not a profitable venture. And CN 
must remain competitive. Maintaining our national railway in 
the long term implies government ownership in the short term.
<P>
	For reasons of profitability, and in an effort to find solutions 
to eliminate CN's growing deficit, the government must ensure 
the maintenance of an adequate service, particularly in remote 
areas which are not served by any other public means of 
transportation.
<P>
	Let me give you some figures. My riding of Champlain is 
served by two CN-operated railroad lines, Montreal-Senneterre 
and Montreal-Jonquière. According to a 1992 Via Rail survey 
on the origin and destination of travellers, 56 per cent of 
passengers on the Montreal-Senneterre line were either going to 
or coming from a remote destination. Twenty two per cent of the 
respondents said that their point of departure or their destination 
was otherwise only accessible by bush roads. In the early 
nineties, Transport Canada found that 38,000 trips were made on 
that line, with over 60 per cent of them originating or ending in 
remote communities or places otherwise only accessible by 
bush roads.
<P>
	The same survey showed that 26 per cent of all passengers on 
the Montreal-Jonquière line were going to or coming from a 
remote community. Seven per cent of respondents said that bush 
roads were the only alternative. In 1992, Transport Canada 
found that close to 20,000 trips were made on the 
Montreal-Jonquière line, with over 26 per cent of them 
originating or ending in remote communities or places 
otherwise only accessible by bush roads.
<P>
	It should be noted that, after a decrease in the number of users 
in 1990, there has been a significant increase, in the last two 
years, in the number of travellers on these two lines, in spite of a 
lack of marketing and poorer services, a well-known fact. Just 
think of the environmental disaster resulting from the 
derailment in the Tawachiche ZEC, close to the municipality of 
Sainte-Thècle, in my riding of Champlain.
<P>
	Of course, the railway service in the southern part of these two 
lines has to compete with other means of transportation. Given 
the length of the trip, the unaccommodating schedules, their 
infrequency and our individualized travelling habits, the train in 
its current incarnation is not competitive.
<P>
	However, it does contribute to the autonomy of residents of 
remote areas, it is an efficient evacuation method in case of 
natural disaster and it could be at the heart of economic 
development or promote tourism, if it were more 
enthusiastically supported and its publicity campaigns better 
targeted.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12587"> 12587 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	After reading Bill C-89, one has to wonder how the 
privatization of Canadian National will affect the maintenance 
of infrastructures in remote areas and one has to ask oneself if 
the Minister of Transport can guarantee these people access to 
public transportation where roads are not adequate?
<P>
	This question is even more pertinent, since clause 16 of the 
bill before us gives the federal government the right to meddle 
with the property of short line railways. It is particularly 
unacceptable and even economically inefficient and 
unjustifiable for the federal government to take over all or even 
some of these small operations.
<P>
	One of the main reasons that these short line railways can 
make a profit operating short lines is that they are not heavily 
regulated by the federal government. These operations need the 
flexibility which they enjoy under the jurisdiction of the 
provinces. This federal initiative could discourage the creation 
of short line railways and limit their numbers. We must not 
forget that each of these operations saves a railway line from 
abandonment.
<P>
	If the government impedes the development of these small 
operations, an increasing number of kilometres of track in 
Quebec and in Canada will be abandoned.
<P>
	Another aspect of Bill C-89 which makes me fear for the 
future of remote areas is the lack of controls regarding foreign 
takeovers of CN holdings.
<P>
	The aim of the Minister of Transport in presenting this bill is 
highly praiseworthy, but his prime obligation is to ensure that all 
Quebecers and Canadians, who paid the cost of building and 
operating the national railway, continue to have the service 
available to them. One way for this to happen would be to limit 
ownership of CN to Canadian interests.
<P>
	Clause 8(5) is unacceptable in its present form, because it 
allows a foreign group of associated businesses to acquire a 
majority of CN shares. The only thing blocking an effective 
takeover in such a situation is the decision by CN directors that 
the companies in the owner consortium will stand by their 
statutory declaration to not act jointly. A company acts first and 
foremost in its own interest and in the interest of its 
shareholders. If the companies owning CN's shares have 
common shareholders, they would not need to act jointly in 
order to achieve the same end.
<P>
	Therefore, clause 8(5) must be deleted in order to limit 
ownership of CN to Canadian groups.
<P>
	In closing, I would remind the Minister of Transport that he is 
responsible for keeping control of Canadian National within 
Canada, because it was built with the tax money of Quebecers 
and Canadians. With billions of dollars of public money already 
poured into this rail system, it would be intolerable if it were 
now to be taken out of the hands of Quebecers and Canadians. 
Furthermore, if we are to keep CN rail traffic from  heading 
south to the American rail systems, it is vital that CN remain 
under Canadian control.
<P>
	In the past two quarters, CN has recorded profits of over $200 
million. Now that it is beginning to make money, we sell it. CN 
must be well managed, serving the needs of its clientele and of 
the remote regions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome the opportunity today to speak to Bill C-89 which, as 
we know, will have the effect of privatizing Canadian National.
<P>
	This bill will also determine the mechanism that will be used 
by the government to implement the process. As soon as the 
legislation is passed, CN will no longer be a crown corporation. 
It will become a business corporation.
<P>
	When I began to examine this bill, I soon realized that some of 
its clauses were cause for concern.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	Clause 6 of the bill allows the transfer of CN property to the 
government. Under this clause, the government will be able to 
take possession of CN affiliates and real estate not directly 
related to the railway sector.
<P>
	We also know that the minister made it clear he wanted CN to 
keep only those assets directly related to rail transport. Assets 
related to other sectors will be privatized separately.
<P>
	I would like to take as an example the intermodal station in the 
riding of Jonquière, next door to my own riding. If the station is 
closed, all freight will be transferred to Quebec's highway 
network, more specifically the highway through the Parc des 
Laurentides wildlife reserve.
<P>
	We know the Minister of Transport has no long term policy for 
the road network, which means that the entire road network in 
Quebec will be penalized. Safety will be a casualty as well. 
People will have to cope with larger numbers of heavy trucks on 
our roads.
<P>
	To me, this clause rang some alarm bells. We know that CN 
affiliates include businesses that are not in very good financial 
shape but still manage to do the job thanks to CN.
<P>
	One wonders whether these businesses will be viable without 
CN and whether they will maintain the same employment levels. 
Will these levels be maintained? I think this is a very important 
question.
<P>
	Eighteen months ago, throughout the election campaign, the 
Prime Minister's main platform was creating jobs for the people 
of this country. Eighteen months later, we see this promise was 
not kept. Even worse, in the last budget the Minister of Finance 
failed to include measures for direct job creation. I would even 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12588"> 12588 </A></B>
<P>
go so far as to say that the budget's impact will be the reverse of 
what was promised in the red book.
<P>
	In my riding, things are very bad, with over 30 per cent of the 
population on unemployment insurance or welfare. Of this 
group, a number of people have decided to give up looking for 
jobs. They have stopped looking for jobs because there are none. 
We are gradually killing off an entire generation.
<P>
	Jobs in CN affiliates must be guaranteed so that we do not get 
thousands more unemployed people looking for jobs. This is 
particularly crucial when we realize that this government is 
doing little or nothing to deal with this problem.
<P>
	The Prime Minister seems to have forgotten the golden rule 
which says that when you are the boss, never take on a task your 
assistant will not be able to do. Let me explain. Clearly, neither 
the Minister of Labour nor the Minister of Finance are in a 
position to keep the government's promise that it would put 
people back to work and provide for economic recovery.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	CN itself has concerns about this bill. I will take the specific 
example of AMF Technotransport Inc. of Montreal, which 
employs 1,300 people but, on its own, without the support of 
CN, it may get into financial difficulty, which will add to the 
unemployment statistics of the province.
<P>
	Again, this bill does not contain any provision to protect jobs 
in subsidiaries. This could be very dangerous, leading to jobs 
cuts, layoffs and perhaps even businesses closing down. We 
cannot afford this kind of luxury.
<P>
	Another clause that would require further consideration is 
clause 8. My colleagues mentioned it earlier, but I would like to 
address it anyway, particularly as regards paragraph 5, which, as 
it stands, authorizes a foreign group of corporations which are 
associates to acquire majority control of CN.
<P>
	The only thing that stands in the way of an effective takeover 
in such circumstances under this clause is the judgment of the 
CN board of directors, which they have shown in negotiations, 
and collective bargaining in particular, with employees at every 
level. Collective agreements were signed that were considered 
generous at the time, but then the company only tried to take 
these hard won rights away from the workers later on. They tried 
to do so by seeking legislation like the bills that were brought 
before this House a few months ago. Knowing how much 
common sense the CN directors responsible for determining 
whether the corporations in the owners group are complying 
with their statutory declaration not to act in concert really have, 
I doubt this can be achieved.
<P>
	Everybody knows that corporations are guided first and 
foremost by the interests of their shareholders, and that is 
absolutely normal. So, if the corporations that own CN all have 
the same shareholders, they do not need to act in concert to act 
along the same lines. It is therefore essential that clause 8 be 
amended.
<P>
	Need I remind you that this railway system was built with 
money provided by the taxpayers of Canada and Quebec? It 
would be unacceptable for control over a railway in which 
billions of dollars of public money were invested to be lost to 
Canadians and that CN traffic be redirected toward U.S. rail 
systems.
<P>
	Finally, at a time when the provinces are asking the federal 
government to give them more flexibility and to withdraw more 
and more from certain jurisdictions, clause 16 authorizes the 
federal government to interfere in a wide variety of provincial 
jurisdictions through short-line railways.
<P>
	In closing I would like to add that these entities should be 
protected so that they can be sold to private sector enterprises, 
but enterprises truly owned by Canadians and Quebecers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Fontana (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-89 is a very important 
bill to the railway industry and for the future of transportation in 
the country. I appreciate the number of members who have 
spoken and the vast number of questions which will be answered 
in due course in the committee hearings to commence tomorrow.
<P>
	I want to extend appreciation to the opposition parties, the 
official opposition, the Bloc Quebecois and the Reform Party, 
for their support in principle of the bill. I understand it is 
conditional support at this point in time and that we will 
endeavour to answer their questions at committee. I should point 
out that the NDP continues to be in a time warp. It believes the 
government must own and operate everything to ensure that it is 
run efficiently. Most members have indicated that we have a 
tremendous opportunity to create a new CN with greater 
efficiencies.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	I highlight two questions that have been posed to the 
government. The first concerns no restrictions to foreign 
investment. The Canadian taxpayer has helped to build 
Canadian National and the Canadian taxpayer deserves to get 
the maximum benefit for that investment. Therefore the experts 
have indicated to us that to ensure the maximum benefit, one 
cannot impose certain restrictions on the share offering to try to 
get the best possible value for Canadian National.
<P>
	Second, we have put a restriction on individual shareholdings 
to a maximum of 15 per cent. A number of opposition members 
have indicated that certain unaffiliated or unrelated companies 
could band together to essentially take over Canadian National. 
I want to say with regard to that concern that the experts have 
told us it is impossible. The reason we have drafted the bill with 
<P>

<B><A NAME="12589"> 12589 </A></B>
<P>
such detail is to ensure that unrelated companies and individuals 
could not band together to essentially have control of Canadian 
National.
<P>
	I want to make two other points. The Minister of Transport 
indicated this morning that regulatory reform would be coming 
up soon. It is as important as CN's privatization to ensure that 
we have an efficient railway transportation system.
<P>
	We all agree that transportation is key to our competitiveness, 
to creating jobs and to exporting. That is why we want to create a 
national, affordable integrated railway system in the country 
that will allow us to be able to move goods and people as 
efficiently and as effectively as we possibly can, and to ensure 
that those jobs remain in the country and that we continue to 
export.
<P>
	Bill C-89 is going to committee and when it comes back I am 
sure we can look forward to the support of all members of the 
House.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Pursuant to Standing

might agree that in your chair you are more often a listener than 
you are a speaker, but not all Canadians share the luxury of 
hearing as you do.
<P>
	May is Hearing Awareness Month and as such is an occasion 
to promote greater public understanding of Canadians who are 
deaf or hard of hearing. It is also a time to help those with related 
communication disorders and to emphasize the importance of 
protecting our hearing.
<P>
	More than one million Canadians have a hearing loss. For 
these people communication is not a simple task. It means using 
teletypewriters, close captioning for television, listening 
devices, sign language and oral interpreters.
<P>
	This year the hearing awareness campaign will focus on 
access and communication. Hearing organizations will be 
working together to promote programs and services that 
improve the lives of the hearing impaired in Canada.

operation in Quebec, the Louvicourt mine, near Val-d'Or.
<P>
	This mine, which will employ over 350 people for more than 
10 years, is the result of a roughly $300 million investment by 
partners Aur, Teck and Novicourt. This impressive achievement 
shows how important government assistance, in the form of 
flow-through shares, is to mining.
<P>
	We deplore the fact that the government has rejected the 
Standing Committee on Natural Resources' recommendation to 
enhance the federal contribution to the flow-through share 
system. The Minister of Natural Resources should be reminded 
that the government's involvement in mining is not an 
expenditure but a profitable investment that would benefit a

thousands of workers.

<P>
	The federal Liberals support the Ontario Liberals' red book

interfere in the provincial election by ridiculing Ontario Tory 
policies. However, speaking of ridicule, I wonder just how 
proud Lyn McLeod is of the federal Liberals. Why does she not 
ridicule federal Liberal policy that will see the continuation of

<P>
	Ontario Liberals understand the revulsion that Canadians feel 
toward their MPP pension plan and say in their Ontario red book 
they are going to scrap the porky plan.

	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Liberal red book highlighted the importance of Canada's 
infrastructure to our economy. Yet the Liberal government has 
done another about face by selling off CN Rail which takes away 
a vital link in our transportation infrastructure.
<P>
	The Canadian people will no longer be participants in our rail 
economy, the transportation link that built Canada.
<P>
	In preparation for the sell-off, CN laid off 11,000 Canadians. 
As a former trainman for CN Rail, I saw firsthand the good work 
done in bringing grain and other Canadian products to market. I 
am one of thousands of Canadians who are deeply concerned 
about even further job loss caused by putting CN Rail on the 
auction block.
<P>
	With no rules on foreign ownership, CN is destined, with the 
Liberal government's blessing, to be purchased by individuals 
and corporations with no interest in Canada's future. The 
Liberal government is exchanging an east-west transportation 
system for a north-south system that will see even more foreign 
control of the Canadian economy.
<P>
	Bill C-89 brings to an end Canadians' ownership and control 
of their own railway and only leaves further job loss and more 
debt for Canada.

	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are 
being visited today by the Port Perry Cadet Corps. This corps of 
young men, who attend both elementary and secondary school, 
has a long history of achievements.
<P>
	Having been formed in 1898, they are now fast approaching 
their 100th anniversary. The purpose is not to train soldiers but 
to train young men for the responsibilities of citizenship.
<P>
	Being a part of the Department of National Defence, they have 
expressed to me their concerns about possible reduced funding, 
especially since they are often dependent on the local forces 
base, many of which are now closing. They also expressed to me

celebrated today.
<P>
	The United Nations calls the family the most crucial link 
between generations, the purveyor of human culture, the

family the most important grouping of people in our society. On 
this day to honour families I want to take a moment to honour 
my own.
<P>
	The family unit is fundamental to our society. Through our 
families we strive to make the world a better place. Through our 
families we hope to achieve harmony in the world by promoting 
healthy values and instilling tolerance, understanding and 
compassion in our children.
<P>
	Families struggle to maintain cohesiveness in these stressful 
times of social and economic change. Households are changing 
but the family unit remains intact and strong as each member 
supports the others.

this detachment exemplifies what is meant by serving the

<P>
	On January 15 the local RCMP began a community policing 
pilot project, forging a new relationship with citizens. By 
dividing the city into four districts, the force will eliminate a 
central command, making officers more accessible to citizens, 
essentially assigning each officer to his or her own turf. By 
providing a greater presence in  the local neighbourhoods, 
through full service community stations, storefront contact

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CHECHNYA">CHECHNYA</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
although the Prime Minister says he is concerned about human 
rights issues, on his recent trip to Russia to attend ceremonies 
celebrating the 50th anniversary of V-E Day, it was clear once 
again that the Canadian government's only priority is trade.
<P>
	In fact, at the very moment when the Russian army continued 
its attacks in Chechnya, the Prime Minister was discussing a 
Team Canada trade mission with his Russian counterpart.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Considering 
the foregoing, would the Prime Minister agree that his attitude 
and that of his government, which subordinates human rights to 
strictly commercial interests, does not give the Russian 
authorities any incentive to show more respect for the rights of 
the Chechen who are now being attacked by the Russian army?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, everyone knows that I raised the issue of the people of 
Chechnya with President Yeltsin, and I told him personally that 
his government's attitude did nothing to further Russia's 
interests in the world.
<P>
	We were there to celebrate the 50th anniversary of V-E Day. 
The Russians made an exceptional contribution since 27 million 
Russians died during the war. We accepted the invitation as a 
matter of course.
<P>
	My colleagues in the Western world and myself refused to 
attend the military parade, but we agreed to attend a parade of 
veterans who fought during the last war. To show our 
disapproval of what is now happening in one part of Russia, we 
boycotted their biggest parade.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
prepared to accept the Prime Minister's reply, but if he really 
wanted the Russian authorities to take seriously his concerns 
about human rights violations in Chechnya, why did the Prime 
Minister not tell them in advance that he would refuse to attend 
the military parade, as a form of protest, like other heads of state 
who were not afraid to speak out?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I made it quite clear, although I may not have had a 
chance to announce my intentions publicly, but in 
communications with other heads of state, we agreed we would 
boycott this big military parade, and we did. The Russian 
government was well aware that Canada would not attend this 
parade.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Prime Minister said President Yeltsin gave him assurances that 
the Russian army had already been replaced by a normal police 
force in Chechnya. However, immediately after his departure 
from Russia, the Russian army was again bombing Chechen 
civilians.
<P>
	Considering the false assurances the Prime Minister received 
from the Russian head of state, how does his government intend 
to put pressure on the Russian authorities to stop human rights 
violations in Chechnya?
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have protested on several occasions. My colleague, 
the Minister of Foreign Affairs, brought this matter up several 
times with his Russian counterpart. We are putting as much 
pressure as possible on the government. And if the problem 
persists, I will have another opportunity to launch a protest 
when I meet Mr. Yeltsin in Halifax next month.

submission this company made to the government dictating the 
steps to be taken to reverse the CRTC's decision allowing 
Expressvu to begin broadcasting as early as next September but

the order be tabled in the House before April 24 to prevent 
Power DirecTv from being put at a disadvantage?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, although this information is a little dated, I am pleased 
to answer the hon. member's question. If he had read the 
document, he would have noticed that we did not follow Power 
DirecTv's recommendations. In fact, we received many other 
recommendations in that period. We did not accept all of the 
suggestions of Power DirecTv, but we did accept all of those 
made by the Consumers' Association of Canada. The 
recommendations we accepted were the ones made by that 
association.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, that is a 
very interesting explanation, but let us look at the facts. And, 
given the appearances, the minister should find this case 
indecent.
<P>
	Does he not find it indecent that Power DirecTV, a company 
owned by the Prime Minister's son-in-law, not only tried to 
instruct the government on how to settle an issue to its 
satisfaction, but that worse yet, the government, we have every 
indication to believe, scrupulously followed its orders and 
issued a decision tailored to the requests of the company?
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.

<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will repeat for the hon. member. He seems to have 
failed to read a document which I think has been in the public 
domain.
<P>
	Certainly others have quoted from this submission received 
by the government from Power Direct, one of many received 
after the expert panel's report was tabled. In the case of this one, 
which asked that we make changes to the direction and table it 
on April 24, he will know we did not make changes to the 
direction and we did not table it until April 26.
<P>
	On many important elements we did not take its 
recommendations. What we acted on were the very general and 
very supportive recommendations of the Consumers 
Association of Canada, Friends of Canadian Broadcasting, 
ACTRA, et cetera. We took our recommendations from people 
who are concerned about competition in this field in Canada.

	Last Friday Mr. Mosley, the assistant deputy minister, stated 
consultation with the James Bay Cree took place when the 
government provided the country with its white paper on 
firearms control and through the issuance of Bill C-68. He 
denied that constitutional rights of aboriginal people had been 
violated.
<P>
	Is the justice minister's definition of a consultation the mere 
provision of what he intends to do with firearms legislation? 
Does this explain why he has stated repeatedly he has consulted 
with various groups and individuals including the James Bay 
Cree, the attorneys general of Saskatchewan, Alberta and 
Manitoba and the ministers of justice from Yukon and the 
Northwest Territories, who have all stated they were not 
consulted by the justice minister?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I engaged in 
consultation for many months before tabling last November 30 
the government's proposals, before tabling Bill C-68 on 
February 14 of this year.
<P>
<B>(1425 ) </B>
<P>
	This consultation was not done through officials. It was not 
done through publishing an options document. It was done 
personally by my visiting all 10 provinces and both territories to 
meet with national, regional and local firearms groups as well as 
representatives of aboriginal communities.
<P>
	The views we heard during that consultation process were 
carefully and fully reflected in the legislation we put before 
Parliament.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
letter signed by Ovide Mercredi to the minister. He says: ``For 
God's sake, respect our rights''.
<P>
	Bill C-68 has some draconian search and seizure provisions. 
The police are given enormous powers and discretion to inspect 
for firearms and search and seize without warrant. At one time 
Canada had writs of assistance which were in effect permanent, 
blanket search warrants. They were withdrawn and these kinds 
of searches are no longer allowed.
<P>
	Is the minister intending to bring back something even more 
reprehensible than writs of assistance through his so-called 
inspection provisions?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am fully aware of the 
hon. member's recent enthusiasm for aboriginal rights as well as 
his recent discovery of the importance of the Canadian Charter 
of Rights and Freedoms.
<P>
	He is a very hard working member of the very parliamentary 
committee now hearing witnesses and examining clause by 
clause the provisions of the bill. If he has a constructive 
suggestion with respect to the implementation of this act in a 
fashion sensitive to aboriginal traditions and customs, I hope he 
will make it in committee and we will listen.

	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the worst

with the native people and then violate those very agreements.
<P>
	There is growing concern from groups about many aspects of 
the bill. The Canadian Bar Association and the Canadian Civil 
Liberties Associations are both concerned about Bill C-68. The 
Canadian Bar Association will publicly elaborate its concerns 
regarding the constitutionality of the so-called inspection, 
search and seizure powers.
<P>
	Is the justice minister still confident his bill is constitutional 
in every respect?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> I am, Mr. Speaker, but the very 
purpose of having hearings before a committee is to enable 
groups such as those referred to by the hon. member to come 
forward and express their views.
<P>
	I have had no doubt from the beginning the bill can be 
improved by that process. I listened with interest to the views 
expressed to date and I will listen with interest to the views to be 
expressed by the Canadian Bar Association.
<P>

with respect to the inspection procedures or others we are very 
happy to have those proposals. We will take the proposals from

	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last week the Minister of Transport suggested he might 
cancel the problematic air traffic control computerization 
contract with Hughes Aircraft. Now he has apparently offered 
the company more than a hundred million taxpayer dollars to 
supply a system inferior to that in the original contract.
<P>
	How does the minister justify his about face, which will 
actually reward a company for not living up to its government 
contract?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the difficulties with Hughes on that contract are well 
known. As the hon. member has raised in the House and as I have 
agreed, we have to find a way out of that. It is a very difficult and 
complex question.
<P>
	It is a very odd situation to have the hon. member now suggest 
that we should cancel the contract when has been such a stout 
defender of the Pearson contract.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister did not hesitate to cancel the Pearson 
airport contract without producing a single item of evidence of 
wrongdoing.
<P>
	Hughes is a year and a half behind schedule. It has stated that 
it cannot provide what it contracted to provide the government 
with and it wants even more money for what it does supply.
<P>
	If Hughes insists on more money for an inferior system, why 
does the minister not either approach an alternate bidder or 
simply retender the air traffic control contract altogether?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there have been millions of dollars spent already on 
this contract. I agree with the hon. member that the contract is 
not being delivered on schedule and that it is over budget.
<P>
	We are negotiating with Hughes to try to find a solution to the 
problem. The hon. member would know that the contract was 
entered into a number of years ago. It came to my attention that 
there were problems with it and I immediately informed the 
auditor general of my concerns. I have discussed the matter with 
my deputy minister. We are going to try to find a solution to it.

<P>
	After testifying before the commission on Quebec's future, 
Pierre Laberge, a retired member of the RCMP and CSIS, has 
now been barred from their Montreal headquarters, where the 
association of former RCMP and CSIS members holds its

Chamberland, the current director of CSIS for the Quebec 
region.
<P>

measures against a retired employee simply because he took part 
in the proceedings of the commission on Quebec's future?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the association of former RCMP members is a private 
organization that does not report to the government. It makes its

<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
understand that the RCMP building comes under the

<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House

internal management matter that concerns the RCMP. It is a

Yet we are informed that the defence department, 16 months

years behind schedule and massively over the agreed contract 
price, signed a $70 million deal for a military version of the

a system that does not meet the original specifications? Why did 
he proceed with this project?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence

I addressed this question on Friday.
<P>
	The air traffic control system is primarily being developed 
under the auspices of the Department of Transport, and it 
appeared only logical for the former government to have the 
defence air traffic control systems at Canadian military bases 
developed in co-operation with that being developed by the 
Department of Transport.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr.

the department estimates its internal costs alone will add $106

many questions about its capabilities?
<P>

we have to emphasize that this contract was initiated by the

<P>
	After Quebec's National Assembly unanimously passed a bill 
providing for the automatic collection of child support, the 
minister said on April 25 that, in the coming weeks, he would 
propose measures to enforce child support orders.
<P>

already in effect in several provinces including Quebec?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney

House some days ago concerning the government's intention to 
announce shortly its proposals with respect to child support in

strategy for enforcement of orders requiring the payment of 
child support.
<P>
	I can give the hon. member my assurance that we share the 
objectives of the Government of Quebec and other provincial 
governments that have put in place methods to increase the level 
of compliance with such orders. We will not be working at cross 
purposes; rather, our intention will be to collaborate to ensure 
that our efforts work together to achieve what we both have in

<P>

	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney

determination of the amounts of child support, we have 
signalled to the provinces a preparedness to see separate 
provincial formulae if there is a good need to have different 
amounts, so long as they are the same in purpose and principle. 
Second, as I mentioned, we are happy to work and I believe we 
are already working closely with provincial officials in 
developing enforcement methods that are complementary.

<P>

today is the first day of a six-month tour in the former

sparked the inquiry has been removed from the picture.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of National Defence. Is it not 
as obvious to the minister as it is to the Somalia commission and 
to members of the House that Major Armstrong being posted to 
this war zone compromises the investigation into the events in 
Somalia?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence

absolutely not.

forces personnel are required as part of their duties to be 
deployed from time to time outside the country.
<P>
	If the commission wishes to have Major Armstrong or anyone 
else testify before the inquiry, it has to ask the person to come.

Yes, Mr. Speaker, I can confirm for the hon. member that we will

<P>
	There has been no change of policy. In response to the very 
thorough review of the parliamentary committee we have 
expressed in our presentations the various goals we want to 
pursue in foreign policy.
<P>

we believe in. Certainly we believe in respect for human beings

foreign policy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr.

circumstances to make sure human rights are upheld around the

	Will the minister say that there will continue to be a link 
between human rights and trade policy? If he will not that is a 
flip-flop.

use the good rapport to promote human rights and influence 
governments to change their policies and to accept our values

<B>(1455 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
is the Minister of Foreign Affairs saying he rejects that 
possibility with respect to any country guilty of severe human 
rights violations, whether it be Burma in the present or South 
Africa in the past? The government from now on will rely on 
good rapport that is supposed to be established between 
countries as a result of trade? Or, is he still open to the 
possibility of using trade sanctions as a way of upholding human 
rights around the world?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is quite clear that in some cases, through the 
United Nations, when all countries accept the imposition of 
trade sanctions as happened in South Africa, Canada has 
certainly joined others and supported the measures.
<P>
	To try to be a boy scout on our own, to impose our own rules 
on others when nobody else is following, is absolutely 
counterproductive and does not lead to any successful future. 
Therefore it is quite clear that our approach, the multiplicity of

copyright protection policy.
<P>
	Since the heritage minister is now waiting for his colleague 
from justice, could the Minister of Justice tell us if he plans to 
introduce this bill for consideration by this House before the 
summer recess?
<P>
<B>(1500 ) </B>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I cannot say. I am not 
sure that I know the timing of the proposals. I do know that 
officials in my department have been communicating with 
Heritage Canada and are at work in preparing proposals to 
improve the copyright law. As to timing, I am not able to answer 
the hon. member. Perhaps I will inquire of my colleague and let 
her know in the next day or two.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Sherbrooke.

	<B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my colleagues for the usual reception.
<P>
	On Saturday I met with a group of truckers in Nova Scotia 
concerning Highway 104. They were protesting the diversion of 
$26 million in funds from the federal-provincial agreement to 
upgrade the highway for safety reasons among others and to 
encourage interprovincial trade.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Given the fact that this 
diversion has been denounced by the auditor general of Nova 
Scotia as not conforming to the agreement signed between both 
governments, will the Prime Minister rein in his minister of 
public works so that he stops sending money to his own riding at 
the detriment of the safety of the highways in Nova Scotia?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to welcome the leader of the fifth party back for 
his monthly appearance.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am sure the hon. minister is going to get to his 
answer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Young:</B> Mr. Speaker, I can only say that had the member 
been tuned in, he would have known that the question has been 
raised in the House on a number of occasions by members of the 
Reform Party. As I indicated to them and as I want to advise my 
hon. colleague now, the decision to build highways in Nova 
Scotia is a decision of the Government of Nova Scotia. The 
report to which my hon. colleague refers is a report by the 
auditor general of Nova Scotia.
<P>
	It is not unheard of and certainly no precedent for this 
government to be able to reallocate funds and to be flexible 
enough to recognize realities, whether that occurs in 
Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick or in 
Nova Scotia. Under these agreements funds have been 
reallocated.
<P>
	Any beef the hon. member has would be with the few 
colleagues he still has in Nova Scotia in the opposition there.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> This brings to a close the question period. I do 
have a point of privilege from the hon. member for Prince 
Albert-Churchill River.

	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Prince Albert-Churchill River, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on Friday the member for North 
Island-Powell River made the following statement about me:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Speaker, the member for Prince Albert was adopted by binding 
aboriginal ceremony into the Bird family of the Montreal Lake Bank in a 
powwow about two years ago. Roy Bird, the chief of the band, is an important 
player in this family. The member for Prince Albert has been co-opted by the 
minister and is defending these negotiations with his adopted family.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Will the minister not agree that he has placed this member, knowingly or 
unknowingly, in a conflict of interest situation?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I have been accused by the hon. member from the Reform 
Party of being in a conflict of interest situation. I feel that these 
accusations have very serious moral and legal implications 
<P>

<B><A NAME="12602"> 12602 </A></B>
<P>
impacting and affecting my ability to adequately function as a 
member of Parliament.
<P>
	I would like to make very clear that even if this suggestion 
made by the hon. member were true, this is nothing more than an 
honour bestowed by a community upon an individual.
<P>
	So that the Reform Party can understand what this type of 
ceremony would be about, it would be like receiving a citizen of 
the year award from the chamber of commerce. It would be like 
getting an Order of Canada from the Government of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1505) </B>
<P>
	I would suggest this would simply be an honour bestowed by a 
community upon an individual and is not grounds for any 
conflict. Even more important, this honour was never bestowed 
upon me in the first place. I wish to say I do not know where the 
hon. member would get such a statement.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, whether or not you view that my privileges have 
been violated, I would like the hon. member for North 
Island-Powell River to publicly withdraw the comments and 
apologize to the people of Canada for making statements that in 
some parts of the country damage positive race relations. This is 
the new politics promised by the Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, this point of privilege rises out of 
one that was raised on Friday. At that time the hon. member was 
not here to defend himself and that is why I waited until today to 
hear what the hon. member had to say.
<P>
	It would seem to me at first blush that this is not a point of 
privilege; it is surely a point of debate and clarification. Many 
times when these statements are made, they are made in good 
faith, and I have to believe that they are because hon. members 
are just that, hon. members.
<P>
	I do not think the hon. member for North Island-Powell 
River is here today. If we could let this sit until tomorrow, I want 
to take a look at everything that was said. I want also to review 
the video. If it is necessary, I will come back to the House but at 
this point it would seem to me this is not a question of privilege.

<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to introduce to the 
House today my private member's bill entitled an act to amend 
the Food and Drug Act, re lactose warning labels.
<P>
	This bill amends the Food and Drugs Act by ensuring that any 
packaged food or drug that contains lactose and is intended to be 
sold and used by the public is packaged in containers labelled 
with a warning that it contains lactose and may be harmful to 
persons with lactose intolerance.
<P>
<B>(1510 ) </B>
<P>
	Lactose intolerance is a condition that affects one out of five 
Canadians, which is about six million of the population. I hope 
all members will take the time to carefully review this bill and 
come to the realization that the proper labelling of food 
containing lactose would certainly assist at least six million 
Canadians.

	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 36 I wish to present a petition that 
has been circulated across Canada. This particular petition has 
been signed by a number of petitioners from the Oakville, 
Ontario area.
<P>
	The petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the 
House that managing the family home and caring for preschool 
children is an honourable profession which has not been 
recognized for its value to our society. They also state that the 
Income Tax Act discriminates against families who make the 
choice to

<P>
provide care in the home for preschool children, the disabled, 
the chronically ill or the aged.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call upon Parliament to 
pursue initiatives to eliminate tax discrimination against 
families who decide to provide care in the home for preschool 
children, the disabled, the chronically ill or the aged.

<P>
	The petitioners call upon Parliament to oppose any

Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 36, I am pleased to 
present a petition today from 385 British Columbian 
constituents many of whom are from my riding of New 
Westminster-Burnaby.
<P>
	The petitioners make it known in their petition that they are 
overburdened with taxation due to high government spending. 
Therefore they pray and request that Parliament reduce 
government spending instead of increasing taxes and implement 
a taxpayer protection act to limit federal spending.
<P>
	By presenting this petition, these petitioners have displayed 
their responsibility to help Canada get out of this fiscal crisis. I 
wish to concur with this petition.

Mr. Speaker, I have a second petition today signed and started by 
a constituent of mine, Shelly Siwack of New Westminster.
<P>
	Fifty-seven petitioners signed the petition in order to voice 
their opposition to Bill C-41 and urge members of the House of 
Commons to not give passage to the bill.
<P>
	The petitioners pray that Parliament not amend the Canadian 
Human Rights Act or the charter of rights and freedoms in any 
way that would tend to indicate societal approval of same sex 
relationships or homosexuality, including amending the human 
rights act to include in the prohibited grounds of discrimination, 
the undefined phrase sexual orientation.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Roger Simmons (Burin-St. George's, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 52, I am requesting that you 
grant leave to move the adjournment of the House for the 
purpose of discussing a matter requiring urgent consideration, 
the damaging and misleading statements made by the leader of 
the third party in New Brunswick on Thursday, which I became 
aware of late Friday-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I received notice from the hon. member, as 
procedure requires. I believe the hon. member stated he wanted 
to have an emergency debate on the fisheries and not on the 
statements made about the fisheries.
<P>
	I wonder if the hon. member would limit himself to debate or 
at least to putting forth his points on debate on the fisheries if 
that is what he wants to do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> Mr. Speaker, my next sentence was that the 
fishery in Atlantic Canada is a $1.6 billion export industry; $1.6 
billion is a far cry from suggestions that the fishery is over.
<P>
	Given the morale situation in Atlantic Canada right now and 
given the importance of the fishery and the confidence issue that 
is important to the fishery at this very difficult time, I feel it is 
timely to have a full fledged debate on the issue to set the record 
straight, to ensure false and misleading information is not 
undermining the confidence of a very vibrant industry 
employing tens of thousands of people in Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, that is my application. I hope you will give it 
your consideration.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SPEAKER'SRULING">SPEAKER'S RULING</A></H4>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> To the hon. member with all respect, the 
fisheries question in Canada on both coasts is one of great 
importance to all of us in the House and to all Canadians.
<P>
	However, I suggest the hon. member might have avenues to 
pursue that other than an emergency debate. It seems to me at 
this time at least an emergency debate on that topic would not be 
in order.
<P>
	I thank him for his intervention on behalf of his constituents 
and for the work he is doing in that regard.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="VETERANSREVIEWANDAPPEALBOARDACT">VETERANS REVIEW AND APPEAL BOARD ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from May 12 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-67, an act to establish the Veterans Review and 
Appeal Board, to amend the Pension Act, to make consequential 
amendments to other acts and to repeal the Veterans Appeal 
Board Act, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> When we last debated this matter the 
hon. member for Nanaimo-Cowichan had the floor. He has 15 
minutes remaining in his intervention.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, because there has been a lapse of several days I remind 
all that Bill C-67 is the Veterans Appeal and Review Board Act 
and that the purpose of Bill C-67 is to reduce the existing 
backlog of appeal pension cases and to shorten decision time on 
first application.
<P>
<B>(1520 ) </B>
<P>
	If it succeeds it will merge two existing bodies, the Canadian 
Pension Commission and the Veterans Appeal Board, and first 
decisions on veterans cases will be made by the Department of 
Veterans Affairs, and the bureau of pension advocates will 
become part of the department and will work only on 
preparation of appeals.
<P>
	My unease with Bill C-67 stems from two sources. The first is 
the change of position of the bureau of pension advocates. This 
has long been an extremely important first level of contact for 
veterans who have a case to make. To move it to the second level 
is totally unacceptable. The second unease I have concerns what 
I shall call the leadership factor in the Departments of National 
Defence and Veterans Affairs.
<P>
	Reaction to need within those departments has historically 
been very slow. I do contend that at the sharp end of the 
Department of National Defence, when we are talking about our 
troops, it is very good. Its reaction time is good and it is flexible. 
The farther we move in the chain of things behind the front line, 
the more the bureaucracy is involved and the slower the 
reaction. The bill's purpose is admirable but if the effect of the 
bill will be to increase the size of the bureaucracy then I cannot 
believe it will achieve its aim.
<P>
	When I spoke to the bill very briefly last week I pointed out 
delays of 40 and 50 years in recognizing our veterans' 
accomplishments. The merchant navy waited for 50 years for 
recognition. The veterans of Dieppe have waited for over 50 
years and are finally receiving a simple clasp for a medal. The 
veterans of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12605"> 12605 </A></B>
<P>
the Korean operation have waited for well over 40 years to 
achieve something. Other veterans of peacekeeping operations  
are still waiting. There was a proposal from this side of the 
House, supported by some members opposite, that there be a 
Canadian volunteer service medal produced for peacekeepers. 
However, I am sorry to say that was rejected by the House. There 
is certainly a slowness in recognition.
<P>
	The other side of this impasse in national defence I started to 
illustrate the other day when I spoke about problems with 
hearing loss of members of the Canadian forces. Way back 
when, and we are talking a long time ago, when I was on the rifle 
ranges we wore no ear protectors. It took literally years for the 
Department of National Defence to come up with protection for 
the troops on the ranges firing weapons. It took even longer for 
any recognition of the fault of the Department of National 
Defence to be echoed by the Department of Veterans Affairs 
when veterans applied for hearing aids. The departments 
dragged their feet. That is a syndrome visible within national 
defence and veterans affairs.
<P>
	Another example is the atomic energy corporation of Chalk 
River. There were spills of radioactive materials. There was a 
spill of the main reactor in Chalk River in the 1950s. People like 
Jimmy Carter, not then the president of the United States but a 
midshipman at Annapolis, came up to help clean up that spill. I 
was there. I had some illness presumably attributable to 
exposure to radiation. I tried to declare this on my release from 
the forces but it was not even accepted by national defence and 
veterans affairs.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	There is the gulf war syndrome. Our troops were in the 
Persian gulf several years ago and some of them have 
complained of a variety of symptoms. The same thing has 
happened in the United States. The American veterans 
administration has acknowledged and labelled the problem as 
the gulf war syndrome. It has set up a registry at veterans affairs 
across the United States where all gulf war veterans 
complaining of health problems can get a complete physical 
examination. There has been acknowledgement of it in the 
United States. Here there has been nothing yet. We are still 
looking at the problem.
<P>
	I am not in a position to say there is such a thing as an illness 
contracted whether it is from the oilfields, nerve gas or from 
anything there. What I am saying is national defence and 
veterans affairs invariably drag their feet in recognizing there 
are problems.
<P>
	There are sufficient symptoms displayed by veterans that it 
should not be a problem. The symptoms include loss of memory, 
aches in the joints, night sweats, severe headaches, loss of hair, 
confusion, reproductive problems, stress within family, 
attention disorder, fatigue, abnormal rashes, bleeding gums, 
irritability, breathing problems and so on. They are surely 
sufficient for our people to say get it out in the open and tackle 
this thing and either put it to rest and say there is no such thing as 
gulf war syndrome or there is and these are the attributes we 
recognize.
<P>
	I have a letter from the vice-president of the Canadian 
Peacekeeping Veterans Association. He is reporting on the gulf 
war syndrome problem: ``This report would be more extensive 
had I received all of the information I am waiting for. Please 
advise me if you would like me to keep you informed of any new 
developments. Our methods of gaining information are very 
tedious, as we are a non-profit organization that must rely on the 
mail system, etc. We do not have the funds to travel to interview 
the individuals in question. We also have full time employment 
and must conduct this type of research after hours. Don't get me 
wrong, we do this research because we believe in what we do. 
We must help our fellow veterans. We would like eventually to 
conduct an interview or have a questionnaire completed by our 
gulf war veterans and their spouses. This would certainly 
enlighten us as to the situation with regard to that''.
<P>
	My point is veterans affairs and national defence should take 
more initiative, should exercise leadership and show our serving 
soldiers and veterans that they are interested and lay some of 
these problems to rest.
<P>
	We have other examples of the same thing. Somalia and the 
use of mefloquine is another such example. Mefloquine is a drug 
used as a malaria inhibitor. Years ago, I will not say how many, 
when I was in Korea we used paludrine which had certain side 
effects but nothing to the extent that apparently mefloquine 
does. My colleague from Delta brought this up in the last six 
months. He has asked for an investigation into the effects 
mefloquine may have had on Canadian troops serving in 
Somalia. He cited specifically Trooper Kyle Brown who, as we 
all know, has been put into prison, and Master Corporal Clayton 
Matchee and the men of the Canadian Airborne Regiment.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	I understand this drug is still in use to this day in Somalia in 
spite of questions about its appropriateness. Apparently 
Canadian troops in Somalia were given heavy doses weekly of 
mefloquine which, as I say, is used as protection against 
malaria. However, the drug is well known to have neurological 
side effects. The manufacturer's literature states that reactions 
are rare but include convulsions, psychosis, nightmares, 
dizziness, headaches, confusion, anxiety and depression.
<P>
	The Canadian medical personnel in Somalia reported that 
Canadian troops experienced these side effects. In fact, the day 
the drug was administered in Somalia was known as psycho 
Tuesday.
<P>
	In view of reports like this, I would expect that the 
Department of National Defence-and I lump veterans affairs in 
with it for this purpose-would show more leadership by taking 
the initiative to say: ``Let us put a stop to nonsense like this. Let 
us put a stop to the stories. We will determine accurately 
whether mefloquine can continue to be administered, what its 
side 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12606"> 12606 </A></B>
<P>
effects are, when it can and cannot be used, what its effects are 
with liquor and so on''. We need to put these things to rest.
<P>
	In conclusion, I find that leadership in national defence, 
lumped in with veterans affairs, is lacking today. We have been 
looking at a great many problems over the last year: Somalia, 
the disbandment of the airborne regiment and the videos 
pertaining to that, the reduction in the size of the forces, 
equipment problems, morale problems brought out in the 
Oehring report, having to do more with less in the way of 
equipment and troops as brought out by Brigadier-General 
Jeffries' report from Petawawa, the Fowler-Doyle-Létourneau 
incident, the Somalia inquiry and the staffing of the inquiry 
itself, the Bosnia-Croatia decisions, suicides in the forces and, 
more recently, the block of access to information problems. All 
of these things tell me that there are leadership problems in 
national defence.
<P>
	When I look at those problems and the foot dragging that goes 
on, I say that Bill C-67 should be really looked at very carefully. 
It should not be proceeded with in its present form. I am 
absolutely against the relegation of the bureau of pension 
advocates to a review position. This is not going to help the 
veterans. The burgeoning bureaucracy that will be created by the 
combining of two levels is going to be bad news once again for 
the veterans and their administration.
<P>
	Therefore, I speak negatively on this bill. The purpose of Bill 
C-67 is laudable but its implementation, I am sorry to say, may 
not do what we want for the veterans who are having problems.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very happy to rise and speak in the debate today on 
Bill C-67.
<P>
	For the benefit of those viewing this at home, Bill C-67 has to 
do with the review procedure for pensions of people who 
represented and fought for our country in the last world war. It is 
apropos that we should be speaking about this having just gone 
through the victory in Europe celebrations and remembrances 
last week.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	As we discuss the bill concerning pension reform we should 
keep in mind that the average age of those involved is 74 years. 
That means that the motivation for the government to proceed 
with this bill now is to try to speed up the process.
<P>
	When we want to find out how things affect veterans in our 
country it makes sense to go to the Royal Canadian Legion. As 
everyone knows, the Royal Canadian Legion by and large speaks 
for veterans. To some degree it is supportive of the bill. Its 
concern has to do with four basic facts. It wants to see that these 
four basic principles in the adjudication of pension disputes are 
met.
<P>
	First, it wants to preserve the benefits and services provided 
to veterans. That goes without saying. It does not want to see this 
reduced in any way.
<P>
	Second, there is a need to protect the benefit of the doubt 
provision. If the bureau of pensions is to err on one side or the 
other then it would err for the benefit of the applicant.
<P>
	The third principle is to ensure an independence of advocacy 
and adjudication. Members should keep that in mind.
<P>
	The fourth principle is to achieve the necessary speed and 
generosity to ensure that pensions and other benefits are 
received by the veterans when they are entitled to them.
<P>
	The Royal Canadian Legion believes these four basic 
principles should be upheld by the bureau of pensions. Further it 
has two basic problems with the bill. They are the levels of 
expertise to be afforded the applicant at the first application 
level under the new system and the need to maintain continuity 
of process between the first application and any subsequent 
review or appeal.
<P>
	Members may know, but many people watching may not be 
aware, that when a veteran appeals for a pension it is a two-step 
process. If the pension is applied for and granted, that is the end 
of it. However only 30 per cent of veterans who apply receive a 
pension after the first round. Therefore, most of them go to 
appeal.
<P>
	When veterans are talking about the continuity of process, 
they are saying it makes sense for their advocates at the first 
level to also be their advocates at the second level at appeal.
<P>
	It is interesting that of the 70 per cent who are rejected at first 
application and go on to appeal, fully 80 per cent of applications 
appealed are granted. That would be the benefit of the doubt. 
Therefore, the vast majority who apply for a veterans pension 
get it. Keep in mind that they are 74 years of age.
<P>
	If we follow the logic of the whole process as I have described 
it, a veteran, whose average age is 74, requests a pension. Thirty 
per cent receive it and 70 per cent do not. Of those who do not 
receive it and appeal, 80 per cent end up winning their appeal. A 
lot of those would be based on the benefit of the doubt provision 
which is one of the four principles the Royal Canadian Legion 
particularly would like to have.
<P>
	Another principle the Royal Canadian Legion has identified is 
the importance of an independent adjudicator. That is the 
Achilles' heel of the legislation.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	The government has stated a number of times that the goal of 
the legislation is to speed up the time it takes a veteran to get a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12607"> 12607 </A></B>
<P>
disability pension without the veteran losing any of the rights 
the veteran currently possesses. That is a very laudable 
objective. However, we have identified a serious deficiency in 
the bill.
<P>
	The disagreement centres on whether the bureau of pension 
advocates should remain an independent body at the disposal of 
veterans at the first level or whether it should be made part of the 
department reserved for appeal level only. If 30 per cent of the 
applicants get their pension and on appeal 80 per cent win, why 
are we not making the gates a little wider at the beginning?
<P>
	A number of arguments were made in the Standing Committee 
on National Defence and Veterans Affairs and in the House in 
this regard and they have been reviewed extensively. After 
consideration I have concluded that the bureau of pension 
advocates should remain an independent body at the exclusive 
disposal of the veterans. Why? I fail to see how removing the 
bureau from the first level will save any time in the current 
system. The only way to speed up the system is to ensure that 
more applications are accepted at the first level.
<P>
	If 80 per cent of the appeals are granted, why not grant more 
of them at the first level? These applications must be well 
prepared in the future because the department currently rejects 
70 per cent but goes on to accept 80 per cent on appeal. The 
typical time it takes for a lawyer to prepare an application is two 
to three months, a modest period of time to prepare a case when 
the veteran is forced to battle the department to receive a 
disability pension. The remaining delays at the first level, which 
can take up to a year and a half, are the responsibility of the 
department.
<P>
	The problem is not with the veteran or with the lawyer who 
prepares the application, the problem is with the department. 
Much of that was identified earlier by my colleague who went 
through a step by step process of showing how the application 
goes from Ottawa, gets copied and then ends up in Prince 
Edward Island because the former government decided to put 
the bureau in Prince Edward Island.
<P>
	Ironically, the government feels that removing the bureau 
from the first level will speed up the system because it will focus 
on appeals only. Under the legislation the government intends to 
have departmental clerks assist the veteran in filling out the first 
level application. That is a potential problem which the Royal 
Canadian Legion identified because it is the skill and the 
proficiency with which the first application is completed that 
will determine its acceptance.
<P>
	The first level decision would then be adjudicated within the 
department. It could be true that the first level decision would be 
faster, but would the acceptance rate be higher than the existing 
norm of 30 per cent? Given the department's past record of 
rejecting 70 per cent of first level applications, I doubt it. If the 
veteran then has to appeal the case he has to go to a bureau 
lawyer who would work directly for the department.
<P>
	The current system is that an outside, independent lawyer who 
is acting on behalf of the veteran, makes the application and then 
follows through with the appeal. Under the new system a 
departmental clerk will complete the application and only if the 
application is refused would the lawyer go to work to prepare an 
appeal for the applicant, which would take a further two to three 
months. The veterans say that streamlining of the whole process 
is in large measure due to how well the first application is put 
together.
<P>
	If the government intends to focus all of the bureau's 
resources at the appeal level, then it is obvious that the first level 
acceptance rate will not increase. The majority of veterans will 
still have to wait years to get their disability pensions, and we 
must remember that their average age is 74 years.
<P>
	If the process is to be speeded up the first level acceptance 
rate must be increased so that there will be fewer appeals. The 
way to accomplish this is twofold. First, have the first level 
application expertly completed by a bureau lawyer so that the 
veteran's case is solid. Second, the department should consider 
the success rate for past appeals, which is 80 per cent, and use 
the benefit of the doubt provision more liberally to increase first 
level acceptance. This two-track approach would substantially 
speed up the system and serve best the interests of the veterans. I 
know that it is serving the interests of the veterans that all 
members of this House and indeed all Canadians are firmly 
committed to achieving.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	While the intent in this bill is certainly a step in the right 
direction, as with much legislation that comes before this House 
there are certain aspects of it that could be substantially 
improved. I draw again on the suggestions made by the Royal 
Canadian Legion that the four paramount underpinnings of the 
foundation of the veterans' appeal must be to preserve and 
protect the benefits and services provided to the veterans of 
Canada; to protect the benefit of the doubt provision; to ensure 
an independent advocate; and to achieve the necessary speed 
and generosity to ensure that our veterans, whose average age is 
74 years, are honestly and fairly dealt with.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is indeed a privilege to address the House with 
regard to Bill C-67 on third reading of the Veterans Appeal and 
Review Board Act.
<P>
	In the last few days our attention has been focused on the men 
and women who served our country so valiantly 50 years ago, 
men and women who left family and friends to fight for 
freedom, democracy, and peace. As I and thousands and perhaps 
millions of other Canadians witnessed the V-E Day celebrations 
here in Ottawa and on television from Europe last week, it 
evoked emotions of pride for this country and respect for all 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12608"> 12608 </A></B>
<P>
those who served here and abroad. While we have honoured 
these veterans through pomp and ceremony, we have failed in  
many cases to provide them with the compensation that is due 
them.
<P>
	I want to briefly refer to a couple of incidents that happened in 
my riding. First, there was a huge air show in the city of 
Lloydminster last week where we were able to show off both 
military and domestic planes in a huge air show. It was a 
success. The Snowbirds were involved. Of course they are based 
at the Moose Jaw airbase. They were very well received.
<P>
	A couple of days later there was another event in my riding. It 
too occurred in the city of Lloydminster. It was sponsored by the 
Kinsmen and the Kinnettes. It was a raising of the flag 
ceremony. It was truly an honour for myself as well the mayor of 
Lloydminster and one of the MLAs from the area to be involved 
in the ceremony where annually they raise the flag and we 
reflect on our country and the democracy we enjoy and 
remember those who paid a heavy price for the democracy that 
we enjoy. There was a colour guard there and cadets present, as 
well as the Kinsmen and the Kinnettes and dignitaries.
<P>
	Following the raising of the Canadian flag and following the 
ceremonies I had an opportunity to meet with a couple of 
veterans. They were two brothers from the area who had just 
returned from the Netherlands and the celebrations over there. 
We were able to talk with them about their own experiences, 
first of all on the advancement into Europe when the liberation 
took place and then the recent trip over there. They expressed 
real emotion about the warm greetings and the warm reception 
they received from the people of Holland for the efforts they had 
been involved in 50 years before.
<P>
	As I spoke to one of these veterans, one of these brothers, he 
said he had not been able to stay the full time. He had not been 
involved in the entire liberation, he said, because he got hit a few 
times. He pointed to his left hip and said ``I got hit here first and 
then a little while later I got hit in this hip, and then finally they 
got me a little higher up, in the arm and the chest. After that they 
decided they had better send me home.''
<P>
	When we think of the commitment to democracy and we think 
of the commitment to Canada and what we stand for that was 
displayed by these veterans 50 years ago, it really humbles us 
who have not experienced the sacrifice and hardship that they 
did. It elevates in our minds the value of our veterans for their 
dedication and for their service to our country, and not only our 
country but democracy around the world.
<P>
	Just a few minutes ago we also listened to the member for 
Nanaimo-Cowichan as he also described some of the horrors of 
war both past and fairly recently, including the gulf war and the 
gulf war syndrome.
<P>
<B>(1550 ) </B>
<P>
	We realize that war is a terrible thing and that people are 
involved in it not because they enjoy it but because they feel a 
sense of duty and want to be involved for the pursuit of peace 
and democracy.
<P>
	We realize once again that we do owe them more than just a 
thank you for a job well done. We need to come through with 
more than just kind words and phrases, but with actions and 
deeds as well. That is why it is a privilege for me to speak to Bill 
C-67, the bill that deals with the Veterans Review and Appeal 
Board Act.
<P>
	The government has stated in this House a number of times 
that the goal of this legislation is to speed up the time it takes 
veterans to get their disability pensions without the veterans 
losing any of the rights they currently possess. This too is the 
aim of the Reform Party. Yet we disagree with the means to this 
end.
<P>
	One of the main points of disagreement centres on whether the 
Bureau of Pension Advocates should remain an independent 
body at the disposal of veterans at the first level or whether it 
should be made part of the department reserved for the appeal 
level only. A number of arguments have been made in the 
Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs 
and in this House as well in this regard. They have been 
reviewed extensively by my colleagues in the Reform Party, my 
fellow MPs who sit in this part of the House. After careful 
consideration we have concluded that the Bureau of Pension 
Advocates should remain an independent body at the disposal of 
all veterans.
<P>
	Let me explain. I fail to see how removing the bureau from the 
first level will save any time in the current system. The only way 
to speed up the system is to ensure that more applications are 
accepted at the first level. These applications must be well 
prepared, because the department currently rejects 70 per cent 
of first applications but then goes on to accept 80 per cent of 
appeals at the second or third levels.
<P>
	The typical time it takes for a bureau lawyer to prepare an 
application is two to three months, a modest period of time to 
prepare a case when the veteran is forced to do battle with the 
department to receive a disability pension. The remaining 
delays at the first level, which can take up to a year and a half, 
are the responsibility of the department. Ironically, the 
government feels that removing the bureau from the first level 
will speed up the system because they will now focus on appeals 
only.
<P>
	Under this legislation, the government intends to have a 
department clerk assist the veterans in filling out their first level 
application. The first level decision will then be adjudicated 
within the department. It could be true the first level decision 
will be faster, but will the acceptance rate be greater than the 
current 30 per cent? Given the department's past record of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12609"> 12609 </A></B>
<P>
rejecting 70 per cent of first level applications, I doubt if this 
will change. We have no  reason to believe that Bill C-67 will 
improve this situation.
<P>
	If the veteran then has to appeal his case, he will have to go to 
a bureau lawyer who works for the department directly. This 
lawyer, who answers to the minister, must start to prepare the 
appellant's case from scratch, which will take months or years, 
because there is nothing in this bill that will speed up the appeal 
process, which currently takes up to three and a half years.
<P>
	One gentleman who had served in the armed forces for a 
number of years waited approximately five years to receive a 
disability pension for military related injuries. This was after he 
had made several long trips for medical examinations for the 
appeal process and after he had written a number of letters to the 
department.
<P>
	Veterans are becoming increasingly frustrated, frustrated to 
the point that many are unwilling to go through the lengthy 
appeal process. How many bureaucratic hoops must these 
veterans jump through to receive what they are legally entitled 
to?
<P>
	If the government intends to focus all the bureau resources on 
the appeal level, it is obvious the first level acceptance rate will 
not increase. The majority of veterans will still have to wait 
years to get their disability pension. With an average age of 
veterans approaching 74, this is too little and too late.
<P>
	I firmly believe that if the process is to be speeded up, the first 
level acceptance rate must be increased so there are few appeals. 
The way to accomplish this is twofold: first, have the first level 
application expertly filled out by a bureau lawyer so the 
veteran's case is solid; second, the department should consider 
the success rate for past appeals, which is 80 per cent, and use 
the benefit of the doubt clause more liberally to increase the first 
level acceptance rate. This two-track approach would 
substantially speed up the system and serve the best interests of 
all veterans.
<P>
	The government in this piece of legislation has also proposed 
the merging of the Canadian Pension Commission and the 
Veterans Appeal Board. It has been implied that this 
amalgamation will streamline delivery and hence cut 
turnaround time for pensions in half and eliminate the backlog 
in two years. This is to be done without affecting veterans' 
benefits or appeal rights.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	As this House knows, the Reform Party is in favour of 
streamlining government and eliminating bureaucratic 
entanglements. However, there must be some guarantee that the 
veterans will receive what they are entitled to in the shortest 
period of time. As I have already noted, only 30 per cent of 
veterans' claims are accepted by the Canada Pension 
Commission, whereas 80 per cent of the appeals heard by the 
Veterans Appeal Board are accepted. Why is there such a 
discrepancy in the rulings of the two commissions?
<P>
	Currently the Canada Pension Commission has an 
independent policy from that of the Veterans Appeal Board to 
determine what constitutes a disability. With 70 per cent 
rejection of veterans' claims by the Canada Pension 
Commission, it is evidence that they have taken a more 
restrictive view of the assessment of disabilities than the 
Veterans Appeal Board.
<P>
	What position will the new amalgamated board take? Will it 
take a more restrictive position, as that of the Canadian Pension 
Commission, or will it take a more liberal position, as that of the 
Veterans Appeal Board? A more restrictive position taken by the 
board will undoubtedly increase the number of second appeals 
and lengthen the average turnaround time. Therefore it is 
essential that if the two boards amalgamate they adopt the more 
liberal policy of the Veterans Appeal Board. Any other position 
would adversely affect veterans' rights and benefits.
<P>
	In addition, there is some concern from veterans whether or 
not the proposed Veterans Review and Appeal Board will 
provide for a new and independent look at each of the levels or 
simply be a review and appeal process. Under the new board, 
commissioners may hear both reviews and appeals but not of the 
same case. The whole review and appeal process would lose its 
independent look. As a result, any appeal would essentially 
follow the department's stated policy and procedure. The checks 
and balances the two independent boards have provided would 
be lost. Further, there would be no reason for a veteran to appeal 
any decision made at the first level.
<P>
	We have given our veterans medals. We have honoured them 
in ceremonies, and rightly so. We have given our veterans 
parades. However, we have failed to provide our veterans with 
adequate financial compensation for their faithful and loyal 
service to this country when it was due.
<P>
	We in this House have a moral obligation to provide support to 
veterans in a reliable and timely manner. How else can we say 
thank you to those individuals who laid down their lives for us?

	The House resumed from May 8, consideration of Bill C-54, 
an act to amend the Old Age Security Act, the Canada pension 
plan, the Children's Special Allowances Act and the 
Unemployment Insurance Act, as reported (with amendments) 
from the committee; and of Motions Nos. 5, 6 and 7.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Because of circumstances, the hon. 
member for Calgary North has the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to speak on group No. 4, amendments 
to clause 23 of Bill C-54.
<P>
	For Canadians watching the debate, I will repeat that the bill 
is an attempt to make the administration of some of the 
government social services programs more streamlined, a little 
more user friendly, so to speak. We think that is a good idea but 
there is real concern expressed in this group of motions about 
the accountability in the administration of these acts.
<P>
	The Bloc has put forward two amendments to clause 23 and 
Reform has put forward one amendment to clause 23. In fact, 
that is the only amendment we have put forward on the entire 
bill.
<P>
	The purpose of our amendment is to ensure accountability of 
the administration of these new rules and procedures. We think 
it is right and proper that our citizens have access to these 
programs in a way that is not unduly bureaucratic and which 
removes as much red tape as possible. We are also very 
concerned that it also removes the accountability of the 
department and the administrators of the program from the 
people because it removes needed accountability to Parliament.
<P>
	We believe the amendment we are suggesting to the bill and to 
clause 23 specifically would make the system more accountable. 
We think they are very modest and sensible proposals. We have 
not put forward a number of amendments but we think the issue 
of accountability is so key and so necessary that we felt the 
amendment we put forward ought to be seriously considered and 
passed by the House.
<P>
	The amendment we have put forward is set out in today's 
Order Paper on page 17 under Motion No. 7.
<P>
	Essentially the motion calls for the minister to be required to 
make a report to the House every year within 30 days of the 
beginning of the fiscal year. The report would tally the 
overpayments under these programs, particularly CPP and OAS 
and the amount of the overpayments. At the very least, the 
minister and his department should be accountable to the House 
and therefore, to the Canadian people we represent.
<P>
	The House should know exactly how much the overpayment is 
because it really identifies administrative error, waste and 
inefficiency. If overpayments are being made, clearly the 
department is not doing its job very well. Overpayments, of 
course, very properly suggest these are payments over and 
above what should be made.
<P>
	It is necessary because the dollars available to assist people in 
need under programs are becoming more scarce, with the 
possibility of CPP going broke in the next few years. It is very 
important that the dollars available actually reach the people 
who are entitled to them. If dollars are going to people who are 
not entitled to them, then clearly some of the difficulties these 
programs are in will hit hardest the people who do need those 
moneys.
<P>
	Therefore, we think right after the beginning of the fiscal 
year, the minister should give a report to Parliament through the 
operating committee, of the administrative error that has taken 
place in the last fiscal year.
<P>
<B>(1605 ) </B>
<P>
	It is all very well for the minister to report the overpayment 
and the errors that have been made by his department, but then 
what happens? The report will then be considered by the 
appropriate committee and the committee will then decide to 
what level the minister may have leeway to overpay for the next 
year.
<P>
	For example, if the department has made overpayments under 
these programs of, say, $3 million the year before, the 
parliamentary committee may say to the department: ``This is 
simply unacceptable. We will make you accountable by putting 
a cap of only $1 million on the errors and overpayments you can 
make next year. We think that is plenty of room for error and we 
want you to operate in that range''. The committee then will 
decide how much margin for error that particular department 
can operate under.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12611"> 12611 </A></B>
<P>
	This is sensible and sound management of very scarce and 
needed dollars. It would give the minister a target and goal and 
some parameters within which to operate. This limit would be 
considered by a proper authority, which is Parliament itself.
<P>
	Someone running a business, a board of directors of a 
company, a school board, a union and even a household have to 
have some kind of budgetary parameters within which to 
operate. If there is an unlimited ability to overspend and to make 
errors in spending, two things happen. One is that the operation 
pretty soon does not operate on a sound fiscal basis and does not 
live within its means. The other is that money which is needed in 
other areas is simply not available because it has been wasted or 
not properly allocated in the area being considered.
<P>
	I think that this is nothing but a very sensible, sound and 
modest way of ensuring that there is some accountability in the 
spending of the department under this bill. Under these new 
proposals we can effectively judge how well and how sensibly 
the program is being run.
<P>
	Without this kind of accountability we lose a couple of things 
that are very important to sound management. One is the paper 
trail. There has to be some record kept of spending, where it has 
gone and why there has been overspending so that there can be a 
good assessment of how soundly things are being run. We also 
lose track of where the money is going. We do not want to do 
that. That is important not just because of some accounting 
fetish, but because money goes to people and the people who are 
entitled to the money need it and are entitled to know that is 
being well managed and put forward sensibly.
<P>
	I urge the House to adopt this motion put forward by the 
Reform Party. It enhances the bill. It enhances the service to 
people and enhances our need to be accountable to the Canadian 
public.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I find it fascinating to be discussing Motion No. 7 
because of what the Reform Party is advocating. It is advocating 
that the minister's discretion with respect to forgiving 
overpayments should be wiped away and this special kind of 
power given to the highest ranking officer.
<P>
<B>(1610 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> No, that is not true. It should not be wiped 
away. It should be accountable.

	Let me begin my discussion of this amendment by outlining 
briefly what it contains.
<P>
	The Reform Party proposes that the minister should report to 
the House how much overpayment benefit money is forgiven 
each year. That is a simple request. The minister should make 
recommendations regarding how much he should be permitted 
to forgive in the upcoming year. The Reform Party believes that 
the minister has a crystal ball and knows exactly how many  
cases are going to appear before him and his ministry. 
Therefore, he should be able to make such a judgment for the 
future 12 months.
<P>
	Reform proposes that a parliamentary committee should set 
limits on how much may be forgiven in a year. Again we have to 
use the crystal ball. The proposal also suggests that no amount 
may be forgiven until the committee sets the yearly total and no 
amount may be forgiven once that total has been reached.
<P>
	When I first heard the motion, I could hardly believe my ears. 
The Reform Party is supposed to be the party which believes that 
less government is better government. Yet that very same party 
introduced the motion which would add extra processes, extra 
time, extra layers of bureaucracy and extra costs to the 
administration of the old age security program. It really is 
amazing.
<P>
	Motion No. 7 betrays the Reform Party's fixation on the 
minute details of the OAS program. Members opposite seek to 
micromanage the program and the minister at great cost and for 
no benefit whatsoever. It would like to have complete control 
over every minute detail, every tiny aspect of the entire 
program.
<P>
	As usual, it is instructive to look at the facts surrounding the 
motion. It is also worth while to note that these facts are at the 
disposal of the Reform Party, as they are at the disposal of all 
members of the House.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development currently 
forgives something less than $1 million in old age security 
overpayments each year. As we have noted in debating other 
motions, the minister is responsible for that amount but does not 
have carte blanche to forgive overpayments. Certain conditions 
must exist before the overpayment can be forgiven.
<P>
	As the old age security program pays benefits in the order of 
$18.5 billion each year, the rate at which overpayments are 
forgiven is something in the order of five one-thousandths of 
one per cent of the benefits paid. In addition, the amounts are 
already reported to Parliament in the context of the annual main 
estimates and public accounts. I will repeat that for the benefit 
of Reform members. These amounts are already reported to 
Parliament in the context of the annual main estimates and 
public accounts. Hon. members already have the opportunity to 
examine all of the figures in depth.
<P>
	The motion by the Reform Party would create a duplication of 
these processes, and to what gain? So that Reform members can 
micromanage the minister's use of his discretion to forgive 
overpayments which amount to something in the order of five 
one-thousandths of one per cent of the program's expenditures.
<P>
	If the motion were adopted, it could lead to disaster. Imagine a 
committee setting a small limit on the amount which could be 
forgiven. If that amount of money were used up in eight months 
time, let us say, what would happen to the cases which occurred 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12612"> 12612 </A></B>
<P>
in the final four months of the year? The government would have 
to tell those individuals that they must repay their debts even  
though their circumstances were similar or worse than someone 
who was overpaid a few months earlier. I do not consider this a 
fair practice and no one else in the House does.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	With regard to the motions to amend Bill C-54 moved by the 
Bloc and the Reform Party, the government finds itself right in 
the middle. In one of the motions the Bloc Quebecois demands 
the minister be required to forgive overpayments without regard 
to the ability of the client to repay the amount. In Motion No. 7 
the Reform Party seeks to prevent the minister from using his 
authority to forgive benefit overpayments compassionately by 
placing limits which would have to be respected no matter what 
the ability of the pensioner to repay the overpaid amount.
<P>
	On one hand we have a party that says never collect any 
overpayment and on the other hand we have a party that says 
never forgive any overpayment. The government recognizes the 
need to recover moneys where warranted and to forgive 
repayment where appropriate. I also believe ministers must 
retain responsibility for the administration of their programs 
and that this responsibility should not be removed, as would be 
in the case of either Motion No. 6 or Motion No. 7 if adopted.
<P>
	I firmly oppose Motion No. 7. I urge all hon. members in the 
House to do likewise and to move to the speedy passage of this 
legislation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
members of the official opposition are used to seeing their 
amendments or their comments misunderstood or not 
understood at all. This is once again the case. It must be 
understood that we are significantly amending an act, and that 
seniors or people who are eligible either for the Canada Pension 
Plan or for family allowances may discover, at some point, that 
they received more money than they were entitled to.
<P>
	The current act, which we are in the process of amending, 
includes a provision which is fair in that it provides the 
following, and I quote: ``Where a person has received or 
obtained a benefit payment to which the person is not entitled, or 
a benefit payment in excess of the amount of the benefit 
payment to which the person is entitled, the amount of that 
benefit payment or the excess amount, as the case may be, 
constitutes a debt due to Her Majesty and may be recovered in 
proceedings commenced (a) at any time, where that person made 
a wilful misrepresentation or committed fraud for the purpose of 
receiving or obtaining that amount or excess amount''. In other 
words, if someone cheats, the government can, at any time, 
recover the money.
<P>
	However, there is also a (b) in the existing section, and we 
hope that the government will listen and keep that provision. 
Part (b) provides this: ``in any case where paragraph (a) does not 
apply, at any time before the end of the fiscal year immediately 
following the fiscal year in which that amount or excess amount 
was received or obtained''. We will see what these other cases 
are.
<P>
	We feel that the (b) part should be kept. But what is the 
government doing? It is eliminating that provision. The 
government says that any such payment constitutes a debt to Her 
Majesty, as though the recipients were cheaters. I agree that the 
government is significantly amending the legislation to make 
things easier for the public. For example, I can think of the 
income supplement for needy elderly people. As you know, 
these people currently have to sign a form every year. The bill 
before us provides that they will no longer have to sign that 
form. However, it could be that, without any ill intent on the part 
of the elderly, their situation may change, because they inherited 
some money or for whatever reason, so that they are no longer 
eligible for a supplement, but will not know that and may 
continue to receive such supplement for years, until someone 
finds out.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	Without being in any way guilty or even responsible, they 
would find themselves in the situation of having to pay back a 
large sum, even though responsibility for the overpayment 
might rest entirely with the system. I asked the committee to 
ensure that people knew what they were entitled to annually. I 
was told that that would be done through the regulations. I have 
no guarantee. I was shown nothing.
<P>
	It seems to me that we cannot, on the one hand, increase the 
opportunities for administrative errors and, on the other, remove 
this limit, which forces the government to recognize that people 
are not required to pay for the errors it makes, because in fact, in 
this bill, the government is doing two things. It is taking away 
the five-year period within which a person could make a claim 
for benefits to which he was entitled. There was agreement with 
that, but at the same time, the government is giving itself 
unlimited powers to go after these amounts, which again may 
not have been fraudulently obtained, but might simply be the 
result of an administrative error. It is giving itself the power to 
subject members of the public to serious hardship, even in the 
case of an administrative error. We know that the people in 
question are generally seniors or families on income support.
<P>
	Therefore, it seems to me that this is a measure worthy of the 
government's attention. We are concerned about the likelihood 
of administrative errors, and we will be supporting the Reform 
Party's amendment, and adding an amendment to the 
amendment deleting subsections 7 and 8.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12613"> 12613 </A></B>
<P>
	The Reform Party wants members to be told exactly how the 
legislation has been administered so that they are aware of the 
large number of errors that have been made. We are in 
agreement with that, but do not agree that the government 
should not correct the errors, and we can be sure that the 
government will wish to correct them only in those cases where 
there has been prejudice done. We do not agree that errors 
should be allowed to stand until the House moves in this regard, 
particularly as any motion it brings forward can only be a 
recommendation.
<P>
	Here is the amendment. I move, seconded by the member for 
Argenteuil-Papineau:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Motion No. 7 be amended by deleting the new subsections (7) and (8).</BLOCKQUOTE>
	But, it boils down to the same thing. Yes, we should improve 
the administration of the law but, in doing so, we should be very 
careful not to increase administrative errors and inconvenience 
people who are most in need and who are often unable to defend 
themselves. Individuals should not have to pay.
<P>
	The current two subsections of the act stipulate that the 
government can recover its due at any time, regardless of the 
time which has passed since payment, if fraud is involved. If 
administrative or other errors were in play-mostly 
administrative errors-the stipulated time period is one year, 
and I stress this point all the more because this provision is 
contained in legislation, which increases the likelihood of 
administrative errors. I would like to take this opportunity to 
point out that we know, from what has gone on in our ridings, 
that when the new computer program was introduced, there were 
many administrative errors.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	These administrative errors hit citizens hard, citizens who did 
not receive any pension cheques at all. Those are obvious errors. 
When people stop receiving pension cheques, often, they call 
their MP, and I am glad that that is what happens. But, other 
administrative errors occurred, causing people to receive 
supplements to which they were not entitled.
<P>
	I do not know whether you have ever helped people of a 
certain age who do not quite know how to go about it or what 
their entitlements are to fill in those forms. They can easily, with 
the best intentions, end up receiving benefits to which they are 
not entitled and have no idea what to do to fix the situation. In 
those circumstances, the same errors which deprived people of 
their entitlements could have the effect of giving people benefits 
to which they were not entitled, which they did not seek to 
obtain and which they could be obliged to pay back at one point. 
In my opinion, that is very unjust.
<P>
	The government should take this matter seriously. Is that not 
the rule of thumb to ensure that administrative errors do not 
occur? Nothing is easier when cutting the payroll than letting 
administrative errors go by.
<P>
	I am not saying that this is the government's aim but that there 
is nothing meaner and more stupid than wholesale jobs cuts 
which end up negatively affecting seniors in particular.
<P>
	I hope that they will listen to our message, which is not an 
extremist message, contrary to what my honourable colleague 
said, but one of reason and compassion for people. Far from 
being extreme, our position consists of maintaining in part the 
current legislation. It appears to me that it is more my 
honourable colleagues opposite who are breaking with the 
Liberal tradition, which used to take into consideration the 
rights of people and was compassionate with them, a tradition 
which is broken with here. I invite them to correct this serious 
error in approach.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I declare the amendment to the 
amendment by the hon. member for Mercier in order. We shall 
therefore continue debate on the same group, including the 
amendment moved by the member for Mercier.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the days have long since past when individual 
Canadians had to rely only on themselves, their families and 
their community for support during times of either 
unemployment or old age. Instead, the federal government has 
created the complicated system of tax funded programs of 
support, often called our social safety net. Like any other net it is 
full of holes, some of which are intentional but some of which 
merely represent aspects of serving the public which were not 
anticipated when the original legislation was drawn.
<P>
	Bill C-54 represents the most recent efforts of the 
Government of Canada to mend some of those unintentional 
holes in our national safety net. It pertains to several major 
pieces of legislation, including the Old Age Security Act, the 
Canadian pension plan, the Children's Special Allowances Act 
and the Unemployment Insurance Act.
<P>
	The fact that it covers such a large amount of earlier 
legislation makes one suspect Bill C-54 will be complicated. In 
that regard the suspicion is correct. Several members of 
Parliament have spent many hours studying and digesting what 
the government has proposed here.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	According to the legislative summary provided by the 
economics division of the Library of Parliament research, the 
government intended Bill C-54 to achieve the following goals: 
to improve service to clients of these major income support 
measures; to better co-ordinate programs, administration and 
the actual delivery of service; to eliminate some inconsistencies 
between old age security and the Canada pension plan programs; 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12614"> 12614 </A></B>
<P>
to reduce administrative costs, and to save some trees and some 
time by reducing duplication and paper burden, both for the 
departments and their clients; and finally, to  help members of 
Parliament to better serve our constituents.
<P>
	These changes will have wide ranging impact since they are 
expected to benefit some 1.4 million seniors and save the 
taxpayer about $10 million annually. Of course, nearly all 
Canadians, including those in the Reform Party of Canada, 
would approve of these goals. We all want more efficient 
government, fewer program duplications and reduced federal 
expenses. As one might expect, however, it is how the 
government proposes to undertake these much desired 
improvements that has led some of us to propose amendments to 
Bill C-54.
<P>
	The first section of Bill C-54 deals in clauses 1 through 24 
with the Old Age Security Act. I must report to this House that 
my constituency office frequently receives complaints from 
seniors who are caught up in the red tape of the Old Age Security 
Act sections.
<P>
	People receiving the spouses allowance, SPA, and the 
guaranteed income supplement, GIS, are required to reapply 
every single year preventing any payments from being made 
when the new fiscal year begins each April 1 until those 
applications have been received and approved. Single handedly 
that requirement imposes real hardship on the very Canadians 
this legislation was aimed at helping, namely low income 
seniors whose cheques are often delayed, for example if some 
bureaucrat decides that information on the application must be 
verified.
<P>
	The simple fact is that the income of these least well off 
seniors does not change much from year to year. Therefore it 
seems to me to make far more sense to require only that seniors 
must report changes to their yearly income. No report received 
means there is no change.
<P>
	On behalf of those seniors I personally congratulate the 
government for eliminating the very irritating and generally 
unnecessary piece of red tape. However, the question is not that 
simple.
<P>
	A House committee has been at work on Bill C-54. The result 
of the committee's work is a series of proposed amendments 
which this place has been treating in groups for the purpose of 
organizing the debate.
<P>
	Clause 23 of that first section of Bill C-54 is the subject of 
amendments, or Motions Nos. 5 and 6 proposed by the Bloc 
Quebecois as well as Motion No. 7 put forward by the Reform 
Party of Canada.
<P>
	Clause 23 deals with overpayments that people may have 
received. Our position regarding Motion No. 5 is that when 
Canadians receive payment to which they are not entitled, they 
should pay the amount back except in those circumstances such 
as hardship or death, which already appear on page 10 of the bill.
<P>
	Regarding Bloc Motion No. 6, we oppose it because we 
believe that department officials should stand behind their 
advice and be accountable regarding our tax dollars. This 
unaccountability by the bureaucrats and in some regards the 
politicians has gone on far too long.
<P>
	Regarding Motion No. 7, the Reform Party's concern 
primarily relates to keeping the minister accountable to 
Parliament. This has been overlooked for years. It is time that 
the minister started to accept some of that accountability.
<P>
	Motion No. 7 asks the minister to report annually to this 
House regarding overpayments in either Canada pension plan or 
old age security, providing details of their cost to taxpayers. A 
parliamentary committee would then study this report and make 
its recommendations regarding what the minister could or could 
not remit the following year.
<P>
	Motion No. 7 has the great advantage of keeping the 
department and its minister accountable to the Canadian people 
through members of Parliament who are the people's elected 
representatives. What I am saying here is opposite to that which 
the member on the other side said a few minutes ago. We in the 
Reform Party say maybe it is time that MPs started to buckle 
down and do some work on their own to help the minister out and 
not just to pass it off.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	Very often even in my own riding of Okanagan-Shuswap I 
hear complaints from voters that civil servants and bureaucrats 
can do whatever they want with no accountability to the people 
who pay their salaries. It is an ongoing complaint and not only in 
my constituency. I am sure hon. members on the other side have 
had the same thing happen. They must hear it at the parties they 
go to or from the friends they associate with. It is an ongoing 
concern in Canada that has to be addressed.
<P>
	We must take every responsible opportunity to correct this 
situation, where both bureaucrats and the courts run this country 
instead of having a government of the people, by the people, for 
the people. Too often we have government of the Ottawa 
mandarins for their own purpose, or governments of the lawyers 
and the judges, all too often to protect the rights of the criminals 
rather than to defend the interests of the vast majority of 
law-abiding citizens.
<P>
	Until we can bring accountability back into this House we will 
always have this complaint from our constituents. It is 
unnecessary. It is something we must address and I believe 
Motion No. 7 is the first step in a long process.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12615"> 12615 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to be able to address this particular matter today. When 
I came here in the fall of 1993 one of the biggest promises I 
made to the constituents of Elk Island who elected me was to 
exert pressure on the government to be accountable for the way 
the taxpayers' hard earned dollars were being spent.
<P>
	I remember very distinctly one of the things which shocked 
me when I arrived here. There was an orientation for new 
members. The individual making the presentation told us what 
our office budgets were and explained the formula. Then he said 
that it did not matter, that we could spend more, that we could 
spend any amount we wanted to. I was getting upset and as a 
brand new member I did not know what to do. Should I get up 
and say that is wrong and we should not do that? I was getting 
quite angry about this carte blanche that an MP had to spend any 
amount he wanted.
<P>
	Then the presenter said that to remember, any amount we 
overextended or overspent on our budget or any category in it 
would simply be deducted from our salary. I immediately 
relaxed and was happy. He was obviously building it up. He said 
that as a member of Parliament I had a personal responsibility to 
be within my budget. If I am not trustworthy or not on the bit in 
terms of managing my budget, then it would come out of my own 
pocket.
<P>
	When I left that meeting I remembered how my emotions 
went up with anger and down with great delight that there was 
one level of accountability. I then asked some of my colleagues 
if it would not be wonderful if we could require that same level 
of accountability from all members of the government, all of the 
bureaucrats. A deputy minister would be required to give up a 
portion of his salary for overspending the budget.
<P>
	I have been watching the budget and we have been working in 
committee on the estimates for the year and I am appalled. Over 
and over we hear about cuts, cuts, cuts. Yet in every set of 
estimates I have looked at so far the spending is up. The people 
of Canada need to know that total government spending under 
this new, much touted cutting budget is actually $2 billion more 
than last year. The people of Canada and members of this House 
ought to know that we are spending more and more.
<P>
	When the hon. member from the governing Liberal Party was 
speaking earlier, he made some comments about the Reformers. 
He said that here is this group of Reformers who want 
accountability and all they are doing is proposing something 
that will cost more money. The member then said that the 
amount of overspending is not really that much. Why, it is only 
five one-thousandths of one per cent.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	Five one thousandths of one per cent is certainly not excessive 
if it is put that way. But if we look at the tens of millions of 
dollars which are overspent because of  administrative errors, 
because of lack of accountability and lack of resolve, I think that 
maybe 100 taxpayers would be required to pay their total tax 
bills just to pay for the overpayment. If we got those 100 
taxpayers, or 1,000 taxpayers or however many are needed to 
come up with the tax dollars to fund this administrative error, I 
think we would have howls of protest. Perhaps then we would 
have a greater cry for accountability.
<P>
	The member said that it is an administrative hassle. It will 
cost money to ask the minister to be accountable for the 
overpayments. Yes, indeed, accounting for money is a cost item. 
As any person who has ever been in business will tell us, the 
money which is spent on reliable accountants and on acceptable 
accounting procedures is usually money well spent. Money 
which is spent in providing accountability usually provides a 
saving of an amount much greater than the amount which is 
required to deliver on that accountability.
<P>
	I would speak against the Bloc amendment to the Reform 
motion. What we are doing is we are promoting accountability.
<P>
	The cry from the other side was that these people do not care, 
that we want to cut people off. Another statement was that we 
want to prevent the minister from being able to do his job. 
Wrong on both counts.
<P>
	We in the Reform Party believe it is time we managed our 
fiscal affairs in such a way that we do not go down the tubes, so 
that we do maintain the ability to help people who are truly in 
need. As long as we keep on wasting money because we are too 
lazy to account for it, we are diving headlong into a disaster. 
That will prevent us from doing anything for anyone because we 
will have either runaway inflation or increased taxes and 
probably both in order to try to bail us out of a fiscal problem 
which was generated by governments over the past 30 years. 
There is probably nothing more urgent than bringing 
accountability to the whole process.
<P>
	There is a recommendation in our motion that the minister 
must include his recommendations in his report. In other words, 
we are not saying that the minister cannot do his job; we are 
telling the minister to do his job and to do it well. Where it can 
be improved, he should bring his recommendations to the 
House. We will then provide assistance, via the House or a 
committee, so that we can be more efficient and better stewards 
of the money which Canadian taxpayers entrust to us.
<P>
	We are saying to the minister that if he is overspending 
because of administrative errors, if he is giving money to people 
to whom it is not due, that money should be recoverable. If there 
are mitigating circumstances which would recommend that on 
compassionate grounds or for whatever reason it will not be paid 
back, we want to know why that is so. We want to know what the 
minister is going to do about it. Many years a go a very wise 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12616"> 12616 </A></B>
<P>
teacher of mine said: ``If you set no goals, you will be sure to 
reach them. If you aim for nothing, you will be sure to hit it''.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	We are asking the minister to account for administrative 
errors in his department that cost the taxpayers money. We are 
asking the minister to come up with a plan that will save the 
taxpayers money. I do not think anyone would argue that when 
there is increasing competition for increasingly rare dollars 
from government, the money should go to people to whom it is 
intended. If someone receives money, whether it is OAS or CPP 
or UIC, to which they are not entitled it is actually a violation of 
the rights of the people who need it and it should be paid back 
unless there are very severe mitigating circumstances.
<P>
	We want the minister to aim ever higher. We want the minister 
to say: ``Last year this amount of unauthorized payments were 
made and we could not collect it back''. We want the minister to 
stand in the House or table a report that will say what the amount 
was. He must be up front with the taxpayers who are footing the 
bill. Then he must also show his plan for reducing those costs. 
He must show what he is prepared to do in order to make the 
administration more efficient to reduce the number of people 
receiving payments to which they are not entitled. If the 
minister aims at nothing or says if we will have a certain amount 
of overpayment, so be it, we cannot improve, that is exactly 
what will happen. There will be no improvement.
<P>
	However, as our amendment suggests, if the minister is 
required to give a report, stage his plans for doing better then we 
hopefully will find there will be improvement and fewer people 
will receive money to which they are not entitled. There will 
hopefully be fewer people required to pay back money they 
should not have received because the administrative procedures 
will be so honed to a fine art that people who are not entitled to 
receive money will not receive it. That is the ultimate goal for 
which we should strive and the goal which we should keep in 
mind and work toward until it is actually met.
<P>
	We recognize it is not possible for a minister to micromanage 
his department. We say without equivocation that if the 
committees are to have any function in the House, as we were 
told by the so-called Liberal red book, we were to have more 
meaningful activities for MPs, let them work in the committees 
and deal with these recommendations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is with considerable amount of trepidation and at the 
same time a certain sense of responsibility that I rise in the 
debate on the bill.
<P>
	What is operating here is a plea for accountability, 
compassion and responsibility, efficiency and businesslike 
operation of the affairs of the House.
<P>
	In particular I draw the attention of the House to Motion No. 
7, the Reform Party motion calling for the minister to make a 
report to the House on where overpayments of CPP and OAS 
were made and at what cost to the Canadian taxpayer.
<P>
	I am sure members of the House recognize only too well the 
largest group of people in Canada that deserves compassion 
today are the taxpayers. All taxpayers are burdened, be they 
young or old. They are paying taxes to a point at which they 
believe it has become excessive. They find themselves unable to 
do many of the things they want to do. They want to get into 
some of the larger purchases. They want to buy houses, cars, 
appliances and they find their discretionary income is getting 
lower and lower even though their gross salary is increasing.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	We need to exercise some compassion. One of the greatest 
examples of compassion the House could demonstrate is that the 
money given to us by taxpayers be treated as money given to us 
in trust, money not to be spent willy-nilly at whatever whim or 
fancy might strike us at a particular time.
<P>
	What is being called upon here is for the minister to say to all 
of his servants, the servants to the House and to the people of 
Canada: ``Do your administration honestly, do it fairly and do it 
consistent with the legislation''.
<P>
	To the credit of most of our civil servants I must admit to the 
House that my association with our civil servants has been 
exemplary. They have done what they could and they do make 
mistakes, just as all of us make mistakes from time to time. 
When they make a mistake who is responsible? If the servant to 
the minister makes a mistake that servant is responsible to the 
minister but it is the minister who is responsible for the action of 
the people he has employed who report to him. The minister is 
responsible to the House for the actions taken by him and under 
his direction the staff he has appointed.
<P>
	Therefore we ask that if there is an overpayment a committee 
do study these issues and they be reported to the House so that 
the responsibility can come back to the House. This is the 
Parliament of Canada. Here the legislation is enacted; here the 
responsibility ought to be demonstrated to all of the people of 
Canada.
<P>
	It is with pride that we sit here. It is with the responsibility of 
knowing we are managing the people's money that we should 
approach the various aspects of the administration. It is with this 
intent that I come before the House to say the time has come to 
be accountable, to be responsible and to recognize it is not just 
the response we make to a stimulus but that we exercise the 
ability and the skill we have developed in the background we 
have so the right decision is made to emphasize that it helps the 
people who need the help the most.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12617"> 12617 </A></B>
<P>
	Another group of people needs compassion. Those are the 
people who need to be helped by our social safety nets. There 
are many of them. There are those in our society, sad to say, 
who abuse the system, who use fraudulent means to apply for 
these benefits, who are dishonest in the information they 
include. They are responsible for the actions they have taken 
and they should be called to account. That is why this 
recommendation in this particular bill, to amend the bill, so that 
those overpayments do indeed become a debt to the crown. 
These are necessary and they ought to be enforced.
<P>
	Then there is that other group that may well have received 
through administrative error or something else additional funds. 
Those people may through no fault of their own have spent more 
money than they probably should have are now unable to repay 
even though they may have received the amounts in error. Then a 
judgment call needs to be made. At that point the minister 
should exercise his responsibility. If he can defend that decision 
in the House, I am sure there are enough compassionate people 
in the House who would say there are those who ought to be 
forgiven.
<P>
	We as a nation and as individuals would be the most 
despairing people and the most despicable people if we could 
not learn to forgive. Where there are honest mistakes made we 
ought to forgive; where people demand compassion, we must be 
able to give them that forgiveness. It can be done; it should be 
done.
<P>
	Let us be accountable. Let us be compassionate to our 
taxpayers so we do not spend more money than we have to and 
recognize they are already overburdened in the taxes they are 
paying. Then let us call those to account who are responsible for 
the administration. They report to the House, they report to one 
another and they do these things honestly, credibly and 
efficiently. Let us all forgive where that needs to be done, where 
there are good reasons to forgive.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to speak to Motion No. 7, the amendment put 
forward by the Reform Party.
<P>
	Why is commons sense usually the first victim when we give 
consideration to change? I have stood in the House on more 
occasions than I wish to count and have seen that basic common 
sense becomes a trade-off between positive ideas for change 
and partisan politics.
<P>
	Canada has reached a crossroads. Our fiscal situation has 
prompted a country wide debate on the state of our social 
security programs. Our safety net is financially unsustainable 
and many of the programs reflect waste and disturbing 
inefficiencies which will ultimately hurt the very people these 
programs were meant to help.
<P>
	Motion No. 7 is one we believe can make the system more 
accountable. Accountability is one of the basic planks on which 
I was elected. I made a promise to constituents that all of my 
analysis, all of the efforts and  work undertaken on their behalf 
would reflect that commitment to accountability.
<P>
	There are many occasions in the House when all of us receive 
letters from constituents who write to us from their heart about 
expenditures and the danger to the basic structure of our social 
programs. When I get these letters I know why I am here 
challenging the government, demanding accountability on 
behalf of the Canadians we represent and using common sense in 
the deliberations we debate.
<P>
	I received a letter from a lady named Irene in February of this 
year. Irene wants some answers to some very basic questions. 
She writes from her heart. She asks about accountability: ``Dear 
member of Parliament, I am a senior citizen who is proud to call 
myself Canadian. However, I have become more and more 
concerned with the handling of our budget by our government. I 
have decided to participate in the process by writing this open 
letter to all members of Parliament regardless of party 
affiliation to communicate my concern over what I and many of 
my friends and family see as utter waste regarding unrealistic 
expectations and greed and total absence of conscience for the 
spending of public money''.
<P>
	She is doing what I would call her political work, 
participating in the process. She goes on to say: ``I have been 
elected spokesperson by my group of friends, hence the lengthy 
list of suggested budgetary cuts. By cutting the following 
expenses we can perhaps cut less from programs that we have 
supported with our many years of hard work and money. 
Although these are but basic and straightforward budget cuts, 
surely the more unpalatable cuts will be seen less as another 
blow to the ordinary Canadian if it is perceived that all expenses 
are open to scrutiny''.
<P>
	What she is asking for is accountability. She goes on to list 
two pages full of cuts she believes would be appropriate and 
useful for government to take under consideration. Something 
in her last point I found quite interesting: ``Why not increase the 
resources of the auditor general to find waste and duplication 
which they manage to find every year?'' I thought that was 
appropriate to bring into the debate today since we are looking at 
our estimates: ``However, rather than just report it, why not 
increase the personnel so that follow-up action may be taken? 
Every year we hear about all the waste and duplication in 
different government departments. However, once the report is 
made public, is that all there is? Is there any follow-up and/or 
guidance for the guilty parties?''
<P>
	Irene once again is simply seeking accountability.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12618"> 12618 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
	In Motion No. 7, which is basic common sense, we are trying 
to bring accountability to that system so that we can say to Irene: 
``Yes indeed, there is follow up to government waste. There is 
follow up to issues and problems as they arise within the 
bureaucracy''.
<P>
	Having said that, I want to go through the point that Motion 
No. 7 refers to because it is important to have for the record a 
very common sense motion that reflects the values of the 
Reform Party.
<P>
	The motion calls for the minister to make a report to the 
House on where overpayments in CPP and OAS were made and 
at what cost to the Canadian taxpayer. That comment is very 
much reflected in Irene's letter to me. It is basic information 
about the government's bottom line. The report will then be 
studied by a parliamentary committee made up of 
representatives of the people who have entrusted us to make 
decisions based on the Canadian taxpayers' best interests with 
compassion and to do that with transparency.
<P>
	The committee and not the bureaucrats will decide what the 
minister can or cannot remit next year. It will make 
recommendations on where and how to reduce the cost to the 
Canadian people in overpayment. That is just and fair.
<P>
	If this motion is adopted, it will return accountability to where 
it belongs, in Parliament and not in the hands of the minister or 
senior bureaucrats of the department where everything is done 
behind closed doors. Let not the momentum of mediocrity 
continue to plague the actions of the House as we move toward 
change and become openly and completely accountable to the 
Canadian people.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> My colleagues, it is my duty to inform 
the House that the question to be raised tonight at the time of 
adjournment is as follows: the hon. member for Mackenzie- 
Canadian National.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have been quite surprised by the Bloc amendment to the motion 
that we proposed.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I believe the hon. member has already 
spoken to this motion, has she not?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Mr. Speaker, no, I spoke to the motion but 
not to the Bloc's amendment.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Since it is the same vote, the member is 
precluded from speaking twice to the matter.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, I am a little 
puzzled. My motion has been amended and yet I have no way of 
expressing in debate my response to that.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> My understanding is that the matters 
were all grouped for debate. The member is correct that she did 
not have knowledge of the amendment before she spoke earlier 
today. Accordingly, unless anyone else wishes to intervene on 
the matter, I can see no reason why she cannot speak.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I find the amendment proposed 
by the Bloc to be extremely inconsistent with the stand that its 
members are taking on the bill.
<P>
	Bloc members are erasing the accountability of the minister. 
They are saying that the minister should have discretion whether 
he exceeds any limits on overpayment. Yet in a number of their 
amendments, they say that the minister's discretion should be 
erased. Here they want to give the minister discretion by 
amending my amendment but in any other case, they do not want 
the minister to have discretion. I would ask the Bloc to consider 
the consistency of this amendment.
<P>
	If they do not like the minister having absolute discretion in 
clause 38, why are they saying he should have absolute 
discretion in clause 23? I do not understand it at all.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	Erasing subclauses (7) and (8) of our motion will make the 
committee's recommendation totally toothless. The Bloc 
members are the ones who are always hollering and screaming 
about the need for more fiscal accountability in the way 
government spends money and to quit adding to the debt.
<P>
	We have tried to bring forward a very simple motion that 
would put some limits and some parameters around what a 
department can spend. The Bloc members do not want that. They 
want this department to have absolutely unlimited discretion to 
overspend, to make payments that are not legitimate, necessary 
or warranted, but there is nothing that Parliament can do to stop 
this. They do not want Parliament to be able to stop this but they 
are always complaining that departments are overspending.
<P>
	I am really sorry but I fail to see the reasoning. The Bloc has 
not even put anyone up to explain why it is doing this. I see 
absolutely no reason why the Bloc is doing this. It seems 
entirely capricious and illogical.
<P>
	I would ask my colleagues in the Bloc to reconsider the 
position they have taken which is not consistent, not logical, 
seems to serve no good purpose and flies in the face of the 
concerns they have expressed about this bill in their own 
motions.
<P>
	It is all very well to say the committee would look at the 
overspending, but if Parliament has absolutely no ability to 
place limits on ministerial and departmental discretion what is 
the good of Parliament? Why are we sitting here? Is not the 
whole purpose of us being here to manage the affairs of the 
country in a realistic way?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12619"> 12619 </A></B>
<P>
	If this amendment passes we are saying that if departments 
overpay, make all the mistakes they want, waste all the money 
they want, send the money here, there and everywhere, 
wherever they want, we cannot do anything about it nor do we 
want to do anything about it. God forbid that we should say: 
``This far and no more can your inefficiencies go''.
<P>
	I appeal to the members of the House to reconsider their 
position on this. If the minister wants to overspend and feels 
there are good reasons to do this and has a logical explanation, 
then he will have to convince a committee of the House, 
parliamentarians, people who were elected to manage our affairs 
and our money, that he has a good reason for needing to do this. 
Is that not the whole purpose of us being here or am I missing 
something?
<P>
	I ask my friends in the Bloc for an explanation of why they 
proposed this amendment. Failing that, I can only urge on the 
House that it is totally frivolous. It is illogical. It is unnecessary. 
It flies in the face of what we are here for. I urge that it be voted 
down and the motion as proposed be accepted.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 12</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-54 be amended by deleting Clause 38.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, finally, the last amendment to Bill 
C-54. In Motion No. 12 I move the following amendment:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. As I 
understand it, the House voted on whether to accept the 
amendment to Motion No. 7 but not whether to accept Motion 
No. 7. We need to do that.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> That will be done at the time of the 
deferred division.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dumas:</B> Mr. Speaker, in Motion No. 12 I move the 
following amendment: That Bill C-54 be amended by deleting 
clause 38, which reads as follows: ``Where a decision is made by 
a Review Tribunal or the Pension Appeals Board in respect of a 
benefit, the Minister may stay-that is what it says-payment of 
the benefit until the latest of-there are three choices-(<I>a</I>) the 
expiration of the period allowed for making an application for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12620"> 12620 </A></B>
<P>
leave to appeal to the Pension Appeals Board, (<I>b</I>) the expiration 
of the period allowed for making an application under the 
Federal Court Act for judicial review of the decision, and (<I>c</I>) 
where Her Majesty has made an application under the Federal 
Court Act for  judicial review of the decision, the month in 
which all proceedings in relation to the judicial review have 
been completed''.
<P>
	Why delete clause 38? Because the purpose of this 
amendment moved by the Bloc Quebecois, the official 
opposition, is to prevent the government from suspending 
payment of benefits during appeals, since these appeals arise 
from the government's failure to manage these programs 
satisfactorily. Senior citizens should not have to pay for the 
government's incompetence.
<P>
	Clearly, the government wants to discourage senior citizens 
from filing appeals, since some people do not have the resources 
to tide them over this waiting period. Clause 38 of Bill C-54 
provides no guarantees for adequate financial security for 
seniors.
<P>
	In the report by the National Advisory Council on Aging, as I 
said before, the disposable incomes of seniors were as follows: 
the income of families where the head of the household is a 
senior is 60 to 80 per cent of the income of other Canadian 
families, depending on the standard used and the region.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	In 1989, the average income of families where the head of the 
household was a senior was only $37,462 or 72 per cent of the 
income of families where the head of the household was under 
65. In 1989, the average income of single persons aged 65 or 
over was $16,316, while the average income of single persons 
under 65 was $23,080. A single person, for the purposes of this 
clause, is a person who lives alone or in a household where he or 
she is not related to the other members of the household.
<P>
	Single persons, whatever their age, tend to have relatively low 
incomes. Consequently, the gap between seniors and the rest of 
the population is not quite as wide for those who live alone as it 
is for families, but it is still significant.
<P>
	By allowing himself to stay payment of the benefits during a 
review or an appeal, the minister is depriving recipients of 
money they need to live on, as it is often their only source of 
income.
<P>
	Seventy-two per cent of retired women and 50 per cent of 
retired men receive old age security and guaranteed income 
supplement benefits. Only 5 per cent of seniors make more than 
$50,000. The life expectancy of seniors has increased. We must 
ensure that their extra years of life are satisfactory.
<P>
	By tightening the conditions under which seniors can appeal 
what they consider an unfair decision, the government is trying 
to discourage them by reducing their income. Yet, the 
government itself admits that old age benefits are the only 
source of income for a considerable proportion of recipients.
<P>
	Let us keep in mind that the federal government has already 
decided to reduce the deficit on the backs of the most vulnerable 
by lowering the age credit. As a result, all taxpayers aged 65 and 
over can apply for a tax credit equal to 17 per cent of $3,482 at 
the federal level and 20 per cent of $2,200 in Quebec. This credit 
is non-refundable, that is to say, it applies to the tax payable, 
and the excess portion cannot be refunded. The unused portion 
of the credit can, however, be transferred to the spouse.
<P>
	On May 31, 1994, I rose in this House to oppose reducing the 
age credit. I reiterated that the feeble efforts to reduce spending 
were being made on the backs of the most vulnerable. During 
that speech, I also asked the minister responsible for seniors a 
question about the plan to install voice mail to answer inquiries 
from seniors.
<P>
	The minister simply told us about the speed of the proposed 
service. I explained that many seniors are reluctant to use such a 
service and that they express this opinion on a regular basis. If 
you ask seniors how clause 38 will affect their decision about 
whether or not to appeal a decision, the answer is clear: seniors 
will not appeal because, for most of them, old age benefits are 
the only source of income.
<P>
	In conclusion, the Bloc Quebecois, the official opposition, 
cannot remain silent and let the government reduce the deficit 
on the backs of seniors. Clause 38 of Bill C-54 must be deleted 
so that the government will not be able to stay payment of 
benefits during the appeal process.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, again I rise on 
this question to try to persuade the government to make the right 
decision. Since the calls are made by the Liberals, with their 
majority whatever they decide will be, so I am going to try hard 
to persuade them in the correct way.
<P>
	There has been considerable inconsistency from Bloc 
members, in the sense that with this amendment they are asking 
that we take away from the minister the discretion not to pay.
<P>
<B>(1720 ) </B>
<P>
	In other words, if the minister decides that somebody should 
not be entitled to some of these programs that are being dealt 
with in Bill C-54 and some administrative bureaucrat in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12621"> 12621 </A></B>
<P>
system decides a person should not be receiving a benefit 
because the rules say he should no longer be receiving it, 
according to this amendment the minister would no longer have 
the right to stop the payments.
<P>
	To me, this is ludicrous. On the one hand they move a 
subamendment to our motion, which would have the effect of 
not giving the minister the right to make payments when they are 
required, and here they are saying they do not want to have the 
minister have the right to not make payments when they are not 
required. That does not make sense to me.
<P>
	As members opposite are thinking about this amendment, and 
I presume they will be opposed to it, I want to strongly urge them 
to be opposed to it. If the payments are not justifiable they are in 
breach of the rules, and the minister should be able to stop those 
payments.
<P>
	Let us look at the scenario this sets up. A person receives 
money and the department says no more money. Then the person 
who is receiving appeals. During that appeal process, in which 
the wheels of government can take quite some time, these 
payments must be kept coming. If the person receiving them 
really wants to take the system for a ride, they will make sure 
that all of that money they receive is totally spent, so that if the 
appeal goes against them they will be able to say they cannot pay 
it back because they have no money. Then, on a compassionate 
ground or whatever, according to the previous rules that money 
would not be repayable.
<P>
	It really means that the taxpayers are being totally dumped on 
in terms of accountability if this amendment is accepted. As I 
said, I urge the members opposite to pass the information on to 
their leadership so that the leadership gives the direction to them 
so they know how to vote and they will vote correctly in 
opposing this amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is easy to see from the large number of amendments 
prepared on the subject that the opposition is not in favour of 
making changes to the current appeal process.
<P>
	I cannot speak for the opposition, but the Liberal Party of 
Canada believes that our seniors deserve the best. With the 
proposed changes to the appeal system we would be giving them 
the opportunity to have their decisions reviewed as quickly and 
fairly as possible under the best system we can offer.
<P>
	Motion No. 12 is intriguing. By the debate that is taking place, 
we see it is also very frustrating and confusing for the members 
of the official opposition versus members of the third party 
opposite. The battle that is going on between the two clearly 
reveals to me and to other members of the House of Commons 
that there is no simple answer to the very complex operations of 
any great government such as we have in Canada. Simple 
solutions just do not exist.
<P>
	However, both parties have for some time, close to 18 months, 
been advocating simple solutions to extremely complex 
problems. I am just wondering after this lengthy period of time 
whether or not that is a deliberate attempt, or perhaps it is 
simply a matter of fact, that both parties lack the ability to 
comprehend the complexity and profound depth of these 
government operations. Perhaps they are deliberately trying to 
confuse Canadians with these simplistic solutions and are 
therefore misguiding the voting population.
<P>
<B>(1725 ) </B>
<P>
	We should begin by noting that the Canada pension plan 
review tribunals hear thousands of cases every year, thousands. 
These cases often are very complex. The legislation is also 
complex. They are sometimes very difficult to adjudicate.
<P>
	With human beings involved, mistakes are sometimes made 
by these tribunals. When this occurs the minister must with 
great reluctance appeal the decision to the pension appeal board. 
This is only done where there are the clearest indications that a 
mistake has been made. Nonetheless, the department records 
indicate that 45 review tribunal decisions that were appealed by 
the minister to the pension appeal board were in fact overturned 
by that body. That 45 represents 80 per cent of the decisions that 
were made and rendered in 1994. Had the minister followed 
what appears to be the preference of the opposition and paid 
benefits before he was absolutely certain they should be paid, 
these 45 people would have been in the unfortunate position of 
having to repay money to the government. Imagine the shock 
these 45 people would have received if they had opened their 
mail and discovered they had to pay back thousands of dollars 
immediately. Naturally, they would be in the position where 
they would have no assets, no funds, simply because they live 
from cheque to cheque.
<P>
	Therefore, closer examination of this motion, which the 
opposition claims will give better service to clients, will in fact 
reveal that many of those clients are put in a position where they 
have large overpayments that must be repaid, because the 
government is paying benefits before it is certain about 
entitlement. We must not allow that to happen.
<P>
	For all these reasons, I oppose Motion No. 12 and urge all hon. 
members to do the same.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, if 
someone is inconsistent in this House, it is certainly not anyone 
on this side. I do not see where the consistency is in 
saying-especially with respect to the Canada Pension Plan 
which, we will recall, provides benefits to people with 
disabilities of all kinds-that individuals who are denied 
benefits will have to appeal. It is stated in the bill that the 
minister may stay payment of any benefit until the later of the 
following dates.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12622"> 12622 </A></B>
<P>
	How can those people who are often disadvantaged because 
they have problems getting around and defending their case, 
because they have to hire someone to help them-people who 
will now be expected to appeal if they are convinced they 
qualify, knowing that, if they are wrong, the law requires that 
they repay-how can they, on top of everything, be deprived 
of benefits while they have to defend themselves? It makes no 
sense.
<P>
	This is beyond me. If there is someone who does not 
understand, it is not one of us. Examine actual cases and then try 
and look us straight in the face and tell us that benefits should be 
stayed, even though the legislation clearly provides for benefits 
to be repaid. The pensioners who will appeal are those who are 
sure they have a good case. But if they do not receive benefits 
during that time, chances are that people will not appeal because 
they are unable to do so. It does not make any sense to me. It 
makes no sense and this so-called Liberal government should 
examine this point closely before adopting this clause.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	The clause reads as follows: ``Where a decision is made by a 
Review Tribunal in respect to a benefit''-so there was a benefit 
to start with-``the Minister may stay payment of the benefit 
until the later of-''
<P>
	This means that those to whom benefits are denied or cut will 
probably have to go on welfare and rely on the welfare plan in 
their province. In some places, single individuals get something 
like $250. When a handicapped person who has to pay a helper 
loses his or her benefits and is told to wait until the very end, at 
which time he or she will get benefits, this is absolutely 
inconsistent and illogical; it makes no sense but, more 
importantly, it shows a total lack of compassion.
<P>
	I urge Liberal members to look at this legislation closely and 
not from a partisan point of view. We, on this side, certainly did 
not debate the issue on a partisan basis. We work for those who 
are the least able to take care of themselves. This is how we have 
to consider this issue. We took a close look at the amendment 
proposed by the Reform Party and we agree with part of it. 
However, we do not agree with the part which provides that the 
minister must wait, even if he is convinced that an amount 
should be remitted because an administrative error was made. 
We feel that those who suffer the prejudice should not have to 
wait.
<P>
	In any case, the amendment proposed by the Reform Party did 
not remove the minister's discretionary power, since the motion 
only refers to a recommendation. That could only adversely 
affect the people concerned, since the minister still had 
discretionary power. I am answering the hon. member, because 
we always enjoy debating the substance of these issues, but that 
proposal does not make sense. The fact is that, if we look at all 
these provisions and amendments, which are supposed to be 
technical, we realize that this bill will significantly change the 
relationship between the elderly, the handicapped  and families, 
on the one hand, and the state, on the other hand. This is what 
this legislation is about.
<P>
	It seems to me that we are all trying to protect the interests of 
our fellow citizens. At the same time, we realize that the system 
must include some protection. However, that protection must 
not be provided at the expense of the public. We must not set the 
whole system against the public. To deprive people of the means 
to defend themselves when they risk losing their meagre 
benefits, is certainly not consistent with social fairness, 
accountability or good government. No. The government is 
trying to save money on the backs of Canadians, by not 
explicitly providing them with the right to appeal, a right which 
is theirs.
<P>
	One must have worked with people who had to fight the 
system, whether as regards occupational safety and health 
issues, or eligibility to disability benefits, to measure the 
enormous challenge which these people face, given how hard it 
is for them to provide the required evidence. Consequently, 
there is no reason to come up with such a provision, in addition 
to all the other changes proposed in this bill to favour the 
system, at the expense of the public. To be sure, this is not a 
legislation which the Liberals can be proud of.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we are having a good debate today on some administrative 
changes to Bill C-54. I certainly agree with my hon. friend from 
the Bloc that we are trying to serve the citizens of the country as 
well, as effectively, as compassionately and as truly as we can.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	Our country deserves the best we can give it. I remind my hon. 
friend that if we are to run things effectively it should not be 
done on the backs of citizens. Savings should not be looked on as 
being something we do on the backs of people. Spending is 
really what we put on the backs of people. Spending is a burden 
which we extract from the hard work of our citizens and often 
place on our future citizens as well. We have to look at all of the 
administrative measures and all of the spending proposals in a 
way which is fair to the people who need the money, fair to the 
people who have to earn the money and fair to the people who 
will inherit the debt we are building in order to spend some of 
the money.
<P>
	We cannot look at this issue as if only desperately poor and 
needy people are being hurt. Those are the people we want to 
help. If we are to continue to help them then we must be 
responsible, effective and efficient in the way we administer 
every government department.
<P>
	I was saddened to hear the Liberal member deriding the 
Reform amendment to this very complex bill. He suggested it 
was put forward to hurt seniors. It does no credit to debate in the 
House when attempts to constructively improve proposals of 
government are simply dismissed as meaning to hurting people. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12623"> 12623 </A></B>
<P>
It is  beneath members of the House to suggest that any member 
would be motivated by such repugnant motives.
<P>
	The Liberal member also suggested the amendments were 
simplistic. Is any attempt to improve government legislation to 
be dismissed as being simplistic? I say to the people of Canada 
that to look at complex bills, to study them, to assess the impact 
and the effectiveness of them takes a great deal of time and 
effort. It is done in an attempt to give the best to our country, to 
ensure everything we do has the highest standards of 
accountability in delivering the services which Canadians need 
in a way we can afford and which we can count on over the long 
term.
<P>
	I appeal to members to respect and to objectively and 
seriously judge the things put forward in the House, not to 
deride, misrepresent and distort them in a partisan way. The 
country will not benefit from that kind of approach. I am 
saddened by that kind of approach and I appeal to members not 
to take it.
<P>
	Over 80 per cent of Canadians say they want our social 
programs reformed. They know the programs are often abused. 
They often give money to people who do not need it. There are 
many examples of programs sending money to millionaires. 
Any small attempts we make to these complex bills to make the 
departments and bureaucrats accountable are somehow 
dismissed.
<P>
	Do we really want to say as parliamentarians to a minister or 
to a department: ``Go out and overspend. Go out and make 
allocations of money not warranted, to which people are not 
entitled, in any amount you want. We do not care. We do not 
want to know about it. We will not stop you. We do not want 
limits on that''?
<P>
<B>(1740 ) </B>
<P>
	Surely we owe the people of Canada better responsibility, 
accountability and management than that. I ask the House to 
vote down measures which remove accountability and support 
measures which add accountability.
<P>
	Our ministers and our departments are not looking for ways to 
defraud the Canadian people of money to which they are 
rightfully entitled under these programs-far from it. There are 
tens of millions of dollars going to people who do not need it, 
who do not deserve it, who are not entitled to it, people receiving 
money from programs not meant for that.
<P>
	Surely we have an obligation and a responsibility in the House 
to put a stop to that and to make sure the people who do need the 
money are getting it and the people who do not need the money 
and who are not entitled to it are not getting dollars that should 
be going to the neediest people in our society.
<P>
	I speak against Motion No. 12. It removes accountability in an 
important way. I certainly urge the House to add more 
accountability to the way these programs are administered 
rather than detract from it.

	<B>Hon. Raymond Chan (for Minister of Industry, Lib.)</B> 
moved that Bill C-88, an act to implement the agreement on 
internal trade, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Minister of Industry, I 
thank you for this opportunity to speak on the occasion of 
second reading of Bill C-88, an act to implement the agreement 
on internal trade.
<P>
	The bill is another step in the process to create a new internal 
trade regime that has been under way in Canada for some time. 
Our objective is to reduce barriers to interprovincial trade and to 
remove restrictions on the movement of people and capital 
within the domestic marketplace.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12624"> 12624 </A></B>
<P>
	Passage of Bill C-88 will be a necessary step for Parliament 
to take in order to implement the agreement on internal trade 
signed last year by all the provinces and territories along with 
the federal government.
<P>
	At the invitation of the Prime Minister, first ministers met in 
Ottawa last July to formally accept and sign the agreement the 
committee of ministers of internal trade had finalized at the end 
of June. With this accord, we were committed to a target of July 
1, 1995 to have the appropriate legislative and regulatory 
changes in place so the agreement could be legally 
implemented.
<P>
	In this sense, in putting this legislation before the House we 
are meeting an obligation to provincial and territorial 
governments we incurred when we signed the agreement in June 
1994. The agreement on internal trade was an important step in 
the quest to create an integrated domestic market in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1745 ) </B>
<P>
	In the 127 years or so since Confederation, we have seen a 
hodge-podge of protectionist measures and trade conventions 
develop, which have inhibited interprovincial trade and 
restricted the flow of goods and capital between provinces in 
Canada. These measures range from outright restrictions to 
bidding on government contracts to a patchwork of regulations 
and incompatible standards.
<P>
	The government has felt strong and repeated pressure from 
the private sector to deal with the problems associated with 
internal barriers to trade and conflicting regulations on 
cross-border flows of people and capital. We have received 
representations from the Canadian Manufacturers' Association, 
the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, the Business Council on 
National Issues, the Canadian Federation of Independent 
Business, the Canadian Bankers Association, the Canadian 
Construction Association, and so on. The list is long and the 
problems are deeply felt and broadly experienced.
<P>
	Such barriers put Canadian businesses at a comparative 
disadvantage by restricting the size of the available marketplace 
and by making the markets open to Canadian businesses even 
smaller than they would be on an open national basis. In a time 
of increasing global competition and more open markets in other 
parts of the world, this can have the negative result of putting 
Canadian businesses at a disadvantage to international 
competitors, even in our own markets. In addition, there is an 
economic cost related to marketplace inefficiency. The 
Canadian Manufacturers' Association has estimated that 
barriers to trade cost Canadians about $7 billion annually in 
direct job and income loss.
<P>
	In years past, when external trade barriers protected 
economies like ours from international competition the 
economic costs of internal trade barriers were tolerated. When 
Canadian industry was sheltered from international competition 
by tariff barriers of 10 per cent or even 20 per cent, the economic 
costs were not so obvious. But a marketplace sheltered from 
international  competition is no longer the reality. International 
barriers and tariffs are down. The market is global and the 
competition is fierce.
<P>
	We will not and cannot be successful in an open global market 
if we operate in a closed market here at home. So we need to 
adapt to the international reality in trade. Bill C-88 and the 
agreement it implements is an important aspect of this process 
and is part of the more open fundamental process of economic 
renewal that the government is following towards its strategic 
objectives for economic growth and job creation.
<P>
	Last fall the Minister of Industry introduced in the House our 
government's plan to build a more innovative economy. We 
outlined our intentions for improving the economic climate of 
Canada in four ways: to build a positive entrepreneurial climate 
and to help small business grow; to expand markets for jobs and 
growth through trade; to create an efficient and modern 
infrastructure; and also to make technology work for Canada. 
These are the areas where the government can have the greatest 
impact on job creation.
<P>
	While Bill C-88 will support all of these objectives, it has 
special relevance for the objective to expand markets. To grow 
and prosper, business needs an efficient and open marketplace, 
an environment that encourages innovation and expansion, free 
of unnecessary barriers.
<P>
	With the agreement on internal trade and now with this bill we 
have the elements to establish a new internal trade regime in 
Canada, one that will allow us to make the most of our 
interprovincial domestic market by encouraging innovation and 
expansion and by removing unnecessary barriers to trade.
<P>
	The Canadian economy is in a period of transition. There are 
fundamental changes taking place because of the globalization 
of trade and the rapid pace of technological change. Competitive 
advantage in today's world depends less on location and natural 
resources and more on innovation and ability to respond to 
changing market conditions and to achieve economies of scale.
<P>
<B>(1750 ) </B>
<P>
	As we continue the transition from a resource based economy 
to one where innovation, knowledge, and flexibility are the 
underpinnings of competitive advantage, we need to ensure that 
the domestic trading environment will accommodate and 
expedite the necessary changes.
<P>
	Bill C-88 will provide a supportive environment for the 
economic transition process we are now experiencing. The 
legislation that is before the House now is the result of a long 
process of negotiations and consultation, which has involved 
many Canadians with many different perspectives, ministers of 
the federal government, ministers of all the provincial and 
territorial governments, officials of all these governments and 
representatives of the private sector. Also, it is interesting to 
note that political parties of all stripes have co-operated in 
negotiations leading to the agreement.  There were different 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12625"> 12625 </A></B>
<P>
perspectives, but a shared belief that a more open trading 
environment will be good for Canada.
<P>
	In fact a striking feature of the process has been the high 
degree of co-operation and goodwill that has been demonstrated 
on all sides. Those Canadians who have been involved in the 
process understand the compelling need to open our internal 
markets and ensure that the Canadian marketplace works to the 
advantage of all Canadians.
<P>
	Over the last two years the negotiations and background work 
were under the guiding hand of Mr. Arthur Mauro, a well known 
Canadian businessman. Mr. Mauro acted as chairman of the 
committee of chief negotiators and worked tirelessly to keep the 
process moving toward its objectives and produced the 
agreement that the ministers signed last year.
<P>
	The work leading up to this bill has been exhaustive. It has 
been thorough and it will be ongoing. It is our duty to keep the 
process moving. The process began in June 1988, when federal 
and provincial agriculture ministers compiled a list of barriers 
to internal trade in agricultural food products. A 
federal-provincial committee of ministers of internal trade with 
a commitment to open market access within Canada was 
formed. The focus of this group was comparatively narrow. 
Topics of discussion included government procurement, wine, 
spirits, and beer, transportation, professional mobility, and 
standards.
<P>
	The process had begun. Governments were now dealing with 
the problems of internal trade barriers in an organized way. 
Federal-provincial discussions continued and the focus 
widened. Ministers also began to consider the need for a dispute 
resolution mechanism as part of more comprehensive trading 
agreements between provinces and territories.
<P>
	In December 1989 a memorandum of understanding on 
internal trade in agricultural products was signed by seven of the 
provinces. The process was beginning to move. 
Federal-provincial negotiators continued to meet. Agreement 
was reached and memoranda of understanding were signed on a 
number of individual issues, such as transportation and 
government procurement.
<P>
	By December 1992 the committee of ministers of internal 
trade recommended that the process be accelerated and that all 
parties commit to the goal of reaching a broad and 
comprehensive internal trade agreement by June 30, 1994.
<P>
	By March 1993 the negotiators agreed to three specific 
principles as basic to an agreement. They were that governments 
treat people, goods, services, and capital equally, irrespective of 
where they originate in Canada; that government reconcile 
standards and regulations to provide for the free movement of 
people, goods, services, and capital within Canada; and that 
governments ensure that their administrative policies operate to 
provide for  the free movement of people, goods, services, and 
capital within Canada.
<P>
<B>(1755 ) </B>
<P>
	In August 1993 Mr. Mauro took charge of the negotiations. In 
December 1993 our government reaffirmed its commitment to 
the process, and in January 1994 chief negotiators were given 
specific instructions to prepare a draft agreement for the 
consideration of the committee of ministers of internal trade. 
Ministers were looking for an agreement that would improve 
three main elements: trade rules to apply to specific sectors or 
issue areas; an elaboration on how the rules would apply in these 
specific areas; and also a dispute resolution mechanism that 
would encourage parties to negotiate settlements but not to 
involve the courts.
<P>
	Now the process was in high gear. An intensive series of 
meetings was held during the period from January to June last 
year. These meetings culminated in ministers agreeing to the 
text of an internal trade agreement at the end of June. Following 
that, the Prime Minister and all other first ministers signified 
their acceptance of the agreement with a formal signing on July 
18. The final legal text was put in place and accepted by all 
parties by last October.
<P>
	All governments agreed to make necessary legislative and 
regulatory changes to bring the agreement into effect by July 1, 
1995. Bill C-88 fulfils the commitment of the federal 
government in this regard. Last year's agreement on internal 
trade was a major step in a long process. It has demonstrated that 
all governments can work together to achieve a common 
objective that will benefit all Canadians.
<P>
	What are we putting in place? The agreement on internal trade 
gives a set of general rules that prohibits any new barriers to 
trade and eliminates old ones in ten specific sectors or areas and 
establishes a formal mechanism for the resolution of disputes 
that may arise.
<P>
	The agreement provides for the following objectives. It will 
open the $50 billion annual government purchasing market to 
competitive bidding throughout Canada. It will reduce 
restriction on investment, including a code of conduct to forbid 
incentives that lure firms to relocate from one province to 
another. It will improve the ability of Canadians to work 
anywhere they wish. It commits government to work on 
harmonization of environmental protection, transportation 
standards, and consumer protection. It will set up an impartial 
publicly accessible process for resolving trade disputes between 
governments and between individuals and governments.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12626"> 12626 </A></B>
<P>
	The dispute settlement mechanism is based on the principle 
that it is preferable to solve problems informally and at an early 
stage. It reflects the desire of governments to cooperate rather 
than to confront or to litigate.
<P>
	Therefore, it sets out a methodical, step by step process of 
information exchange followed by consultations. Questions not 
settled in that way may be brought to an impartial panel that 
would make recommendations for solving the issue. Only as a 
last resort, when a party has failed to change a measure found to 
have violated the agreement, might retaliation be acceptable. 
Even then, action would be limited both in effect and scope to 
areas especially covered by the agreement.
<P>
	Also important is the fact that the agreement has the potential 
to grow and evolve. It deals directly with a large number of 
current issues and it provides the framework for negotiations to 
continue on others. Also, the agreement and this bill are parts of 
a broad set of activities now under way to create a more open 
trading environment throughout Canada.
<P>
	The provinces and territories have obligations to implement 
the terms of the agreement by July 1, 1995. Work is under way 
on many fronts to make necessary legislative and regulatory 
changes at the provincial and territorial levels. At the federal 
level we have both an obligation to make the necessary changes, 
as Bill C-88 does, as well as a duty to show leadership in order 
to advance the process. It is fair to say this bill does not solve all 
the interprovincial trade problems that have built up over the 
last 127 years. However, it has moved us a considerable way 
along the track.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	We see the process as one of forward movement. Some issues 
are dealt with. Systems and procedures are in place for dealing 
with others and new ones may yet come forward for our 
attention. For example, in the energy sector a separate set of 
negotiations is under way toward a similar deadline of July 1.
<P>
	A process is in place to deal with the outstanding issues in the 
agricultural sector. Issues related to interprovincial trade in 
alcoholic beverages are not resolved either, but a consultative 
mechanism is set up and deadlines for resolutions are in place.
<P>
	In summary, for the first time in our history, we will have a 
rules based system, a mechanism for settling disputes and a 
work plan for the future. In the future other issues may come up, 
for example, interprovincial regulations relating to financial 
services or standards for environmental protection. There is the 
further possibility of using the framework to consider 
streamlining and harmonizing ``non-standards'' regulations.
<P>
	Whatever new issues come forward, we will want to deal with 
them in the same spirit of co-operation, shared objectives and 
mutual interests that has now been established within the 
agreement on internal free trade  that this bill will implement. 
With this legislation we are ensuring the framework is in place 
and we are confirming our belief that the fundamental principles 
of free trade will work.
<P>
	When first ministers signed the agreement last summer they 
committed to having the necessary legislative and regulatory 
changes in place by July 1, 1995. Passage of this bill by the 
House will ensure we meet our obligations to our provincial and 
territorial colleagues as discussed at the recent meeting of 
federal, provincial and territorial ministers in Calgary. It will 
also demonstrate our continued leadership in the move toward a 
more open domestic trading environment and it will reinforce 
our other activities to create a more innovative economy.
<P>
	I want to emphasize that passing this bill is not the end of the 
process. It is part of a continuing one. This legislation builds the 
foundation and establishes the framework within which we will 
continue to build an effective domestic trading environment 
over time. Look at how the GATT and the European Union have 
evolved over time. The important thing is to establish the base 
and create the mechanism to allow for flexibility to meet 
changing economic conditions as they occur.
<P>
	Trade agreements deepen and broaden with use and 
experience and this one will too. Bill C-88 will provide the 
foundation for moving toward a domestic trading environment 
that will allow for the free flow of goods, services, people and 
capital within Canada. The Prime Minister and other ministers, 
including first ministers, have been actively involved in 
broadening the marketplace for Canadian goods and services in 
export markets. The Team Canada approach has been highly 
successful in doing that.
<P>
	Now we must bring the same spirit to improving the domestic 
market for our businesses and our workers. Bill C-88 is an 
important step in that direction and that is why we support it.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this bill 
is aimed at implementing the provisions of the Agreement on 
Internal Trade signed with the provinces last summer. To this 
end, the federal government must pass legislation to comply 
with the agreement before its coming into force, on July 1, 1995, 
as the minister said. Briefly put, this is the purpose of Bill C-88.
<P>
	First, I would like to show that Bill C-88 assumes powers 
which were never mentioned during the negotiations with the 
provinces or when the agreement was signed. This indicates a 
strong desire on the part of the federal government to centralize.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12627"> 12627 </A></B>
<P>
	In the second part of my speech, I would like to highlight 
some of the aspects of international trade which favour the 
political autonomy of the regions and the creation of economic 
unions rather than the establishment of great federations with 
a rigid and centralizing constitution such as the Canadian 
federation.
<P>
	Last summer's agreement deals with 11 specific areas, 
namely government contracts, investments, labour mobility, 
consumer protection standards and initiatives, farm products 
and foodstuffs, alcoholic beverages, natural resources 
processing, communications and transportation, energy and the 
protection of the environment. However, the sections of the 
agreement Bill C-88 deals with are basically those regarding 
dispute resolution, as if all the federal government could do was 
put controls in place.
<P>
	Articles 1601 to 1604 deal with the establishment of a 
committee on internal trade and its secretariat. The role of the 
committee will be to supervise the implementation of the 
agreement and to assist in the resolution of disputes. Article 
1705 deals with the establishment of a panel at the request of the 
disputing parties. The panel is made up of five members who 
will have to decide on the validity of the dispute and on 
retaliatory action that the complaining party will eventually be 
authorized to take.
<P>
	Articles 1710(4), (5) and (6) stipulate that, if the matter has 
not be resolved within one year of issuance of the panel report, 
the complaining party may request a meeting of the committee. 
The committee shall convene within 30 days to discuss with the 
complaining party the option of taking retaliatory action in 
respect of the party complained against. So, the complaining 
party may, until such time as a mutually satisfying resolution is 
achieved, impose to the party complained against retaliatory 
action of equivalent effect to the damage caused to the 
complaining party.
<P>
	If I am reminding the House of these few rather technical 
aspects of the Agreement on Internal Trade, it is essentially in 
order to highlight the context within which the interprovincial 
agreement was reached. We must understand that the panel 
decisions are not binding, which implies that the committee 
governing the interprovincial trade agreement has no power.
<P>
	If the party complained against does not comply with the 
panel recommendations, article 1710 applies. As we saw, article 
1710 deals with retaliation action that the complaining party 
may take in respect of the party that did not comply with the 
agreement.
<P>
	In fact, the main purpose of this bill is to implement the 
agreement on internal trade. The Bloc Quebecois has always 
been in favour of freer trade, which is the context in which states 
do business today. So, we support the principle of the 
agreement, but if the federal government is the aggrieved party 
under a trade agreement referred to in the agreement, it can 
impose retaliatory measures. However, that is not what is said in 
Bill C-88.
<P>
	In fact, clause 9 goes well beyond the spirit of the agreement 
reached by the provinces last summer. This is why we are 
against the bill as it stands now. Clause 9 reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For the purpose of suspending benefits or imposing retaliatory measures of 
equivalent effect against a province pursuant to Article 1710 of the Agreement, 
the Governor in Council may, by order-</BLOCKQUOTE>
And then it goes on. It says that the Governor in Council may 
act, by order, which is the method usually used by an autocratic 
government. This bill clearly shows that the Liberal government 
wants to govern by order in council.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	Are we again facing Liberal totalitarianism? In fact, clause 9 
means that, if a party is at fault pursuant to article 1710 of the 
agreement, then the federal government, whether or not it is 
party to the dispute, assumes the right to impose retaliatory 
measures against all of the provinces without distinction.
<P>
	Bill C-88 clearly indicates that the federal government 
intends to interfere in interprovincial trade and be both judge 
and judged, to provide through this agreement the power to act 
by order in council, a power it alone can exercise, and to extend 
the application of any federal law to the provinces, as mentioned 
in clause 9(<I>c</I>).
<P>
	Governing by order in council, setting oneself up as the 
arbiter of interprovincial trade, are measures that go way 
beyond the spirit of the agreement signed with the provinces last 
summer. Nowhere in the 13 paragraphs of article 1710 of the 
agreement is there mentioned any right of the federal 
government to intervene in a trade dispute when it is not itself 
one of the parties to the dispute, contrary to the retaliatory 
measures described in clause 9 of Bill C-88, as formulated and 
tabled before us today.
<P>
	The range of retaliatory measures the federal government has 
given itself in this clause is too broad. Its power of retaliation 
can affect the entire population of a province and is excessive. 
The problem stems, of course, from the fact that Ottawa has 
legislative power over all Canadians and can impose legislation 
on all the provinces.
<P>
	Bill C-88 is another example. In our opinion, the retaliatory 
measures contained in clause 9 must be toned down 
considerably and the focus limited strictly to matters of trade. 
The federal government would thus not be able to retaliate in the 
social sphere, by attacking the Canada Social Transfer, for 
example.
<P>
	I would have one last word concerning the intentions of the 
Liberal government reflected in this bill. Clause 14 of the bill 
provides, in the best Liberal tradition, that appointments to fill 
any position that may be necessary or advisable for carrying out 
the purposes of the Agreement be by order in council. To prevent 
any form of patronage on the part of the Prime Minister, the Bloc 
Quebecois requests that appointments be systematically  ap-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12628"> 12628 </A></B>
<P>
proved by the House of Commons, as they should be in a 
democratic system.
<P>
	There is no doubt in our mind that this bill is highly centralist. 
It is a sign of a retrograde vision of trade relations between the 
various regions of the same continent. We are living in an era of 
trade globalization, of the dissolving of tariff and non tariff 
barriers, of open markets and not of the heavy, unilateral 
regulation by order in council of a continental market by a single 
state like Canada.
<P>
	More and more, a new competitiveness can be found at the 
local, regional and provincial levels, which goes against the 
federal centralizing model. The new regional international 
model of economic development is an example of the 
globalization of economies, in which regional economic trade 
areas are swallowed by the global market.
<P>
	Fernand Martin, from the department of economic sciences of 
the Université de Montréal, is unequivocal regarding this 
regional international reality. He says that local businesses are 
realizing that they are competing not only with domestic 
businesses but with all other businesses, and that they no longer 
benefit from the buffer of national borders.
<P>
	This new reality on the world market underlies a second 
economic phenomenon: the role of local economies in the 
competitiveness of businesses. Regional space takes on a 
strategic importance. In this context, the intervention of a 
national state structure is no longer needed. By wanting to give 
unprecedented powers to the regions, the Government of 
Quebec fully grasped the new parameters of international trade, 
something that the government in Ottawa failed to do. NAFTA 
will decrease the federal government's power to intervene in 
economic matters even more.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	Even now in the area of international trade, agreements such 
as the GATT prevent Canada to a large extent from imposing 
tariffs and subsidizing exporters. These international 
agreements promote globalization of the economy and thus 
reduce, along with regional economic development, the federal 
government's control over the national and interprovincial 
economy.
<P>
	Globalization of trade was first and foremost the product of 
the emergence of the multinationals. They initially turned the 
states toward new economic spaces, such as NAFTA. Today 
their ability to restructure an economic space is well 
established. Accordingly, they confer international stature on 
the cities and regions they locate in. These cities and regions in 
turn form networks giving rise to decisions and economic policy 
previously the domain of central states.
<P>
	The federal government's regulatory authority, in these 
circumstances, becomes less and less important, and it is clear 
that clause 9 of Bill C-88 runs contrary to the current course of 
international trade. This point is all the more relevant, and, once 
again I quote Fernand Martin: ``-since economic development 
is based on competitive development, which counts on the 
quality of labour and on the infrastructures and economics of 
large population centres and urbanization. These levers come 
under provincial jurisdiction, because health, education and 
land use planning do''.
<P>
	Thus, in terms of economic development and international 
competitiveness, membership in a centralized economic union 
is today, at the dawn of the 21st century, of little importance. 
However, the same cannot be said when it comes to belonging to 
a region. Since Trudeau, the traditional federalist vision of the 
federal Liberals has never gone beyond the level of a strictly 
nationalist analysis. Like those from the Trudeau school of 
thought, this liberal government is obsessed by the fact that it is 
powerless to stop the national economy from being regionalized 
under the influence of multinationals and the newly created 
continental trade areas.
<P>
	It should not be forgotten that as interprovincial trade is 
increasingly following a north-south axis, Bill C-88, and more 
specifically clause 9, are nothing more than the reaction of this 
government without an economic agenda to this phenomenon 
and, by and large, to the present changes.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is an 
honour to rise in the House today and speak to second reading of 
Bill C-88, an act to implement the agreement on internal trade.
<P>
	However, Bill C-88 is like Bill C-85 on pension reform, it has 
more fluff than substance. Unfortunately it is another failure to 
deal with a serious problem. It appears to be another broken 
promise made in the famous red ink book. The Reform Party will 
be opposing the bill as it is currently written because it would 
implement an agreement that from a federalist perspective may 
be a step backward in our already deplorable situation.
<P>
	I would like to point out for the benefit of all members the 
problems this bill brings, some historical perspective and as 
always, the Reform alternative, what I believe can be an 
inexpensive, agreeable and efficient solution to our current 
problems.
<P>
	We are all aware that Canada has a massive problem with the 
free flow of goods, services and capital within our borders. We 
are all aware of the hundreds of barriers that exist to trade 
between the provinces, the billions of dollars this costs the 
economy annually, the thousands of jobs that are lost to 
Canadians and the larger than necessary government deficits 
that continue to grow.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12629"> 12629 </A></B>
<P>
	The Canadian Chamber of Commerce estimates that 
interprovincial trade barriers cost every Canadian family at 
least $1,000 a year. Others have estimated that the cost per 
family may be as high as $3,500 per year.
<P>
	The chamber continues on to say: ``These estimates do not 
capture the costs associated with new activity that is deterred as 
a result of the existence of barriers. For example, existence of 
internal barriers and the knowledge that new ones can be 
introduced at any time can deter Canadian businesses and 
entrepreneurs from undertaking new initiatives based on the 
expectation of access to the whole Canadian market. Similarly, 
the existence of internal barriers may discourage international 
investors who seek to locate their plants in fully integrated 
markets from bringing their productive investments to 
Canada''.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	There is no partisan issue in these considerations. We have all 
agreed, as did all the premiers last year, that these barriers to 
growth, productivity and employment must be reduced and 
eliminated. Even the current premier of Quebec has indicated 
his willingness to find agreement in these matters. Free trade 
within our borders is something every member of the House can 
agree to, except perhaps the NDP.
<P>
	Where some of us differ is on the issue of the best mechanism 
to get there. The agreement signed last year between the 
provinces and Ottawa is a faulty mechanism that may do more 
damage than the good it intends.
<P>
	A <I>Globe and Mail</I> editorial stated: ``To say that the signing of 
the agreement on interprovincial trade barriers was a triumph of 
federalism would be an overstatement. To say that it will create 
a free market would be an illusion. To say that it will bring 
stability and unity would be optimism''. The editorial continues 
to talk about the status quo of barriers which will remain in place 
saying: ``These are the wages of parochialism and the country 
continues to pay them''.
<P>
	What became perfectly clear at the outcome of the meeting 
was not that the agreement to trade freely had been brokered but 
rather that an excellent photo opportunity had been set up for 
one candidate in the Quebec provincial election. All news 
commentators made that point. All of them remarked on the 
shallowness of the deal and in the final analysis they were right. 
The deal was shallow and the photo opportunity was a bust. The 
Quebec candidate went on to lose the election.
<P>
	Unfortunately Canadians have to suffer with the results. 
There is still no improvement in trade between the provinces. 
The unity question continues to burn. We believe that in the 
solution to our domestic trade problem we will also find the 
solution to our national unity problem. The trade ties that could 
be binding us together as Canadians are the trade walls which 
are currently keeping us apart. Reformers and the BQ agree on 
this point. The Liberals say they agree but their words have rung 
hollow so far.
<P>
	A Liberal Party pollster summed it up well when he said: 
``The people on the street know this is no victory for federalism. 
They know the deal is full of loopholes. They know that Canada 
has successfully negotiated a sweeping free trade deal with the 
United States but is unable to do so within its own borders''.
<P>
	It is important to reflect on the statements that have come 
from the government recently with respect to free trade. For 
example, the finance minister estimated that the economy would 
grow by 0.4 per cent as a result of the implementation of the 
GATT agreement due to freer trade with other countries. On the 
other hand, estimates by the Fraser Institute on the effect of 
removing interprovincial trade barriers ranged from 2 per cent 
up to a possible 6 per cent growth in GDP.
<P>
	In other words, with the Uruguay round of the GATT we spent 
seven years and millions of tax dollars to negotiate with 120 
foreign countries to open up trade and yet we have an 
opportunity to realize five to fifteen times the economic benefit 
by legislating, negotiating and arbitrating among only ten 
provinces. Unfortunately, the government has given only a 
half-hearted effort so far.
<P>
	The Minister for International Trade in speaking to the GATT 
implementation bill stated: ``The agreement includes an 
enormous package of national commitments to lower tariffs and 
non-tariff barriers to merchandise trade''. It sounds wonderful 
but where are the complementary commitments we need to 
increase interprovincial trade?
<P>
	The Prime Minister stated during the first ministers' 
conference that thousands of new jobs would be created and it 
would benefit all Canadians regardless of region. Unfortunately 
the talk we have heard bears little resemblance to the inaction 
we have seen in the flawed agreement. Let me explain where 
some of the flaws are.
<P>
	The agreement sets out to eliminate specific barriers but may 
in fact create new ones and higher hurdles for business to cross. 
An example is the provision contained in article 709 which 
states that a province may adopt or maintain a measure that is 
inconsistent with the articles on labour mobility if the purpose 
of that measure is to achieve a legitimate objective.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	The list of legitimate objectives is extensive. Any province 
wishing to maintain or erect a barrier need look no further than 
this list to find a suitable excuse. Included are: public security, 
safety and order; protection of human, animal or plant life and 
health; protection of the environment; consumer protection; 
affirmative action and so on.
<P>
	In other words, labour mobility is restricted by the 
self-serving interests of any province through the articles 
contained in this agreement. Many would recognize this as the 
current status quo, but early on I said this may even be a step 
backwards. Such 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12630"> 12630 </A></B>
<P>
a provision could be used by any self-interested group in any 
province to erect new barriers to trade.
<P>
	The dispute resolution mechanism included in this agreement 
may deal with these issues but it is not clear that the agreement 
will bind a province that wishes to go its own way.
<P>
	Another major impediment to change is article 1507, part III, 
which states that nothing in this agreement shall be construed to 
effect the existing rights and obligations of the provinces under 
other environmental agreements, including conservation 
agreements. It does not take very much effort to realize that if 
one province wanted to keep in place an existing trade barrier, 
all it would have to do would be to claim an environmental 
exemption. Even worse, it is obvious that new trade barriers 
could be erected under this article. Again the agreement appears 
to be a step backwards.
<P>
	One fact that cannot escape scrutiny is that many new 
regulations, panels and other administrative functions have 
been introduced in this bill both at the provincial and the federal 
level. It is plain that a whole new bureaucracy will spring up: 
new jobs for bureaucrats, new expense for the taxpayers but not 
necessarily any benefits to consumers.
<P>
	However, one provision stands out as an improvement over 
the past practice and that is the proposed reduction in 
restrictions on interprovincial trucking. The consensus in this 
important area should not be dismissed lightly. Barriers to 
trucking have raised transportation costs, resulted in 
inefficiencies and lost productivity, and ultimately cost 
consumers millions. I hope we can capitalize on the consensus 
reached on this aspect of the agreement.
<P>
	Some commentators have made the observation that the 
agreement is only the first step in a process which will see more 
agreements signed and barriers reduced. While this may be true, 
Reformers believe that this first step agreement is not 
necessarily a step forward. If we are going to improve the 
situation, it is vital that all steps must move us forward and 
reduce barriers, not leaving the possibility that new barriers can 
be erected in their place. We have lived with the status quo for 
too long already and Canadians deserve better.
<P>
	It is important to look at the historical record and see where 
we have been as a nation in dealing with this issue. When 
Canada was created out of four British colonies in 1867 the 
founding fathers of Confederation had one purpose in mind. 
They believed that if they united, they could resist being pulled 
into the American sphere of influence and retain their distinct 
cultural heritage.
<P>
	They saw two strategies as essential to resisting American 
pressures. The first was a unified military which could better 
defend the borders of Canada. Thankfully we have not had to 
face a major threat on our own soil since that time. But our 
armed forces have served with distinction in most major 
conflicts and all peacekeeping missions since that time.
<P>
	The second strategy to maintain a distinct identity was to 
implement free trade between the provinces. It was believed that 
the free flow of goods and services would strengthen economic, 
political and cultural ties east to west instead of north to south.
<P>
	It is quite obvious in which strategy we failed to accomplish 
our objectives. The fact is that trade between Canada and the 
U.S. today in many goods is freer and easier than the trade 
between the provinces.
<P>
	Where we do fall down on this issue, history has shown it 
came because of ineffectual leadership in this area at the federal 
level.
<P>
	I see my time is running out. I have quite a bit more. Will I be 
allowed to finish my presentation later?

consent to apply the vote in the following way: that the vote on 
second reading of Bill C-89 be applied in reverse to the motion 
now before the House.
<P>
<B>(1910 ) </B>
<P>
	If you were to seek it you might find similar consent to apply 
this vote to report stage Motions Nos. 4, 5 and 6, as well as to the

<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADIANNATIONAL">CANADIAN NATIONAL</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, on May 8 
I rose in the House and asked the Minister of Transport to 
explain why the government appeared to have changed its policy 
outlined in the red book of resisting U.S. influence in the 
economy and in our nation by leaving the share offering that he 
was proposing in his commercialization bill for CNR open to 
foreign purchasers.
<P>
	In the minister's response he said: ``I have not seen any major 
changes in the way Canadian Pacific Railway operates and 
handles its shipments, as opposed to CNR''. With that, he 
apparently was attempting to justify the fact that on a one time 
only offering of shares for ownership and control of CNR it 
would somehow come out with a similar kind of shareholding as 
Canadian Pacific.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="12640"> 12640 </A></B>
<P>
	I think the minister failed to recognize that Canadian Pacific 
began under the guidance of the government of the day and that 
there was an initial policy of Canadian ownership and control, 
even though some of the capital came from Great Britain and the 
United States. That tradition of existing shareholders, 
ownership, and control continues. It is not very likely that the 
balance of control over CPR would change overnight, as is 
possible with the CNR commercialization offering, because the 
shares will be offered all at once. If there are no Canadian 
bidders or purchasers it could conceivably all fall into the hands 
of foreigners, with the only control being that no one purchaser 
could hold more than 15 per cent.
<P>
	I noticed that when the group that investigated 
commercialization for the government looked at it, they were 
attempting to answer the question of how competition could be 
encouraged to ensure that pricing and outcomes are not affected 
by the duopoly nature of railways in Canada. They were also 
asked to describe how the rationalization and abandonment 
process could be improved to ensure that efficiency and equity 
are addressed.
<P>
	It seems to me that the proposal I put forward of putting the 
first share offering directly into the hands of farmers, because 
the amount of money is roughly the same as what is going to be 
netted from CNR after the brokerage fees are taken off and 
because the government had already decided to allocate $1.6 
billion toward that end-that a different use of those funds 
would in fact allow for true competition because the users would 
then be the owners of the railway and it would be in their own 
interests to keep the prices for the service of the railway as low 
as possible. This would in fact force a new, never  before seen 
kind of competition onto the rail sector in this country.
<P>
	I cite as an example the kind of competition that resulted on 
the prairies in the elevator system in the teens and twenties, 
when farmers began taking over the ownership of government 
owned elevators at that time and the elevator system became 
truly competitive. For the first time in 20 years of buying grain, 
a truly honest, fair weight and fair pay were given.
<P>
<B>(1925) </B>
<P>
	This is the kind of thing we could expect if the government 
would accept the proposition that there are other ways of 
commercializing CN that would put full control directly in the 
hands of the users not just of owners.
<P>
	I stress to the government that the question of control is even 
more important than who owns CN, the people who decide who 
will be the board of directors. Those directors would be making 
the decisions to operate the company afterward. If those 
directors had to respond and be responsible to the users, the 
resource industry which in this case would be the farmers, it 
would be a big step toward true global competitiveness.
<P>
	The minister has said that he does not think farmers want to 
own CNR. He said outside the Chamber that he has some doubts 
they would be able to operate the CNR. I point out that they have 
a lot of experience outside of farm operations which has proven 
to be very beneficial to them, their communities and the 
economy. These have become very much commercial 
operations. This has held the farming and rural community in 
good stead.
<P>
	For those farmers who do not wish to continue to hold shares 
in CNR, it would be very simple for them to sell the shares. I am 
sure that other resource users such as mines, timber businesses 
and sulphur shippers would be interested in buying shares, as 
would the initial farmer shareholders. As well, some port cities 
would be interested in owning shares that might become 
available from the farmers who wish to retire and dispose of 
their CN assets. There would be quite a diversified ownership of 
the company.
<P>
	Most important, because those shares would come on the 
market slowly and not in 100 per cent blocks as is the 
proposition the government is putting forward, it would be 
highly unlikely that foreigners would quickly get to own and 
control the CNR.
<P>
	It is especially important that when the east west policy is 
fully abandoned by the government, the natural flow will be 
north and south. The proposition of U.S. railroads and shippers 
ending up controlling the second railway in this country is not a 
prospect I who represent shippers in western Canada look 
forward to.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Fontana (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this government's objectives are 
to put CN on a viable footing so that it maintains 
competitiveness with other carriers and to  maximize the value 
of the sale of CN's shares to Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	To achieve maximum value the broadest possible distribution 
of shares is necessary. The initial public offering of CN will be 
the largest such issue in Canadian history. The Canadian equity 
market may not be large enough on its own to absorb such an 
issue of this size.
<P>
	To ensure the divestiture of all the government's equity in CN 
at maximum value, markets outside of Canada will need to be 
assessed. The United States in particular will be an important 
market. Its numerous investors are familiar with the rail renewal 
and revitalization which Canadian railways and CN in particular 
are undertaking. Foreign ownership restrictions could 
jeopardize the participation of these investors.
<P>
	Canadian rail policy does not restrict or prohibit foreign 
ownership. More than 30 per cent of CP's limited shares are 
owned abroad. By not limiting foreign ownership for CN it 
ensures a level playing field between both CN and CP in their 
ability to raise equity capital in global financial markets.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="12641"> 12641 </A></B>
<P>
	The government's financial advisers agree that a foreign 
ownership limit could reduce the potential size of the issue and 
would reduce the price. Limits could also prevent the 
government from selling the majority stake. Given the size of 
the share offering, a successful issue would be endangered if the 
potential shareholder base was limited to Canada.
<P>
	While shareholder investment thresholds under the 
Competition Act and Investment Canada Act could conceivably 
have provided sufficient safeguards against an unwanted foreign 
takeover, the proposed 15 per cent limit on individual share 
ownership also acts as an effective constraint on foreign control. 
Past experience with Canadian initial public offerings indicates 
that foreign sales are unlikely to approach, let alone exceed, 50 
per cent.
<P>
