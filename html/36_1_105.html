</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe—Grey, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, today 
I am putting two regional political parties on notice.  These 
parties are the Bloc and the Reform.  Both parties knowingly or 
unknowingly are negative forces in our government's attempt to 
resolve unity problems once and for all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During this first session I have witnessed escapades like the 
Reformers screaming, Reformers throwing Canadian flags on the 
floor and Reformers driving around Parliament Hill in an old 
wreck of a car with the Canadian flag painted on it for no other 
reason than to excite emotion and gain a little publicity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the Bloc members screaming.  I see them abusing 
parliamentary privilege to promote the break-up of our great 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both of these factions should be ashamed of themselves. Bloc and 
Reform listen up. The residents of Simcoe—Grey want a united 
Canada.  The vast majority of Canadians want a united Canada. 
Indeed the vast majority of residents of Quebec want a united 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of all Canadians, enough is enough.  Stop trying to 
break up our country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
let us look at the heritage minister's misguided attempt at 
promotion of Canadiana, the most recent being the CRTC Canadian 
radio content ruling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The measurements of music, artist, production and lyrics, known 
as MAPL, forces some Canadian artists off Canadian radio stations 
while others simply because they reach the bureaucratic high bar 
are included. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CanCon censors micromanage what Canadians can listen to. While 
only 12% of CDs purchased are certifiably Canadian, radio 
stations are forced to play 35%, soon to be raised to 40%, 
certifiably MAPL rated music.  This decision to increase Canadian 
content to 35% was simply picked out of thin air. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should this government bother to hold expensive hearings and 
public forums when the result is the CRTC and the minister do not 
listen to the people anyway?  The minister's Canadiana 
culturecrats do not trust Canadians to be Canadians.

welcoming over 600 participants, judges, parents and visitors to 
this prestigious and popular event. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not only an opportunity for young Canadian scientists to 
display their projects and compete for awards, it is also an

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to publicly thank the organizing committee of the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, when 
a government drains our best and brightest from our workforce, it 
drains our future, our promise and our prosperity as a nation. 
Right now we have an entire generation of economic refugees 
fleeing our borders, a generation driven away by high taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the brain drain facts. Over the last seven years, work 
visas to the U.S. have increased tenfold.  There has been a 20% 
increase in Canadian doctors and nurses leaving for the states 
since 1985.  Last year the University of Waterloo had 120 U.S. 
companies recruiting its graduates, four times more than in 1995. 
One-third of its co-op computer grads are hired away by 
Microsoft each year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is we are subsidizing American jobs with Canadian 
education.  What we really need is to create an environment that 
lets our graduates stay here at home.  For us in Canada this 
means lower taxes.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Nationally the Canadian Nurses Association is addressing 
strategies to improve the quality of health care including the

youth who form the Baffin Regional Youth Council today may very 
well be leaders in Nunavut tomorrow.  I wish them good cheer and 
good luck in their future endeavours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next week is Aboriginal Awareness Week in Canada. Although we 
have made great strides in awareness of aboriginal issues, 
success stories and even problems in the last 10 years, we still 
have a lot of work to do in teaching all Canadians about many 
other issues related to all aspects of native culture, beliefs, 
lifestyles, hopes, aspirations and dreams. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that next week every Canadian will make a special effort 
to get to know about aboriginal issues and that the dialogue will 
continue for better relations for all concerned.

</I></B></P><P align=left>“I am not revealing a secret by stating publicly that I am in 
favour of an elected Senate.”  Senator Gauthier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“I think that would be the first step towards democratizing 
this place and going to the elected Senate, which I have 
advocated for years.”  Senator Perrault. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Canadians will not tolerate much longer the status quo.  The 
status quo means our work and our efforts will become meaningless 
and we're better off staying home.”  Senator Ghitter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even a number of senators want the Senate reformed.  When is the 
Prime Minister going to realize he is on the wrong side of the 
issue and live up to his promises to reform the Senate?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, May is 
National Speech and Hearing Awareness Month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government is committed to building a society where the 10% 
of Canadians who suffer from hearing impairment can reach their 
goals both personally and professionally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a person who suffers from hearing loss.  I have no hearing 
in my left ear and only 50% in my right.  In spite of this 
disability I have been able to build a successful accounting 
practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of this House I have been able to use the sound 
equipment here without much impediment. In fact it has sometimes 
been a great advantage to me to turn off my hearing aid which I 
might say often adds to the comprehensibility of this place 
rather than detracts from it.  Of course this is the lighter side 
of what for many is a major impediment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can say that government through programs at HRDC has made 
funding available to allow for training and computerization of 
many job functions to allow people with hearing impairments to 
have full and productive lives.

the hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine said that President 
Roosevelt was in favour of assimilating French Canadians. On 
this basis, the hon. member urged our leader to denounce the 
monument in Quebec, which, in her mind, is unfair to Liberal 
Prime Minister Mackenzie King. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, an excerpt of Mackenzie King's personal diary published 
in the March 1, 1997, issue of <I>L'Actualité</I>, stated that Hitler 
and Mussolini really tried to make various benefits available to 
the grassroots and that Hitler could be seen as one of the 
saviours of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we follow the logic of the hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine, every work perpetuating King's memory

the cause of such humiliation for the Liberals, should be 
denounced.

members of the NDP continue to raise concerns about the 
disastrous effect of Bill C-9 on Canadian ports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most damaging sections of Bill C-9 is section 25. 
Section 25 bans any federal government from giving any money to 
any ports to improve their infrastructure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How dare the government make decisions for future governments. 
By closing the door to federal investment in ports, this 
government is on a collision course with Canadians who depend on 
ports for their livelihood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday NDP MPs lobbied members of the Senate transport 
committee before they rubber stamped the minister's bill but some 
refused to listen to common sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Common sense tells us if we want to remain competitive, we must 
look at our competition.  The Americans understand the importance 
of investing in their ports and that is what they are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New Democrats call on the minister to suspend approval of Bill 
C-9 until the disastrous provisions prohibiting federal 
investment in Canadian ports are removed.

C-36, the budget implementation act, nickels and dimes Canada's 
poor seniors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one blinked an eye when the budget promised to “improve the 
way in which the guaranteed income supplement operates”.  This 
was until people realized that the finance minister's idea of 
improvement is to cut benefits to seniors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take for instance the effects Bill C-36 will have on seniors who 
are working to earn extra money.  These seniors will now be 
subject to a stiffer clawback on the benefits they receive.  If 
the clawback that already exists was not enough, the government 
proposes to take up to $250 more from the poorest senior citizens 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of these senior citizens are working in fast food 
restaurants. They were told by this government that they would 
get a full meal deal.  Instead, this finance minister is giving 
them the drive through.  It is unfortunate and it is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister's improvements nickel and dime Canada's 
poorest seniors.  That is why I have sent a letter to all members

<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, tomorrow the country's health ministers will meet to 
solve the problem of compensating hepatitis C victims.  But the 
real problem has become the federal health minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister did not want this meeting.  He has fought full 
compensation for the victims tooth and nail.  He is the one that 
said this file was closed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I ask, will the health minister make a personal commitment 
to this House to achieving compensation for all hepatitis C victims 
at the conference tomorrow? 
<P><A NAME="LINK36"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I know that our objective in attending the meeting tomorrow is to 
determine from the health ministers across the country what their 
position is on these issues and to find out whether we can reach 
a new consensus on how to approach the issue of those who 
received hepatitis C through the blood system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My personal commitment to this House, to the member and to all 
members of the parliament, is to spend my time tomorrow trying to 
forge with my counterparts a consensus on how to approach this 
problem. 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the victims and the premiers are asking the minister 
and the federal government to commit to a position and we get no 
commitment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make things worse, the minister's officials are saying that 
the health minister will be proposing a two-tier package 
tomorrow:  two tiers of compensation and two tiers of health care 
for two tiers of victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is this Liberal health minister pitting one group of victims 
against another by proposing a two-tier system? 
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
first, I would caution the Leader of the Opposition against 
engaging in speculation.  That is something I am not going to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather, I am going to go to the table and sit with ministers of 
health from across Canada.  I am going to find out what their 
views are.  Some have changed their position over the last few 
weeks.  I am going to find out from them what their approach is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will then determine whether it is possible to do what is in 
the interests of all ill people in this country, which is to have 
an integrated and co-ordinated approach among all levels of 
government to the health system to serve those who are ill.  That 
is our objective. 
<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we know that the health minister does not get along 
too well with the backbenchers.  No wonder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The MP from St. Paul's is now saying that any assistance should 
be based on pathology rather than chronology.  In other words, 
she does not want— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  My colleagues, the hon. Leader of the 
Opposition has the floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the backbenchers do not 
want two tiers of victims based on when someone was infected. 
That is precisely the same point that Premier Harris made in his 
unanswered letter to the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the health minister the question that Ontario is bound to 
ask him tomorrow.  Does he still believe it is fair to treat 
someone infected on December 31, 1985 differently than someone 
infected on January 1, 1986? 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
one of the reasons it is important for us to find out tomorrow 
what provincial positions are is that the federal government 
cannot resolve this issue by itself.  It is the provinces which 
deliver the services.  The hon. leader knows that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very odd to listen to the leader of the Reform Party 
complaining about a two-tier approach to health care when he and 
his party are the people who call the Canada Health Act an 
outdated piece of legislation and who want to introduce two-tier 
medicine in this country.

hour ago I talked with Jeremy Beaty of the Hepatitis C Society. 
The victims are meeting with the health ministers tomorrow. 
Jeremy asked that he not just have a quick little audience and 
then be ushered out.  He wanted, at the end of their 
presentation, to have a dialogue with the health ministers.  He 
wants to hear what they have to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will our health minister give Jeremy the opportunity to have a 
dialogue, an interchange? 
<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I sent Mr. Beaty a copy of my letter to provincial and 
territorial ministers urging them to join me in receiving 
representatives of the Hepatitis C Society and, indeed, we added 
other societies as well who are interested in the subject so we 
can hear them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member and the House can be assured that as far as we are 
concerned those representatives will be accorded the respect that 
they are due. 
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, Mr. Beaty 
will notice that there was not an answer to my question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have a second request.  Although they will be ushered out 
and the ministers will not be able to listen to them all, at the 
end of the deliberations they want to come back to hear the 
solution.  They want to have these health ministers look them in 
the eye and tell them what they are going to do for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will Jeremy Beaty and the other victims get a chance to look 
these ministers in the eye when they have their solution? 
<P><A NAME="LINK44"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
we have written to ministers urging them to join us in welcoming 
representatives of the Hepatitis C Society and other 
associations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should say that the member ought not to jump to the conclusion 
that there is going to be a resolution tomorrow.  Indeed, the 
provinces may take a very different position and it may not be 
possible to have a consensus tomorrow.  We will do the best we 
can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member should bear in mind that this depends as much on what 
the provincial positions are as it does on what the federal 
position is.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, by 
detonating five nuclear bombs one after the other, India has 
challenged international public opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has also rekindled the already considerable tension with 
Pakistan, as well as with China.  And all this has taken place 
in an area of the globe where the political situation is far 
from stable, given the situation that also exists in Indonesia 
and Afghanistan in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will Canada, which until now has been content to have the Prime

position and implement real political and economic sanctions, as 
the United States is doing? 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
have already taken concrete action.  We have withdrawn our high 
commissioner, suspended all contact with India, and banned all 
military exports.  We are considering and taking decisions 
regarding other measures, following active consultation with our 
allies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are taking concrete action because we are in complete 
disagreement with what India is doing. 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
the past, Canada has placed substantial limitations on trade 
with certain countries, in order to put pressure on them.  I am 
thinking of South Africa in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If India persists in defying international public opinion, does 
the government plan to take more substantial action against this 
country, such as reviewing the work of the Export Development 
Corporation? 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
repeat that we are actively considering additional but sensible 
measures. Our approach is to work together with our allies 
because, as I said, we are in complete disagreement with India's 
nuclear activities.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's attitude toward the use of nuclear testing as an 
instrument of intimidation in a regional conflict is pretty 
weak, considering the important issues raised by the 
irresponsible attitude of the Indian government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Above and beyond the intentions of the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs and the Prime Minister to raise the question at the G-8

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the matter 
of hepatitis C, the meeting of the health ministers has yet to 
begin, but the government is already talking about a plan B, 
which does not involve compensation, another plan B destined to 
fail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government must now concentrate on plan A: compensation for

</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, however, what matters is that we are keeping an open mind

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
crafting a fair compensation package demands leadership from the 
federal government.  Dividing blood injured Canadians into two 
classes of victims reflects a failure of leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Victims will not accept two-tier compensation.  Canadians will 
not accept two-tier compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the health minister categorically reject here and now all

<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>   Mr. 
Speaker, I do not think it is useful to speculate on the outcome 
of tomorrow's meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also think it is important to bear in mind that the solution 
to this issue must come not just from the federal government, but 
from all governments, the provincial governments who deliver 
health services, the provincial governments who are responsible 
for administering health programs in the provinces.  To be sure, 
under the leadership of the Prime Minister, we have brought them 
to the table so far, but the solution must be found in the 
provinces as well as in the federal government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the same 
blood system infected people before and after 1986, but the 
government's policy toward the victims is to divide and 
discriminate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we hear that the minister may offer a two-tier package that 
will leave the provinces with the ongoing cost of assisting hep C 
victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister do the right thing and go into the meeting 
with an open mind?  Will he commit to go into the meeting 
tomorrow to see how all the victims can be compensated and not 
whether all the victims will be treated equally? 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will, of course, approach the meeting with an open mind.  That 
is the way I have approached the subject from the outset. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to tell the hon. member that this is the party that 
is responsible for introducing medicare in Canada.  This is the 
party that believes strongly in one tier of treatment for those 
who are ill and no proposal we make or support at any time will 
depart from the principle of one tier of treatment for those who 
are ill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, God 
bless those who got hep C before 1986 if he went in with an open 
mind that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By slashing health care transfers by billions of dollars since 
1994 the government has jeopardized provincial ability to meet 
the health care needs of not just hep C victims, but all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some provinces have realized that to compensate some victims and 
not others is wrong and they are willing to put more money on the 
table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the government have the courage to do the same when it goes 
into that meeting tomorrow? 
<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
what we have managed to do, remarkably, is to make our way 
through the economic ruins left by the last government to restore 
fiscal balance and at the same time maintain cash transfers to 
the provinces at a floor of $12.5 billion a year. 
That is a remarkable achievement.  We will bring that kind of 
skill and commitment to this issue as well.

talk about these issues.  We finally got them through a series of 
several meetings to the point where together we offered 
compensation to a group that was infected at a time when those 
responsible could have prevented those infections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be sitting down again tomorrow to look at outstanding

</I></B></P><P align=left>Jonathon Duncan had 16 blood transfusions between 1983 and 1986. 
One transfusion falls in the 1986 to 1990 compensation window

one tiered approaches.

the member will find that it is dangerous to use examples for 
partisan purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few weeks ago they were talking about a 15 year old boy.  They 
were saying that 15 year old boy was excluded from the 
compensation offer.  When we found out the facts of the case we 
discovered that the little boy was covered. I caution the member 
to be careful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than engage in that, I will be at the table tomorrow with

yesterday the justice minister admitted that the Young Offenders

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as usual, 
we got a non-answer, sort of a liberal answer.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Cancelling talks is one thing, tough sanctions are what

C victims before 1986 and post-1991?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the member should know that the provincial governments actually 
provide health services.  They are the ones that run the health 
systems in the provinces.  Any solution must involve and include 
the provincial governments, which is the reason we brought them 
together to one table over several sessions to make the progress 
we have.

that is my objective and it is to that process that I am

I think we are on the right track.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, I want to protest in the 
strongest terms the actions of the chair of the justice committee 
yesterday to bring a report before the House this afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee adopted this report with only one opposition 
member present and no notice was given of the intention to 
proceed in this manner at yesterday's meeting.  The chair and the 
Liberal members at the committee knew full well that the 
opposition members were intending to attend the briefing that was 
called by the Minister of Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Liberal caucus were given an advanced briefing of 
the same material at 1 o'clock yesterday, while the opposition 
members were not provided the same information until 3 o'clock. 
This activity, I suggest, created a planned conflict for the 
justice committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agenda of the justice committee could have been adjusted and 
the Liberals' intention, therefore, to adopt the report with a 
full committee would have been much more advisable.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice certainly should have been and I suggest 
would have been aware of this conflict and resulting fiasco for 
the opposition.  The contempt that she showed for the House of 
Commons by failing to make her policy statement here in the House 
as a ministerial statement rather than a statement to the press 
is an attempt to manipulate this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that a warning to the minister, the 
parliamentary secretary and the chair of the justice committee is 
in order.  All of those individuals have to depend on the 
goodwill of the House, including the opposition and the second 
House of Parliament, if there is to be a successful disposition 
of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the government to use this coming week to reflect on this 
point and I serve warning that the insults shown to the 
opposition and the amateur attempts to manipulate the House will 
result in the undermining of the government House leader, which 
might lead to unforeseen consequences for future good workings in 
this parliament. 
<P><A NAME="LINK136"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I agree with my colleague's comments.  We had a short discussion 
regarding this with the House leaders yesterday and I think it is 
appropriate in this House that we start acknowledging and 
respecting our colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that when these ministers have points to make or 
reports to table they should be tabled in this House prior to 
them going out and worrying about their media friends.  They 
should be here giving every consideration to their colleagues and 
tabling reports prior to media events or any other such events 
because these kinds of issues are important to all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  My colleagues, indeed, these types of points 
have been raised before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough mentions 
something that took place in the committee and I firmly believe 
that he does have a grievance.  However, I think that particular 
point should be settled in the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to other statements being made, the House does not 
have any rules governing this particular way of disseminating 
information.  However, I would encourage ministers and, indeed, 
all members when they bring reports, if it is at all possible, 
that we, the collective parliamentarians of Canada, should have 
access to these documents as quickly as possible.  I understand 
that sometimes that cannot be done when the House is not sitting. 
I understand that.  But where it is possible I would urge 
ministers to consider doing just such a thing in the future.

ceremonial dress of red tunics and bearskin hats, most 
recognizable worldwide from their role on Parliament Hill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This representation should not eclipse the participation of the

Highlanders coordinated the APEC 97 tranportation effort.

an additional two days at eight hours per day average.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, as a member of 
the finance committee responsible for reviewing Bill C-36 as it 
relates to the millennium fund, I am very pleased to take the 
floor today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, the millennium scholarships are as important as 
manpower training. It would have been a symbolic gesture on the 
part of the government to comply with the consensus that has 
been expressed in Quebec, concerning the possibility of opting 
out, with full compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the millennium scholarships are a test of the 
flexibility of federalism. This is the kind of attitude we are 
up against.  We saw 34 groups, 41% of which came from Quebec. 
All Quebec groups were in favour of opting out with full 
compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, this is a demonstration of the government's bad 
faith. 
Had it wanted to show good faith in this matter, it would have 
amended the Canada Student Loans Act.  All that would have 
required, as we know, was to add these scholarships on to it, 
and then opting out with full compensation would have been 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I would point out the bad faith of the government, and 
then there is another point to be made as well.  They could have 
given the current negotiations a chance without rushing to pass 
a bill which, as we know, does not give the power to the 
foundation and does not allow a province to opt out with full 
compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we want to do so?  Clearly, as the Prime Minister himself 
has said, he needs visibility.  He is therefore creating a bill 
that does not allow opting out with full compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The board will not have the power to delegate to the provinces. 
That is why the Bloc Quebecois will speak today on this Bill 
C-36, which we oppose because the millennium scholarships do not 
reflect the reality of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had it not been for pressure from the Government in Quebec and 
the coalition for Quebec's withdrawal with full compensation, we 
would never have had the opportunity to speak for Quebec. Forty 
one percent of those who testified through their various 
organizations, or 1.2 million people, have been heard by the 
committee, including 89,000 small businessmen and women.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the business community, Quebec's Conseil du 
patronat and Chamber of Commerce as well as manufacturers and 
exporters from both Quebec and Canada came before the committee 
to ask that Quebec be allowed to manage education and to opt out 
with full compensation, so that funds can be allocated based on 
the needs and realities of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very disappointed. I sat on this committee with a great 
deal of good faith. I was able to see once again how little 
attention is paid to Quebec's demands, consensus and reality. 
These were ignored since the government members, after having 
heard all the witnesses, do not have a single amendment to 
propose in this place. 
I am disappointed as a member of the committee who took part in 
the proceedings in an honest and open fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can say that all witnesses from Quebec were once again 
unanimous. I did warn the committee that the people will judge 
their performance. It shows just how inflexible this federal 
system is. In fact, John Trent, a university professor and a 
federalist, told us that this was poor federalism and that, once 
again, Quebec's demands were being ignored. This is not a 
sovereignist speaking, but a federalist who testified before the 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is all very disappointing. Many students' associations 
outside Quebec came to tell us to listen to Quebec. They 
believed Quebec's demands should be listened to for once. 
I attended almost every discussion and meeting with the various 
representatives, associations and witnesses, and I can tell you 
that several witnesses noticed the government's bad faith in 
this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consensus in Quebec includes the education sector and the 
unions, but polls have also been conducted. According to one 
public opinion poll, 71% of respondents preferred an increase in 
the Canada social transfer. They felt that it had been extremely 
difficult to go through the period of restraint created by the 
cuts and that the surpluses might not be properly managed. 
Considering the $2.5 billion to be allocated to a private 
foundation which, as we know, will have a rather broad mandate, 
I do not think we can expect a great deal of transparency from 
that foundation. So I am very disappointed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the unanimous consent of the House to postpone 
consideration of the bill until we have seen the results of the 
negotiations between Quebec and Ottawa. Why not do that? 
I am asking you, Mr. Speaker, to seek the consent of the House 
to postpone the study of this bill. I think the government is 
acting in bad faith. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Could the hon. member clarify the reason why 
she is requesting the unanimous consent of the House? Is it to 
refer the bill to committee? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, we are now looking at the 
bill. I am asking that this review be postponed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one wants to negotiate, one does not rush things. I worked 
in the real estate sector for seven years. I know what 
negotiating means. One does not sign a contract until both 
parties have agreed to it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Perhaps I can clarify the situation. It is 
the government that determines the order of the items to be 
considered during Government Orders. So, we cannot change 
things, but the hon. member may want to ask the House for 
permission to adjourn the debate on this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon:</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent to adjourn the 
debate on this bill? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There is not unanimous consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not surprised by the 
answer.  We see that our colleagues across the way, who were not 
on the committee, have not heard everything that people wanted. 
Most of those who appeared before us wondered what the point was 
of trying to agree on a bill now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am therefore disappointed.  The government holds a vote on a 
motion on distinct society and what does that really mean?  We 
have always said that we will achieve absolutely nothing by 
holding a vote on the motion.  In the end, the government is 
making grand promises and telling us how very deeply they care 
about distinct or unique society, call it what you will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But this means that it is passing wall-to-wall legislation that 
does not reflect the real situation, specific to Quebec.  This 
bill shows, once again, the government's inflexibility.  It was 
a test the government could have passed, but one that it is 
going to fail. 
The people of Quebec, and students in particular, who know what 
is going on and are not stupid, know that the real reason for 
this bill is to increase the government's visibility, to the 
detriment of what happens in the education sector with student 
funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Students would have liked there to be a better form of 
management of the funding than by a private foundation.  This 
concern is shared by almost all the witnesses that appeared 
before us.  The auditor general challenged the transparency of 
this foundation that will be managing $2.5 billion.  I think 
this money should have gone back into the social transfer to the 
provinces for education, health and welfare. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK241"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to 
acknowledge my friends in the Reform Party for giving me the 
privilege to speak at this point in the discussion and my friends 
in the Liberal Party as well.  I should also refer to my friends 
in the Conservative Party who have agreed to allow me to make a 
couple of points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might have some different views than my colleagues from 
Quebec, but we have concerns about the millennium fund.  I first 
of all want to acknowledge that in terms of the government 
providing some recognition of the serious problem of student debt 
relief I think is a step in the right direction although a very 
limited step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to acknowledge that the average student debt load now 
for Canadian students is at $25,000 and is growing year after 
year. Obviously some dramatic measures must be taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to the millennium scholarship fund we have to 
acknowledge that this is going to help perhaps somewhere between 
8% and 9%  of students requiring financial assistance.  We still 
have a huge group of young people, and perhaps not so young 
people, who need financial help and this millennium scholarship 
will not be of much help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also want to acknowledge that we are concerned that students 
who are able to access this fund do so on the basis of need. We 
take the position in the New Democratic Party that if a person 
seeking post-secondary education is accepted by an institution, 
that demonstrates merit.  They have qualified for their program; 
they have qualified for entrance to a university or college or an 
institute of one kind or another.  After that it should be based 
on need to ensure that no Canadian is kept from pursuing 
post-secondary education because of a financial barrier.  That is 
one point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point is we are concerned that the scholarships be 
allocated on a reasonable basis.  By that I would suggest that if 
a population of a province is for example 12% as in British 
Columbia, then British Columbia could expect to receive 12% of 
the scholarships operating in that fund. 
It would not go to one area of the country over another area, 
which unfortunately is the tradition in so many of these federal 
government programs.  Certain people in certain areas of Canada 
receive an overwhelming benefit, often at the expense of other 
regions of Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While this fund is limited to certain kinds of institutions, 
there are other institutions and other ways of training and 
learning that should be considered.  I think for example of 
apprenticeship programs.  We are woefully lacking properly 
trained apprentices in a number of areas.  They should have 
access to this program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should also recognize certain institutions.  If they qualify 
for funding under the present Canadian loans act, students in 
those institutions or colleges or whatever they may be called 
ought to have access to the scholarship fund.  It should 
recognize that education is changing in terms of how it is being 
pursued by individuals, whether it is on a part time basis in a 
small institute, or career planning as opposed to academic 
planning. If a person is serious about self-improvement, serious 
about becoming better educated, we should use this facility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us also acknowledge that this scholarship fund reflects a 
government that does not place a high value on education.  If it 
actually placed a high value on education, it would do what some 
other nations do which in fact place a high value on education. 
For example, 16 out of the 29 OECD countries have no tuition 
fees.  It is their way of saying it is one thing they can do to 
eliminate a barrier from some people pursuing post-secondary 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fair to say that many decades ago we as a country decided 
that 12 years of education was an absolute minimum in order for 
someone to be a contributing citizen. Therefore we do not have 
tuition fees in grade 6 or 10 or 12 but we do at let us say, 
grade 13 or 14 or 15.  There probably is not a single Canadian 
that would not think that they now have to have more than 12 
years of formal education.  They probably have to have at least 
14 or 16 years to enter the workplace and become a contributing 
citizen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that tradition we should consider eliminating tuition fees as 
a barrier, like so many other countries do.  As a matter of fact, 
even the college system in Quebec does not have tuition fees, 
unlike other provinces, as a way to encourage young people to 
continue their education in that province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a number of concerns.  As the day progresses, various 
colleagues of mine will be identifying concerns they have in 
various sections of the bill and other concerns regarding the 
millennium scholarship fund. 
<P><A NAME="LINK242"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is my pleasure to address the Group No. 1 motions respecting Bill 
C-36, the budget implementation act.  In particular I want to 
speak to the three motions being brought forward by the Reform 
Party and explain why we think it is important that the House 
consider them seriously and give serious thought to accepting 
them.  We feel very strongly that they will improve greatly what 
is being proposed in the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first motion I want to speak to is Motion No. 3.  This 
amendment would ensure that an eligible institution for a 
millennium grant would be any institution that currently is 
eligible to receive a student loan from the federal government. 
In other words, what we would do with this motion is spread the 
eligibility from the current proposal which is just for students 
who attend publicly funded institutions to all institutions, 
including institutions for instance like Trinity Western 
University in British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel very strongly that publicly funded institutions do not 
have the monopoly on good education.  The federal government in 
the past has seen that these institutions, like Trinity Western, 
provide a good education which is why it allows student loans to 
be used to go to school there. 
We think it just makes sense if the government is going to be 
consistent that the millennium fund should apply to those 
sorts of institutions.

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are suggesting that the government should hear what we are 
saying.  I also believe that this was supported by witnesses who 
came before the committee.  We hope the government will hear 
what we are saying and adopt this as part of the budget 
implementation act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second motion we want to address, Motion No. 42, deals 
with the establishment of an appeal process whereby a student who 
was turned down to receive a scholarship fund would have some way 
of appealing the decision.  Governments are notorious 
for making bad decisions.  They do it all the time.  They 
get information wrong and based on that information they may make 
a faulty decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think it makes sense to have an appeal process so if somebody 
is turned down because of a bureaucratic bungle, a problem at the 
government's end, there is some way for the student to come back 
and say “these are the facts, you have it wrong, you made a 
mistake, let me have another chance to apply and have access to 
the grant”.  It is a mechanism that will ensure fairness for 
students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final motion we want to discuss and the one that is most 
important is Motion No. 67.  It is a motion to allow a provincial 
government to opt out of the millennium scholarship fund and 
enter into an agreement where the foundation pays the province 
the amount that would have been spent in a particular province. 
The province would then use the funds for its own priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a bit of history required in order to understand why 
Motion No. 67 is so important.  In the 1993 leadership debate the 
current Prime Minister was questioned by the current Leader of 
the Opposition about transfer payments for health care and higher 
education. The Leader of the Opposition asked the current Prime 
Minister if he would keep them at the current level.  The Prime 
Minister replied: “I said yesterday in reply to Mr. Bouchard 
that I promised that they will not go down and I hope that we 
will be able to increase them”.  That was a few days before the 
election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened after that is history.  I think we all know what 
happened.  There were $6 billion in cuts to the provinces for 
health care and higher education.  After the Prime Minister 
promised they would not go down and in fact might even go up they 
were cut by $6 billion.  That means the provinces have $6 billion 
less to give to their health care systems and higher education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The impact was devastating.  It meant that tuition costs had to 
go up dramatically.  We know as a result of tuition costs going 
up dramatically all of a sudden students had to bear more of the 
cost for their education.  That is why we have student debt 
levels of around $25,000 today.  But that is not in all 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec provides more money for its university system and 
education is much more heavily subsidized. Student debtloads are 
much lower, about $11,000.  We heard that over and over again 
from witnesses who came from Quebec.  They said their student 
debtloads are not nearly as high.  They said they do not need the 
millennium scholarship fund to address those things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once the federal government created the problem 
it then stepped in with the millennium scholarship fund, this 
great monument to the Prime Minister, and said “now that we have 
created this problem and the provinces are taking all the heat 
for it we are going to step in and be heroes and get all the 
credit for fixing it”.  It is like the arsonist who starts fires 
so he can come back later to put them out and get credit for 
putting out the fire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So we are saying let us not let the federal government get away 
with that.  Let us ensure there is a clause that allows the 
provinces to opt out and if they so choose to take the money that 
would come to their province through the millennium scholarship 
fund and use it to lower all tuition costs, not just for the 
select few who have access to the millennium scholarship fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think what the government did was duplicitous. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1550"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It set out in 1993 to convince Canadians it would somehow fix 
all their problems without having to make any cuts of any kind 
and then turn around immediately and slash funding to the 
provinces for health care and higher education.  Then it steps in 
with a fund that is clearly in provincial jurisdiction and wants 
to get credit for fixing the problem it created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want to let it get away with that.  We want to ensure 
the money gets back to the provinces so they can use it in a way 
they choose.  They may choose to stay in the millennium 
scholarship fund and if they do that is fine, it is up to them. 
But they know their own priorities a lot better than the federal 
government does 2,000 miles away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us give the provinces that option.  In a day and age when 
the federal government is talking about co-operative federalism 
it would take a giant step toward healing rifts if it would adopt 
Motion No. 67. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All we are asking is to give provinces the options.  The federal 
government needs to have some faith in the people of Canada.  If 
the people of Canada do not want their provinces to use this 
money for something else, they will send a strong message to 
their provincial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government should have some faith in the people. 
That is exactly what they will do.  We are encouraging the House 
to seriously consider adopting Motion No. 67.  I am very 
sensitive to the issues raised by my colleagues from Quebec that 
over and over again we had witnesses coming from Quebec saying 
they did not necessarily need this for scholarships in Quebec. 
Student debt levels in Quebec are only about $11,000 compared to 
$25,000 elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge colleagues to consider the good this motion would do in 
terms of building bridges with the provinces, in terms of uniting 
our country and strengthening the union. I urge members to 
support Motion No. 67 and the other motions Reform has brought 
forward. 
<P><A NAME="LINK243"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, this 
government's approach to budgetary decisions is a patchwork quilt 
of interventionist policy that lacks the type of consistency 
required for sound economic policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have proposed 19 amendments to Bill C-36.  I want to ensure 
we have proposed these amendments in a very constructive 
non-partisan way because we want to make significant improvements 
to this legislation which will benefit all Canadians and which 
will be a credit to this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two such amendments we have proposed would see both private and 
public institutions treated similarly by the millennium 
scholarship foundation.  For instance, we believe private 
institutions require representation at the board level and at the 
membership level of the foundation.  It is absolutely essential 
that students in private educational institutions across Canada 
have that kind of representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Private colleges and career colleges are growing across Canada 
because they represent the needs of the workplace. They are more 
sensitive to labour mobility and a lot of the facts of life of 
the late 20th century and the early 21st century in terms of the 
needs of Canadian employers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this millennium scholarship fund to not recognize the 
importance of career colleges and private educational 
institutions would be a travesty.  One of our amendments calls 
for membership at the board of directors level and at the 
membership level of the foundation for representatives from 
career colleges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another amendment we have moved would allow students studying 
provincially certified programs at private institutions access to 
the scholarships as well.  This is consistent with our belief 
that career colleges and private institutions and students 
studying at those institutions deserve to be treated with respect 
and deserve to be thought of with the understanding they are 
going to be making a significant contribution to Canada in the 
21st century.

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each province currently has standards and criteria for funding 
for programs so we do not have to reinvent the wheel.  We can 
simply rely on the provincial certification process which has 
worked extraordinarily well to date.  The federal government need 
not reinvent the wheel or start a new bureaucratic process to do 
this.  We can simply rely on the good judgment of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the legislation governing federal boards and agencies 
must provide a proper framework for accountability and 
transparency, and this framework is lacking in this bill. For 
boards and agencies functioning with taxpayer money there must be 
an accountability to this parliament and to all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transparency means that the stakeholders, ordinary Canadians and 
their representatives in parliament, have free access to 
information sufficient to enable them to judge the make-up of the 
board and the board's conduct of its business. Unfortunately the 
arm's length nature of the millennium scholarship foundation and 
the lack of transparency denies Canadians that access and denies 
Canadians the opportunity to judge whether the millennium 
scholarship foundation will meet the needs of ordinary Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two and a half billion dollars of Canadian taxpayer money is 
going to a private foundation which would not be accessible 
through the Access to Information Act, the books of which will 
not be available to the auditor general.  What the government is 
really doing is saying “here is $2.5 billion, do not worry about 
screwing up, you operate at arm's length and you are free to run 
your own show and the auditor general will not have access to 
your books anyway”. The auditor general is the Canadian 
taxpayers' watchdog in Ottawa and to deny Canadian taxpayers 
access and due diligence over the books of $2.5 billion of their 
money is a travesty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is debatable to what extent this foundation is at 
arm's length given that the government appoints a 
chairman and a third of the board.  The other two-thirds are 
appointed by members who in turn are initially appointed by the 
minister.  Most of the money will come from the federal treasury 
and yet this is considered an arm's length foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The annual report is to be tabled in parliament.  The auditor 
general questions exactly how arm's length the millennium 
foundation will be.  In chapter 9 of last month's report he 
states: “It relates to what we would call the essential nature 
or substance of these types of entities.  We will be examining 
this matter further and will report separately if significant 
findings emerge.  Questions that we will address in this study 
will include whether, in substance or in fact, such entities 
operate at arm's length from the government”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general questions the degree to which this will be 
an arm's length foundation and I think Canadians require greater 
accountability and assurances that this $2.5 billion is to be 
invested properly and will benefit all Canadians. That is why we 
call in our amendments for a greater level of transparency and a 
greater level of accountability for these funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also put forward an amendment that would require a five 
year review to be conducted by someone who is independent of the 
foundation.  The Liberals do not care if this review is done by 
someone with close ties to management who would take a cursory 
look around and write a glowing report and then collect a fat fee 
for telling management what it wants to hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians deserve better than that.  Canadians deserve to have 
true accountability. We are offering government members an 
opportunity to redeem themselves in this instance by supporting 
some of these amendments and effectively ensure that Canadians 
will have external auditors who will do unbiased evaluations of 
the millennium scholarship foundation's activities without the 
bias or prejudice of appointment by the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge members to support this amendment so that all members of 
parliament can judge for themselves the success or failure of the 
millennium scholarship fund and its value to the Canadian 
taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another amendment we have put forward would allow the board to 
indefinitely block the release of unfavourable annual reports by 
simply refusing to approve them.  Under the current legislation 
if a report comes forward that would be an unfavourable annual 
report the board can indefinitely block it from public viewing. 
That is unacceptable.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We propose that effectively any report or any annual report will 
be made available to the Canadian public after a reasonable 
period of time.  Currently these types of negative annual reports 
can be shelved indefinitely, denying Canadians the access to 
information and the accountability and transparency they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also an amendment we are proposing which would require 
that some directors know something about investments. They are 
going to be given $2.5 billion.  We do feel that they should know 
something about investments.  Perhaps they will lend the money to 
the provinces, as was done with the Canada pension plan money 
resulting in the stellar performance that we have seen in recent 
years during a time when we have seen unprecedented growth in the 
equities markets around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that there should be criteria for the board members 
that include some knowledge of the investment industry and some 
knowledge of portfolio management.  This can prevent poor returns 
in fixed income securities.  It can also prevent high risk 
situations à la Orange county derivatives or shares in the next 
Bre-X. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is increasingly apparent that the Minister of Finance does 
not have a particularly good relationship with the auditor 
general.  I would venture to say that is probably one of the 
greatest understatements made in this House this year.  The 
auditor general's accounting advice is routinely ignored by the 
Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are looking to provide the type of accountability through 
these amendments to this legislation which will provide ordinary 
Canadians with the accountability they need, independent of the 
auditor general and independent of the Minister of Finance.  We 
need to ensure that this money is accounted for properly and that 
ultimately the millennium scholarship foundation results in the 
betterment of Canadian educational opportunities and 
competitiveness in the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have time to devote my speech to some of the other 
amendments, but we will have some opportunities later today. I 
urge all members to take a look at these amendments in a 
non-partisan and constructive way.  That is the way they were 
developed and proposed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK244"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, let me start off by saying 
that the 1998 budget set up the arm's length foundation to manage 
the millennium scholarship fund.  It is intended to increase 
access to post-secondary education for deserving students from 
lower income families.  It is a priority that has support right 
across Canada.  It has been discussed at the first ministers 
meeting and in other fora.  Federal and provincial officials have 
been working together co-operatively to address the issue of 
student financing for post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The foundation has been mandated to undertake an extensive 
consultation with the various stakeholders, which would include 
the provinces, on the definition and administration of the 
scholarships.  We heard during committee the concern that 
individuals have with respect to overlap and duplication.  That 
is why the foundation has been mandated to take on those 
consultations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be very clear.  The millennium scholarship foundation 
will not be a federal program.  Scholarships will be distributed 
from a private arm's length organization which will deal directly 
with the students.  That means the foundation and the 
scholarships will not be under the control of the federal 
government, nor will the government be able to dictate to the 
foundation the parameters of these scholarships or their 
distribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The scholarship fund will provide 100,000 scholarships a year to 
students in every province and every community, up to $3,000 per 
year for full time and part time students.  It is about 
increasing access to knowledge and skills.  It is the country's 
dividend for balancing the books.  It is the recognition that 
Canadians from coast to coast, province to province deserve equal 
access to the opportunities that will secure a better future for 
them and their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have said it in committee and I will say it again here. 
Something as important as this should be taken out of the hands 
of politicians and put into the hands of experts.  That is what 
this millennium scholarship fund is doing.  The foundation will 
be administering the scholarships and over time will attract 
private sector endowments so that it can grow and help even more 
young Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the motions in Group No. 1, the member for 
Kings—Hants talked about his amendment and the idea that private 
schools should be designated by provincial law as eligible for 
the millennium scholarship fund.  Under the current legislation, 
universities, community colleges and CEGEPs will be eligible 
institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current legislation also provides the foundation with the 
flexibility it needs to determine the eligibility of privately 
funded institutions.  This flexibility gives it the means to 
designate bona fide credible private institutions as eligible 
institutions.  There is no intent in this legislation to exclude 
such institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I go on to the Reform motion that would require the foundation 
to establish an appeal process for applicants who do not receive 
scholarships.  I said it in committee and I will say it again. 
There is nothing in this legislation to prevent the foundation 
from establishing an appeals process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to understand this is an arm's length foundation.  It is 
completely within its purview, and the legislation allows for 
this flexibility, to establish an appeals process.  Establishing 
an appeals process pursuant to regulations established by the 
government would undermine the arm's length nature of the 
foundation.  We cannot have it both ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative Party proposed an amendment that calls for the 
Auditor General of Canada to be appointed as the auditor of this 
foundation.  There is really no need for this amendment because 
the auditor general could be appointed as the auditor for this 
foundation.  There is no legal obstacle to naming the auditor 
general.  It is completely within the purview of the foundation 
to choose the auditor general as its auditor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same member from the Conservative Party calls for the 
Minister of Finance to remove the auditor of the foundation from 
office.  I could not believe this amendment when I read it.  The 
hon. member's motion gives the Minister of Finance the power to 
remove the auditor chosen by the foundation. This amendment 
compromises the arm's length nature of the foundation. It gives 
the minister a direct role in the removal of the auditor.  That 
role properly belongs to the members of the foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is actually being said is on the one hand there is a call 
for transparency and accountability and on the other hand this 
amendment says if the Minister of Finance does not like the 
particular auditor, the minister can pull him.  I do not think we 
can support that amendment.  We are looking for independence, an 
arm's length relationship, accountability and transparency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 65 makes reference to the booking of this foundation. 
The auditor general came before the committee.  As I have said 
before, the accounting issue has also been discussed by the 
public accounts committee.  In its majority report the public 
accounts committee supported the government's accounting policies 
with respect to the booking of such non-recurring liabilities. It 
is certainly very clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from the Bloc spoke eloquently at the meeting. I 
believe that member is in agreement with me that there is 
disagreement within the accounting profession with respect to 
this issue.  That means professional judgment should be exercised 
in such cases, which is exactly what the government is doing and 
what it will continue to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government announces a program and commits to funding a 
program, it is incumbent upon the government to pay for that 
program.  When we came to office there were a number of unfunded 
liabilities on the books.  There were programs that had been 
announced but not funded. 
We came to office and there was a $42 billion deficit and 
decisions needed to be made.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are saying is no more. We are saying that when a 
government makes an announcement and makes a commitment to a 
particular program, the government should pay for it.  I believe 
Canadians will support that. Canadians want to know that when an 
announcement is made and a program is put in place that the money 
is there to pay for it, even if the program is going to begin 
down the road, as long as certain criteria is met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That criteria was certainly discussed at the finance committee. 
What we have here is a disagreement within in the accounting 
profession.  Professional judgment will be exercised as it has 
been in the past and as it will be in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other point brought forward by the hon. member from the 
Conservative Party was about access to information.  Again the 
foundation is an arm's length entity and it is independent of the 
federal government.  Let us talk about what it is required to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sections 36 and 39 of the bill talk about what the foundation is 
required to do with the annual report.  It needs to outline its 
investment activities.  It needs to include the auditor's report. 
It needs to include the portfolio on the policies, the statement 
of outlook, and the results achieved with respect to the 
foundation's scholarships which are placed.  Finally it is also 
required to hold a public meeting every year.  It is required to 
provide ample advance notice of the public meeting so the public 
can attend, scrutinize, ask questions and discuss what the 
foundation has done over the past year.  So it is not about 
access to information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should also say that the annual report which is then tabled in 
the House of Commons is certainly open to the auditor general to 
review and comment on it, as is any other document that gets 
tabled in the House.  It is completely within the purview of the 
auditor general.  There is transparency and there is 
accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close by saying that this is not a government program. It 
is an arm's length foundation.  The opting out option is not 
there because it is not a government program, it is an arm's 
length foundation. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK245"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak today to this important bill and to the group 
of motions we have presented, whose aim essentially is to 
eliminate everything to do with the millennium scholarships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we presenting this group of motions?  For one good 
reason: with the millennium scholarships the government is not 
minding its own business.  In the course of three weeks of 
hearings before the Standing Committee on Finance, 14 
organizations from Quebec all said the same thing, which was 
that the federal government has no business meddling in an area 
of exclusive jurisdiction. 
According to the Constitution these people claim to be 
defending, the federal government cannot interfere, and the 
organizations are calling for the right to withdraw with full 
compensation for Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Witnesses appeared on behalf of such important organizations as 
the FTQ, the CSN and university and college student 
associations.  An association of former student movement 
leaders, who oversaw the changes in the education sector in the 
past 11 years, had seven messages for the committee, and 
especially the federal government.  The first was that, with 
these scholarships, the federal government is showing its 
ignorance of the situation in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to quote from the brief of the FTQ, which said, about 
the proposal as it was formulated in Bill C-36, that “this 
proposal illustrates the Canadian government's lack of knowledge 
about Quebec's system of loans and grants and its priorities in 
education”.  The president of the Fédération des cégeps said 
essentially the same thing.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The association of former student leaders of Quebec said “With 
its millennium scholarships, the federal government is showing 
its ignorance and its incompetence in the field of education”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think they were paying much attention on the other side 
of the House because, despite three intensive weeks and the 
unanimity of the witnesses from Quebec, the members of the 
Liberal majority on the finance committee did not move a single 
amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have the nerve to claim to be in touch with people's needs, 
when 14 organizations representing at least 1.2 million adult 
Quebeckers with some degree of connection to education or 
business have told them to mind their own business.  But they 
did not get it.  They are thumbing their noses at people and at 
the democratic system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Normally, if people had been listened to properly, and if the 
business of holding public hearings in the committees had had 
any value in the eyes of the parliamentarians, who claim they 
are democratic right down to the roots of their hair, they would 
have backed off after hearing the representations from Quebec. I 
fault the chair of the finance committee for not allowing any 
mention of Quebec's unanimous opposition to the millennium 
scholarships in the report he tabled last Friday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second criticism voiced by all stakeholders is that the 
federal government came up with this project solely to gain some 
more visibility. Minister of Human Resources Development made no 
bones about this either.  With his usual candour, he indicated 
that this indeed was the reason.  The Prime Minister went still 
further, as has been his wont since the start of his career in 
politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This project creates duplication and doubles costs for all 
taxpayers.  At the present time, the loans and bursaries system 
that Quebec has developed since the Ministry of Education was 
created in 1964 is without equal, and works impeccably well.  We 
are not the only ones to say so.  It is cited as an example 
across Canada. We have all of the structures, all of the staff, 
and all of the expertise accorded to us by the Constitution, the 
British North America Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Adding on a foundation to administer scholarships just creates 
duplication and greatly increases costs. The administrative costs 
of the millennium fund are double what we have in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the average, Quebec's administration of bursaries and loans 
takes about 2.5% of the amounts involved, while the figure for 
the millennium scholarships will be twice that, at 5%.  Yet they 
talk of efficiency. Efficiency, my foot! 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third criticism from Quebec stakeholders at our hearings was 
that, far from reducing inequalities, the millennium 
scholarships run the risk of increasing inequalities in the 
field of education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth criticism is that the millennium scholarships are not 
a solution to student indebtedness. 
Ever since 1995, since the Minister of Finance started slashing 
federal transfers for higher education, we have been saying that 
the answer to the student loans problem is for the government to 
stop slashing and start giving back what it has taken from the 
pockets of the provinces and was actually used before to finance 
the education programs. That would be a positive measure to 
reduce student loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fifth criticism put forward by people from Quebec is there 
is no need for this in Quebec. That does not mean that we do not 
need money, but we do not need a wall to wall policy. That could 
work outside Quebec. Some Canadian stakeholders stated that they 
were interested in the millennium scholarships, because they are 
not organized as Quebec has been since 1964, when it set up its 
student loans and grants program. However, the proposed 
scholarship fund does not meet the needs of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What Quebec needs right now is for the Minister of Finance to 
stop playing petty politics with the surplus he hides year after 
year, by juggling the figures, and to start giving back what he 
has grabbed from Quebec. We would then be in a position to help 
students out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sixth criticism is a major one. We have grown accustomed, 
ever since his appointment,  to seeing the Minister of Finance 
juggling the figures. He literally juggles all the figures he 
brings forward. It has come to a point where we no longer 
believe the government's financial statements or the estimates 
the minister tables. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the millennium scholarship program, he has been criticized 
three times by the auditor general, who is the watchdog of 
public finances and is accountable to Parliament. The auditor 
general is impartial; he is accountable to Parliament.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the auditor general have to say? He said that, by 
charging to the 1997-98 budget these $2.5 billion that he plans 
to start spending only in the year 2000, the finance minister is 
fixing the books. They no longer mean anything. Amounts that 
have yet to be spent cannot be included in the financial 
statements. Where will that kind of government accounting lead 
us? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few moments ago, I heard the secretary of state say that 
people appreciate this new accounting method whereby all 
commitments are included in the books as soon as they are made, 
even though the money will be spent only three years later, 
because it makes people aware of planned spending. This is not 
true. 
It is absolutely false. People want to know what the real 
figures are. They want to know where they are going. They want 
to know that the money they are paying in taxes will be spent in 
the current fiscal year. They do not want to know that 
expenditures that will be made only in the year 2000 were 
charged in full to last year's budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These $2.5 billion should not have been included in the books 
for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1998. The auditor general 
and chartered accountants are almost unanimous on this issue, 
except for those hired by the government, of course, who may be 
suspected of being less impartial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not the first time the finance minister pulls such a 
stunt. It is the third time. He did it when he concluded a deal 
with three maritime provinces to harmonize the GST with their 
provincial sales tax. 
A compensation package totalling about $1 billion—which is 
still being criticized because it means the government bought 
those three maritime provinces to get what it wanted—was 
included in the books before the agreement between these 
provinces and the federal government was even signed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second time was when the innovation fund was created. Again, 
the minister charged the full amount to the current year's 
budget even though he started spending the money only one year 
and a half later. Therefore, like all the stakeholders in 
Quebec, we condemn this practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During this debate, we will have the opportunity to address 
other aspects of the millennium scholarship fund that are very 
important to Quebeckers. 
I will talk about an important federal-provincial conference that 
took place on March 31, 1964, in Quebec City. It was a turning 
point in the debate on education between the federal government 
and the Quebec government. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK246"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords—Lloydminster, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, on behalf of my constituents of 
Battlefords—Lloydminster I am pleased to speak today to Group 
No. 1 amendments to Bill C-36, the budget implementation act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like the budget itself, the act is full of items that may have 
good intentions but are badly thought out or whose purpose seems 
to be to fool Canadians into thinking the government is managing 
taxpayers' money properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of the Standing Committee on Finance, the most 
glaring example I can see of good intentions gone bad and turning 
into a political boondoggle is the Prime Minister's millennium 
scholarship fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the thinking in the Liberal cabinet was:  Who could 
possibly disagree with putting more money in the hands of 
deserving students?  In principle, no one really disagrees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, most of the presenters to the finance committee in the 
past weeks all had problems with sections of this fund, including 
the student groups themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party certainly supports the concept of encouraging 
these young Canadians to pursue higher education but, in the time 
honoured tradition of its predecessors, this Liberal government 
has managed to separate the taxpayer from his money only to offer 
it back to him as if it were a favour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After cutting $6 billion from the amount the provinces were 
expecting to help pay for further education, this finance 
minister had an embarrassing problem.  He had taxed Canadians to 
the limit and built up a budgetary surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why he could not bring himself to leave these excess tax dollars 
in the hands of the people who earned them we will never 
understand.  In any case, he ended up with $2.5 billion to 
dispose of, to hide from his fellow colleagues as it were. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister decided to charge his credit card this year 
and start paying for it two years down the road.  The benefit of 
providing only 7% of Canada's students with $3,000 a year will 
not even kick in until the year 2000, but the taxpayer gets to 
foot this bill right away.  The auditor general says nobody else 
could get away with this creative accounting and we certainly 
agree with that statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our colleagues in the Bloc have been pressing to allow Quebec to 
opt out altogether and to decide how to dispense its share of the 
millennium scholarship fund. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1625"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly agree in principle since the provinces are 
responsible for education and this bill states nothing about how 
to approach the various types of schools that each province has 
set up to provide a range of education opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in committee we were told that there is no provincial 
share because this is not a federal program in the legal sense of 
the word.  This is a new breed of animal that commits taxpayers' 
money to a private foundation.  This government sets up an entity 
with public money but says it does not need the auditor general 
to look after it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The board will name its own auditor, state its own salaries, 
hand out taxpayers' dollars on merit—whatever that might be—or 
need, or both, ignoring the fact that provinces and the federal 
government and, for that matter, private industry already have 
bursaries, loans, grants and award programs in place to help 
students who demonstrate that merit and need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we going to reward the poorest of the best or the best of 
the poorest?  That is one of the comments we heard at the finance 
committee the other day.  I think it is certainly true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No wonder this government does not want the millennium 
scholarship foundation to be subject to the Access to Information 
Act.  It is clearly a political ploy to convince Canadians that 
the Liberals care about education when what they really care 
about is filtering tax money through their offices to get credit 
at election time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To sum up, the Reform Party wants this government to return to 
recognized accounting procedures that only book funding in the 
year that the project actually takes place.  We propose the that 
Auditor General of Canada be named in the act that creates this 
scholarship fund, that this fund be subject to the Access to 
Information Act and that an appeal process be specified to deal 
with applications that are turned down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, we propose that each province and territory be allowed 
to access scholarship funds based on the system in place and the 
needs as determined by the governments based on student 
populations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to assist the next generation in developing the skills 
and education they need to build a better Canada we should look 
first at how we can leave the maximum resources in their hands 
and then how we can provide them with the most flexible and cost 
effective ways to support their efforts. 
<P><A NAME="LINK247"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I want to make a brief intervention on the bill before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of the finance committee I had an opportunity to 
listen to the witnesses who came before us.  It is clear that the 
millennium scholarship fund was one of the most talked about 
aspects of the budget implementation bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member asked:  Are we rewarding the best of the poorest or 
the poorest of the best?  The member well knows that the issue of 
merit was well explained by the authors of the millennium 
scholarship fund and that acceptance at an institution would 
constitute merit.  Clearly, for any program to be successful, 
obviously the candidates who are eligible should be those who 
demonstrate an aptitude to be able to complete a program because 
that is the most important part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of accessibility was more important for many members 
simply because we all know that there are many students out there 
who have demonstrated aptitude in secondary education but, given 
their circumstances, are unable or unwilling to take the economic 
plunges needed to pursue post-secondary education.  All members 
know that is almost a prerequisite to having a good job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member's cynicism with regard to a political ploy is 
certainly a very weak argument against the federal government 
being involved in the education of Canadian youth.  There is no 
question that there is an appetite to have more students attend 
post-secondary education in order to pursue the necessary skills 
and training they are going to need to participate fully in the 
economy of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the funding and the accounting, this issue has 
been dealt with very thoroughly.  Indeed, the public accounts 
committee congratulated and supported the government in terms of 
its accounting for the millennium scholarship fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the committee met and discussed briefly the mechanics of 
the accounting, it was pointed out that if the millennium 
scholarship fund had been designated to be operated through the 
foundation for innovation that would have eliminated the need for 
the auditor general to comment. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1630"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, before the committee, the auditor general did admit 
that if the millennium scholarship fund, as proposed, were put 
under the umbrella of the foundation for innovation he would not 
have made comment with regard to the $2.5 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to table those remarks.  It is clear that some 
members do not agree with the millennium scholarship fund, but it 
appears also that their reasons are more politically motivated 
than they are in terms of showing interest in the future of our 
young Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>]

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to speak to Bill C-36 at 
report stage.  This bill makes it possible to implement certain 
provisions of the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our first group of amendments indicates our strong opposition to 
this government bulldozing over Quebec's jurisdiction in the 
education sector, and not deciding, in the present situation, to 
complete negotiations.  The Prime Minister of Canada and the 
premier of Quebec have given themselves two months to come up 
with a solution that will respect Quebec's jurisdiction and 
Ottawa's need for visibility. 
This is the only reason Ottawa has intervened: to ensure its 
visibility on the cheques it may send students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not respecting the negotiating process either means the Liberal 
majority is ignoring the Prime Minister, or the Prime Minister's 
promises are worthless. Members of the Quebec education 
coalition, who support Quebec's position, were present at a 
meeting of the premier of Quebec and the Prime Minister of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to know who these people are.  They are not just 
sovereignists.  They represent the entire education movement in 
Quebec. 
We are talking about the following groups:  the Alliance des 
manufacturiers exportateurs du Québec, the Centrale de 
l'enseignement du Québec, the Fédération des travailleurs du 
Québec, the Fédération étudiante collégiale du Québec, the CSN, 
the Fédération des associations d'étudiants universitaires 
québécois en éducation permanente, the Fédération des cégeps, 
the Coalition d'ex-leaders et étudiants québécois, the Fédération 
québécoise des professeurs et professeures du Québec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these people, 41% of the witnesses heard, came to say the 
same thing.  The Liberal majority was unable to find a single 
witness from Quebec to say that the millennium scholarships made 
any sense.  Why does Quebec feel this way? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1964, there were two men who had a conception of Canada that 
was completely different from that of the Prime minister today, Mr. 
Pearson and Mr. Lesage. I remember because I was quite young at 
the time but my father was a Liberal supporter and he knew that 
they were trying to come to an agreement. In the 1964 agreement, 
it had been decided to recognize Quebec as a distinct society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Quebec and Canada were told “There is indeed a 
Canada Student Loans Act, but one province wishing to develop a 
different model will be allowed to do so”. That is what distinct 
society is about. This philosophy worked for 34 years and led to 
the best student assistance system in Canada. Many witnesses 
agreed on this, not only those from Quebec who were defending 
their system or Quebec students who came to speak out in favour 
of their system, but also witnesses from the other provinces of 
Canada. 
It was very clear what was on the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government had to choose between two alternatives. 
To put in place a student loans and bursaries program like the 
one available elsewhere in the country, all it had to do was to 
amend the Canada Student Loans Act. This way, the rest of Canada 
could have benefited from a loans and bursaries system similar 
to the one in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the federal government not take that route? Because this 
meant automatically allowing Quebec to use its right to opt out 
with full compensation. This right is already provided for in 
the legislation. Since 1964, Quebec has been using this right to 
opt out with full compensation and has apparently been doing so 
properly. The system it has developed could be a model for all 
Canadian stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, the average debt load of university graduates is 
$11,000. 
In Canada, it is anywhere from $18,000 to $25,000. Obviously, 
Canadian students are curious about what makes the Quebec system 
so successful. The main reason is the fact that there is a 
bursaries program within the Quebec system.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government decided, in order to create a scholarship 
program, to use a rather extraordinary legal scheme called the 
millennium fund. The government claims that it must absolutely 
promote students' performance to achieve great results. But the 
real reason is that it did not want Quebec to be able to opt out 
with full compensation. The federal government wanted to make 
sure Quebec would be forced to ask the foundation for the 
authority to grant scholarships, according to specific criteria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This House must realize that if there is one thing on Quebec 
will never compromise, it is its jurisdiction over education. 
This government's claim that providing financial assistance to 
students has nothing to do with education is hogwash. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any Quebec student or member of the Quebec coalition against the 
millennium fund knows full well that financial assistance to 
students is part of the balance, part of the whole system in the 
education sector. It is what determines accessibility to 
education. It is thanks to the financial assistance provided to 
students that there are now as many young women as there are 
young men in Quebec's universities. This financial assistance 
has helped children from low income families complete their 
education. The program was established in 1964, because we had 
an old and obsolete system which, while quite successful in 
producing a high quality elite, did not allow others to succeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the Quiet Revolution—and this was an initiative taken by 
a Liberal government—we wanted to make sure we would have an 
education system that would be accessible. We are proud of the 
model that we developed in Quebec, even though it is not 
perfect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give you an example of what this system allows us to do. 
We have a project to recognize students' good performance. One 
of the ways to achieve this in Quebec is to forgive part of a 
student's debt if that student completes his or her education 
within the normal timeframe. This means six semesters for a BA. 
If a student completes his or her BA in six semesters, he 
or she can get a 15% reduction of his or her debt. This is a 
nice way to acknowledge the efforts of someone who works hard to 
complete his or her education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along with that program, we will now have the millennium fund. 
Under that fund, students will get scholarships based on merit, 
but not necessarily their financial needs. 
Students will be facing the following situation: elsewhere in 
Canada, in the nine English-speaking provinces, some students 
will be granted millennium scholarships. Good for them, but 
several others will have to do without. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in Quebec, when a student will be granted a millennium 
scholarship, if the legislation is not changed, Quebec will have 
to withdraw any financial assistance it was providing that 
student, because it will have to take into account this 
additional income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the student at the receiving end, it does not change a 
thing. It only creates a whole new bureaucracy. The members 
opposite do not seem to know how education works. To apply for a 
loan or a grant, one needs to fill out some forms. 
The cegep and university staff who help the students to fill out 
the forms and to meet the requirements to get the most out of 
the system will now have to learn how the two systems work, to 
become familiar with the two different forms, because the 
requirements will not all be the same. This total and absolute 
duplication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, we have to deal with a government that is turning a 
deaf ear. It did it in committee, tit gagged us and decided it 
would do the same thing at report stage. One thing is clear, in 
the end, the people in Quebec will realize by themselves that 
the federal government is turning a deaf ear to all Quebec 
stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the members from the province of Quebec, whether they are 
from Brome—Missisquoi, from Anjou—Rivières-des-Prairies, from 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine, from Bourassa, from Beauce or from 
Saint-Maurice, to reconsider their position. 
How can they be silent in the House, not say a word, not rise in 
their place to say that Quebeckers are right about this, that 
they must be given a chance to continue running their system, 
which is  a good one? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And to top it all, last week, three of Quebec's major management 
associations, the Conseil du patronat, the Chambre de commerce 
du Québec, and the Association des manufacturiers et des 
exportateurs du Québec came to testify before the committee. 
These are not exactly people who are identified with the 
sovereignist movement in Quebec.

the government will assume its responsibilities, as will the 
opposition, but there will not be a pretence of democracy such 
as that being forced on us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the Bloc Quebecois has introduced motions to delete 
from this bill any references to the foundation.  Quebec will 
never agree to the federal government poking its nose into one 
of the systems we have developed, the best in the world.  We 
will never stand for it. 
The government will make sure it passes by invoking closure at 
every stage, because otherwise this bill will never get through.

feeling poor.  I can tell the House why Canadians are feeling 
poor.  It is because their government has become richer at their 
expense.  Why?  It is because of high taxation, not because the 
government reduced expenditures.  It has been on the backs of 
Canadians, raising taxes as well as cutting funding to the 
provinces.  Funding to the provinces for education has been cut 
by $6 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has created a debtload on students.  We all know that 
students' debtload has skyrocketed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two daughters who are in university.  One has just 
completed university and she has a debtload of $15,000.  The 
other has a debtload of almost at $8,000 and she is midway 
through her university degree.  They are both very worried about 
how they will pay this debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about what the government is trying to do.  It has 
come up with what it calls a millennium fund.  The irony of this 
situation is that Brian Mulroney, a former prime minister, came 
up with the Meech Lake and Charlottetown accords so he could go 
into the history books as doing something.  Now we have this 
Prime Minister who also wants to go into the history books by 
bringing in the millennium fund which is not well thought out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who will benefit from this millennium fund?  We are told that 
the fund is targeted toward students.  About 7% of students will 
receive about $3,000.  It is based upon merit.  Granted, there 
has been talk about need, but the majority of scholarships will 
be given on merit.  We heard a member opposite talk about how the 
merit system will work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to bring in another point of view.  My riding, like 
many ridings in Canada, is made up of hard working Canadians, 
Canadians who, due to the high taxation of this government, are 
struggling to put food on the table.  They do not have the money 
to send their children to university.  Most of their time is 
spent trying to put food on the table.  Therefore, they have less 
time to spend looking after their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding, particularly, there are hard working, working 
class people.  When I visited a high school in my riding the 
principal told me that only 10% of the students will go on to 
higher education. 
What is the solution to that?

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked to them and explained that they do not have to go to 
university for higher education.  They do not have to go to 
college to get ahead in life.  They should look at another 
option, trade schools.  They can become electricians.  They can 
become drywallers.  They can become carpenters.  These are the 
options the majority of the students in my riding face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the millennium fund going, their tax dollars?  It is 
not going to address these concerns.  That is why I call the 
millennium fund an elitist fund.  Time after time after time many 
members have talked about how it will help students in 
university.  That is fine, but what about the other students? 
What about thousands of Canadians who will try to choose a trade 
career and be denied access to the fund? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore the amendments the Reform Party have put forward are 
worth looking at to address many of the issues I have raised. 
First and foremost, Motion No. 3 asks that we take a look at 
public and private post-secondary education institutions in 
Canada that are designated for Canada student loan purposes. This 
will open it up to many students in high school who are unable to 
go university but choose a trade as their career. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I emphasize that we must look at the students who choose careers 
that are different.  We must also help them.  We do not want a 
shortage of skilled workers in the trades area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 42 is extremely important.  Whenever taxpayers' money 
is put into something, be it a private foundation or a government 
institution, there has to be a mechanism where people can appeal 
a decision that at times may not be favourable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the bureaucracy in these foundations has a tendency 
to follow strict rules.  There has to be a place where people can 
go to someone and say that a wrong decision was made. They have 
that right because they are taxpayers.  Their parents have paid 
money into the fund.  That money has not been raised by private 
sources.  It is public money so the right to appeal should be 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk about the provinces.  Education is a provincial 
jurisdiction.  Provinces are the ones most closely associated 
with the economy of their regions.  They know what is required in 
the regions.  It is not the federal government sitting 2,000 
miles away.  Therefore it is important that we look at the motion 
which allows the provinces to opt out and use the money in the 
way that will address their own needs.  It is very important that 
they be given flexibility.  It is public money.  There is no need 
for the federal government to have tight control over it although 
it talks about the private foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask my colleagues across the floor to look at the motions that 
are trying to create a better disbursement of the fund and make 
it accessible to all Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure today to speak Bill C-36, the Budget 
Implementation Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not go over the litany of problems we have historically 
had in our country.  I will not go over the 30 years of 
mismanagement of our finances by previous Liberal and 
Conservative governments.  My colleagues have outlined that 
specifically and very eloquently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to constructive solutions that the government 
could have employed but has not.  It can employ them in the 
future if we are to create a stronger more stable country, a 
stronger more vibrant economy, and save our social programs, that 
social net which protects many underprivileged people in our 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is instructive for us to look at real world experiences.  We 
should look at other countries, other provinces and other states 
that have employed very specific solutions to problems that have 
affected them and are affecting us.  Let us look at our own 
country, at Ontario and Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I lived in Ontario for 18 years.  It was very sad to see the 
economic devastation that took place with respect to the huge 
debt load the NDP government foisted upon the people of Ontario 
at that time, the high tax rates that crushed the life out of the 
economy, and the egregious rules and regulations that prevented 
the Ontario economy from being the lion it could be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current government took the bull by the horns.  It 
substantially cut taxes.  It streamlined and eliminated 
government spending, not by doing fancy accounting or changing 
accounting practices but by cutting the fat off the government 
beef.  It also eliminated rules and regulations that tended to 
constrict and restrict the private sector.  What has happened? 
Ontario is engaging in a boom.  Ontario has had more money coming 
into its coffers.  This is very interesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who slandered the Ontario government for engaging in its 
policy of fiscal conservatism, tax cuts and diminished government 
spending said that it would gut social programs.  What has 
happened to health care?  In spite of a $2.7 billion cut in 
health care transfer payments to Ontario, the Ontario government 
has had an extra $1 billion to spend on health care.  That is 
very instructive because it dispels the myth that some would put 
forth that if taxes are cut social programs are gutted.  That is 
not true at all.  If taxes are decreased what happens?  It causes 
investment to go into the province.  It causes a revamping and a 
resurgence of the private sector.  By doing so the amount of 
money in the public coffers is actually increased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Mulroney did it in 1992.  He lowered taxes.  What happened? 
More money went into the public purse.  As a result he could have 
spent more money on public social programs but instead he 
increased taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been pushing forward a very constructive plan.  We have 
given it to the government.  To some extent the government has 
pursued it and should be congratulated for balancing the budget. 
We have been telling the government to do this for many years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also instructive to look at Saskatchewan.  An NDP 
government in Saskatchewan woke up and said that it should look 
at what works, at the reality of the late 20th century economies 
of the world and becoming competitive.  The NDP government took a 
very balanced approach.  It listened to the Reform Party and said 
that it would cut taxes and balance the budget. 
It wanted to give people more money in their pockets, to have a 
balanced budget, to cut taxes and to spend intelligently doing 
what governments do best.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That government invested in infrastructure, invested in 
education and put money where governments should put money to 
give people the tools to take care of themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Historically there has been a rule among Liberal thinkers that 
government can take care of us better than we can take care of 
ourselves.  We obviously do not adhere to that rule.  We believe 
the government's role is to give people the tools, the power and 
the ability to take care of themselves.  Governments should also 
take care of those people who cannot take care of themselves. 
Those two can actually work together.  Those two are actually two 
halves of the same whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are fiscally irresponsible we are socially irresponsible. 
By being fiscally irresponsible and spending more than we take 
in, we compromise the social programs we profess to help by 
spending more on those programs than we take in.  By elevating 
debt and interest payments we diminish the amount of money 
available to spend on those programs.  We do not compromise the 
rich because they can go wherever they want.  We compromise the 
poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleagues in the Reform Party have mentioned, the 
government is saying that it will take care of people instead of 
people taking care of themselves.  That is why the government has 
increased CPP payments made by individuals by a whopping 75% for 
every working man and woman in the country.  What does that do? 
It takes money out of people's pockets and prevents people from 
taking care of themselves.  It does not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at New Zealand we see very clearly that approach does 
not work.  In every country that has tried to do this it has 
resulted in abysmal failure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Great Britain and Chile have taken a long pragmatic look at 
their pension plans and social programs and have put them on firm 
financial ground.  They have managed to privatize them while 
still ensuring that all individuals will be taken care of.  No 
one will go without.  Those most socially deprived in those 
countries will be taken care of.  If they did not do that those 
in the lowest socio-economic areas would be compromised the most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not try to devise grandiose new plans for the problems 
that affect us.  The problems that affect us in Canada affect 
other developed nations all over the world.  If we were to take 
those solutions and employ them in Canada we would see a national 
growth rate that could rival the provincial growth rates we have 
seen in Ontario and Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If one wants to look at the other side of the coin one need only 
look at my province of British Columbia to see what high tax 
rates, high debt loads, egregious rules and regulations and 
labour laws that constrict and restrict the private sector do to 
an economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>British Columbia, arguably the richest province within the 
country, has an enormous amount of natural resources and a well 
trained and educated workforce.  It is actually 10th in the 
nation in terms of development.  Who would have thought that 
British Columbia would be 10th, the bottom of the barrel, in 
economic growth for two years running? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reasons for it are very simple.  I implore the government to 
take a look at what we have been trying to convince it to do for 
years.  The member for Medicine Hat, our finance critic, has been 
very eloquent in suggesting this to the finance minister.  Why 
not adopt most of these solutions when they have been proven to 
work all over the world? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can take a look at the United States, for example the state 
of New Jersey which has employed constructive solutions to its 
problems.  It has right to work legislation.  It has used tax 
havens.  It has decreased taxes and eliminated egregious rules 
and regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened to the individual worker there?  What happened to 
the person who works day in and day out slogging on the streets? 
Their incomes were increased by over $2,200 per person.  This 
meant more money in their pockets and better health and welfare 
for every individual in those communities.

debt load.  And for heaven's sake remove the egregious rules and 
regulations that constrict the private sector.  In doing so we 
would provide for better socioeconomic circumstances for all and 
we would save our social programs.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne—Blainville, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, my 
colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois who spoke before me had an 
opportunity to express all of their objections to the millennium 
fund and, since the subject provided lots of fodder, they had 
lots to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be objective, all of this should be weighed and some 
acknowledgement made of the fund's positive aspects.  The 
millennium fund to its credit advances the cause of sovereignty. 
It will bring home the truth to Quebeckers that the federal 
system, regardless of the party in power, will never change, 
that it is incorrigible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We sovereignists know that many Quebeckers are not sovereignist 
because they still hope that the federal system will change. 
Now, the pretentious millennium fund, which is infringing 
provincial rights, has revealed the true colours of the federal 
government, and we hope that many Quebeckers, who up to now have 
not understood, will now understand that federalism, regardless 
of the party in power, will not change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such disdain for the people of Quebec to have thought that they 
would swallow it holus-bolus because it meant money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, you are as familiar with the Bible as I am.  You 
know that Esau gave up his birthright for a dish of lentils 
because he was hungry.  We will not do the same for the dish of 
lentils the millennium fund represents. 
We in Quebec have not stopped advocating and claiming provincial 
rights because the federal government is infringing them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was wrong to think that we would give up our rights for a 
dish of lentils.  I understand that it is a rude awakening for 
the Liberals to discover that their proposal did not slip 
through and that Quebeckers are protesting and indignant at this 
unfair fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The neat thing in all this is that it is not just the 
sovereignists who are complaining.  All the various communities 
in Quebec are protesting this fund.  I have a few examples. 
First those from the educational community, obviously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CEQ stated that the millennium fund was not the way to 
provide young Quebeckers with improved access to a university 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give another example among many. The Fédération des 
étudiants des collèges du Québec said that student debt was a 
big problem, but that the millennium fund was not the answer. We 
should not forget that this fund was supposed to lure young 
Quebeckers, most of whom are sovereignists. Obviously, it did 
not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on and on. We also have the general manager of the 
Canadian Institute of Adult Education. 
Here is what he had to say: “The federal government's budget and 
tax decision over the last few years have contributed to the 
erosion of the standard of living of students and of the 
provincial public education systems. The package contained in 
the last budget may well go against what provincial governments 
have been trying to do”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could give so many examples, but the one that takes the cake 
comes from a federalist, John Trent, from the University of 
Ottawa. He told us: “The millennium fund will necessarily be a 
source of federal-provincial duplication and overlap with 
existing programs. Bill C-36 which provides for the millennium 
fund is a direct attack against the principles of federalism.” 
That is a federalist talking. The millennium fund is an abuse of 
the very principles of federalism. It shows contempt for the 
parliamentary resolution, proposed by the Prime Minister, to 
recognize the distinct nature of Quebec society. One of the 
advantages of the millennium fund is that it has shown people 
that this distinct society resolution is pure window dressing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The educational sector is not the only one putting up a fuss, so 
is the business sector.  This is worth noting.  The Finance 
Canada experts have estimated that the administrative costs for 
the foundation will be around the 5% mark, or twice what they 
are in Quebec.  The comment by the Alliance des manufacturiers 
et exportateurs du Québec was “Duplication must be avoided, and 
the millennium fund is definitely one example of this.  Existing 
provincial structures must be taken advantage of.” That is the 
reaction of the business sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the Canadian taxpayer, the comment by Walter Robinson of 
the Canadian Taxpayers Foundation was that this showed “contempt 
for accounting standards”. It is unbelievable.  Need I go on? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The arrogance of Ottawa's desire to trample over the rights of 
the provinces is nothing new, but until now Quebec had managed 
to block it as far as student loans were concerned.  Earlier on, 
one of my colleagues recalled that, back in 1964, the Pearson 
government proposed student loans for which it would cover the 
interest. 
In response, Mr. Lesage, who was not a sovereignist, said that 
Quebec would have to go to court in order to have its 
constitutional rights respected in this matter. Mr. Pearson then 
had to acknowledge that, if a province preferred to have its own 
loan program, it would be entitled to an equivalent amount in 
compensation.  It seems to me that the federal federalists were 
brighter than they are now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This time, the scandal is even greater, because it comes in the 
wake of cuts to education which have forced the provincial 
government to slash budgets, particularly those allocated to 
universities and colleges, which have done them real harm.  The 
Liberals have, therefore, cut provincial education budgets, to 
then use the money merely to increase their political visibility 
through the millennium fund, which does not meet any real need 
in Quebec. 
This is outrageous. The Liberal motto is “Make political hay 
while pretending to serve the public”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This arrogant government, with its contempt for provincial 
jurisdictions, thought it could once again pass off as a service 
something that was totally focussed on gaining political 
popularity.  It did not work and, as I have said, it will help 
show Quebeckers that the federalist cause is no longer 
sustainable.  The arrogant, authoritarian, overbearing federal 
regime, which is also disrespectful of provincial areas of 
jurisdiction regardless of which party is in power, is simply 
hopeless.  Thanks to the millennium fund, more Quebeckers than 
ever now understand that there is but one solution for Quebec, 
and that is sovereignty.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues have dealt thoroughly with this legislation in 
committee.  I would like to address only the Group No. 1 
amendments concerning the millennium fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As this House is aware, the passing of this act would bring into 
effect the much talked about Canada millennium scholarship 
foundation.  This fund concerns me for a number of reasons, the 
first of which has nothing to do with the world of budgets and 
finance at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Education is an area of provincial jurisdiction.  Any further 
meddling by the federal government only helps to enhance the 
frustration felt by our provincial partners about the Canadian 
federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This point is important because the millennium fund will be more 
than just another ineffective and wasteful Liberal policy.  It 
will be a constant reminder to our friends in Quebec, Alberta and 
elsewhere that this government refuses to recognize 
constitutional division of powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall very well the Bloc supply day motion which opposed the 
millennium fund because it violates provincial jurisdiction. 
There were aspects of the motion that were admittedly 
objectionable to the Reform caucus, but I share the sentiment 
felt by my colleagues in the Bloc that the federal government has 
once again overextended its reach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also suggest that the members of the Bloc, like the 
members of the Reform caucus, are no less concerned about the 
quality of education than the Prime Minister.  They simply 
appreciate that the federal government should respect provincial 
jurisdiction.  They also understand that the provincial 
governments are better able to administer programs than is a 
distant and out of touch federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The premiers of this country are united in their support for a 
rebalancing of powers that better reflects the original 
constitution.  Yet the federal government refuses to respect this 
consensus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would recommend that if the government is interested in 
solving the national unity problem, it should look at the new 
Canada act put together by the Reform caucus.  This act embodies 
many of the concerns felt by our premiers and is a blueprint for 
positive change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mention this to illustrate a point.  There are consequences of 
bad policies which are not readily apparent but that must be 
addressed fully.  We cannot continue to ignore the delicate 
political reality in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The millennium fund must be opposed because of the potential 
damage it will do to intergovernmental relations.  The Prime 
Minister is not concerned about national unity or constitutional 
matters.  He is concerned about his political legacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The millennium fund will provide the Prime Minister with a 
legacy, but not for being a champion for higher education.  Our 
Prime Minister will instead join the long list of status quo 
federalist politicians who refuse to listen to our first 
ministers who are calling on this government to get out of areas 
of provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second concern with the millennium fund is one that has been 
addressed many times.  It is a concern I alluded to only minutes 
ago.  This fund, simply put, will not be effective in improving 
the financial situation for Canadian students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even after billions are spent, 90% of Canadian students will 
never see a penny of this money.  They will face the same 
financial constraints they always have.  If the federal 
government was concerned about education, it need only to 
reinvest money in provincial transfers for education.  Maybe it 
could look at such things as an income contingent student loan 
plan which would ensure adequate funding for students.  Or maybe 
the Prime Minister could work toward building a partnership 
between educators and industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is that the possibilities for helping Canadian students 
are endless.  We must look for creative ways to drive down the 
cost of education and to ensure access to funds for students in 
need.  However the millennium fund is clearly not the way to 
accomplish this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Reform caucus is opposed to the fund, we have 
recommended some changes that will improve the current 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the millennium scholarship fund should be subject to the 
Access to Information Act.  This is fair.  It is hard to argue 
why the fund should be shrouded in secrecy. If the government is 
confident the money will be properly spent, it should embrace the 
opportunity to make the fund open to scrutiny. 
Second, eligible institution should mean an institution that is a 
public or private post-secondary educational institution in 
Canada that is designated for Canada student loan purposes and

</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this amendment satisfies the principle of equality and 
fairness and should be considered by all members of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, it is our recommendation that the provinces and 
territories be allowed to opt out and enter into agreements with 
the foundation to use their portion of the fund to suit their 
post-secondary priorities with no strings attached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be very surprised if Liberal members of this House 
opposed the amendment, as it is in keeping with Liberal policy on 
the procedure for implementing federal programs in areas of 
provincial jurisdiction where the provinces are reluctant to 
allow federal intervention. This is a part of Liberal policy on 
national standards, so I expect the government's support on that 
amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we recommend that an appeal process be established to 
consider grant applications which were denied or rejected. Again, 
this is a reasonable amendment that entrenches a provision for 
fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The millennium fund will not help Canadian students struggling 
to pay their way through university.  It is a bad program that 
should be scrapped.  However, if it must remain the recommended 
amendments made by my hon. colleague from Medicine Hat should be 
given careful consideration and support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is only one of the issues that have put a black mark on 
Bill C-36.  For this reason I will join my colleagues in the 
Reform caucus in opposition to it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK253"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to have this opportunity to rise in the House to speak 
about Bill C-36, the budget implementation act. There has been 
much debate about this bill already in committee and certainly in 
the House coming out of the budget that was presented.  We have 
heard a lot of discussion about the millennium fund and whether 
it will improve the situation for post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having looked at the document in committee where some of this 
discussion has taken place it is quite clear that post-secondary 
education is in a very deep crisis.  One of the reasons that we 
are facing a crisis with post-secondary education is the retreat 
of public funding to our post-secondary educational facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although we have heard a lot of talk about the millennium fund, 
this grand fund of $2.5 billion, the reality is this fund will 
not even begin until the year 2000 and will in reality help only 
about 7% of students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the time the fund begins in the year 2000 we will have 
experienced cuts of around $3 billion from post-secondary 
education.  So it becomes very clear that the millennium fund 
does not even come close to replacing and compensating for the 
massive drain and cuts we have experienced in post-secondary 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is causing enormous concern in terms of where public policy 
is going but also for the impact it is having on the lives 
of individual students.  It is because of the retreat of public 
funding that tuition fees have skyrocketed.   We have seen an 
increase of 240% in tuition fees over the last 10 years. We have 
all used the figure that average student debt is now at $25,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a direct relationship between the pain and the debtload 
students are facing and the retreat of public funding as a result 
of a loss of transfers from the federal government to the 
provincial government.  There is absolutely no escaping that 
fact, and the millennium fund cannot make up and does not make up 
for the loss we have experienced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the other really serious situation that the 
millennium fund creates is it begins to take us down a slippery 
slope of privatization.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>New Democrats are very concerned that with this foundation, a 
private foundation being set up which will have representation 
from corporations in the private sector, there will be less and 
less control in terms of public administration and public 
direction of our post-secondary educational facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For that reason alone, this fund should be rejected and we 
should go back to the drawing board and say that the real issue 
here is to support publicly administered, publicly accessible 
post-secondary educational facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have already seen examples in Canada where the corporate 
influence on board of governors of universities and colleges and 
now on this millennium fund is beginning to have an impact on 
curriculum of deregulation of tuition fees and deregulation of 
programs.  All these things are creating an environment where 
there is increasing privatization and corporatization of our 
post-secondary educational system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The millennium fund is a part of that direction and for that 
reason must be rejected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP believes very strongly that we must have an open 
discussion with the provinces because education is a provincial 
jurisdiction.  Members of the Bloc Quebecois have pointed out 
very well the huge concerns they have with the millennium fund. 
It is not only in Quebec.  This is echoed across the country in 
terms of unilateral decisions being taken by the federal 
government with regard to post-secondary education and the 
establishment of this private foundation with no consultation 
whatsoever with provincial jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP believes we need to have leadership from the federal 
government. It needs to be the kind of leadership done in 
co-operation and collaboration with provincial jurisdictions to 
design a national program of national grants that deals with 
different provincial jurisdictions and different provincial 
contexts where there is a clear understanding and a principle 
that accessibility for all students in Canada is a national 
standard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP believes that is the starting point of ensuring that our 
post-secondary education system is protected and strengthened and 
not destroyed as we have seen over the last few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is one of only two OECD countries that do not have a 
national grant system.  We need to ensure federal funding is 
provided in co-operation with provincial governments to establish 
a national system of grants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my province of British Columbia as well as in the province of 
Quebec there has been leadership shown in terms of trying to keep 
education accessible for students even in the face of massive 
cutbacks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In British Columbia we are now in the third year of a tuition 
freeze.  That has been very difficult to accomplish given the 
massive cutbacks we have experienced in transfers from the 
federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP is calling on the federal government to show the 
leadership that is necessary.  We have heard a lot of rhetoric 
and concern expressed by government members about the level of 
students debt, but there is nothing in this bill that will really 
alleviate the pressure and the huge debtload now facing students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have talked to students in my riding and here in the Ottawa 
area and have been really shocked to hear stories of students who 
are now facing debts of $40,000, $50,000, $60,000. What kind of 
way is that to start a life? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to go back to the drawing board and say clearly that 
this millennium fund is taking us down the wrong road.  We need a 
national grant system.  We need accessibility.  Most important of 
all, we need restoration of federal funding for post-secondary 
education in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, it 
is with great interest that I wanted to speak to Bill C-36, 
particularly with regard to the millennium scholarship fund. 
There are many reasons for this: first, because I am a father; 
second, because I worked in the area of education; and third, to 
show that, once again, we are duplicating structures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will always remember the farmer who, in 1970, convinced me to 
join in the fight for Quebec's sovereignty. He lived on 
concession 7 in a small community in my riding. His argument was 
quite simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: “Jean-Guy, take a good look in my barn”. He had a 
magnificent herd of Ayrshire cows. 
That dairy farmer had a mixed quota: 50% fluid milk and 50% 
industrial milk. The part of a cow's production used for 
industrial milk was under federal jurisdiction, whereas the part 
used for fluid milk, the kind we drink every day, was, and still 
is, under Quebec's jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the same cow, two agriculture ministers: one for industrial 
milk and one for fluid milk. All that for the same dairy 
producer— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> And the same cow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien:</B> And the same cow, of course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is doing the same thing to our students. The 
same student will have to send two applications for a loan or a 
scholarship: one to the Quebec government and one to the federal 
government. We are talking here about the same taxpayers, the 
same parents and the same students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few moments ago, I heard my friend, the member for 
Laurentides, say that 5% of the $2.5 billion will be used to pay 
employees, to pay for the forms, and so on. That means $1 out of 
every $20. If the federal government really wants to help our 
students, why does it not allow former students who are starting 
to repay their student loans to deduct the interest on their 
loans from their income? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it were so generous, if it really had the interests of young 
Canadians and young Quebeckers at heart, it would accept our 
suggestion immediately and would gain from this situation that 
opposes it to the Quebec government. 
In the early 1960s, under the late Jean Lesage, whom I had the 
pleasure to work with in the Liberal Party of Quebec, an honest 
man who worked for the well-being of his community, the well-being 
of Quebeckers, the Government of Quebec established a loans and 
grants program in co-operation with the federal government. It is 
working exceptionally well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our students are leaving universities with a bachelor's degree, 
with an average debt of $11,000, while students outside Quebec, 
elsewhere in Canada, have an average debt of $19,000 or $20,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, tuition fees are almost half those outside Quebec. It 
is not surprising that our English universities are filled with 
students from Ontario or elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Duplication creates unwarranted and unacceptable expenses, and 
the result is, in Canada, we pay 27 % more taxes of all kinds 
than in the United States for equal services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A second point that also hurts and offends students, the future 
recipients of these scholarships, and they demonstrated this in 
all the universities and cegeps of Quebec, is the way the 
federal government is getting ready—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ)</B> moved that Bill C-289, 
an act to amend the Bank Act and the Statistics Act (equity in 
community reinvestment), be read the second time and referred to 
a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Madam Speaker, you will understand that I have been 
waiting for this moment for a long time, since I introduced this 
bill in November. This is a somewhat special day, because it is 
also my birthday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> I am not saying this simply to get attention, I 
just think this might be my lucky day and that my luck will 
benefit poor communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me start off by saying that this bill is a concrete step 
against poverty. As MPs, we all know there is a direct link 
between poverty and access to credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the United States, a country where, we must admit, capitalism 
and free enterprise are thriving, they have had since 1977, that 
is for the past three decades, the Community Reinvestment Act, 
which makes it compulsory for banks to invest in disadvantaged 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is this all about? The six major chartered banks listed in 
schedule I of the Bank Act have the privilege to earn big 
profits using the money deposited by their clients. 
What we are asking for is some balance between the deposits they 
receive and the loans they make to the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not challenging the fact that banks are trying to make 
profits. If they make money by playing the bond market smartly 
or making a wise use of any other financial vehicle, we 
understand. What we do not understand is that in 1998 banks are 
no longer present in poor communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hochelaga—Maisonneuve is a case in point. This once thriving 
blue collar community is now hurting. Elderly people there tell 
me that in the 1960s there were 10 banks in their community. I 
challenge you to guess how many there are today. 
There are two. That is what has to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The banks, which are making record profits, have entered the 
global market, with 40% of their assets coming from foreign 
investments at the present time.  It is not right that banks are 
not present in communities needing their help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a community such as mine, Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, housing is 
where banks could invest and get involved.  Eighty-six per cent 
of my constituents rent their accommodation.  The banks' 
requirements are such that it is extremely difficult for anyone 
wishing to buy property to get a loan.  This must end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the United States, the equivalent of our superintendent of 
financial institutions tables an annual report in Congress on 
the efforts banks make in disadvantaged communities. 
This report looks at loans made for community development 
purposes, loans to small business and loans to individuals.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of loans to individuals, there are figures for low, 
middle and high income earners, by urban census area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is what I am asking of all parliamentarians today.  At a 
time when the Bank Act is being debated, at a time when a 
five-year review is obligatory, at a time when the Minister of 
Finance has set up a task force, is it not incumbent upon us as 
parliamentarians to send a very clear message in the end to the 
effect that we want the philosophy behind the Community 
Reinvestment Act to be part of our concerns as parliamentarians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a partisan issue because, regardless of which side 
of the House we are on, there is always a need for banks to get 
involved in the community. The Reform Party and the Bloc 
Quebecois each represent a part of this constituency. The same 
is true of the New Democratic Party and the Progressive 
Conservative Party, not to mention the government party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should banks get involved in their communities? The most 
obvious reason is of course that they can afford it. My bill 
does not call for this social involvement of banks across Canada 
to take a specific form. Within each of their communities, banks 
should work with industry, community groups, elected 
representatives, the bone and sinew of the community, to ensure 
that investments can be made which will benefit community 
development. 
That is the philosophy behind community reinvestment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me remind you that, in 1992, banks made approximately $2 
billion in profits. This year, profits will likely be closer to 
$8 billion. So, we are in a situation where, as I said, the 
effort asked of banks is not an unreasonable one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Banks should get involved in their communities because they 
operate in an extremely sheltered environment. The socio-economic 
studies chair at UQAM reported that 90% of loans issued by banks 
are secured by one level of government or the other and that 92% 
of all banking activities in Canada are conducted by the six 
major schedule I chartered banks. In a word, banks make profits 
and operate in a sheltered and concentrated environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The good news for bank shareholders is that retained earnings 
are higher than they have ever been in recent years. The 
retained earnings of banks have grown by 18% per year. Few 
industries in our society can match that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>UQAM is a breeding ground of ideas, which has enlightened the 
Quebec society. A good friend of mine, whom I wish to mention in 
passing—his name is Dominic Peltier-Rivest—is a professor of 
economics at UQAM and he supports my bill, which is comforting 
to me. I would ask my colleagues to some enthusiasm about this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Also, the socio-economics studies chair at UQAM 
has revealed, along with banking specialist professor Bernard 
Élie in his latest book, available from the Presses de 
l'Université de Montréal for the modest sum of $28, that the 
banks are getting rich off people's savings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every day in Canada, 2.5 million transaction slips are churned 
out by automatic tellers, and the banks get 50 cents for each 
transaction.  Imagine, a person cannot even take money out of 
his own account, his own independent income, without the banks 
charging for the transaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It cannot be repeated enough, we parliamentarians must tell the 
financial institutions, the chartered banks, that they have to 
get involved in disadvantaged communities, that they have to do 
so because they can afford to, and because they receive a lot 
from the community by virtue of their protected situation, so it 
is the least they can do.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To give some examples, once again in the United States, the 
Community Reinvestment Act has been in force since 1977 and so 
we can see what the effects of such an arrangement can be.  I do 
not want to talk about coercion here, we do not see a bill of 
this kind as compulsion.  It is a bill that will clarify the 
framework within which the banks can act in order to get 
involved in their community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you know, in recent years the Hispano-American community and 
the Afro-American community have seen their access to credit 
improve by 30%.  That is, of course, understandable. 
When a bank is in a predominantly black community, efforts will 
be expended to ensure that this community has access to personal 
loans and to mortgage money.  This is possible because there is 
an evaluation of banking business. Bank involvement is assessed. 
The monitoring agency makes reports and the consumers and 
American consumer groups follow those reports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The following are a few examples.  In some American states, 
there are special accounts just for people who write a limited 
number of cheques.  Some states have said that, in the spirit of 
the Community Investment Act, a certain number of free cheques 
will be allowed.  The banking institution will process a certain 
number of cheques without a service charge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote an example from New York State. As the member for 
Quebec, who has always been sensitive to these issues, knows, 
some communities passed rules making it impossible to freeze a 
client's account for more than two banking days. This is 
something important which comes from the Community Reinvestment 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More important yet, as I was saying earlier, in an area like 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, 86% of the population lives in rental 
accommodation. If we do not help them a bit, and God knows banks 
are not easy to deal with in that respect, they will never own a 
home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give you another example. In a number of American states, 
banks absorb part of the mortgage-related costs such as the 
appraisal, title search and credit rating costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You will no doubt agree with me, Madam Speaker, that all this is 
very reasonable. There is nothing outlandish about this. There 
is nothing in the examples I just gave that is not consistent 
with what banks are all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there anybody in this House who believes that, if we leave 
the banks to their own devices, they will voluntarily invest in 
disadvantaged communities? Certainly not. As law-makers, we must 
send them a very clear message and tell them exactly what we 
expect of them, regardless of our political affiliation. Whether 
we belong to the government, the NDP—of course, much to its 
credit, the NDP has a long history of social action—the Reform 
Party or the Conservative Party, we must tell banks now that we 
will no longer tolerate their being absent from large 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recently gave a press conference with the bishop of Rimouski. 
He is highly respected in his community; he received a classical 
education and he is an extremely sensitive man. He told me that, 
just as in Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, banks have deserted his 
community. I have to say it, I want this to be very clear, it is 
the main thrust of the bill before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the rest, I can only hope. This bill is very close to my 
heart. I want to get this thing going because I know that 
several other parliamentarians are sensitive to this problem. 
I want to use my colleague from Brome—Missisquoi as an example, 
because he has also introduced a bill to better control bank 
fees, to ensure that banks will have to appear before a 
committee to explain any fee increases and also to establish the 
appropriate regulations. I raise that point because there are 
obviously, in every political party, members who could work on 
this in a non-partisan caucus.

the operations of the banks and our expectations in this area in

non-partisan caucus, where all members who are concerned about 
this issue would represent their parties and give their best for 
greater social justice.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to note that the Task Force on the Future 
of the Canadian Financial Services Sector is examining the 
responsiveness of financial institutions to community needs as 
part of its work.  Consequently we believe that it is appropriate 
to wait for the task force views before deciding whether any 
further action is required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of community reinvestment involves a number of 
important considerations.  At the end of the day the task force 
will need to assess whether there is a need for a more focused 
approach to community investment by the banks.  There may be a 
number of models that would have to be carefully considered. The 
government's primary task, should it decide to move forward on 
this matter, is to ensure that the model chosen will accomplish 
specific policy objectives in an efficient manner.

While the bill's provisions are intended to promote equity in 
community investment, it contains some elements that could have 
unintended negative impacts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-289 appears to be loosely modelled on the American 
community reinvestment act, legislation that was implemented in 
the U.S. in response to a unique credit discrimination problem. 
This type of credit discrimination does not exist in our banking 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to recognize that the CRA was introduced in the 
U.S. during the 1970s to discourage financial institutions from 
red lining inner city areas, that is, taking deposits from the 
entire service area but not lending in certain neighbourhoods. 
This practice is believed to be the primary factor underlying the 
transformation of many U.S. inner cities into urban ghettos. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the CRA has been useful in raising U.S. lenders' awareness 
of their lending patterns, it remains unclear whether its 
benefits, primarily social, outweigh the regulatory costs.  This 
legislation has been criticized for imposing cumbersome and 
expensive data reporting and record keeping requirements on both 
the government and regulated institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-289 will require Stats Canada to produce estimates of 
monthly unemployment rates for each federal riding.  Statistics 
Canada has estimated the initial implementation cost would be $15 
million. The ongoing annual cost of the monthly labour force 
survey would mushroom to $40 million, triple the current cost. We 
would want to explore whether there may be a more cost efficient 
method of designating disadvantaged communities and establishing 
stress measurements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the provisions of the bill, branches of schedule I banks 
located in designated disadvantaged federal ridings would be 
required to produce detailed lending statistics for those 
specific areas.  Disadvantaged ridings would be defined on the 
basis of the unemployment rate within the riding. However the 
proposed criteria that would be used to assess whether a riding 
is disadvantaged is problematic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any federal riding having an unemployment rate equal to or 
higher than the national average unemployment rate would be 
designated as disadvantaged.  Furthermore a riding's monthly 
unemployment rate need only equal or exceed the national rate 
once during the preceding year to be designated as disadvantaged. 
Such a loose definition goes far beyond capturing those ridings 
with chronic unemployment problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover there is a problem with the definition of community in 
general.  Imposing artificial limits on bank lending based on the 
geographic source of deposits presupposes that the market is not 
working efficiently. 
In considering any potential community investment initiatives, 
the government would want to be assured that the model being 
examined would not lead to inefficient allocation of capital.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A further area of concern with Bill C-289 is the requirement for 
banks to generate detailed lending statistics at the federal 
riding level.  This could impact negatively on privacy protection 
for bank customers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During its hearings with the banks on small business financing, 
the House industry committee explored the concept of requiring a 
much more detailed breakdown of lending statistics.  In fact the 
committee looked at seeing whether we could get the breakdown by 
postal code or community.  In the end it was determined that the 
aggregating of lending statistics to this extent would 
potentially result in the breach of client privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to re-emphasize the government's commitment to community 
investment despite the criticisms I have put forward here. Today 
the government is taking action to promote community investment. 
The regional development agencies and other government programs 
continue to play a big role in financing community needs across 
Canada.  We are also sustaining efforts to aggressively encourage 
the banks to meet legitimate small and medium size businesses' 
financing needs in all regions of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is nevertheless sensitive to the fact that many 
rural communities have experienced difficulties in accessing not 
only credit but banking services in general.  Let us be clear. 
The banking landscape has changed dramatically in recent years. 
The banks must take steps to ensure that rural and remote 
communities have sufficient access to banking services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is also keeping a watchful eye on the banks' 
lending activities and carefully reviews their lending data in 
order to assess progress in meeting the financing needs of small 
business.  Regular House industry committee hearings with the 
banks provide a good opportunity to question the banks on 
statistics which may reveal problem areas with respect to access 
to capital. While it is recognized that credit decisions are 
highly subjective and involve potential considerations, the data 
reporting requirements of the banks provide an effective check on 
the banks with respect to their efforts to support community 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much of the debate on community reinvestment has focused on the 
increasing availability of microcredit to small business.  I 
would note that there are a number of federal and provincial 
microcredit initiatives run by a variety of community 
organizations right across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In general these programs offer financial assistance as well as 
training, mentoring and counselling services. These programs 
serve not only small business operators but also target youth, 
aboriginal peoples, women and non-urban rural communities. The 
government considers these microcredit programs to be of vital 
importance in promoting community development at the grassroots 
level and will continue to support and promote microcredit 
lending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, while the government supports the principle of 
community investment, Bill C-289 may not be in fact the best 
approach.  Furthermore, we believe that it would be premature to 
take any action in this area before the task force submits its 
views to the government this fall. For this and the other reasons 
I have outlined in my discussion today, I believe that it would 
be incumbent upon the House to reject Bill C-289. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to say that the hon. member, I am sure, is quite 
sincere in putting forward the bill and does believe in what he 
is doing. I merely want to point out a number of deficiencies 
that I see in this particular bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact the reason we set up the task force was to look at the 
changing financial institutions and the changing financial 
sector.  I do believe that waiting for that report would be the 
most effective way of dealing with the change that is going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the end we all want to ensure that Canadians in urban Canada 
and rural Canada, Canadians who are involved in small businesses 
and Canadians who deal in microcredit are all properly served by 
the financial institutions in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly applaud the work of the industry committee and 
certainly the work of all members.  The outcome is the benefit 
that can be achieved by ensuring that small business and 
Canadians in general do have the proper access to capital and do 
receive the necessary banking services they require so that they 
can continue to contribute in a very real and effective manner to 
the growth of this country and its economy.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I feel 
privileged to enter the debate on this bill.  I think the 
motivation that gave rise to the bill is a very commendable one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe at the beginning of the last parliament, the 35th 
Parliament, the industry committee undertook a major study on 
access to capital for small business.  That study has continued 
to guide the hon. member who just spoke on behalf of the 
government side in this debate.  It certainly influenced him and 
it influenced a lot of other people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue here is the availability of credit to individuals and 
to businesses.  We need to be very careful that this credit is 
available in a fair and equitable manner and in a competitive 
marketplace where the people who are providing the capital do so 
in a fair and reasonable manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue before us is that banks, chartered banks in 
particular, be forced.  I know the hon. member who is presenting 
this bill said that there is no coercion involved.  That word 
perhaps is false.  There is coercion involved in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the outset of the bill its summary clearly suggests rather 
directly that the banks shall.  It says that this enactment 
amends the Bank Act and provides that certain branches of banks 
must take measures to facilitate access to credit to persons who 
have a residence or place of business in the federal electoral 
district in which the branches are located. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the clauses of the bill the words “shall” and 
“must” are located.  The issue is very clear that there is 
definitely an element of coercion involved in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of my remarks is not to suggest that the banks are 
doing an exemplary job in providing access to capital to small 
business or to individuals.  That is not the issue. The issue is 
that the banks are doing that sort of thing.  Are they doing it 
as well as they should? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague opposite said that the industry committee 
receives quarterly reports from the way in which the chartered 
banks are lending money to the various businesses. It is very 
interesting.  The most recent of those quarterly reports is dated 
September 30, 1997.  I did a comparison with the first report 
dated December 1995.  I compared what has happened to the lending 
patterns of the chartered banks in that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was very interesting that in December 1995 the banks were 
lending more money to small businesses, that is from zero to 
$25,000, than they were in 1997.  The total number of dollars 
available in fact decreased during that time period. The number 
of people however who received those loans increased.  This 
really meant that more people were getting smaller loans than was 
the case two years previously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the other end of the scale, the number of those 
who borrowed $1 million to $5 million dollars had gone down. 
However, the total amount available in credit was considerably 
higher.  Therefore, there were fewer people borrowing more money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is all part of the banks' profit picture.  It is true that 
the banks can argue that they are profitable organizations. 
Nobody will debate that.  We all know that they are highly 
profitable.  They are so profitable indeed that many people would 
criticize their profitability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that there are a lot of other profitable 
businesses in this country.  The issue here is not to criticize 
the profitability but rather to look very carefully at whether 
their pattern is such that we can take exception to the 
accessibility to the lending and the borrowing that we need to do 
in order to run our businesses and our own individual lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill restricts itself only to chartered banks.  It also 
restricts itself to branches in chartered banks.  There are two 
difficulties with this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, there are many other deposit taking institutions 
that are not chartered banks.  I look particularly at the credit 
unions, caisses populaires and trust companies. Those are 
probably the most commonly recognized as being deposit taking 
institutions. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1800"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT49"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT49"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1800

<A HREF="#LINKT48"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These institutions are very community centred, very involved in 
the community.  They take money out of the community and lend 
money back into the community.  To distinguish one particular 
group by saying that it must but others can do whatever they feel 
I do not think is quite fair.  I do not think that was the 
intention either.  Perhaps it was; I do not know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose it could be argued that because the banks have 85% of 
the deposits in Canada therefore in each community that is the 
case.  It may follow or it may not.  In fact in many cases it 
does not follow.  There are other ways of depositing money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is one of reinvestment.  How do we reinvest?  If a 
bank takes substantial sums of money in deposits from a 
particular community, ought it not reinvest in the same 
proportion as it receives deposits from the community?  The bill 
is not clear as to whether that is how it would work or whether 
it would not work that way.  It is not known. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like also to refer to another provision in the bill 
which I think has a serious shortcoming.  It suggests that a 
disadvantaged community is a community in which the unemployment 
rate once during the previous 12 month period was equal to or 
larger than the national average.  This is to be done on an 
electoral basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An electoral district does not have a constant boundary.  It 
changes every 10 years, but nevertheless it does change.  The 
issue now becomes one of being very micro centred. A community 
goes beyond an electoral district. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we take the city of Montreal it can in one sense be 
considered a community.  If we look at the unemployment 
statistics for that community—and I agree there is more than one 
electoral district—it would as the larger community certainly 
qualify as being a disadvantaged community.  Not only that one, 
but we could go right across Canada and most of our major centres 
would qualify as disadvantaged communities under that definition. 
If we break it down small enough into certain sections there 
would not be a disadvantaged community in that sense.  In other 
cases there would be very much the opposite situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that there are some shortcomings in the bill.  The 
intention may have been reasonable but the way it is worded will 
cause us a lot of difficulty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also we want to recognize the intent and purpose. Certainly my 
purpose on the industry committee and certainly my purpose as a 
parliamentarian is to make sure that there is a sound and stable 
financial institutional system in Canada.  Our chartered banks 
have served us very well, but there are some very severe 
shortcomings.  The issue is that some of our chartered banks are 
perhaps moving into areas that are to the disadvantage of the 
small borrower, the small lender, the small depositor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the pressures that have come with quarterly reports have 
caused the banks to perhaps change their behaviour slightly but 
not enough to make a material difference.  The intention may be 
okay but I think there are some difficulties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to suggest that there is a major change 
coming. It is happening already in the whole financial 
institutions area and in particular with regard to banking and 
banking services.  We are getting into electronic banking in a 
big way. In fact there are electronic banks that have no 
branches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would the legislation do in that regard?  Non-branch banks 
also take deposits out of what would have been defined as a 
disadvantaged community.  Would the same requirements that are 
imposed on chartered banks with branches be imposed on them?  If 
not, one group is being preferred over another and it does not 
create fair competition or equality of competition. I do not 
think that is fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For that reason, if for no other, I would say let us vote 
against the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
first like to say that I support Bill C-289 moved by my friend, 
the member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve. There may be some details 
on which I disagree, but this is normal.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important to refer this bill to a committee of the 
House to have a debate on the future of the banking system in 
our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similar legislation exists in the United States. It is not 
something very radical. In the United States, just south of the 
border, there is very similar legislation. For this reason, I am 
in favour of this bill before us this afternoon. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time has come when we should start treating more seriously 
private members' initiatives in the House in terms of referring 
them to committee more often; giving our committees more power 
and independence so that a committee of the House can actually 
initiate legislation; reforming our political parliamentary 
system to make it more democratic and more independent from the 
executive, the government; and making parliament more meaningful 
to the people of the country.  I think that is a very 
non-partisan statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from Saskatchewan where our party has been in power for 
the most part of the last 50 years.  I know there and in every 
other province that too much power resides with the executive. 
There is not enough independence for ordinary members of 
parliament who are elected to express their point of view and 
initiate legislation that is useful to people of any province or 
any country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time has come where members on all sides of the House, all 
five parties, will have to band together to make sure we get some 
meaningful reforms to make parliament more acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look at the cynicism out there today I see it is 
increasing.  When we look at the turnout in the last election we 
see that it is going down.  People are more and more turned off 
by the political process.  If we could somehow make debates like 
this one more meaningful, it would serve a great purpose for 
Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the great exercises in democracy that I hope will occur 
in the next six months will be to allow the opinion of the people 
of the country to be expressed about the bank mergers and the 
future of financial institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance, probably in November, will make a 
decision on whether or not he will allow the merger of the Royal 
Bank and the Bank of Montreal along with the merger of the CIBC 
and the Toronto-Dominion Bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I travel around the country there is a great amount of 
concern about megabanks being expressed by a broad spectrum of 
the Canadian population that support all parties in the House. It 
does not only come from certain groups in society.  It comes, for 
example, from the Canadian Federation of Independent Business 
that represents 89,000 small and medium businesses.  It recently 
did a survey which shows around 75% of its members are in 
opposition to these megamergers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That should tell us something.  Small business is the real motor 
of our economy.  It employs people.  It talks to the public.  It 
has a good sense of what the public wants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in parliament should find a way to make sure that point of 
view is heard by and expressed to the government.  We should be 
saying to John Cleghorn, Matthew Barrett and the other presidents 
of the banks that they will not hold parliament to ransom by 
making their announcement well ahead time and expecting us to 
rubber stamp the merger of these four great Canadian banks into 
two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That will not be the case just because the stock market has 
reacted and bank stocks have gone up by $19 billion since January 
in anticipation of our being trained seals.  We will not 
necessarily react that way.  Parliament should express the will 
of the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Big is not necessarily better.  We can look at the big Japanese 
banks that are having trouble today. These two megabanks which 
are now four Canadian banks represent assets of over $900 billion 
compared to the budget of the Government of Canada in the $120 
billion to $150 billion range. We are talking about two huge sumo 
wrestler type banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They do not want to merge to be a better service to the Canadian 
people.  It is the bank workers, the customers and the 
communities which have built those banks and made them profitable 
that will be devastated by these mergers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The banks want to merge for one reason and that reason is greed. 
Those bank presidents have seen their stock options increase by 
approximately $100 million since January.  In the CIBC and the TD 
alone the nine major officers of those two banks have seen their 
stock options increase by $142 million since January.  No wonder 
they want the mergers to proceed.  It is good for the big fat 
bankers, but is it good for Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Experts are saying that approximately 20% of the people who work 
for those banks will be laid off.  They will lose their jobs. 
Approximately 30,000 Canadians will lose their jobs. That is a 
population of a small city.  That is why parliament has to stand 
up and say no and represent the Canadian people on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those four banks have about 5,000 branches, many of which will 
close throughout rural Canada and in city centres.  This will 
result in a lack of service for the Canadian people. There is 
also the issue of corporate concentration.  Our banking sector 
already is the most concentrated banking sector of any country in 
the Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we go from five big banks to two megabanks we will see 
about 70% of the banking assets in the hands of two banks.  In 
the United States it would take approximately 100 banks to make 
70% of the banking assets of that country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This should be a great worry to Canadian people in terms of 
service, bank service charges, interest on loans, service to the 
small business community, farmers and ordinary people.  These 
mergers will not be in the interest of the people of the country. 
They are in the interest of Mr. Cleghorn, Mr. Barrett, Mr. 
Baillie and Mr. Flood, the presidents, CEOs and banking 
executives of these four big banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those banks have been made very profitable.  They have made over 
$7 billion in profits in the last year, and they have done that 
in Canada.  They do not have to get bigger to be more profitable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even my Liberal friend from Winnipeg is embarrassed about the 
power of these big banks.  He knows the electorate in his riding 
is very concerned about the layoffs that will ensue, the lack of 
competition and the branches that will close throughout Manitoba. 
In Lynn Lake, Manitoba, there was only one bank which is the 
Toronto-Dominion Bank and it has closed.  It is a community 
without a bank. This is happening right across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope we take advantage of this debate to focus once again on 
the power of these banks and to say at the very least that 
Canadian banks should be forced to reinvest in their local 
communities the money they take from depositors in their local 
communities.  This is happening now in the United States of 
America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing radical about it.  It is happening in the 
United States.  Let us make sure it happens here.  The banks are 
here to serve the Canadian people, not to fatten the pockets of 
John Cleghorn, Al Ford and the other big bank CEOs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will do whatever I can as a member of parliament to help 
channel public opinion against these big mergers.  They are not 
in the Canadian interest and I say to John Cleghorn “Don't take 
parliament for granted.  We are not trained seals.  We are not a 
rubber stamp.  You can't blackmail the Parliament of Canada”. 
Parliament is supreme in terms of making up its mind whether or 
not these mergers go ahead.  We reflect the Canadian people.  We 
will make sure they say no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a survey in the Regina <I>Leader Post</I> about two 
weeks ago.  It was a survey and not a poll.  The question was 
“Do you think if these big banks merge you will get better 
service or worse service?”  Over 2,000 people called the 
<I>Leader Post</I> and 93% said the service would be worse and 7% 
said the service would be better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is another reason we as members of parliament should say 
that it is not in the public interest, not in the interest of 
Canada, that these mergers go ahead.  That is one of the reasons 
I support the bill of the hon. member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve.

congratulate the member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve for putting 
forward this piece of legislation, which I have read.  I echo the 
comments of my colleague in the NDP that it is very refreshing to 
speak to issues that are important to us as individual members of 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I share some sympathy with the member who submitted this bill 
that it is not votable.  I find that to be unfortunate. I wish 
that all private members' legislation, bills or motions, were 
votable in this House.  I have had the opportunity to speak to a 
number of my own that were not votable, although they were very 
important issues.  They are very necessary issues for individual 
members of parliament, not only for their own constituencies but 
for the constituency we all serve, the constituency of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was confused as I read the bill because it did not speak a lot 
about the bank mergers.  I respect the hon. member in the NDP for 
his opinion on a number of issues.  He has conviction and he is 
certainly very dedicated to his cause.  However, I am not 
prepared to stand here and not speak to the legislation, and I 
certainly will not bank bash, which was the soap box given to the 
hon. member with respect to this piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will try to home in on what the member for 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve is trying to put forward.  As I understand 
it, this bill would amend the Bank Act and the Statistics Act to 
promote equity in community reinvestment.  It is not a bill that 
talks about bank mergers and the operations of banking 
institutions and how the Americans are either better or worse 
than us.  What it talks about is a very important issue to all of 
us, in particular the smaller communities which have banking 
institutions.  Moneys are taken from those communities, whether 
in deposits, in RRSP contributions, in mutual funds or in other 
investment vehicles to be invested in other areas, most of them 
being the major financial centres, the larger centres in eastern 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the theory and practicalities of economy.  Let us 
be serious about it, perhaps a little more serious than the NDP 
member who spoke, who may not quite understand all of the 
mechanics of international and national economies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe very seriously that in my own community the banking 
institutions are good corporate citizens.  They become a part of 
our community, but they have a job that has to be done.  That job 
is obviously to make a profit, which the NDP member would see 
slightly as a dirty word.  I see it as an opportunity for 
corporations to reinvest in themselves and to help those same 
employees the member suggested would be impacted by the mergers. 
They are and have always been good corporate citizens in my 
community.  They are certainly there when necessary to help the 
community in any number of fashions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We first talked about reinvestment in the community.  The 
banking institution is there to help people like members of the 
House to maintain the standard of living they have developed over 
the past number years in their families.  They allow us to 
purchase our residences, to purchase our vehicles, to purchase 
things for our leisure activities and to purchase the education 
that is vital for our families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They reinvest in the community with respect to commercial and 
industrial reinvestment.  We have heard constantly about small 
and medium size enterprises, the backbone of the Canadian 
economy.  In most cases the small and medium size enterprises 
depend an awful lot on the same financial institutions we speak 
about in this legislation.  That is not in all cases because 
mistakes are made and everything is not perfect in this world. 
However, in most cases those small and medium size enterprises 
are assisted by the banking industry, which is good, not bad. 
This legislation also speaks to those good things.  I am very 
pleased about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation also calls for more transparency in the banking 
institutions.  It suggests that the banks should tell us how many 
dollars are being taken from our communities and how many are 
being reinvested.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is as far as it should go.  I do not think there should be 
a quota system.  I do not believe there should be legislation 
saying that if dollar one goes out then dollar one must come in. 
That changes the whole dynamics of what we realize as being a 
Canadian economy built on a banking system which is probably 
second to none in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC Party believes in promoting equity in community 
reinvestment and in strengthening the corporate citizenship of 
the banks in those communities.  However, the measures that Bill 
C-289 would take to ensure equity are ambiguous and a bit 
unclear.  Under Bill C-289 banks in different regions would be 
held at different standards.  Only those banks in a district with 
higher unemployment than the national average would be subject to 
this bill and the accountability that it would bring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that the bill should be applicable to all 
electoral districts, not just to a selected few.  Currently the 
legislation is not equally applicable to all banks.  Judging a 
bank in Cape Breton differently than one in Medicine Hat is not a 
solution that will promote community reinvestment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government intervention in the lending sector is not the 
solution to job creation.  Lowering payroll taxes and tax relief 
should be the first steps in promoting job creation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, Bill C-289 does propose a very productive step forward 
in promoting accountability in the banking industry that is very 
positive.  It is a step for which I congratulate the member.  But 
the accountability brought forward by Bill C-289 should not be 
restricted just to electoral districts with unemployment rates 
greater than the national average.  That same accountability and 
transparency should be throughout all electoral districts.  There 
should not be any criteria with respect to unemployment rates. 
It should be applied to all banks across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently the Canadian Bankers Association distributes business 
credit statistics outlining recent credit extended to small and 
medium size businesses.  In fact, the banking sector undertook 
this practice even before crown corporations began to publish 
similar reports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill rightfully pushes the level of accountability and 
transparency further than the current reporting practices of the 
banking sector.  The proposal under section 522.06 where banks 
would have to analyse their operations systems, rules and 
practices in order to determine their position relative to 
community reinvestment is positive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the bill admits that the government would be 
hard-pressed to apply specific measures to certain banks which 
did not comply with the bill's intention.  Nowhere in the bill is 
there any mention of how the minister could impose greater 
lending practices on institutions that do not meet the ambiguous 
and undefined criteria for community reinvestment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC Party is in favour of having a report published and 
publicly accessible outlining the commitment the banking sector 
has made toward community reinvestment.  At this point in time we 
believe that simply publishing this information would ensure 
greater public accountability in the banking sector.  If the 
numbers are there the public then has the opportunity to make its 
own decision as to whether sufficient dollars are being 
reinvested into the community from that one institution and 
whether the public should in fact support that institution in 
their community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this bill is meant to promote accountability in the banking 
sector, then yearly reports are the first step in this process. 
However, if this bill is meant to strengthen job creation in 
underdeveloped employment regions of Canada, the government 
should not confuse the issue with accountability in the banking 
sector.  They are two separate issue.  I appreciate the fact that 
we should have transparency in accounting in the system because 
then we do have a choice, but for the institutions to put that 
money back into a region simply because of a high unemployment 
rate is not the way to do it.  There are other ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of intervening in private enterprise the government 
should offer small and medium size businesses in Canada the tools 
to expand and promote job creation on their own.  I touched on 
that earlier by suggesting that the government should help 
regional development with respect to taxation, which is the major 
impediment of any regional development, and provide the 
opportunity to develop those industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Offering Canadians tax relief and cutting employment insurance 
premiums are the first steps the government should undertake to 
assist regions with high unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve for putting the 
bill forward.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to clarify three points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the government member who said that this legislation 
dates back to the 1970s probably does not know that the Clinton 
administration has updated the Community Reinvestment Act. The 
impact of this legislation and its underlying objectives are 
just as relevant today as they were when the bill was first 
passed in 1977. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, why was the electoral district used as unit of 
reference? Simply because it is the unit for which there was the 
most data available and because we thought, along with the 
drafters who worked on the bill, that it was an interesting unit 
of reference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, if a member thinks that another unit of reference should 
have been used, in a democracy, the best way to counter an idea 
is to put forward a better one. I am very open to any kind of 
amendment that would improve this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of my remarks, I will ask unanimous consent to refer 
this bill to a parliamentary committee so that we can have a 
real debate on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not have unanimous consent. The four opposition parties, 
namely the New Democratic Party, the Progressive Conservative 
Party, the Reform Party and the Bloc, are willing to give it, 
but not the government. Do you know why the government is not 
willing to give its consent? Because this government is made up 
of hypocrites who speak from both sides of their mouths, 
particularly the House leader. They tell us that they support 
the philosophy behind the Community Reinvestment Act, but they 
back off when the time comes to engage into a real debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You know very well, Madam Speaker, that we have a problem with 
credit in Canada and in Quebec. The Liberals are hypocrites, 
particularly their House leader. They are just short of being 
liars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is unacceptable is that, yesterday, the leader of the Bloc 
Quebecois and I came very close to an agreement with the 
government for the bill to be referred to a parliamentary 
committee, which is the minimum one can expect in a democracy. 
Today, the Liberals are opposed to that. Do you know why? 
Because none of them can rise and speak without his hands being 
tied by the banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If one of these members were to rise and say this is not true, I 
would be prepared to table in this House the banks' 
contributions to the political parties.  You can see these 
people cannot be honest and upright.  They cannot hope for a 
real debate and take a stand on behalf of the disadvantaged, as 
in the south centre, Hochelaga—Maisonneuve and Winnipeg, because 
they have sold their souls.  They are owned by the banks.  I 
find the position of the House leader of this government 
insulting, disdainful and unparliamentary, as I do the remarks 
of the government members who just spoke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are nowhere near a real debate on the banks.  I know we 
cannot count on the Liberals. 
What is interesting today is that the Reformers, the New 
Democrats and the Conservatives, with whom we do not agree on 
everything, as is to be expected, are giving their consent and 
are prepared to meet in committee and call witnesses in order to 
have a real debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sick at the thought of how hypocritical the Liberals are. 
Earlier, the deputy whip said to me “No, we will not support 
this bill”.  They were prepared to give their support, 
yesterday, because they thought the Reformers would not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like those watching this evening to know that the 
Liberals are deeply dishonest.  They lack integrity.  If people 
do not take to the streets, if there is no groundswell to force 
this government to assume its responsibilities, there will be no 
debate on the banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And what will happen. We will go on as before.  How is it that, 
yesterday, the National Council of Welfare reminded us of the 
five million Canadians living in poverty, when in 1989 we passed 
a resolution to have all parties work to fight poverty? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there one member in this House who will rise?  Is there one 
individual among the government members, with their stupid 
smiles, who will rise and say there is no relationship between 
poverty and access to credit?  The Liberals make me sick, and I 
want people to know that they will never be honest with the 
banks, because of the funding they get.  We know, we have the 
list.  That is the distinction between democracy, between people 
who can stand up and speak honestly with their hands untied and 
the traditional parties that let themselves be bought by the 
banks.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, both 
military and civilian employees of the Department of National 
Defence are under heavy attack from this government.  That was 
evidenced by what the federal standing defence committee heard 
last week in Halifax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee was told of military families so strapped for 
money they were forced to knowingly cash bad cheques to pay for 
their children's medicine.  There were also horror stories about 
people injured while serving their country, only to be thrown on 
the scrap heap by DND. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of working to maximize the potential of our armed 
forces, this Liberal government has chosen to treat our defence 
personnel as second class citizens, sacrificing their jobs and 
their families' future to the short term selfish economic gains 
of large corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Liberal government's ASD allegedly stands for alternate 
service delivery.  It really stands for armed services 
destruction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This shortsighted and destructive strategy of cutting the 
civilian workforce in Halifax, Goose Bay, Shiloh, Gagetown and 
throughout the country hurts not only those employees sacrificed 
but also their families and entire communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This offensive against Canada's military reads like a well 
crafted government strategic campaign to attack from two fronts. 
It was not enough to disrupt the lives and plans of civilian 
defence employees by forcing them to all of a sudden compete for 
service bids with mega corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When civilian military workers successfully beat the ASD 
contract bids of private companies, this government abruptly 
changed the rules of engagement to favour large corporations. The 
bundling of bids provides for the awarding of contracts on a 
national basis, not only a cheap shot at our military but a slap 
in the face to small businesses throughout this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is this Liberal government's real agenda, an efficient 
military or a privatized and gutted military where there are 
enough funds for huge capital purchases but not enough to sustain 
the dedicated men and women serving Canada in both civilian and 
military roles? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before rushing blindly into a minefield, will this government 
not take time and fully explore what this will mean to the people 
of Halifax and elsewhere? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The plan to cut 125 jobs at CFB Halifax is structured to allow 
management favourites to keep their jobs while those with better 
credentials are fired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are close to two and a half thousand civilian defence 
employees in Nova Scotia, about 90% of them in greater metro 
Halifax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 the federal government cut over 50% of the civilian jobs 
at CFB Shearwater and has been cutting further through this ASD 
fiasco.  Just what are the government's plans for Shearwater? 
The people of Halifax deserve to know what this government has up 
its sleeve for their future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Goose Bay, Newfoundland where support services were 
privatized to a foreign corporation, jobs and wages were slashed. 
The impact on the local community has been dire, with everyone 
from the DND workers to the local chamber of commerce denouncing 
the shortsighted and selfish deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Defence has suggested that people would be 
treated humanely as this offensive against Canada's military was 
deployed.  If laying off people and cutting salaries in half is 
humane, it is a good thing his portfolio does not include human 
rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of the Halifax region, throughout the province of 
Nova Scotia and across Canada deserve answers, answers this 
Liberal government seems loathe to provide, as if it is afraid to 
jeopardize this backward strategy of taking wages and jobs from 
Canada's civilian defence personnel in order to hand over quick 
cash to large corporations. Not good enough.

deliver the missions defined by the government in the defence 
policy in the most cost effective way possible within the 
constraints of the budget available.

can be done with the alternative service delivery program. 
At the same time, however, the government has an obligation and a 
desire to make sure that employees are treated fairly.  We have 
demonstrated that with the way we have gone about the downsizing 
of the public service.  We will demonstrate it again in the terms 
of how we treat employees affected by the alternative service 
delivery program.

</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK269"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise in 
response to the reply provided by the Minister of Transport on 
February 24 to my question on the toll highway in New Brunswick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Trans-Canada Highway between Moncton and Fredericton was 
built with Canadian taxpayers' money. The federal government 
joined New Brunswick to fund the construction of that highway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But at the last minute, the New Brunswick government played 
behind the back of the residents of that province and reached an 
agreement with Maritime Road Development Corporation. This 
agreement creates a number of problems. First, New Brunswick 
residents have already paid for the highway, through taxes. To 
collect a toll from those who travel from one city to another 
violates people's right to move freely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tolls collected may not be a problem for someone like Doug 
Young, but they represent several hundreds of dollars every year 
for those who travel from Moncton to Fredericton a number of 
times every week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreement also poses a problem in that the negotiations with 
Maritime Road Development Corporation were conducted behind 
closed doors. I realize it is common practice for the Liberals 
to do things behind the back of Canadians, but this must stop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that the person behind these negotiations is 
Doug Young, the former Liberal Minister of Transport. Mr. Young 
is now getting rich at the expense of the residents of New 
Brunswick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Enough is enough. Canadians are sick and tired of seeing 
patronage everywhere they look. They are sick and tired of 
seeing that their elected officials are only looking after their 
friends' interests instead of protecting the interests of 
Canadians. Awarding a contract to a former minister of one's own 
party and helping him get rich is not only deplorable, but is 
clearly a conflict of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's highways should never be subject to tolls, particularly 
not to help private contractors get rich. 
The situation was best described by the mayor of Salisbury, Ruth 
Jackson, who said “Setting tolls on any section of the 
Trans-Canada Highway is an abuse of the trust of Canadians, 
because it deprives them of a unified transportation network 
from coast to coast. Any toll road, whether provincial or 
private, must be completely separate from the Trans-Canada 
Highway. If such tolls are set up, any commercial haulage in the 
region east of Moncton will be deprived of the access to the 
national highway network”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us listen to Canadians and do away with the idea of toll 
highways.

jurisdiction.  Lesson one.  This means that provincial 
governments decide on their alignment, design, construction 
standards, tendering process and financing as well as subsequent 
operations and maintenance.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>POST-SECONDARY EDUCATION 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK272"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, as 
the post-secondary education critic for the NDP I have tried to 
do my best to press the federal government on concerns about 
post-secondary education and the crisis we are facing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In question period about a week ago I questioned the government 
about the skyrocketing tuition fees and deregulation which is 
causing a two tier educational system in Canada.  I pointed out 
to the government that the Americanization and the privatization 
of post-secondary education is directly as a result of the 
gutting of federal funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was shocked by the response from the Secretary of State for 
Children and Youth, who suggested I speak to my colleagues in the 
Government of British Columbia to deal with the issue of 
skyrocketing tuition fees.  I was shocked at this response 
because I could not believe a government minister was not aware, 
especially the Secretary of State for Children and Youth, that in 
the province of British Columbia we have had a tuition freeze not 
for one year, not for two years but for three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The B.C. government introduced legislation very recently that 
will continue the tuition freeze until 1999.  The government of 
B.C. is doing this to ensure that post-secondary education is 
affordable and accessible.  The freeze will include tuition fees 
for graduate, undergraduate, career, technical, vocational and 
developmental programs.  It also freezes mandatory ancillary fees 
that could increase the cost of tuition, including such items as 
library registration or laboratory fees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point this out because I really find it appalling that the 
federal government apparently has not a clue what is going on in 
British Columbia and the leadership that has been taken to ensure 
that post-secondary education is still accessible. This tuition 
freeze will ensure tuition fees of B.C. are among the lowest in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other provinces such as Ontario tuition fees have increased 
by 20% in recent years and enrolment has declined.  But B.C. has 
increased funding to post-secondary education despite the massive 
cutbacks by the federal government, a 20% increase, $39 million 
for this year alone. Even today in British Columbia the 
government announced that it is removing tuition fees completely 
for adult basic education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to set the record straight and call on the government to 
issue an apology to the B.C. government in alleging and charging 
that tuition fees in B.C. are skyrocketing.  That is the case 
elsewhere in Canada as a result of the gutting of funds from 
post-secondary education and that is something that is of huge 
concern to all of us, particularly to students who are facing a 
massive debtload. 
Let us get the facts straight here.  I would like to see in the 
government response today and in future responses government

show that same kind of leadership across the country by 
instituting a national freeze on tuition fees and instituting a 
national program of grants for students in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, at the outset it is 
important to recognize some of the key indicators relating to 
post-secondary education as outlined in the 1997 education at a 
glance report prepared by the Organization for Economic 
Co-operation and Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's expenditure on post-secondary education as a percentage 
of gross domestic product was 2.6% in 1994, the highest among the 
OECD member states.  Canada ranks second among the OECD countries 
in terms of post-secondary enrolment as a proportion of the 18 to 
21 age group.  Canada ranks third among the OECD countries in 
terms of graduates at the bachelor or equivalent level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been said before, all government have a continued 
responsibility to ensure that students have access to 
post-secondary education. Clearly the Government of Canada has a 
long history of helping students access post-secondary education 
and other learning opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since its inception in 1964, the Canada student loans program 
has helped more than three million students access post-secondary 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada has been offering grants to students 
across Canada for many years, including those awarded by three 
research granting councils, the Medical Research Council, the 
Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council and the Natural 
Sciences and Engineering Research Council.  By funding these 
councils the Government of Canada supports advanced research for 
graduate students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada opportunities strategy announced in the recent budget 
further confirms the government's commitment to helping Canadians 
access learning opportunities and participate in the knowledge 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada millennium scholarships fund will award over 100,000 
scholarships to post-secondary students each year. Canada study 
grants will provide up to $3,000 a year and will help 25,000 to 
50,000 needy students with children or other dependants. Canadian 
education savings grants will help families save for their 
children's education through registered education savings plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also announced— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am sorry, but I 
must interrupt.  The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to 
have been adopted. Accordingly, this House stands adjourned until 
tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
