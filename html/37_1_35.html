<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA FOUNDATION FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT TECHNOLOGY ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK6">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House proceeded to the consideration of Bill C-4, an act to 
establish a foundation to fund sustainable development 
technology, as reported (with amendment) from the committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK7"></A></P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>SPEAKER'S RULING 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK8"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  This is the ruling concerning the 
groups at report stage of Bill C-4, an act to establish a 
foundation to fund sustainable development technology. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are 12 motions on the notice paper relating to the report 
stage of Bill C-4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned in my statement of March 21, the Chair does not 
intend to provide justification for the selection of amendments, 
or reasons for the non-selection of amendments, except where this 
is deemed necessary or appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since this is the first report stage ruling since my statement, 
I feel that it would be appropriate to briefly outline my 
approach to this bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, Northern 
Development and Natural Resources considered this bill at clause 
by clause on March 15.  This was prior to the statement that I 
made in the House outlining the guidelines that I will be 
following for the selection of motions at report stage.  Since 
members could not have known about the new application of these 
guidelines at that time, I intend to be more generous in 
exercising my discretionary powers of selection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore motions which could have been proposed in committee 
stage but were not will be entertained on this occasion. However, 
in keeping with the note to Standing Order 76.1(5), motions which 
were defeated in committee will not be entertained once again at 
report stage.  Consequently five of the motions submitted by the 
hon. member for South Shore at report stage, namely Motions Nos. 
2, 5, 7, 11 and 12, will not be selected for debate because they 
were defeated in committee. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seven motions will be selected for debate in three separate 
groups.  The voting patterns for the motions within each group 
are available at the Table.  The Chair will remind the House of 
each pattern at the time of voting.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. An 
agreement could not be reached under the provisions of Standing 
Orders 78(1) and 78(2) with respect to the second reading of Bill 
C-7, an act in respect of criminal justice for young persons and 
to amend and repeal other acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, under the provisions of Standing Order 78(3), I give 
notice that a minister of the crown will propose at the next 
sitting a motion to allot a specific number of days or hours for 
the consideration and disposal of proceedings at the said stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  Could you clarify what the government House leader just 
said?  Did he just put closure on the House?

</UL></UL>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my colleague, the 
member for South Shore, who has been very instrumental in the 
clause by clause consideration of this piece of legislation, Bill 
C-4, in committee.  The member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, and I on his behalf, put forward 
an amendment that did not go to the committee.  I thank the 
Speaker for his ruling that the amendment should, and well could 
be, placed on the floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I indicated earlier this morning to the Minister of Natural 
Resources, there are some good amendments that come forward from 
the opposition side, and this is one of those amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for South Shore has indicated, there should be a 
detailed statement of eligible projects for which funding was 
provided.  This speaks to the issue of the funding that has been 
put forward in the legislation.  It has a tendency not to allow 
projects to have a closed portion of the funding.  Also, there is 
a section which speaks to access to information where there 
should be transparency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have talked quite frequently in the House about the openness 
and transparency of the government.  Certainly the foundation 
being proposed under the legislation should also fall under the 
rules where there should be openness.  Public money will be 
expended and certainly those funds should be identified by the 
projects themselves and come back so that members of parliament 
recognize exactly how the funds are expended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I put Motion No. 10 forward on behalf of my colleague.  I 
suspect the government will look very seriously at passing the 
amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK19"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, on the first group of motions, Motions Nos. 1 and 10, we 
would support Motion No. 10 and reject Motion No. 1.  Motion No. 
1 in the name of the Bloc member just adds further confusion and 
vagueness to the whole bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent of the bill and what it hopes to achieve are 
certainly honourable, and our party wanted very much to support 
the bill.  However when we look at the bill and analyse it, it is 
so vague that it appears deliberately designed to allow huge 
discretion in not only the criteria of the projects, but also the 
people who receive funding to undertake the projects.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The criteria that apply to those people is wide open.  There 
does not seem to be any kind of criteria.  As the auditor general 
noted in his last report to the House, there are serious 
deficiencies in the quality of government appointments to some of 
the boards and a lack of expertise.  The bill is very vague and 
loose on who might qualify as a member of the foundation, a 
member of the board or the chair of the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill needs tightening up and cleaning up.  One example of 
that need is the fact that the minister and the government have 
amended the bill four or five times in committee and now in the 
report stage.  That is quite extraordinary.  The minister 
presents a bill to the House and then, before the bill even 
finishes the process, sees flaws and amends the bill in a number 
of areas.  It is very loosely worded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will return to Motion No. 1.  I have huge problems with the 
idea of the Bloc including the provincial environment minister in 
establishing criteria for the project or group to be funded.  We 
would have a piece of legislation with different criteria in all 
10 provinces.  I cannot see how that could possibly work.  If 
there is one thing we need here it is more clarity and 
consistency, not less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I think Motion No. 10 is perfectly valid.  In an effort 
to tighten up the bill, at least to some degree, we in the 
Progressive Conservative Party ask that the eligibility criteria 
be included.  Then we could all assess it here in the House, have 
a look at it and make amendments and recommendations on how the 
criteria could be better applied.  I think that is a perfectly 
valid suggestion.  We certainly will support Motion No. 10. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will speak further on the other groups as we get to them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Serge Cardin (Sherbrooke, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first off, let 
us say that Bill C-4 provides for the establishment of a 
foundation, so we should oppose it right from the start. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should we oppose it?  Because the Bloc Quebecois has certain 
concerns about the creation of foundations.  We have already had 
experience with the millennium scholarships foundation, which 
involves an area under the jurisdiction of a province, Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously the points of concern and the Bloc's position relate 
primarily to the division of jurisdictions.  Quebec already has 
foundations for environmental action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The matter of concentration of power in a foundation is also of 
some concern.  There will be an opportunity to develop this a 
little more later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The definition of the expressions is also another matter.  The 
bill refers to “eligible project” and “criteria of eligibility”. 
There was a national issue table on the environment and there are fairly 
substantial inequalities in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As concerns Motion No. 1, subclause 18(1) talks of meeting the 
eligibility criteria it sets out.  As I was saying 
earlier, subclause 18(1) is not necessarily very clear about work 
or criteria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though the government's intentions in establishing a 
foundation are noble, Quebec already has foundations for the 
environment, so it is understandable that our intention is 
to avoid a duplication of efforts. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1025"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to the environment intentions are always noble, 
but we wonder about the process. Right now we can see that 
there will again be duplication. We have no details on eligible 
projects and on criteria of eligibility.  At this point we 
are still in the dark, which means that there will certainly be 
an abuse of power, given the provisions of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all intents and purposes, the Prime Minister will appoint 
seven members to the foundation who in turn will appoint eight 
other members. The Prime Minister will again be able to appoint 
people. As the auditor general often pointed out in his reports 
and recommendations, those appointed to various foundations and 
organizations should first have the required qualifications, 
instead of being close friends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at Motion No. 6, which deals with subclause 18(1). It 
proposes the following wording for that clause: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>18(1) The Foundation, the Governor in Council and a provincial 
minister responsible for the environment may, by unanimous 
consent, establish criteria of eligibility to be met by the 
eligible recipients who carry on or will carry on eligible 
projects primarily in the province of that minister. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was one of the first concerns that I expressed to the 
House: duplication and up to a point interference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Things should be clear. Even though the foundation's ultimate 
goal is a noble one, provincial foundations including those in 
Quebec also have major environmental concerns. In order to 
avoid duplication it is obvious that ideally the provinces 
should have the right to opt out with full compensation so that 
they can decide on fundamental measures regarding the 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submitted a number of motions to the committee in that regard. 
Some members of the committee told me that such changes would be 
too substantial. These changes would not have substantially 
affected the noble objectives relating to the environment. 
However, from an operational point of view, these changes were 
obviously major ones. The changes proposed in the amendments did 
respect jurisdictions and sought to avoid duplication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a government reaches the point where it collects way too 
much tax, given its mandates and responsibilities it always 
ends up intruding on something.  The foundations are a prime 
example of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the bill the government is prepared to invest over $110 
million. Again, this is not enough. At one point during the 
consultation process it was said that an investment of close to 
$1.3 billion was required for new technologies and sustainable 
development so as to fight greenhouse gases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe, therefore, that the amendment contained in Motion 
No. 6 concerning subclause 18(1) is relevant, helps respect 
jurisdictions, and will enable us to prevent duplication so that 
the priorities of the provinces and of Quebec will be better 
served.  The foundation's objectives, I repeat and will continue 
to repeat, are noble ones.  There is money available, but people 
are already working hard in these areas.  They have the expertise 
and the know-how to identify their priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously we agree with the motions in Group No. 1, that is 
Motions Nos. 1, 6 and 10.  Motion No. 10 moved by the member for 
South Shore also meets with our approval because during a 
meeting of the committee we moved a similar motion telling the 
government that the foundation would have to put in place 
screening mechanisms. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1030"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the federal government puts large amounts into 
intentions—obviously there is even applied research—and only into 
intentions, there is a strong risk that money will be spent in 
sectors or on studies that will go nowhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is needed is some screening within the foundation with 
respect to eligible projects, criteria and results.  It goes 
without saying that this is important and we also support this 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois will oppose the establishment of this 
foundation because it does not respect jurisdictions. It does 
not prevent duplication and it perhaps does not 
respect other priorities. 
It is very vague in terms of eligible projects and criteria, 
with the result that directions are not clear.  In addition, 
people will be appointed to this foundation who 
also do not know what direction they will head in, but who will 
know very soon when the Prime Minister has had a word with 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will therefore be supporting Motions Nos. 1, 6 and 10.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the debate today on 
behalf of the people of Surrey Central to debate, at report 
stage, Bill C-4, an act to establish a foundation to fund 
sustainable development technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just to remind members, as well as the people who are watching 
the debate today, in the 2000 federal budget the Liberals 
announced that they would be creating a sustainable development 
technology fund and that they had earmarked $100 million in 
initial funding to the sustainable development technology fund. 
It was a very good initiative that should have been taken a long 
time ago, but they took eight or nine years to implement their 
own red book one promise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of those who are watching, 10 amendments have 
been put forward at report stage.  They are grouped into three 
different groups.  In the first group we are debating Motions 
Nos. 1, 6 and 10. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the Canadian Alliance support the intent of Bill C-4 
but we have a few reservations and some amendments to suggest 
dealing with the non-involvement of the auditor general in the 
whole process.  We are also concerned with the patronage 
appointments to the board of directors.  We feel that the 
government is using this bill for patronage appointments of 
failed candidates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to Motions Nos. 1, 6 and 10, Motions Nos. 1 and 6 
are very similar in nature.  They would bring provincial 
ministers of environment into all discussions regarding the 
criteria of eligibility for receiving funds.  Being so, it would 
introduce different criteria of acceptance into every province, 
The 10 different provinces may have 10 different criteria, that 
is the potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill desperately needs uniformity. It is so poorly worded 
and poorly drafted that even the minister has had to put forward 
amendments at this late stage in the debate.  We believe that the 
uniformity, which is desperately needed in the bill, may be lost 
when different criteria for funding are applied to different 
provinces and territories.  By allowing these amendments to pass, 
it would make already cumbersome legislation much more clumsy and 
difficult to deliver. Therefore, the Canadian Alliance will be 
voting against Motions Nos. 1 and 6.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be supporting Motion No. 10, which was moved by the 
Progressive Conservative Party member, because it attempts to 
curtail some of the vagueness in the bill by including the 
eligibility criteria for receiving funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the people of Surrey Central, I will be pleased to 
support Motion No. 10 and oppose Motions No. 1 and 6.  I will 
keep the rest of my comments in reserve until the bill comes back 
to the House for third reading. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK22"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to Bill C-4 this morning. This bill seeks to 
establish a foundation to fund technological support for 
sustainable environment. We are currently at report stage and we 
are debating Motions Nos. 1, 6 and 10. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before telling the House how the government should have dealt 
with these amendments, let me say that sustainable development 
is an issue about which I care a great deal. It is important to 
provide sound development and a sound environment, for ourselves 
and for future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we must recognize that the federal government is 
putting this priority behind its visibility. The bill creates 
new duplication and intrudes on provincial jurisdictions. This 
will have a negative impact on the protection of the environment 
and on sustainable development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, the federal government is opting for confrontation 
instead of co-operation with the provinces. Unfortunately, this 
cavalier attitude has become a trademark of the Liberals. The 
creation of the foundation is yet another example, after the 
millennium scholarships and the legislation on endangered 
species. Do not get me wrong: I support sustainable development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am objecting to today is this unacceptable duplication by 
the federal government. Let us take the case of the endangered 
species. We all know that habitat protection is a provincial 
jurisdiction. 
The Minister of the Environment has introduced a bill, now in 
committee, that protects habitats but not species on federal 
crown lands. There is an inconsistency here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Someone suggested this analogy earlier.  The federal government 
is behaving like a parent who tells his neighbour how to raise 
his kids but is incapable of parenting his own properly.  It is 
not surprising that groups such as the Sierra Club have given 
the federal government a failing grade as far as environmental 
protection is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, the federal government is only concerned about 
visibility, not about funding sustainable development 
technology.  This dear government is so proud of waving its 
beautiful red and white flag in every part of the country but 
what it is really involved in is nation building, desperately 
trying to create a Canadian identity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To take another example of development, this time one related to 
the economic development of the regions of Quebec, at the 
present time the federal government is financing the CFDCs, the 
Community Futures Development Corporations, to the tune of more 
than $100 million yearly.  Yet the government of Quebec already 
has regional development mechanisms of its own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there are the CLDs.  Instead of following the Quebec trend 
of allowing considerable leeway for concerted efforts at the 
regional level, the federal government is focusing everything on 
the centre, that is Ottawa, while disguising this operation by a 
series of initiatives targeting specific groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most indecent thing is that the federal government imposes 
criteria of visibility in its contracts. 
Of the four economic development agencies in Canada, only the 
one for Quebec is under the responsibility of the Minister of 
National Revenue. It requires the Canadian flag to be raised 
in exchange for funding.  This is what makes me say that the 
federal government is more concerned with its visibility than 
with regional development and the examples of this keep on 
increasing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that the funds allocated to the foundation 
responsible for funding sustainable development will be tied to 
the same mandate: acting as a foil to the foundation that already 
exists in Quebec.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out that the Quebec Fonds d'action pour le développement 
durable has a budget of $45 million to integrate and promote 
sustainable development and establish ecological infrastructures 
and biodiversity, that it is experimenting with technology which 
has an environmental impact, and that it provides fellowships and 
internships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having seen the success of the Quebec model, the federal 
government is trying to duplicate it from scratch at the federal 
level.  If the Liberals were really serious in their desire to 
promote sustainable development, they would have acted together 
with Quebec. 
But no.  Once again the story is confrontation, as in the case 
of the millennium scholarships.  Instead of creating a 
foundation the federal government should send money to the 
provincial organizations working toward the same goal as 
foreseen at the issue table and having the expertise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members of this foundation would practically all be 
appointed by the governor in council.  The bill provides that 
the governor in council, on the recommendation by the minister, 
shall appoint 7 of the 15 directors of the foundation.  However, 
the other eight are appointed by them, by those appointed by the 
governor in council.  How ridiculous.  Finally, the chairperson 
and all the directors can be removed for cause by the governor 
in council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This method of appointment seems to be a roundabout way for the 
federal government to hang on to the reins in an area of 
provincial jurisdiction and to maintain control over an 
organization that would not be accountable to parliament.  As I 
said earlier, I am in no way opposed to sustainable development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the very able member for Sherbrooke, the Bloc Quebecois 
is moving various amendments, the purpose of which is to improve 
the bill and to allow the Quebec fund to continue to operate 
independently of the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking that those provinces that so request, or Quebec 
anyway, should be able to opt out with full compensation, i.e. 
25% of the fund, so as to prevent amounts being paid to an 
eligible recipient when a similar project already exists in the 
province concerned. 
In this case, the amount should go to the already existing 
projects, first, if the province concerned so requests and, 
second, if it justifies its need for additional funding in terms 
of objectives set at the beginning of the project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, through the voice of our very able colleague, the 
member for Sherbrooke, we wish to include a clause requiring 
that the members and directors of the Canadian foundation be 
bilingual and, finally, that documents produced by the 
organization be accessible in both French and English. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will stop here.  The bill, as drafted, does not require the 
organization to be bilingual, which is unacceptable.  We all 
know that the Liberals are completely incapable of ensuring the 
survival of French outside Quebec.  Furthermore, the official 
languages commissioner observes year after year that the 
Liberals are not taking corrective action. 
They have a wonderful opportunity here to do something about 
this state of affairs by supporting our amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, I will conclude by saying that, through this bill, the 
government is trying to raise its visibility in exchange for 
protecting the environment.  All the federal government is doing 
is hurting Canadians:  millennium scholarships, regional 
development.  Once again, it has failed, as it did so 
monumentally in the case of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ralph Goodale (Minister of Natural Resources and 
Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to take part in this detailed 
discussion about some of the aspects of Bill C-4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that when the bill was debated at second reading and, for 
the most part, when the bill was before the committee, there was 
a great deal of positive commentary, not only from government 
members but also from members of the opposition, about what the 
legislation is intending to accomplish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While some of the remarks made today have been critical and 
some, quite frankly, entirely off the mark, there has been, at 
least with most members, an undertone of support for what is 
being attempted here, the objectives of the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically, with respect to Motions No. 1, 6, and 10 that we 
now have before us, Motions No. 1 and 6 are an effort to identify 
in the internal operations of the proposed fund and foundation a 
specific role for provincial ministers of the environment.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite frankly, I tend to agree with the remarks made by members 
of the Canadian Alliance and for the Conservative Party that such 
a technique would lend itself to the possibility of 
fragmentation, to potential confusion and perhaps even 
inconsistency as to what the foundation is attempting to 
accomplish.  Therefore, I do not support Motions Nos. 1 and 6. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there are other reasons why I would not recommend 
Motions Nos. 1 and 6 to the House.  First, this legislation is 
based upon more than two years of the most open, transparent and 
comprehensive consultation that has probably been undertaken with 
respect to any legislation.  The provinces were thoroughly 
involved in that process, the municipalities were involved, the 
private sector was involved, academic institutions were involved 
and non-governmental organizations were involved.  Every aspect 
of Canadian life was consulted in that two year process and the 
sustainable development technology foundation is the product of 
that process in which all of those players participated.  The 
consultation was very thorough and included all of the provinces 
as well as Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we announced the Canadian action plan with respect to 
climate change last fall, which included the concept of the 
sustainable development technology fund and foundation, the 
Minister of the Environment and I immediately took that concept 
to a joint meeting of ministers of energy and the environment 
that involved all of our colleagues, federally, provincially and 
territorially.  At that meeting where all of this was discussed, 
the chair, who was the minister from the province of Quebec, was 
exceedingly supportive of what was being proposed in relation to 
our action plan and all of the other various elements of the 
approach that we are taking with respect to climate change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I can say with full confidence that the provinces 
have been engaged with respect to this process and have been very 
supportive with respect to the concept of a sustainable 
development technology fund and foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also add that the process of consultation is not yet 
over.  We have established a national implementation strategy. 
We have established a process of rolling three year business 
plans to continue the work with respect to all of the initiatives 
we would undertake with respect to climate change so the provinces 
and all other stakeholders would have further ample, ongoing 
opportunities to have input and be a part of this whole process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, again I would say, based on that consultation which 
has taken place, based on the fact that consultations will 
continue through the national implementation strategy process, 
based on the need for national consistency, which I mentioned at 
the outset, and based on the very practical fact that this is a 
foundation at arm's length from government, meaning not only the 
Government of Canada but the governments of the provinces too, it 
seems to me that Motions Nos. 1 and 6 should not be accepted by 
the House and that the structure that has been described in the 
legislation itself should be proceeded with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Motion No. 10, I would simply make the point that the gist of 
the motion is already covered in the legislation itself.  In 
other words, Motion No. 10 is redundant.  Bill C-4 requires 
annual reporting on the foundation's activities.  That reporting 
must include, among other things: the foundation's audited 
financial statements; detailed statements on the foundation's 
investment portfolio and its funding activities; a statement of 
the foundation's plans for fulfilling the objectives of the fund 
for future years; and an evaluation of the overall results 
achieved by the funding of projects year by year and 
accumulatively since the very start of the foundation.

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we read what is actually proposed in Motion No. 10 with a 
proposed change to clause 30(1)(c), it seems to me that in the 
language of the legislation every point that has been suggested 
and the amendment is already covered in the bill itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reporting that would be required of the foundation would be 
made public.  It would be tabled in parliament so that members of 
parliament would have access to it.  If members wished to discuss 
that report in detail before any standing committee of the House, 
they would be at liberty to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The funding agreement that is contemplated by this legislation 
would spell out the requirements of the annual report in detail. 
In addition, the funding agreement would call for an independent 
interim and final evaluation to ascertain the results that are 
achieved, including measurable results against the funds' 
objectives and, of course, the funding agreement would be 
available to the auditor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply make the point that while I understand what the 
Conservative amendment is trying to accomplish, all of the things 
that are contemplated in the amendment are already embedded in 
the legislation itself.  Therefore, the proposed amendment is 
redundant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all of those reasons, I would recommend to members of the 
House that Motion Nos. 1, 6 and 10 should be defeated because 
they do not add anything that is material or new in terms of this 
legislation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK24"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in rising to speak about the motions that are before the 
House, I would like to reflect upon the entire bill and the new 
crown corporation that would be created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I see equivalent to a crown corporation is an entire new 
bureaucracy.  The minister said it was not a crown corporation. 
It would be an entirely new bureaucracy that would need telephone 
lines, fax machines, computers, offices, furniture, expense 
accounts and all sorts of reports.  It would be a huge new 
bureaucracy that would cost an enormous amount of money for 
taxpayers when the government already has in existence literally 
hundreds of organizations that could spend money on grants to 
deal with the issues which the bill deals with.  It is a waste of 
taxpayer money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be worse if Motions Nos. 1 and 6 passed because then it 
would involve provincial governments.  They also would need extra 
staff, extra phone lines, extra fax machines and all the other 
stuff to make it work.   The universities, other crown 
corporations and government departments have plenty of staff, 
many of whom are probably working on the types of projects that 
the bill would facilitate.  There is no need to create an entire 
new bureaucracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Government of Canada was a corporation, the first thing 
management would be asked to do, if someone came with a request 
for this type of project, would be to look at the overall budget 
of the corporation and the aims of the corporation to see whether 
the project could be carried out using existing staff and 
facilities.  That is exactly what we should have done instead of 
creating a whole new bureaucracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, if there was no way of doing it without setting up a new 
department within the corporation, the management would be asked 
to see if it could get rid of something else that had served out 
its useful time.  Do we see a single facility disappearing?  Do 
we see a single dollar being cut from the government 
expenditures?  Not one dollar is disappearing.  All that we see 
is another bureaucracy, another kingdom to be built that year 
after year will ask for more and more money from the taxpayers' 
purse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we doing it?  For no other reason than we can because it 
is other people's money.  We do not have to ask anybody.  The 
minister can go ahead, ram it through, set up the new bureaucracy 
and, despite his assurances earlier, I have absolutely no doubt 
nor would my constituents that there will be a ton of patronage 
appointments for that new bureaucracy.  You can bet your bippy on 
that, Mr. Speaker.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no confidence whatsoever that this new bureaucracy will 
achieve the aims that it is set out to do.  It will turn out like 
the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, a totally 
unaccountable body that blows away $120 million a year with 
nobody able to obtain information about what it does and with no 
accountability.  For years I tried to get information about 
specific grants that were given out by SSHRC.  It is absolutely 
hopeless.  I cannot get past the bureaucratic walls that are 
there to find out why it is wasting money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The council gave away $2,267,350 for someone to work on the 
history of the book in Canada.  Do members think they can find 
anything that was produced for that $2,267,000?  It was a 
complete waste of taxpayers' dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How about the $62,000 for an investigation of the motivations 
underlying undergraduates alcohol consumption behaviour?  How 
about the $50,900 for cabarets, nightclubs and burlesque, 
investigating the subculture of erotic entertainment in post war 
Vancouver? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there was even a slim chance that we could get information 
about the way this money is being spent, I would feel more 
confident about groups like the SSHRC and I would feel a little 
more confident that what would be created under the bill would 
actually produce something useful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at some other examples from the Social Sciences and 
Humanities Research Council.  There was $515,000 spent for the 
impact of race and gender on social cohesion in light of 
globalization.  There was $16,000 spent for an investigation of 
attacks on aristocratic behaviour in 18th century Britain.  What 
use could there be to the taxpayers of Canada to blow away 
$16,000 studying aristocratic behaviour and the attacks on it in 
Britain in the 18th century? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are small components of that $120 million that SSHRC blew 
away that could have better been used, even if it went to the 
roads in B.C.  In the House three weeks ago I asked why B.C. was 
been completely cut off highway funding for five years.  The $120 
million could have widened the Trans-Canada Highway in B.C. There 
was $20,000 spent for a study of the changing mode of 
reproduction among the resettled forages of Kedah, Malaysia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it any wonder that I get letters from my constituents 
complaining about the way this place blows away money? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said earlier in my speech that we do it for no other reason 
than we can.  If anybody in the House was asked to put in $10 or 
$20 to contribute to the $125,000 for the Tell Malada 
archeological project investigating the urban life in the 
semi-arid highlands of central Jordan, I bet nobody would put $10 
in there.  They would not be interested because it would be their 
own money.  That is the big danger of this bill.

Mr. Speaker, fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol effect, or 
FAS and FAE, are lifelong mental and physical defects that can 
occur in individuals whose mothers consume large amounts of 
alcohol during pregnancy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>FAS victims are physically and mentally challenged, as their 
brains fail to develop.  They often suffer from facial 
distortions, a short attention span and hyperactivity as well as 
spinal and internal organ abnormalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The effects of alcohol damage are not as apparent in the 
physical appearance and mental capacity of FAE victims, but the 
damage is apparent in their substantially lower capacity to 
engage in life skills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one can predict the frequency or severity of FAS and FAE in 
babies born to pregnant mothers who drink, yet one thing is 
certain.  If expectant mothers can refrain from drinking alcohol 
and their partners are supportive by also choosing to abstain, 
society can prevent the needless and permanent victimization of 
children due to the tragic indiscretions of their parents.

along that he could not let it come out that he had a personal 
financial stake in the Grand-Mère Golf Club and that he stood to 
become more wealthy by using his influence to pour millions of 
public dollars into increasing the value of a nearby hotel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now there is new evidence confirming that he had a direct 
conflict of interest in the way he used his high office.  How

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

only wrong.  In fact it is a terrible attempt to smear the Prime 
Minister, without any factual foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister did not stand to benefit financially from any 
representations he made.  He was owed a debt.  The value of the 
debt would not change whether the value of the golf course went 
up or whether it went down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to my hon. friend that she exemplifies how desperate she

clapping from the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's revelations explain why the Prime Minister did not dare 
go public with the documents about who really owned the golf 
course shares because the facts could not support his version of

it is to give the truth to Canadians and just deal with this

<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the public is obviously and definitely not applauding 
the Alliance for its unwarranted assertions.  The Alliance is not 
using these opportunities to talk about the economy.  It is not 
using them to talk about agriculture.  It is not using them to 
talk about the environment.  It is obviously because the public 
thinks we are doing a good job and it is a vote of confidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has been factual.  He has been truthful. 
Those who are asserting otherwise are terribly wrong, and they 
should admit it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Canadian

this from people they trusted, people they believed, and people, 
now it turns out, that were hiding and covering up a very serious 
situation where a prime minister was using his public office for 
his own personal financial gain, to feather his own nest in 
retirement.  Canadians need to hear the truth of this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking the Deputy Prime Minister and the Prime Minister to 
tell Canadians what really happened, to come clean with all the

<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has been upfront, factual and truthful.  He

</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member ought to recognize that.  She is using vague

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Canadian

facts.  One week ago today, Melissa Marcotte phoned me in my 
office, pleading on behalf of the Prime Minister and telling me 
her father had been the Prime Minister's best friend all his 
life. For the 37 years of her life she was like a daughter to the 
Prime Minister.  Today she is saying “I feel I have been made a 
fool of.  I work for a bank.  They may dismiss me”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the Deputy Prime Minister that we should be on the 
issue of the dollar but, first, should we not hire Ted Hughes as 
an independent judge to clear the air on this whole issue? 
<P><A NAME="LINK67"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the first thing the hon. member might do is to ask Ted 
Hughes to look into the unwarranted assertions in his questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has stated definitely from his seat in the 
House of Commons that he did not own the shares in question after 
he became Prime Minister.  Those are the facts.  When it comes to 
matters of the records of the company in question, he has no 
right because he is not a shareholder to have access to these 
records or any control over them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has been upfront and truthful.  I wish it 
could be said in the same way of the allegations of the Alliance 
Party and the member who has just spoken. 
<P><A NAME="LINK68"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Deputy Prime Minister was not 
listening.  I made no accusations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stated that Melissa Marcotte phoned me last Friday as a friend 
of the Prime Minister, as she put it, “to pull my leader off 
this case because it was unfair”.  Today she is saying “I feel 
I have been made a fool of”.  She also said “I was trying to 
clear him now and I cannot clear him and I do not want to be the 
one bringing him down”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are serious accusations from a 37 year close personal 
friend of the Prime Minister whose father was the Prime 
Minister's best friend.  It is time; Canadians have a right to 
get the clear issues.  Ted Hughes should be hired by the 
government as an independent judge, as he has lots of experience, 
to clear the air once and for all. 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister has cleared the air.  He stated the 
facts from his place in the House of Commons.  The problem is the 
fog that is being created by the Alliance Party in its desperate 
attempt to keep itself shored up in public opinion.  Where does 
it stand on the economy?  Where does it stand on the environment? 
Where does it stand on tax cuts? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>None of these things matter to members of that party any more. 
Why do they not get real on matters of concern to Canadians? They 
realize there is nothing they can attack because the government 
is doing a good job, and in desperation they are turning to these 
unwarranted insinuations and innuendoes.

oh what a tangled web the government weaves on this.  Does the 
Deputy Prime Minister not realize that it is the Prime Minister 
himself, by refusing to table all the relevant documents, by 
refusing to put all the facts on the table, who is holding up the 
business of this parliament and of this country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he wants to talk about the economy, agriculture, the 
environment, free trade and all the things that we want to talk 
about here and in fact have kept talking about, it is the Prime

inquiry we are asking for today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK79"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

has stated the facts from his place in the House of Commons. 
This has been confirmed by the ethics counsellor.  This has also 
been confirmed by the decision of the RCMP that there is no basis 
to look into the matter further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the opposition is not asking questions it thinks should be 
asked on the economy, on agriculture or on the environment, let 
it bear the blame itself.  Let it not throw the blame on anyone 
else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the responsibility of opposition members if they think 
they do not need to carry on the work of the country as the

allegations, counterallegations and lack of information that 
would decide the matter once and for all?  Unless the Prime

independent inquiry perhaps headed by Mr. Hughes or someone like 
him of equal stature, so that we can get on with the nation's

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

think the hon. member should only blame himself.  In trying to 
ask a question without basis, when it comes to bullets, he shot 
himself in the foot because there is no reason for an inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is holding up the business of the country and is using

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, first, the hon. member is raising something that is not 
news.  It was reported that the lawyer for the Prime Minister was 
involved in trying to get the debt in question settled that arose 
out of the shares being sold.  This was reported in the 
<I>National Post</I> on January 23, 1999.  I talked about this in 
the House in June 1999.  This is old news.  It has been reported. 
The hon. member is trying to develop something out of nothing and 
he ought to admit that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK84"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark (Calgary Centre, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is a clear and irrefutable conflict of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The conflict of interest code makes the Prime Minister the sole 
judge of his own conduct.  It is now clear that the Prime 
Minister was simultaneously involved in lobbying to secure a loan 
for the Auberge Grand-Mère and in negotiating the sale of shares 
in a adjacent golf course, the value of which could have been 
affected by these same loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the government believe that it is appropriate for the Prime 
Minister to be the only judge of his own conduct?   Would the 
Deputy Prime Minister, as a senior minister in the government, do 
his duty to parliament and to Canada and ask the Prime Minister 
to absent himself from these matters?  Would he take the 
leadership that is within his grasp and call a public inquiry 
under the Inquires Act—

been established.  What has happened in just the opposite.  A 
conflict of interest has not been established. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the hon. member is desperate to keep himself afloat 
politically, but he should not do that at the expense of the work

<P><A NAME="LINK87"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

I would report on whether the relevant official had inspected the 
books of the company in question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to confirm that the official in question attended at the 
office of the lawyers for the company in question.  He took

protect the Prime Minister.  What is really happening is that 
they are buying time when it should not take any time at all to 
put those documents on the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the Prime Minister has not been forthcoming with Canadians

in the areas of the environment, the economy, the work of the

</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think there is any basis for firing the ethics 
counsellor who, as I said in French, is a distinguished public 
servant of long standing and a person of integrity.  He is doing 
a good job.  Just because the hon. member does not want to accept 
that, it does not change the facts of the matter. 
<P><A NAME="LINK95"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the facts are that the ethics counsellor is doing a 
good job of trying to protect the Prime Minister, not his job as 
ethics counsellor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The industry minister stated that the name of the Prime Minister 
was not on the shareholder registry, but it is.  So much for 
trusting that minister.  We can no longer trust the words of the 
Prime Minister.  We can no longer trust the words of the 
industry minister nor of the ethics counsellor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the government call for an independent inquiry into 
the Grand-Mère mess? 
<P><A NAME="LINK96"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, there is no basis and no reason for an inquiry.  The 
facts have been brought out in the House of Commons by the Prime 
Minister himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the opposition parties did not think that the ethics 
counsellor was a person of integrity who would do his job, why 
did they write to him last fall?  Why did they write to him a few 
weeks ago to look into matters?  By writing to him last fall and 
by writing to him again just a few weeks ago, they are in effect 
admitting that they are wrong in trying to attack his integrity. 
They accepted his role up to the point where he refused to be 
their lap dog.  That is the only reason they are against him.

is under fire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The day before yesterday, the auditor general said that the

termed a mistake.  There was no mistake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Her statement about a cross burning incident and a letter in

was no letter from the mayor, there was no cross burning 
incident and, of course, it never happened in any city in British 
Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the secretary of state tell us why, in a callous attempt

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

a mistake and offered a total apology in that regard.  I do not 
see why the hon. member and the House should not accept her 
statement in the same way we accepted the statement of his

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Canadian

a well rehearsed question and answer.  She knew what she was 
going to say.  She named the city of Prince George.  She said 
that there was a letter from the mayor of Prince George.  The 
next day she said, in her hollow apology, that maybe it was not 
Prince George and maybe there was no cross burning, but she 
still maintained she had a letter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the government instruct the Secretary of State for 
Multiculturalism and the Status of Women to produce that letter 
to the House at the earliest possible date next week and to

has dealt with the matter in an appropriate fashion by admitting 
she made a mistake and apologizing for it.  When someone does 
this, the traditions and conventions of the House are that the 
admission of error and the apology are to be accepted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is not the case, then we should not be accepting what 
the Alliance member from Alberta said about his phony interviews. 
We have accepted that.  I think, in fairness, the Alliance

</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has led the effort to reach the consensus.  The 
minister met this week with lumber interests from B.C., from the 
maritimes and from Quebec.  He has met repeatedly with his 
counterparts at the provincial level.  The Minister for 
International Trade has been the leader in building the consensus 
in Canada that we are insisting on free trade in softwood lumber.

There remains a small group of elderly survivors that receive

to free trade in softwood lumber.  Yesterday the minister said we 
need a team Canada for softwood lumber.  This pro-free trade team 
needs a captain to unite and ignite the players.  When will the 
minister name this captain?

practices and policy, but it does not represent all U.S. 
interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the president of Louisiana-Pacific has said that 
the history and data suggest Canada would win a free trade 
challenge on the merits.  Canada also has major trade allies in

meeting with his provincial counterparts.  He knows full well 
that the minister this very week met with representatives of the 
lumber industry from all regions of Canada.

quote from the acting mayor of Prince George, which he alleges is 
an acceptance of the secretary of state's apology.

as soon as it can be translated, if such is the case.

experience as Speaker.  In the event that there was in fact no 
media source to provide that quote for the Deputy Prime

quote in the House, it being confirmed that it was in fact a 
fabrication in his briefing notes as opposed to an authentic 
quote? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Respectfully to the member for Prince

</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to 1992, concentrated liquid strychnine was available for 
purchase by farmers for use in the control of the Richardson's 
ground squirrel.  However, since 1992 Health Canada has 
restricted the sale of strychnine such that it is only available 
in a premixed form, with the amount of strychnine limited to .4%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The allowable limits for strychnine have greatly reduced the 
effectiveness of the poison, resulting in populations of the 
Richardson's ground squirrel increasing.  A great deal of crop 
and hay damage is caused by this ground squirrel.  It is very 
costly to farmers in lost productivity, equipment repairs and 
injury to livestock. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners are asking parliament to amend the relevant

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>AUBERGE GRAND-MÈRE 
</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The Chair has an application for an 
emergency debate and I take note that it is signed by 
representatives and actually House officers of each of the 
opposition parties, so I sense there is a tremendous amount of 
interest and seriousness to this question.  I will begin with the 
hon. member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough. 
<P><A NAME="LINK171"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 52, I have given notice 
to your office of our intention.  I speak of our intention 
collectively because, as you have noted, this letter to you is 
signed by myself as a representative of the Progressive 
Conservative Party and by the chief opposition whip, the deputy 
leader in the House for the Bloc Quebecois and the NDP House 
leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I submit to you that there is a very real and 
pressing need to have an emergency debate based on information 
that now is in the public realm.  This emergency debate would 
concern the apparent failure of the Prime Minister to inform the 
House of Commons fully concerning his relationship to loans given 
to the Auberge Grand-Mère hotel.  This information and this issue 
have paralyzed the House and shaken the confidence of Canadians 
in their government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge you, Mr. Speaker, to give the opportunity for all members 
of the House, including the Prime Minister himself, to come 
forward to take part in a full and open debate so that there 
would be commentary and confidence restored to government in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would urge you to accept this application for an emergency 
debate.  There is tremendous support for this application from 
members on the opposition side, and I suspect that there may be 
members on the government side who would support this 
application.  I respectfully submit to the Chair that it is very 
timely in its nature and, if necessary, we would be prepared to 
debate this matter immediately. 
<P><A NAME="LINK172"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will just stand for a couple of 
minutes and support my colleague from the Conservative Party in 
this request of all parties on this side for an emergency debate 
on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not too often I find myself in agreement with the Deputy 
Prime Minister, but he is talking about getting back to the 
business of this country and what is good for Canadians.  I think 
there is one way to do that, and that is a debate in the House 
today to get the government to realize the importance of having 
an independent inquiry into this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the case where I, as a member of parliament, am phoned 
by a long time friend of the Prime Minister.  It has never 
happened to me before.  She was lobbying on one side of this 
issue to ask me to get my leader to pull off the issue.  Today 
she is saying “I feel I have been made a fool of and I am afraid 
I am going to fired from my job for making this public”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an emergency.  It is time.  I know that I myself and the 
other members of the House would sit here all of tonight and into 
tomorrow if we have to, because this is important business for 
the country.  We have to get it over with and we have to impress 
that on the members from the government side.  It is time to 
debate the issue fully in the House and have an independent 
inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know how difficult this is.  I have been a Speaker myself and 
have listened to many petitions for emergency debates.  However, 
seldom did I see one where all the opposition parties were 
agreeing on the same issue no matter what their political 
backgrounds were. 
However, I think there is a desire on the part of all Canadians 
that we in this House get down to this issue and get it over 
with.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Bloc 
Quebecois supports the Progressive Conservative Party and the 
Canadian Alliance on the importance of having an emergency 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind hon. members that, by virtue of Standing Order 52(6)<I>a</I>), 
an emergency debate must meet the following conditions, one in 
particular which I will quote: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>a</I>) the matter [—] must relate to a genuine emergency [—] 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that today, in light of what we have learned—and the 
demonstration we have had for the past few months, not to say 
the past two years—there are indeed grounds for an emergency 
debate so that the Prime Minister may explain himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind hon. members that, to summarize the situation, the 
Prime Minister has misled the House.  He has misled the public, 
and that is serious.  He has taken refuge behind an ethics 
counsellor who, by his own admission, does not even have the 
ability to exonerate him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that there is a perceived conflict of interest, 
blindingly clear.  The Prime Minister must explain himself 
before the House, and this serious matter, which casts doubt on 
the very capacity of the Prime Minister to govern this country, 
must be debated and debated now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For your information, Mr. Speaker, I would like to quote briefly 
from the Marleau and Montpetit, page 589, regarding precedent in 
cases like this: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in one exceptional circumstance, an application was 
approved for an emergency debate on “the sudden and unexpected 
revelation of events which [had] taken place in the past, in 
that they might precipitate a course of conduct which, if 
allowed to continue unchecked, would certainly classify itself 
as an emergency and a matter of urgent consideration.” 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further on a specific case is cited: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This refers to revelations made by the Solicitor General in the 
House on October 28, 1977, concerning illegal actions committed 
by the national security forces of the RCMP in 1973.  This 
matter was referred to the McDonald Royal Commission and to the 
Attorney General of Quebec. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I am calling for support in this request 
so there will indeed be an emergency debate, given the urgency 
of the situation. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK174"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise in support of the request for an emergency debate with 
respect to what we have learned further today with respect to the 
whole controversy over the Prime Minister's relationship with the 
Grand-Mère Inn and the Grand-Mère golf course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me, Mr. Speaker, that what constitutes an argument 
for an emergency debate is whether or not an issue is of such 
importance, and whether or not the country and parliament is 
seized of it in such a way, that unless it is dealt with we 
cannot move on.  It is something that is so much on the minds of 
all members of parliament that unless we deal with it we cannot 
move on and deal with all the other issues that we have before 
us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the government's own admission, not just an opposition claim, 
we are now at that state of affairs that unless we have a proper 
clearing of the air with respect to this issue, unless we can 
hear in detail and at some length from the Prime Minister or from 
others who want to make his case and from others who have other 
claims to make, the House is basically in a state of paralysis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not something that I welcome, and I think the behaviour of 
my party over the last several weeks would justify me in saying 
so.  We would like to deal with other things, but the Prime 
Minister, by not being willing to produce documents and by not 
being willing to tell the whole story, has created a situation in 
which we now plead, first of all, with the Prime Minister, but in 
this context, with you, Mr. Speaker, to create a situation in 
which this matter can be dealt with.  Through your decision, Mr. 
Speaker, you can do what the government appears unwilling to do. 
It is not that we are asking you to do the government's work 
here, because that would be unfair and unjustified, and you would 
be right to refuse it.  We are asking you to do something for 
parliament and the country, to create an opportunity in which we 
no longer have to spend question period after question period 
trying to get this whole story out, but rather let us have a 
special emergency debate, let us have everything on the table and 
hopefully get this behind us.

with my colleagues in the House.  I would point out to the Chair 
that this matter has been a question in the House for over two 
years now and it is time to clear the air. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very serious when the head of state is under this kind of 
cloud, rightly or wrongly.  I believe we need an objective and 
trusted person from outside to investigate this.  If the House 
itself were to deal with this as a serious matter before our 
institutions and our people, that would be the responsible and 
proper thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two years is long enough.  We need to get to the bottom of this 
and clear it up.

believe what I am hearing today.  The opposition is creating an 
issue that, frankly, does not exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has had an opportunity to debate this issue for over two 
years now in question period.  It has had the opportunity to 
debate this issue during an election campaign.  It has had an 
opportunity to debate this issue on the Canadian Broadcasting 
Corporation station, as well as in the media.  It has been 
holding news conferences day in and day out.  It has had ample 
opportunity to bring the issue to the attention of the Canadian 
public.  It has had the chance every day between 2 o'clock and 3 
o'clock to debate this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I realize it was rather 
unconventional for me to recognize a member from the government

to rise today to take part in the request for an emergency 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For two years, two years, two years—I repeat it three times—we 
have been wasting our time in the House of Commons on problems 
created by the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once and for all, this must be cleared up so that we 
parliamentarians may come here and do our real work.  As the 
Deputy Prime Minister said, we should be here to do the work of 
the opposition and do specific things for the benefit of our 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I agree we should have an emergency debate in order 
to have done with it once and for all. 
If the Prime Minister has nothing to hide, let him table the 
documents in the House and let the thing rest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I hope I have expressed clearly and 
precisely the Chair's view of the request by the opposition 
parties for an emergency debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have listened to arguments from the members of each party and, 
if someone has something new to add, I am prepared to listen 
briefly.  However, with due respect for each intervention, I 
would ask for my colleague's co-operation in not simply repeating 
the arguments made to the Chair previously.

that I would like you to consider. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Wednesday we had a debate on reforming the standing orders 
of the House.  I believe it is very important to know that for 
the course of events we cannot as members have confidence in 
this institution if the Prime Minister himself is not prepared 
to answer a number of questions on matters relating to 
integrity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We assume he acted in good faith.  We would like nothing better 
than to believe that, but we will not have confidence in our 
role as  members if the Prime Minister does not make 
himself available to answer our questions.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA FOUNDATION FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT TECHNOLOGY ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK185">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of Bill C-4, an act to establish 
a foundation to fund sustainable development technology, as 
reported (with amendment) from the committee, and of the motions 
in group no.1. 
<P><A NAME="LINK186"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, prior to question period, I was getting excited about the 
perhaps waste of money that the government is proposing in 
setting up a whole new bureaucracy to administer money or hand 
out money that could easily be done through some other arm of the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would give an example to the minister if he would take the time to 
attend some of the bacon and egghead breakfasts which are put on 
by the Canada Council just about every month in this place.  If 
he had been in attendance at the one that was held last week, he 
could have a met a professor from the University of Victoria who 
is involved in environmental studies and is already studying the 
environment and ways to help reduce pollution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is totally unnecessary to set up a whole new organization to 
deal with this issue of environmental studies and technologies.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is completely ridiculous and it is an excuse to spend more 
money, make more patronage appointments and make the government 
even bigger.  It is, because there is a bit of a surplus of 
taxpayer money, an excuse to spend.  It is wrong to keep doing 
that when it is other people's money.  I gave some examples— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ralph Goodale:</B>  But he says he supports it in 
principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White:</B>  Madam Speaker, the minister interrupts to 
say that the critic supports the bill.  We support the idea that 
there needs to be technology development in conjunction with 
cleaning the environment.  Of course we support that aim, but the 
point I am making is that there are divisions within the 
government which can already do that without setting up another 
bureaucracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I worry about accountability.  The problem with setting up yet 
another bureaucracy is that there is hardly any accountability 
for the ones that are there.  I gave some examples from the 
Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council before question 
period began.  There are plenty of examples.  There is the 
$38,600 for history and aesthetics of television medical dramas 
in North America.  That is enough to make anyone sick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with the government is that there simply is no 
accountability.  Committees have difficulty getting information 
about the way the government spends money.  The Auditor General 
of Canada has accused the government of moving money around in 
the books in a way that makes it difficult to determine exactly 
what is going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The project that is taking place under the bill is just another 
excuse to expand the government.  It should not be necessary.  It 
should not be done when we can handle the project easily within 
other arms of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize the government is past the point of no return and will 
probably not withdraw the bill.  In fact, I heard the minister 
say yes.  The problem with this place is it would not matter if 
300 MPs said it could be done more easily or more efficiently in 
some other arm of government.  Because he is in charge, he will 
ram it through anyway and to Hades with the fact that it will 
cost taxpayers more money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close by saying that since we are debating motions for 
amendments to the bill, I disagree with the motion put forward by 
the Bloc because it would simply add to the bureaucracy by 
involving the provincial governments.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is with pleasure that I rise in the House today to 
speak to Bill C-4. I support the remarks made by my colleague, 
the member for Sherbrooke, who is a member of the Standing 
Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, Northern Development and 
Natural Resources, and who reported what he heard to us. We 
could almost say that he reported what he did not hear since, 
except for the minister and departmental officials, there were 
no other witnesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Natural Resources told us before oral question 
period that there would be a consultation process. I would 
like to know if the bill is so perfect why there is a 
need for further consultation once it is passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not make any sense. Usually, when the government wants 
to introduce a bill, there is a consultation process which 
often takes place at the committee stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something else, something important. If the government 
really thought this bill was important, we know it would have 
passed it a long time ago. We also know that this bill replaces 
a bill—I think it was Bill C-46—that was introduced in the 
previous parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I deplore the fact that once again the government is bringing 
back a bill that died on the order paper. Why did we have an 
election last fall? I know what it did to me. I was about to 
introduce a private member's bill that could have been passed 
and implemented before the election, but the Prime Minister 
decided to call an election before I had a chance to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now this bill is coming back to us as Bill C-4 to do what? To 
establish a new foundation. We could say yet another one.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each time we in the Bloc Quebecois have questioned the 
relevancy of a new foundation. Generally speaking why is a new 
foundation needed? I took part in the debate on the Canadian 
Food Inspection Agency, another government agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us remind members about the millennium scholarships 
foundation. It was used by the federal government to interfere 
in provincial jurisdictions and hand out scholarships, and yet 
education is an exclusive provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have a new foundation to fund sustainable development and 
studies on new technologies. 
It is hard to be against a definition of sustainable development 
like the one we have in this bill, because it states the 
obvious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill reads: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“sustainable development” means development that meets the needs 
of the present without compromising the ability of future 
generations to meet their own needs. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am told that the budget of the foundation will be about $110 
million. That is not very much for the kind of work it will have 
to do, which is almost the equivalent of the program of the 
whole government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going through a foundation is a different approach than the one 
the government normally uses, either through its departments or 
through agencies over which there is some control by cabinet, 
and therefore parliament, because we can ask the ministers 
questions in the House every day, ask questions and try to get 
answers to understand the way things are done, why money was 
spent, and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government tries to justify the creation of a new 
foundation, it tells us “It is important for this to be done by 
an organization operating at arm's length from the government”. 
At first glance, this looks interesting, particularly since we 
wonder sometimes, every day in fact, how certain departments 
operate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be great if everything were at arm's length, but we 
need only look at the nomination process. The chair is appointed 
by the governor in council, or the cabinet. 
Six members out of 15 are appointed by the cabinet and the 
others are chosen by the ones appointed by the cabinet. That is 
not very reassuring. Then the members choose the officials who 
will be in charge of operations. All this is done in a very 
independent fashion, far from the usual rules for hiring public 
servants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nobody is against sustainable development. Like all the other 
parties the Bloc Quebecois supports sustainable development. 
The provinces also support sustainable development. Quebec has 
created a foundation, a special fund to finance projects on new 
technologies that do not impact on the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everything should be clear and all levels of government should 
agree. 
According to information I got, the consultations dealt with 
sustainable development and the objects and purposes, but not 
with ways of proceeding, not with the structure. This is a new 
structure will operate at arm's length from the government 
but be controlled by the government, the cabinet, not by the 
department. We know who is the boss in the cabinet right 
now; it is the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is somewhat like the ethics counsellor appointed by the Prime 
Minister and responsible for watching over him. Here we have a 
process that turns itself around and could be fairly dangerous, 
even though it has noble objects.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec has had for several years a foundation dealing with 
the same kind of projects. It would be normal that the federal 
foundation operate in co-operation with the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not so sure, since admissibility criteria are not 
defined in the bill or their definition is so vague and so 
unclear that anything or nothing can be done at the same time, 
notably things that are already being done by provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the main reasons why I feel we cannot vote for this 
bill. 
The bill itself, even taking into account the motions put 
forward, raises so many questions that we cannot vote for it 
because the bill is really vague and unclear. On the contrary, 
legislation should be clear, applicable and applied.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to have an opportunity today to speak on the bill. 
However I am also disappointed because of everything that has 
happened in the House over the last number of weeks, and 
particularly today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is, without question, important that we invest in sustainable 
development projects.  I do not think there is any argument about 
that.  I have listened to numerous members speak today, and there 
is no argument that we need to invest in sustainability.  What 
there is, though, is a failure to have any faith in the 
government, the Prime Minister or any process that takes away the 
right of parliament to make decisions and puts that right in the 
hands of what is often referred to as an arm's length body. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I have come to realize that in Canada there are probably 
as many people who believe Elvis is still living as there are who 
have faith in the Prime Minister and the government.  I say that 
in all seriousness.  How can we have faith in the system anymore 
when we cannot clear the air on something as important as our 
Prime Minister being honest with us? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a time when we should be investing in sustainable 
development, we must wonder why they are setting up this body at 
arm's length.  Nobody believes it is arm's length anymore.  For 
all government appointments on every type of foundation or board 
or whatever it sets up, there is always a rubber arm reaching in 
from the Liberal Party or the Prime Minister's Office with 
control over it.  No one has faith any more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeared the other night on a CPAC show and I talked about how 
we can encourage more young people to become involved in the 
political process.  I made a comment that people must have faith 
in the system and believe the system works before they can become 
part of it and see positive change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although young people and many other people are not voting, they 
are involved in a political process.  However it is a protest 
process.  They are involved in things outside the realm of 
government.  They no longer have faith in the government to 
follow through with important changes that must happen in our 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As someone who has had faith in this democracy for a number of 
years, I have lost a lot of that faith since coming to 
parliament.  I said the other night I was optimistic that we 
would see positive change.  Parliament met and had discussions on 
democratic reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It now seems it was all just a wash and was not worth anything. 
Our Prime Minister is involved in a situation that has tainted 
the whole process, and he does not come clean. 
That is all that anybody is asking.  If the proof is there it 
should be put on the table so that we can get on with the 
business of the country.

little to-do.  Thank heavens it is not quite that bad, but we are 
getting there.  We are spending our time questioning the 
credibility of our government, and in particular our Prime 
Minister.  It is so disappointing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot help but wonder why we do not put the money to operate 
the board into the environment department.   Why do we have to 
set up another arm's length board, pay a board of directors of 
appointed people once again, giving the implication that it is 
only being set up there to have more money funnelled through 
Liberal patronage? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will have people involved in the sustainability industry, 
business and some NGOs.  However, as far as individual Canadians 
who have an interest or the representatives of those Canadians in 
parliament having any say over what will happen, it is not there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were recently talking about the Canadian Foundation for 
Innovation.  That is an excellent program.  Even with that there 
is a question on how the money would be distributed to different 
areas throughout the country.  Parliament does not have any way 
of saying that the way it is broken down has to be changed, so we 
have to fight that out now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no way that my party and I can support any foundation 
or board that will be at arm's length from parliament because 
that is the bottom line here.  It is not arm's length from the 
government because its rubber arm just reaches in, gives a little 
tug and says that this is what we will do.  Nobody in Canada 
believes any differently.  I do not believe for a second that the 
Liberals believe any differently any more.  Even they cannot 
ignore it any longer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have reached the point of no return.  If we do not clear the 
air, we will be unable to deal with any issues and we will be 
doing nothing for the democratic process in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intentions are very good, as are the intentions of 
parliamentarians.  However it will not work if we are operating 
under the type of rules the government is willing to accept as a 
credible process.  It is disappointing that we cannot support the 
sustainable development fund based on the fact that we can no 
longer count on the government to do what is right for Canada and 
what is right for our country in general.

report stage to Bill C-4, an act to establish a foundation to 
fund sustainable development technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the federal government wants to get involved in 
one area so that the concept of sustainable development can be 
applied in several areas of our society and so that we can 
gradually eliminate any development that does not take 
environmental issues into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all agree with this objective. 
I think we all want any future development to be sustainable and 
to comply with sustainability requirements. 
However this bill needs to be strengthened and expanded.  It 
requires some additional elements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first group of amendments deals exactly with that.  These 
amendments are designed to strengthen the rules for choosing the 
evaluation mechanisms and the criteria for the projects funded 
by the Canada foundation for sustainable development technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed structure of the foundation leaves ample room for 
laxity.  Members of the board of directors will be appointed in 
part by the government and those chosen by the government will 
then appoint the others. 
With such a structure, we could very well see projects being 
funded that do not necessarily meet the objectives of the 
foundation but rather those of the government's friends.  This 
needs to be clarified.

were accepted correctly.

from the government that the money would be spent appropriately. 
In fact, that is the main problem with this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill does not take into account the fact that a fund has 
already been created in Quebec for the same purpose and that it 
would have been much simpler to give the money to Quebec in 
order to increase the effectiveness of the Fonds québécois pour

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite surprising to note that the bill 
defines the concept of sustainable development but does not 
quite define the objectives of the approved projects.

projects will be denounced in the House as being absurd because 
they would not correspond to the objectives of a foundation such 
as the one considered for the sustainable development 
technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am therefore inviting the government to pay attention, to 
listen, to study and to analyze the amendments proposed in this 
first grouping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They will provide us with precise criteria for the awarding of 
contracts. We will have mechanisms for measuring completed 
projects to see whether their bottom line has changed society, 
ensured that the development was indeed sustainable, and saved 
us from situations such as we have seen in the past, for example 
the catastrophic groundfish strategy.  That is one development 
in which long term sustainable development was not taken into 
account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there are far more subtle points relating to the whole 
greenhouse gas issue. 
The foundation also needs to be looked at in terms of its 
objectives.  Will it give an equal opportunity to provinces that 
already have measures and programs in place to deal with the 
greenhouse gas issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that Quebec has already done its part, while other 
provinces have not.  There is often a connection with their 
energy production.  They might turn to this foundation for more 
funds.  This does not mean, however, that people in all parts of 
Canada ought not to be entitled to their share of the funds set 
aside.  I feel that the bill as it stands is too vague, too 
imprecise on these points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have sufficient guarantees that the effectiveness of 
the program will be assessed. 
That is why we want the criteria to be tightened up so as to 
ensure that by the time third reading is reached the bill will 
have integrated the amendments required to give it some teeth. 
It will then be possible, if ever the foundation made a poor 
choice of projects, for funding to be taken back and a warning 
issued to project managers to change their way of doing things 
and to make sure the money goes to the right places. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the appointment process, we really have no guarantee that 
three, five or ten years down the road the criteria will have 
been applied properly as far as sustainable development is 
concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, Bill C-4, an act to establish a foundation to fund 
sustainable development technology, is a good and desirable 
idea. However, it does not suit the Canadian situation because 
it does not respect provincial jurisdictions. It does not 
reflect the fact that Quebec is ahead because it already has its 
Fonds pour le développement durable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill must be amended and refined to include many more of the 
elements that would make it an effective tool to stimulate 
initiatives in sustainable development so that, 10 years from 
now, we can say that Canada has in fact made the shift to 
sustainable development and that the foundation responsible for 
this has reached its objectives by respecting the specific 
characteristics of each region of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These things are missing from the bill. 
This is why we find the bill unacceptable in its present form. 
We ask the government to support the first series of amendments 
we proposed. Others will follow.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I will begin by saying that the Alliance will not 
be supporting Motions Nos. 1 and 6 put forward by the Bloc 
Quebecois for the reasons outlined by my colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is worth repeating some of the difficulties that Motion No. 6 
would bring to the legislation.  It would bring provincial 
ministers of the environment into all the discussions regarding 
the criteria of eligibility and, in doing so, would introduce 
some different criteria of acceptance into every province.  The 
bill needs uniformity and this would be a hindrance to that 
particular aspect of this important legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to pass Motion No. 6, or Motion No. 1 which is 
similar, I think it would create more problems than the bill 
attempts to solve.  For that reason, we will not be supporting 
Motions Nos. 1 and 6. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 10, brought forward by my colleagues from the 
Conservative Party, is an attempt to curtail some of the 
vagueness of the bill by introducing some eligibility criteria. 
We are supportive of that idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the bill has been laid out and we are supportive 
of the intent of the bill.  We have some questions and ideas for 
improvement in terms of how to implement the bill.  We have some 
issues with some aspects of the bill that I believe are worth 
noting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to state that the Alliance is committed to protecting and 
preserving our natural environment and endangered species.  That 
is very clear within our policy and perspective.  We want to work 
together with members from all sides of the House and the 
government.  We commend them for moving forward on good 
initiatives that have to do with protecting our environment and 
enhancing sustainable development.  Those are good, broad and 
general notions to pursue which we support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from North Vancouver pointed out some rather 
glaring difficulties with the whole appointment process in terms 
of governor in council appointments, which is an aspect of this 
bill.  He highlighted, from his own experience, some wasteful 
instances of taxpayer dollars being spent in ways that perhaps 
could have been allocated to priority areas, such as health care, 
education, reducing taxes and those kinds of very important 
priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk a little bit about the appointment process that 
would be created by the bill.  I believe the chairperson along 
with a minority number of directors and members are appointed by 
the governor in council, who would then appoint the remaining 
members to complete the 15 person board of directors.  We do have 
some concerns that the foundation could become a possible 
patronage arm of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the government must appoint many people in many 
different arms of the government, related agencies and boards. We 
know that is a reality, but we would like to see a process that 
would have the most competent and trained individuals for 
positions like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen examples in other areas, not particularly this one 
area that has been brought forward, where appointments have been 
somewhat questionable.  We always raise the concern when the 
issue is brought up within any legislation that there needs to be 
a more transparent and accountable process in place for 
appointing individuals to government boards or to arms of the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One example, of which I am very well aware and which happened 
not too long ago, was the appointment of a former colleague of 
ours here in the House, Mr. Sekora, who was representing 
Coquitlam. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1300"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was appointed as a citizenship judge.  He made some rather 
outlandish remarks in the House which are documented in 
<I>Hansard</I>.  We are all well aware of them.  It showed 
insensitivity on the government's part to appoint an individual 
who demonstrated a lack of sensitivity on issues to do with 
immigration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even after the election he made comments that were rather 
derogatory to immigrants in his own community.  He was then 
appointed a citizenship judge.  His record seems quite contrary 
to the kind of individual one would appoint to a responsible 
position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The actions and past experience of that individual give us 
reason for concern.  We also see, through another piece of 
legislation, governor in council appointments where individuals 
appointed to boards are perhaps not the best selection in some 
cases.  That raises concerns for us, and obviously we have the 
same concern with this bill.  We encourage the government to, and 
hope it will, select individuals who are the best for the job in 
this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  We will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  I am glad to hear the minister say he 
will.  He is making the commitment in the House today to appoint 
qualified individuals to the board.  I thank him for that.  We 
hope that perhaps he can talk to the rest of his cabinet 
colleagues and impress upon them the importance of doing so 
within their areas and departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk a bit about an environmental issue in my own 
community.  There are several.  One has to do with protecting a 
very sensitive area known as the Cod Island wetlands.  It is in 
the Lower Fraser Valley in the area of Pitt Meadows and Pitt 
Poulder.  There are individuals who are working hard to find a 
community solution to the situation.  They are trying to bring 
people together to protect one of the most sensitive wetlands, 
and perhaps the only remaining sensitive wetland in the lower 
mainland in British Columbia, from being developed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the potential for that.  An individual who owns the 
land wants to turn it into cranberry bogs.  It is his land and he 
has the right to do so.  However there is also concern that it be 
preserved, and there are individual working on that.  I encourage 
the government to get involved as well, and to look at how it 
might help out.  I have written letters to the Minister of the 
Environment and the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans on the issue 
and I will continue to encourage them to find community based 
solutions to protect that very sensitive area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Alliance is concerned about the environment.  We are in many 
regards the party that wants to protect the environment.  Members 
from other parties want to protect it as well, and we commend 
them for their efforts.  We need to work together to find 
commonalities wherever we can in regard to the bill.  There is 
agreement on some motions.  We do not particularly support 
Motions Nos. 1 and 6, as I outlined.  However we do support 
Motion No. 10.  We will soon be debating other parts of the bill 
as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an important issue to talk about in the House.  Many have 
said it will be the most important issue within the next 
generation.  We need to protect our environment.  It will affect 
the future health and well-being of all citizens no matter which 
area, province or community they come from.  We must be 
concerned.  We must turn our concern into workable action so that 
we do the right thing together in a way that is not partisan.

do this in an open fashion, as has been done in the House today, 
and allow individuals to bring forward ideas and suggestions for 
amending legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our critic has been very involved for a long time with this 
issue and has ideas and suggestions on how to improve the bill. I 
am sure he has brought up his ideas at committee, and he will be 
bringing them up in the House.  We need to work together to make 
this a workable piece of legislation.

<P><A NAME="LINK191"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
always a bit flattered when you refer to me from the Speaker's 
chair as a membre, in French. I also know that the word refers 
to very different realities in French and in English. However, 
you can always count on me to stimulate the discussion, as far 
as I am allowed to do in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel a bit spoiled to be allowed to speak on this Friday, not 
only because the Secretary of State for Amateur Sport is 
listening to me but also because I am doing so under the 
watchful eye of the member for Sherbrooke, who has done an 
excellent job. 
I am sure that all my colleagues join me in paying tribute to 
him for the tremendous job he did in the committee to convey the 
concerns of the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am all the more confident because our former critic, the 
member for Jonquière, is close by and she is very 
knowledgeable about this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind the minister that if everybody in this 
House knows very well that there is a pink side to me, they 
should also know that there is a green side to me and that the 
Bloc Quebecois firmly believes in the need for governments to 
invest in sustainable development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not an easy issue, because I remember that at the 
beginning of the 1990s, when the secretary of State for Amateur 
Sport had not yet been elected to this House but was working 
very hard to get here, we discussed the main recommendations 
which were adopted by multilateral forums. Of course, the 
discussion dealt with the damage to be expected from climate 
change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we do not question the necessity for governments, 
the federal government as well as provincial governments, to 
invest in this area. However we have a few questions about the 
way the government intends to proceed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At first glance this bill appears to be a positive initiative, 
at least judging by its title, an act to establish a foundation 
to fund sustainable development technology. One would tend to 
see this as a rather positive initiative. 
However, if one takes a closer look at the bill, one finds that 
it raises some concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we should not forget that Canada has a national issue 
table made up of various organizations dealing with environment 
issues. These organizations, which are monitoring the issue of 
the environment with a truly admirable attentiveness, have said 
that a $5 million outlay is very little. In fact, in view of the 
studies and field projects required to yield real results in our 
communities, some $1.2 billion should be invested in the 
foundation. At the very least the foundation needs $500 
million for demonstration projects alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we read the last budget speech announcing the 
establishment of that foundation, we realize that the government 
has been rather parsimonious. For a government which claimed the 
environment as one of its priorities, we cannot say that the 
finance minister has really loosened the purse strings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am rather surprised and I sympathize with this natural 
resources minister who has been somewhat ostracized when it 
comes to budget matters. I know he would have loved to be able 
to make an announcement in this House about a $500 million 
investment. Unfortunately he will have to make do with a meagre 
$100 million in the next few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the second concern, we know how foundations can be a 
touchy subject. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1310"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT38"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT38"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1310

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The foundation in question will be composed of 14 members, seven 
of whom will be appointed directly by the government. Those 
members shall appoint the other seven members—eight with the 
chairperson—of the foundation. Co-optation is clearly in evidence 
here, but this process raises a number of concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why was it not possible, for example, for provinces to submit 
lists directly? If this government had been really serious about 
co-operative federalism, the submission of lists directly by the 
various environment departments or ministries—all provinces and 
territories have one—could have been allowed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a fairly common practice. I remember voicing the same 
criticism when the bill creating the National Tourism Commission 
was before the House. It is always the same. For the sake of 
transparency, the provinces should be involved in the 
appointment process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that the hard working member for Sherbrooke, 
who substantially increased his majority in the last general 
election, tabled an amendment essentially requesting that the 
various provincial environment ministers be involved in the 
process. I hope the government will seize the opportunity to set 
this straight, and to do for the environment what it did not do 
for the National Tourism Commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one of our concerns. We hope the government will be 
favourable to the Bloc's amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I nearly made a terrible blunder. I want to take this 
opportunity to wish all the best to my friend André Boisclair, 
the new minister of the environment as a result of the recent 
cabinet shuffle in Quebec City. He is one of the most talented 
members of the government. He is a rising star in Quebec 
politics. To the member for Gouin, with whom you might even have 
shared a common electorate, Madam Speaker, and who is well known 
for his talents, talents the Secretary of State for Amateur 
Sport might envy a little bit, I wish all the best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know how much our fellow citizens value the environment. 
Understandably so as the future of our society depends on the 
environment. 
There are the issues of recycling, sustainable development, 
climatic change, which must all be looked at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to digress a little to say that I hope the 
Secretary of State for Amateur Sport has a recycling box in 
front of his home. I know this program is available in all 
Montreal neighbourhoods. We know how important green 
neighbourhoods are. I would not understand if the Secretary of 
State for Amateur Sport would not be setting an example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This leads me to talk about the Quebec foundation which has been 
in existence for a number of years. I see the Minister of 
Natural Resources nodding. He will agree with me that this 
foundation has a $45 million endowment. The Quebec government 
maintains environmental know-how. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me remind the House that the Fonds d'action québécois pour 
le développement durable distributes its budget allowance 
between four major components, four major priorities. I would 
like the Minister of Natural Resources to carefully take note of 
these components. He will discover that it would be quite 
possible for him to transfer to this foundation the portion that 
should be allocated to Quebec. He could send it directly, move 
it through the Fondation québécoise pour le développement 
durable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first component deals with the integration and promotion of 
sustainable development, for which the Quebec government has set 
aside $19 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second component is related to the carrying out of 
ecological infrastructures and the enhancement of biodiversity, 
for which the Quebec government has set aside $15 million.

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third component is most important in my opinion, but I know 
there are mixed views on this. For me it is of the utmost 
importance. It is the issue of experimenting with 
environmentally sensitive technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally, if we want new ways of doing things, if we want 
Quebecers and Canadians to change the way they consume 
resources, if we really want to establish new practices which 
have no detrimental effect on natural resources, then obviously 
we have to experiment with new technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To do so, funding must be available to community agencies that 
will conduct new experiments, on environmentally related 
technologies for example, at a cost of $7 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see that my time is nearly up, so I will conclude by saying 
that although our party is pro-environment we believe that too 
many jurisdictions are involved. I ask the Minister of the 
Environment to support the amendments introduced by the member 
for Sherbrooke, for the Bloc Quebecois. 
<P><A NAME="LINK192"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Marcel Gagnon (Champlain, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, the subject 
being debated today involves two great passions I have had 
since I was very young and since I entered politics specifically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about the environment.  There is no doubt that 
the environment means our future.  There is no doubt that when 
we speak of the environment it is hard to oppose the bill, 
because it would appear to be opposing environmental protection 
when in my opinion we do not protect it enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is a case in point on the subject of democracy. I want 
to take what my colleague, the member for Churchill, said a 
little further. She said, “When I arrived in parliament, I had 
illusions.  I thought democracy reigned supreme in parliament. 
The further I go, the more I realize democracy is under threat”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My mentor in reflection in the area of democracy or politics is 
René Lévesque.  I had the opportunity to work with this great 
democrat, now recognized by one and all.  Mr. Lévesque said “If 
there is one political value worth sacrificing one's life for, 
it is the value of democracy”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I see how the government is wearing democracy away and not 
using democracy—because democracy, as we know, is perhaps one of 
the sole values that may be worn away and is lost when not 
used—each time it is threatened, I see René Lévesque and I feel I 
must react. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government's ever more closed administration is 
inexplicable and unforgivable.  We can see what it is doing in 
its closed circuit as well.  The only way it can enter an area 
of Quebec's jurisdiction is by creating foundations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it wants to duplicate what is being done in Quebec, it just 
establishes a foundation and goes ahead. If somebody objects, 
its answer is that it is just a foundation. However who is 
responsible for this foundation? To a large extent the Prime 
Minister is. A foundation obeys the Prime Minister and reports 
to him. It also gets its mandate from the Prime Minister, but 
the money still comes from the taxpayers. I take strong 
exception to this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the environment, for example, my colleague has 
just explained that the Quebec government is putting in a big 
effort and is doing a great job.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The day before yesterday in committee I asked the agriculture 
minister a question about what Quebec is trying to do to make 
agriculture and the environment more compatible, to improve 
agriculture so that agriculture and the environment can go hand 
in hand. The agriculture minister congratulated the Quebec 
government on its efforts concerning the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this democratic parliament has more money to spend on the 
environment, it should go through the normal channels and spend 
it through the Quebec government. It is already there and it is 
doing a good job on the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot even support the principle underlying this bill 
because it is not democratic. The purpose of foundations should 
not be to divert money from provinces and to duplicate 
provincial programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today is a very sad day for me and for my whole environment. I 
am the member for Champlain. My riding is located next to the 
riding of Saint-Maurice. The member for Saint-Maurice, my 
colleague in parliament, is the Prime Minister. Members 
know that we have been talking for months now about what 
occurred in the Prime Minister's riding and in the riding of 
Champlain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister argues that nothing wrong happened, but he 
should turn his words into action and prove that nothing wrong 
occurred. 
I am shocked to see that my neighbour, the member for 
Saint-Maurice, is not even trying to quash the rumours when he 
could easily shed some light on this issue simply by tabling 
some documents. This is hurting the riding of Saint-Maurice, the 
riding of Champlain, the whole region and our democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we should act quickly. Members know that people living 
in various ridings do talk to each other. People come to see me 
in my riding office and tell me: “Mr. Gagnon, when will this 
stop? It is starting to really hurt us”. Many of these people 
come from Shawinigan— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Denis Coderre:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
It is not the first time that the hon. member for Champlain has 
gone off track. I think that the bill is very clear. It deals 
with the Canada foundation for sustainable development 
technology. He should stick to that if he wants to keep going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B> This issue is often raised. 
We should perhaps give a lecture on chapter 13 of our procedure 
and practice relating to the relevancy of debate, because the 
same thing has happened several times today. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to bring to the member's attention the relevancy 
issue because it is an issue that normally on Fridays is raised 
very often.  Unless a member brings it to the attention of the 
Chair, the Chair cannot act on its own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many instances the Speaker has indicated that a question 
invokes the rule of relevancy by indicating to a member who has 
been called to order, as the secretary of state has done in this 
instance, the proper subject matter of the debate and how the 
member's remarks were irrelevant. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like us to continue the debate on the issue before the 
House. I do not wish to say that it is the hon. member's fault 
only. During debate, the Chair allows considerable leeway as far 
as the issues debated are concerned. It is not for me to  judge 
the content, but I believe that we must also respect the 
procedures of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Marcel Gagnon:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank you and I thank my hon. 
colleague across the way for having raised the issue of 
relevancy. I thought my remarks were totally relevant, but I do 
want to come back to the bill.

When I speak about the economy in my area, that is part of my

an end.

concerns not the environment but democracy, which is the basis

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I know I do 
not have much time as we have only five minutes left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise once again to speak about the establishment of a 
foundation by this government. The least we can say is that the 
rules governing its establishment will not allow the public to 
know what is going on. Neither will these rules allow the best 
interests that are supposed to be served by this foundation to 
actually be served. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not because there is no environmental problem in Canada. 
This is not because Canada is not having trouble meeting the 
targets it agreed to in Kyoto; on the contrary. The stakes are 
extremely high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the recommendation made to the federal 
government, instead of ensuring that the extremely necessary 
funding be provided in a timely fashion to advance these urgent 
projects to develop technologies to address climate change and 
pollution, the government is embarking on the creation of a 
foundation through a rather bizarre piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially the bill has only one purpose, as stated in clause 5: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>5. The objects and purpose of the Foundation are to provide 
funding to eligible recipients for eligible projects. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Its purpose is to provide funding for eligible projects. 
It would be given an insufficient amount of money for the 
sustainable development that is necessary. However the 
definition of eligible project reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“eligible project“means a project carried on, or to be carried 
on, primarily in Canada by an eligible recipient to develop and 
demonstrate new technologies to promote sustainable development, 
including technologies to address climate change and air quality 
issues. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only guideline to this foundation if this definition of 
eligible project. However, and this is also disturbing, 
with respect to the establishment of the board of directors, 
it is stipulated that there shall be seven members appointed 
by the governor in council, that is by the government, on the 
recommendation of the minister, and these seven members 
shall co-opt members in the other areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we see? We see a great danger that this would be a small 
group of friends whose task would be to fund eligible projects. 
These eligible projects are extremely wide reaching and we do 
not even know if this will go in the direction of the 
commitments—

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>BÉLANGER-CAMPEAU COMMISSION 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK196"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ) </B>moved:<B></B> 
<A NAME="LINK197">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
recognize the conclusion of the Bélanger-Campeau Commission, 
which proposed, in 1991, that the National Assembly of Quebec 
adopt legislation on holding a referendum and the offer of a new 
partnership, and that no federal legislation or regulations 
should be incompatible with achieving this conclusion. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Madam Speaker, I want to say how proud I am to speak 
about the Bélanger-Campeau commission, since it will be 10 years 
on March 27 that the commission tabled its report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before getting to the heart of the matter, however, I wish to 
welcome a friend of mine who is taking a law course with me. 
Twice a week I attend lectures to be able to better understand 
the bills that are brought before us. I know that, 
Madam Speaker, you have a law degree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to welcome one of my colleagues, Clément Bélanger, 
who wants to hear today's debate. I am glad he is here, even 
though I do not always share his views on Canada's future. I am 
very happy to see him here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, as members will recall, the Bélanger-Campeau commission 
was created as a result of the failure of the Meech Lake accord. 
Speaking about that as a Quebecer, it is hard to forget that 
this was the first time in the history of Quebec that a head of 
government, Robert Bourassa, asked for so little in terms of 
collective powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1987 Meech Lake accord, which the provinces had three years 
to ratify, was based on five main conditions. They were the 
minimum we could accept. Asking for less collective powers would 
have reduced us to the status of a municipality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were five main conditions in Meech: that Quebec be 
recognized as a distinct society and that this should be given an 
interpretative value in the preamble of an act; 
that provinces have a veto, especially with regard to  changes 
to federal institutions; 
That Quebec could submit a list of judges who, more faithful to 
the civil law tradition, would be appointed to the supreme court 
on the recommendation of the national assembly; that 
spending power would be limited with regard to new shared cost 
programs; and that Quebec would have its fair share of 
immigration quotas, that is 23% or 24%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we can see, this was much less than what previous premiers 
had asked for. 
Members will remember that the Meech Lake accord was defeated by 
two provinces, namely Newfoundland and Manitoba. Why should we 
remember the Meech Lake accord? Why should we remember 
Bélanger-Campeau commission?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I felt rather happy last night to hear that the premier of 
Quebec wished to bring the various studies up to date. Fifty-five 
experts, of every persuasion, of every leaning, of every 
allegiance, tabled submissions before the Bélanger-Campeau 
commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point one thing out. It is incredible that it has to 
be remembered, 10 years after the Meech Lake accord failed, that 
if Robert Bourassa were alive and still active in public life, 
he could not have held a referendum along the very terms of the 
Bélanger-Campeau commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to remind my hon. colleagues, particularly those from 
English Canada, that the Bélanger-Campeau commission is not a 
trivial fact of our history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the federal government through the federal-provincial 
relations office, run by the Privy Council, refers to the 
Bélanger-Campeau commission in its own documents, it refers to it 
as a constitutional commission, which represents a moment of the 
history of Quebec, the most intense moment of our collective 
history, when we came close to having something similar to a 
constituent assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thirty-six commissioners, 34 of whom are still alive, sat on the 
Bélanger-Campeau commission, and everything that is stirring in 
Quebec, everything that we love in Quebec, everything that 
thinks in Quebec, was represented, including municipalities, 
school boards, political movements, mostly from Quebec, and 
artists. Everything that is stirring in Quebec was represented 
on the Bélanger-Campeau commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its conclusion the Bélanger-Campeau commission reminded us 
that there are two major options for Quebec's future. Let me 
quote in its entirety the main conclusion of the Bélanger-Campeau 
commission: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only two solutions are open to Quebec in redefining its status: 
firstly, making a new, last, attempt to redefine its status 
within the federal system; and, secondly, achieving sovereignty. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ten years after the Bélanger-Campeau commission, after the 
failure of the Meech Lake accord, after the failure of the 
Charlottetown accord and after the referral to the supreme 
court, I am telling the House that the evidence is now there: 
Canadian federalism cannot be renewed to further the legitimate 
aspirations of Quebecers, and the only relevant, valid, 
appropriate and credible conclusion is Quebec's sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of elements support such a statement. I was a member of 
parliament in 1995; many members who are here now were not back 
then, but I was. The Prime Minister had a motion passed to 
recognize the distinct character of Quebec, a motion in which he 
even gave Quebec a veto. What happened since 1995? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whenever it was time to recognize Quebec as a nation, this 
government always rejected what was passed in this House and 
what was asked by the Bélanger-Campeau commission. What is the 
point of adopting a motion saying that Quebec is a distinct 
society if we cannot even be recognized for who we are? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give some examples. The review of the bill on immigration 
and citizenship was a complex issue, since francophones account 
for only 2% of immigrants in North America. 
Quebec has a citizenship policy. Whether we like it or not, from 
the moment people can take part in democratic institutions, 
citizenship becomes a reality.

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>During debates in committee and in this House, when we reviewed 
the issue of citizenship and immigration, we tabled an amendment 
requesting that Quebec hold its own citizenship ceremony because 
we all know the value of symbols. During the ceremony we would 
have given new immigrants choosing Quebec a copy of our charter 
of the French language, our Quebec charter of human rights and 
freedoms and our elections act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How did the government reply to that motion? It spurned it. 
Through this lack of support for our request, once again, the 
government was showing that it does not seriously intend to 
recognize us as a nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does Bill C-20 mean?  Bill C-20 where the great democratic 
forces in Quebec isolated the government and reminded the 
government that it cannot legitimately expect to write the 
referendum question in lieu of the national assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind members that if Robert Bourassa had wanted to hold a 
referendum on the Bélanger-Campeau commission's report, under 
Bill C-20, and more specifically clause 4, he would not have had 
the freedom to do so. I dare any member of parliament to prove 
to me that it would be possible to ask a two part referendum 
question under clause 4 of Bill C-20. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Worse yet, since the early 1990s we have seen an 
unprecedented attempt to deny Quebec's identity and reinforce 
the Canadian identity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House might recall that in 1995, the year of the 
referendum, the government did one of the most anti-democratic 
things that can be done politically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see that the Secretary of State for Amateur Sport is being 
very offhand about this.  I ask him to remember that in 1995, 
the same year in which was held the referendum under the 
referendum act, René Lévesque's greatest legacy, this government 
did not even have the decency to respect the legislation in 
question.  During the referendum campaign it spent five times 
more than the authorized ceiling in Quebec.  Is that how it 
views democracy?  It spent five times more than was allowed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Worse yet, it used citizenship courts to promote its political 
option and to hand out vast numbers of citizenship certificates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe in immigration because Quebec is condemned to be a 
land of immigration.  When we look at which countries take in 
the most immigrants, Quebec is in fifth place.  It is right 
after Australia, the United States and New Zealand.  Quebecers' 
generosity and openness is well known. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can there be any justification for a government not only failing 
to comply with the referendum act but also using citizenship 
courts to issue 43,000 citizenship certificates, 11,000 of them 
in one month?  If that had been a lasting trend, we would have 
noticed it in 1996, 1997, and 1998.  In 1996 citizenship 
certificate quotas dropped by 70%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what is unacceptable in a democratic system.  Instead of 
maintaining the separation of powers between the legislative, 
executive and judicial arms, instead of maintaining the 
historical perspective required in discussions of such matters, 
this government has breached one of the most time honoured 
principles of our democracy. It has used the judiciary to 
promote its political option.  This is not acceptable.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec there are three issues on which everyone agrees, 
regardless of their political affiliations. Claude Ryan could 
call on the spirit of such a collective opinion and the 
Bélanger-Campeau commission has embodied them. What are these 
issues? Quebec is a nation, and all nations have the right to 
choose their destiny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These last few years the federal government has put in place a 
formidable propaganda machine. Every year since 1996 the 
federal government has spent, on average, $100 million a year on 
initiatives promoting federalism, $100 million of which a part 
surely comes from taxes paid by Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intergovernmental affairs minister said yesterday, with his 
usual outraged tone, that the government is not legitimate. The 
government of Quebec, led by Robert Bourassa, held the first 
constituent assembly of our history, at which all the political 
forces were represented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A certain amount of studies were made.  It is the duty of the 
government to update those studies because we will not accept to 
be treated like a simple province because Quebec is not like 
Prince Edward Island. It is not like Saskatchewan.  It is not 
like Alberta.  With all the respect I have for their 
distinctiveness, but they are not like Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see that my time has expired, but with the unanimous consent 
of the House I could complete my speech in five minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B> The member will still have 
five minutes at the end because it is his motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, is there unanimous consent of the House to allow the 
member to continue with his speech? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> No. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK198"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I have 
listened attentively to the hon. member and I want to say that I 
am quite pleased to be participating in the debate on Motion No. 
220 which has been tabled by the hon. member for 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve and which reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
recognize the conclusion of the Bélanger-Campeau Commission, 
which proposed, in 1991, that the National Assembly of Quebec 
adopt legislation on holding a referendum and the offer of a new 
partnership, and that no federal legislation or regulations 
should be incompatible with achieving this conclusion. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion at least has the merit of providing us with the 
opportunity to rectify certain facts and to set the record 
straight in this debate on Quebec secession.  The motion is 
clearly designed to challenge the legitimacy of Bill C-20, which 
was passed last year by Canada's parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is therefore necessary to respond to the motion by turning 
again to the main arguments that were advanced in support of the 
clarity act.  I would first like to address the portion of the 
hon. member's motion that reads as follows:  “that no federal 
legislation or regulations should be incompatible with achieving 
this conclusion”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find the hon. member's wording of the motion extremely 
one-sided.  It seems to imply for all practical purposes, and in 
a manner that is simplistic to say the least, that the current 
Government of Canada is trying to prevent the government of 
Quebec from holding an umpteenth referendum on Quebec secession, 
an option that it is attempting above all to camouflage through 
vague hints of an alleged will for association. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many times will it have to be reiterated that the current 
Government of Canada is in no way seeking to prevent the national 
assembly from consulting Quebecers on any matter whatsoever? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be noted that a recent poll has confirmed that only a 
minuscule proportion, less than 10%, of Quebecers want such a 
referendum to be held during the current mandate, while 49% say 
they never want one to be held, and 76% of respondents, 
regardless of option preferred, want Quebec to remain in Canada. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1350"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would urge the hon. member to use his inside contacts with the 
current government of Quebec and to remind Mr. Landry of these 
facts, since to date he still does not seem to get the message. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless of these considerations, I can only remind the hon. 
member, who certainly cannot not have forgotten, that Bill C-20, 
passed last year by Canada's parliament, in no way sought to 
prevent Quebecers from deciding on their political future.  As 
respected a personality as Mr. Claude Castonguay emphasized this 
point eloquently before the legislative committee studying Bill 
C-20 when he said about the bill: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not see anything in this bill that limits the jurisdiction 
of the Quebec National Assembly nor the right of Quebecers to 
decide their future. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, Bill C-20 in no way prevents the national assembly from 
wording the referendum question as it sees fit.  A future 
referendum would have to be held in full compliance with 
provincial laws.  The clarity act merely specifies that the 
federal government will not enter into negotiations unless a 
clear majority of Quebecers vote in favour of secession in 
response to a question as passed by the national assembly and do 
determine, through a resolution, whether the question is clear. 
It is very important that the question be clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask hon. members to remember that Bill C-20 was our response 
to the opinion of the supreme court in the Quebec secession 
reference which was issued in the summer of 1998.  Like that 
opinion of the court, it emphasizes the need to ask a clear 
question—I emphasize again, a clear question—and to obtain an 
equally clear majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that some members opposite do not particularly like 
the words clear question and clear majority.  They find something 
radically wrong with a clear question and a clear majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Paragraph 87 of the opinion specified states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The democratic principle—would demand that considerable weight 
be given to a clear expression by the people of Quebec of their 
will to secede from Canada, even though a referendum, in itself 
and without more, has no direct legal effect, and could not in 
itself bring about unilateral secession. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further on in paragraphs 92 and 151 it states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The continued existence and operation of the Canadian 
constitutional order could not be indifferent to a clear 
expression of a clear majority of Quebecers that they no longer 
wish to remain in Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opinion referred to a clear question on numerous occasions 
and the supreme court used the expression clear majority 13 
times.  Why put so much emphasis on clarity?  The answer is 
obvious:  the consequences of secession are so grave that it must 
be clear that the province's population does in fact want to 
cease to be a part of Canada.  Let me say as well that of course 
secession has very grave consequences for other provinces and 
other people of Canada as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A question that refers to the possibility of a political or 
economic association is not clear, because if the response is 
favourable, how can it be known whether it applies to 
independence, to a new partnership or to a form of independence 
providing for some type of association? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A clear answer to a clear question:  who can be opposed to this 
principle other than those who, not once but twice, have 
presented Quebecers with vague, misleading options, with the sole 
objective, as Mr. Parizeau boasted himself, of getting the 
lobsters into the pot?  Mr. Parizeau boasted publicly that all 
they wanted to do was get the lobsters into the pot.  We all know 
what happens to lobsters when we get them into the pot.  They get 
cooked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can well imagine the objections the Bloc raises in this 
connection, just as I am hearing now from an hon. member 
opposite.  The Bloc maintains that the questions asked during the 
1980 and 1995 referenda were clear.  On the contrary, they were 
nothing of the kind, because they referred to such vague, 
nebulous concepts as association and partnership which, as I just 
pointed out, tend to cloud and skew the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To demonstrate the confusion generated by the question asked on 
the last referendum, I want to refer to the statement made by 
Professor Maurice Pinard before the parliamentary committee 
studying Bill C-20. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1355"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Professor Pinard's own words: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995, only about 50% of respondents realized that sovereignty 
did not necessarily mean partnership.  The others believed 
that sovereignty would not be declared if partnership could not 
be achieved. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can it be contested, in light of such figures, that the 
referendum question put to Quebecers in 1995 was ambiguous when 
its true significance escaped half the voters? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B> I would remind members that 
all questions and comments must be put to other members though 
the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also ask members on both sides to be careful in their 
choice of words. We must show respect. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Matthews:</B>  Madam Speaker, it seems that my 
remarks are striking a chord or a nerve with some members 
opposite.  I do not know why that is.  I guess it goes back to 
the point I just made that the referendum question put to 
Quebecers in 1995 was ambiguous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The significance escaped half the voters.  How can the 
government be reproached for requiring that in future such debate 
be held in a context of pure clarity?  Is that too much to ask? 
No one on this side of the House thinks it is.  We want clarity. 
We want a clear question and we want a clear majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I want to make one further criticism of the 
motion.  It attempts to paint a false picture of what the 
Bélanger-Campeau Commission really proposed.  One of the 
scenarios in the commission's recommendations was that a 
referendum on Quebec sovereignty should be held.  One would have 
to conclude that this proposal runs counter to what is being 
touted these days by the leader of the Parti Quebecois, who talks 
about some form of confederative association without defining 
what it actually means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bélanger-Campeau Commission also envisioned the possibility 
of an offer, originating from the Government of Canada, of a new 
constitutional partnership.  Under such a scenario, Quebec could 
and would stay within Canada.  That is the true nature of the 
partnership the Bélanger-Campeau Commission was talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Needless to say, it in no way corresponds to the meaning the 
hon. member opposite wants to convey through his motion, which is 
every bit as vague and misleading as the question put to 
Quebecers in 1980 and 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebecers already have an effective partnership, one that works 
very well.  That partnership has a name, and that name is Canada. 
Quebecers want to keep it that way and they are absolutely 
right.  The Government of Canada, and I cannot reiterate this 
strongly enough, does not want to prevent Quebecers from making 
their choice.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Reid (Lanark—Carleton, Canadian Alliance):</B> Madam 
Speaker, first, I would like to say a few words about the 
Clarity Act. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question of the clear majority was mentioned by the hon. 
parliamentary secretary.  That provision of the law, it deserves 
to be said here, is very unclear.  It is important to point that 
out because the law is often presented as a model of clarity. 
However that part of the law does not specify what a clear 
majority would be.  It only says that we would hold hearings 
after a referendum has occurred and after 50% has been achieved 
in deciding whether a majority has been clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was a private citizen about this time last year, I came 
as an expert witness before the committee looking at Bill C-20. I 
made this observation and suggested that provision of the law be 
changed.  I regret that my advice was not taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest, however, that what the government has done is given 
more credibility to the 50% plus one model while taking away from 
that sense of validity.  The government has, therefore, in 
passing this law, perhaps achieved the opposite of its objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will also read the motion we are debating today, because I 
want to make a point with regard to it: 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1400"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT48"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT48"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1400

<A HREF="#LINKT47"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
recognize the conclusion of the Bélanger-Campeau Commission, 
which proposed, in 1991, that the National Assembly of Quebec 
adopt legislation on holding a referendum and the offer of a new 
partnership, and that no federal legislation or regulations 
should be incompatible with achieving this conclusion. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not quite historically accurate.  The last part of the 
motion which follows the last comma does not accurately reflect 
what was said by the Bélanger-Campeau commission in its report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bélanger-Campeau commission made four pages of 
recommendations.  The four pages were primarily in the form of a 
proposed law to be put before the National Assembly of Quebec. 
Part of the proposed law, which was adopted by the national 
assembly, called for the establishment of a parliamentary 
commission of the national assembly for the review of an offer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can find nothing in the recommendations that suggests no 
federal law or regulation ought to be adopted contrary to those 
recommendations or contrary to the offer to be made.  We ought to 
be clear that we are not debating an historically accurate motion 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. parliamentary secretary had a good point when he said 
that the real function of the motion was to suggest that the 
clarity act was illegitimate.  It is an awkward way of 
approaching it.  If I were to regard it as illegitimate, I would 
attack some of the contents of the act, such as the part to which 
I just made reference.  I find other parts of the act to be quite 
valuable, particularly the requirement that a clear question be 
asked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The subtext of the motion makes reference to or hints at a 
proposal put forward by Jean-François Lisée in his book <I>Sortie 
de Secours</I>.  He proposed to put forward one part of the 
supreme court's decision in its reference, Renvoi relatif à la 
sécession du Québec, and I will read the section: 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A clear majority vote in Quebec on a clear question in favour of 
secession would confer democratic legitimacy on the secession 
initiative which all of the other participants in Confederation 
would have to recognize. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has been read by Mr. Lisée as meaning that not only could a 
proposal on secession put forward and voted upon by the people of 
Quebec be taken to the Government of Canada as grounds for 
mandatory good faith negotiations, but so too could a proposal 
for some form of new partnership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an interesting reading of the court's reference and not 
one the court intended.  The court is always happy to make 
readings of the constitution that bear no resemblance to the 
meaning put there by the original writers of the constitution, so 
perhaps fair is fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems Mr. Lisée's intention is to have a referendum question 
on a new partnership put before the people of Quebec, one that 
would seem reasonable to the people of Quebec but would be worded 
in such a way that it would not appear reasonable to people in 
the rest of the country.  It would create some form of 
negotiations that would be impossible to resolve, much like the 
negotiations that took place during the Meech-Charlottetown 
period in our history.  This would cause the kind of crisis that 
the Parti Quebecois government is having so much trouble 
generating on its own, no matter how many comments about red rags 
are made by the premier of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must be aware that the subtext is in the motion.  If it were 
a votable motion, we would have good grounds to vote against it 
and to reject its proposals.  I also want to make reference to 
the fact that there is something legitimate in what is being 
said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will turn to another group that is proposing changes to the 
Canadian constitution. 
I am referring to the group led by Stephen Harper, Ken 
Boessenkool, Tom Flanagan and others known as the Alberta 6.  In 
its open letter to Ralph Klein about two months ago, it proposed 
that Alberta: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Use Section 88 of the Supreme Court's decision on the Quebec 
Secession Reference to force Senate reform back on the national 
agenda.  Our reading of that decision is that the federal 
government and other provinces must seriously consider our 
proposal for constitutional reform endorsed by “a clear majority 
on a clear question” in a provincial referendum. 
</UL>
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1405"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT48"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Referring directly to the premier, the group said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>You acted decisively once before to hold a senatorial election. 
Now is time to drive the issue further. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is saying that provinces need to have some sort of means to 
force on to the national agenda issues which are currently only 
on the provincial agenda but which are legitimate.  That is a 
legitimate point they are making. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That point would be equally legitimate in the case of the 
concerns of Quebecers.  Their concerns are unable to make it on 
to the national agenda, largely because they get tangled up in 
the whole question of separation versus remaining in Canada, and 
the partisan divide that exists in Quebec, as it does everywhere, 
because of our highly partisan political structure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Referendums do break through that.  We saw that demonstrated 
brilliantly when we in fact had a crisis in the country.  It 
looked as if the crisis would drive the country apart.  A 
referendum was held nationwide in October 1992, largely because 
of the Bélanger-Campeau commission recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians realized that it was a great deal more complex than 
they had thought it was.  The issue was not simply a matter of 
those rotten separatists, those rotten people in Ottawa or in the 
rest of the country who would not listen to us and give 
legitimacy to our positions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We realized that the constitutional proposals offered were in a 
vast unworkable package deal.  A majority of Quebecers voted 
against those proposals, as did a majority of people in a number 
of the other provinces.  The issue itself faded away and the 
unity crisis that could have broken up the country also passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my own reading of that time.  I was an active participant 
on the no side in that referendum.  We were in greater danger as 
a country in 1992 than we were three years later in 1995 when the 
provincial referendum in Quebec was held. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I am a supporter of direct democracy, I am probably the 
strongest supporter of direct democracy in the House, with the 
possible exception of my hon. colleague from Vancouver Island 
North.  Nevertheless, I have some reservations about this sort of 
back door method of introducing the concept of direct democracy, 
and of putting regional concerns through a referendum on to the 
national stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest reasons for this kind of reservation by way of 
reference to one of the great constitutional thinkers in the 
British parliamentary tradition.  I am referring to Albert Venn 
Dicey who wrote the brilliant work <I>Law of the Constitution</I> 
in the 1880s.  It was then updated until his death in 1915. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about the role of referendum and plebiscite in the 
British parliamentary system and whether it was compatible with 
the system.  He suggested that the plebiscite, as practised in 
France, was incompatible with it.  This is the kind of referendum 
we are talking about here.  What he meant by plebiscite was: 
initiated by government usually on some vague proposal as opposed 
to specific legislation such as an order to negotiate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By contrast, he suggested the Swiss model of citizen initiated 
referendum on a specific legislative means.  That would be the 
most productive way of achieving the kind of goals that might 
unite us all, including my hon. colleague who suggested the 
motion. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>]

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, it is a great 
pleasure to speak to the motion brought forward by my brilliant 
colleague from Hochelaga—Maisonneuve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has defended, with all the passion he is known for 
and all his ability, recognized by all I am sure, the need to 
acknowledge that Bill C-20 would have prevented Robert Bourassa 
from holding the referendum he wanted to hold right after the 
passage in Quebec of the act calling for a referendum in the 
fall of 1992.

<A HREF="#LINKT49"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This point has to be made. It is very enlightening. The members 
feel reassured when they hear the government's propaganda, when 
they hear the government saying again and again that there are 
no more problems in Quebec, that Quebecers do not want a 
referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few months before the 1995 referendum, however, Quebecers did 
not want a referendum. Yet they still went to vote, 94% of them, 
and we all know what the results almost were. Canada had to 
resort to those things that my colleague talked about to ensure 
that the referendum would not pass. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out that all this is not a whim. 
I will not go as far back as 1760, but in passing I would like 
to remind members that, when Lord Durham arrived here in 1838, 
he made this now famous statement “I found two nations warring 
in the bosom of a single state”. It would appear nothing has 
changed since then. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What Durham had understood and what we are still struggling 
with, is that French Canadians had to be put in a minority 
situation before the colonies could have responsible government. 
Once they were in a minority situation, responsible government 
could be granted. That is in fact what happened. Durham wanted 
to go further; he wanted assimilation. He said it was for “the 
good of the French Canadians who would for ever be carriers of 
water”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, Quebecers were reduced to a minority. 
For a long time, Quebecers expressed their nationalism in 
various ways, including wanting Canada to sever its ties with 
England, while the good English Canadians were very attached, 
and many still are, to mother England. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the sixties, following the independence of the former 
colonies in Africa, Asia, and the liberation of Cuba and South 
America, a more radical nationalist movement emerged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Daniel Johnson whose father, an Irishman by birth and, 
a contributor to Sinn Fein, did not speak French, ran 
for his party saying “My platform is equality or independence”. 
This was in 1965. His own father did not speak French; he was 
Irish. 
Because of this, perhaps he had a better understanding of the 
fact that the situation of French Canadians deserved, if they 
could not achieve equality, that there be a national movement 
for independence. This was Daniel Johnson in 1965. I urge 
members to read his book again. It is excellent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The movement that became the Parti Quebecois grew progressively: 
in 1966, 8% of the votes went to the indépendantistes; in 1970, 
it was 23%; in 1997, 30% and in 1976, 41%. For the 1980 
referendum, Mr. Lévesque, who had really wanted this country, a 
country associated with Canada, had to leave, not without having 
entered into negotiations with Mr. Mulroney, who had just been 
elected. Why? To regain the powers Quebec had lost with the 
unilateral patriation of the constitution by Trudeau.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>René Lévesque had to leave. Pierre-Marc Johnson was premier for a 
short time. Who took up the torch to try at least to regain the 
powers lost because of Trudeau? It was a good federalist, Robert 
Bourassa. It was Robert Bourassa who led this negotiation. 
It was Robert Bourassa who was premier when the Meech Lake 
accord failed in June 1990. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has happened since? We had the Charlottetown accord, which 
was far from being clear. The Charlottetown accord did not solve 
anything. In 1995 there was a referendum and the outcome could 
not have been closer. One might think that everything is solved. 
Come on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something incomprehensible in the blindness shown by 
the House of Commons and by the political class in Canada. There 
is something absolutely incredible. As I said, this is 
incomprehensible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we go abroad, what seems the most incomprehensible is the 
fact that, on Canada's side, nothing serious was done 
afterwards. Nothing serious was done in this House. There was a 
minor motion that, somewhere, contained the word people, and 
another motion that gave an extra veto to British Columbia, 
which would make it even harder for Quebec to use its veto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What my young and brilliant colleague wants to bring back in 
this House is at least a first hour of debate on that 
substantive issue, because Quebec will never leave on the ocean. 
We will always remain neighbours with Ontario and the maritimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-20 did not settle anything. Do not be lulled by it. 
It does not settle anything because the desire for sovereignty, 
where attempts were made elsewhere to crush it, has grown 
stronger. It seems to me that this parliament should 
recognize—and this is what my colleague's motion is asking 
for—that this desire must be allowed to be expressed unimpeded. 
But Bill C-20 is an impediment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, impediments never stopped this desire from being 
expressed. My point is that parliament ought to realize that 
this desire, this will be expressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sovereignist movement in Quebec has been exemplary, 
exemplary in terms of democracy. We should be regularly thanked 
for that. We owe much of it to René Lévesque who, at the time of 
the FLQ crisis, it must be remembered, said that as long as the 
battle could be won democratically, violence was unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>René Lévesque remained steadfast. Finally, the movement 
disappeared. In fact, when all the police forces investigating 
the FLQ pulled out, we realized that it no longer existed. But 
that is another story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What my colleague is pointing out, and I want to point out also, 
is that Bill C-20 is designed to prevent the people from 
expressing its desire to be both sovereign and associated with 
Canada. I cannot see how an illegitimate law will prevent that 
from happening.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Through you, Madam 
Speaker, I want to thank all those who have taken part in this 
debate as well as the students who have listened to it. I do not 
know the name of their school but I am impressed with the fact 
that they are here on a Friday afternoon and I thank them for 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have to remind ourselves this afternoon is that Quebec 
is in itself a nation which aspires to a different future than 
Saskatchewan, British Columbia or Prince Edward Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am grateful to the member for Mercier, whose well-known 
knowledge of history has touched the member for Hull—Aylmer, 
for reminding us that the sovereignist movement is based first 
and foremost on a very strong attachment to democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This attachment is so strong that three of the main leaders of 
the movement have created political parties to ensure that their 
option would be systematically submitted to an assessment and 
acceptance by the electorate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ever since the Bélanger-Campeau commission, it has been clear 
that one cannot be both a Canadian and a Quebecer.  Why is it 
impossible?  I must say that this has nothing to do with 
individual friendships because, on a personal level, I have 
nothing but friends here in the House. 
It is just simply impossible to live within a system of 
government where all the provinces are considered equal in fact 
and in law and, at the same time, to think that Quebec will be 
recognized as a nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot live under a government which unilaterally patriated 
the Constitution, which forced upon us the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms, the charter that invalidated complete 
sections of our own Charter of the French Language, Bill 101, 
which is the main vehicle for securing public participation in 
our collective culture through the French language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes, incompatibility runs very deep, and Quebecers will 
have to realize that.  It is far from insignificant that, ever 
since its creation by the former government, under Kim Campbell 
at the beginning of the 1990s, the Department of Canadian 
Heritage has constantly sought to strengthen the Canadian 
identity. 
In the 1990s, the Department of Canadian Heritage commissioned 
three comprehensive studies that proved that we do not have in 
Canada any national symbol that strikes a chord with all 
Canadians from sea to sea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Multiculturalism must be a partial explanation.  We think 
that in our society all cultures should not be put on the same 
footing and that Quebec will keep its distinctive 
character. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the coming years Quebecers will have to make their choices, 
with these issues and identity factors in mind. I am grateful 
that the premier of Quebec has reminded us that Quebec is a 
different province and that it constitutes a nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government can use all its propaganda machine to sweep the 
national issue under the carpet. 
However, this issue will periodically re-emerge for as long as 
Quebec will not democratically choose to become independent. 
When we will have chosen to become independent, we will be able 
to speak to each other as equal partners, nation to nation, each 
controlling its own political space. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the idea of partnership was always at the heart of 
the sovereignist project, from René Lévesque and Jacques 
Parizeau to Lucien Bouchard and now, of course, Bernard Landry. 
We do want to maintain our economic ties with our Canadian 
partner, but we want to do it within a political frame that will 
recognize what we are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the Bélanger-Campeau commission reminded us of. The 
commission said: “There are two options”. 
The first was to give Canada still another chance. Only 
Quebecers could believe federalism could still be reformed, even 
after the failure of the Meech Lake accord, even after our most 
basic demands were rejected, even after the Meech Lake accord 
was rejected.
